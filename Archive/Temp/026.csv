Epub 2019 Nov 19.,"BACKGROUND: MLL2 (mixed-lineage leukemia 2) is recognized as an essential role in regulating histone 3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) in mammalian cells. It is frequently mutated to promote developmental diseases and tumor initiation. However, the expression pattern of MLL2 and its clinical significance for patients with early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain totally unknown. METHODS: Eighty-five samples of primary early-stage OSCC were enrolled in this retrospective study, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect the spatial pattern of MLL2. The diagnostic and prognostic value of MLL2 were assessed. RESULTS: MLL2 was widely expressed in tumor cells (TCs), fibroblast-like cells (FLCs), and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), both in tumor center and invasive tumor front, and showed no distributive heterogeneity. Moreover, regardless of cell types and microlocalization, patients with high expressed MLL2 had increased depth invasion of tumor (DOI). Besides, upregulation of MLL2(TC) and MLL2(TIL) in tumor center were both associated with poor differentiation, but showed no correlation with tumor growth with comparable Ki-67 levels. Prognostic analysis indicated that early-stage OSCC patients with enhanced MLL2(TIL) in invasive tumor front were susceptible to occur postoperative metastasis and recurrence. Indeed, patients with higher expressed MLL2(TIL) showed shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and MLL2(TIL) in invasive tumor front was an independent risk factor of DFS. CONCLUSION: TIL-derived MLL2 in invasive tumor front was an independent prognostic factor of DFS for early-stage OSCC patients.",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We evaluated the effect of central venous catheter management on cancer patients with gram-negative bloodstream infections. Method: We retrospectively identified patients older than 14 years with central venous catheters who were diagnosed with gram-negative bloodstream infections to determine the effect of catheter management on outcome. Patients were divided into 3 groups: Group 1 included patients with central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) without mucosal barrier injury and those whose infection met the criteria for catheter-related bloodstream infection; group 2 included patients with CLABSI with mucosal barrier injury who did not meet the criteria for catheter-related bloodstream infection; and group 3 included patients with non-CLABSI. Results: The study included 300 patients, with 100 patients in each group. Only in group 1 was central venous catheter removal within 2 days of bloodstream infection significantly associated with a higher rate of microbiologic resolution at 4 days compared to delayed central venous catheter removal (3-5 days) or retention (98% vs 82%, P = .006) and a lower overall mortality rate at 3-month follow-up (3% vs 19%, P = .01). Both associations persisted in multivariate analyses (P = .018 and P = .016, respectively). Conclusions: Central venous catheter removal within 2 days of the onset of gram-negative bloodstream infections significantly improved the infectious outcome and overall mortality of adult cancer patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections and CLABSI without mucosal barrier injury.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

IDH mutation produces a neomorphic enzyme, which can lead to the abnormal accumulation of R-2-HG and promotes leukemogenesis. IDH mutation occurs in 20% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, mainly including IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140, and IDH2 R172. Different mutant isoforms have different prognostic values. In recent years, IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients. Hence, enasidenib and ivosidenib, the IDH2 and IDH1 inhibitors developed by Agios Pharmaceuticals, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 1 August 2017 and 20 July 2018 for the treatment of adult relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively. IDH inhibitor monotherapy for R/R AML is efficacious and safe; however, there are problems, such as primary or acquired resistance. Clinical trials of IDH inhibitors combined with hypomethylating agents or standard chemotherapy for the treatment of R/R AML or newly diagnosed AML, as well as in post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as maintenance therapy, are ongoing.

STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: King Edward Medical University, Lahore, from March 2015 to April 2017. METHODOLOGY: Patients of both genders and all age groups with Philadelphia chromosome/BCR-ABL positivity were included in the study. Detailed medical history and examination findings were recorded. Sample for CBC was taken in EDTA and run on automated haematology analyser. Bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy was done from posterior iliac crest. Bone marrow aspirate slides were stained with Giemsa stain. The trephine biopsy was processed and stained with haematoxilyn and eosin. Silver (reticulin) and trichrome staining was done on trephine biopsy to assess the degree of fibrosis. Grading of fibrosis was done according to WHO revised classification 2016. RESULTS: Among the 82 cases, 65% (n=53) were having WHO Grade MF 1 myelofibrosis, 27% (n=22) WHO Grade MF 2 myelofibrosis; whereas, 08% (n=07) WHO Grade MF 3 myelofibrosis. CBC counts were analysed to see any association between anemia, thrombocytocytosis and leucocytosis with advanced fibrosis (p=0.148, 0.413 and 0.174, respectively). CONCLUSION: Some degree of bone marrow fibrosis was present in all patients of chronic myeloid leukemia, while advance fibrosis (WHO Grade MF 2 and 3) is also common. Peripheral blood counts are not predictor of increased fibrosis. Therefore, bone marrow biopsy with special staining should be done in all cases of chronic phase of CML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As short-term MTX aggravates mucositis and delays engraftment, we reduced the dose of MTX, as previously reported in the non-CBT setting. Here, we retrospectively analyze outcomes of 20 patients who received CBT from April 2017 to December 2018. All patients received TAC with mini-MTX as GVHD prophylaxis. Mini-MTX was administered at a dose of 5 mg/m(2) of MTX on days 1, 3 and 6 after CBT. Median age was 54.5 years. Median follow-up time in surviving patients was 396 days. The primary disease was acute leukemia (n = 12) or malignant lymphoma (n = 8). Three patients and 17 patients received myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning, respectively. Rate and median time to engraftment of neutrophils were 90.0% and 20.5 days, respectively. Cumulative incidences of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD were 35.0% and 5.0%, respectively.

Epub 2019 Oct 28.,"The adequate nutritional status of pediatric cancer patients is particularly important to enable them to cope with the demands of the disease and its treatment and to maintain normal growth. Malnutrition and obesity have both been associated with reduced survival and increased drug toxicity. We investigated trends in the age- and sex-adjusted body mass index (ISO-BMI) and the prevalence of malnutrition in a Finnish cohort of 139 consecutive children receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with a follow-up period of 42 months after diagnosis. In total, 28% (39/139) of the patients experienced malnutrition (ISO-BMI < 17 or > 10% weight loss), and 12% (16/139) had a nasogastric tube or underwent gastrostomy. Patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemia (5/10), central nervous system (CNS) tumors (5/13), or solid tumors (13/31) most frequently suffered from malnutrition. There was a significant increase in the ISO-BMI of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (+ 2.1 kg/m(2)) and lymphomas (+ 2.4 kg/m(2)) during the first 6 months, and the ISO-BMI of patients with ALL remained higher at 42 months compared to baseline (+ 1.9 kg/m(2)).Conclusion: The cumulative incidence of malnutrition in Finnish pediatric cancer patients is comparable to that reported in other populations. The nutritional status of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, CNS tumors, or solid tumors should be monitored with extra care to facilitate early intervention in the case of impending malnutrition.What is known:* Both malnutrition and obesity are associated with reduced survival and increased drug toxicity in pediatric cancer patients.What is new:* Overall, 28 % of Finnish children receiving chemotherapy for cancer suffer from malnutrition during the first 42 months following the initial cancer diagnosis. * ISO-BMI curves from initial diagnosis to 42 months after diagnosis are provided for patients with different types of cancer.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Body mass index', 'Cancer', 'Chemotherapy', 'Child', 'ISO-BMI', 'Malnutrition']",PMC6942564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 28.,"Development and differentiation are associated with profound changes to histone modifications, yet their in vivo function remains incompletely understood. Here, we generated mouse models expressing inducible histone H3 lysine-to-methionine (K-to-M) mutants, which globally inhibit methylation at specific sites. Mice expressing H3K36M developed severe anaemia with arrested erythropoiesis, a marked haematopoietic stem cell defect, and rapid lethality. By contrast, mice expressing H3K9M survived up to a year and showed expansion of multipotent progenitors, aberrant lymphopoiesis and thrombocytosis. Additionally, some H3K9M mice succumbed to aggressive T cell leukaemia/lymphoma, while H3K36M mice exhibited differentiation defects in testis and intestine. Mechanistically, induction of either mutant reduced corresponding histone trimethylation patterns genome-wide and altered chromatin accessibility as well as gene expression landscapes. Strikingly, discontinuation of transgene expression largely restored differentiation programmes. Our work shows that individual chromatin modifications are required at several specific stages of differentiation and introduces powerful tools to interrogate their roles in vivo.",,['R01 HD058013/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC6858577,,['NIHMS1539810'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secreted factors, intercellular transfer of mitochondria and the receptor-ligand interactions have been shown as mediators of this protection. Here we report that tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-long, thin membranous structures, which have been identified as a novel mode of intercellular cross-talk-are formed in the presence of stroma and mediate transfer of cellular vesicles from stroma to leukemic cells. Importantly, transmission of vesicles via TNTs from stromal cells increases resistance of leukemic cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Using correlative light-electron microscopy and electron tomography we show that stromal TNTs contain vesicles, provide membrane continuity with the cell bodies and can be open-ended. Moreover, trans-SILAC studies to reveal the non-autonomous proteome showed that specific sets of proteins are transferred together with cellular vesicles from stromal to leukemic cells, with a potential role in survival and adaptation. Altogether, our findings provide evidence for the biological role of the TNT-mediated vesicle exchange between stromal and leukemic cells, implicating the direct vesicle and protein transfer in the stroma-provided protection of leukemic cells.",,,,,PMC6817823,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 28.,"Tumor cells adapt to nutrient-limited environments by inducing gene expression that ensures adequate nutrients to sustain metabolic demands. For example, during amino acid limitations, ATF4 in the amino acid response induces expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), which provides for asparagine biosynthesis. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are sensitive to asparagine depletion, and administration of the asparagine depletion enzyme l-asparaginase is an important therapy option. ASNS expression can counterbalance l-asparaginase treatment by mitigating nutrient stress. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms regulating ASNS expression is important to define the adaptive processes underlying tumor progression and treatment. Here we show that DNA hypermethylation at the ASNS promoter prevents its transcriptional expression following asparagine depletion. Insufficient expression of ASNS leads to asparagine deficiency, which facilitates ATF4-independent induction of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), which triggers apoptosis. We conclude that chromatin accessibility is critical for ATF4 activity at the ASNS promoter, which can switch ALL cells from an ATF4-dependent adaptive response to ATF4-independent apoptosis during asparagine depletion. This work may also help explain why ALL cells are most sensitive to l-asparaginase treatment compared with other cancers.",['(c) 2019 Jiang et al.'],"['R01 GM049164/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA244625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA215059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 CA215059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ATF4', '*CHOP', '*DNA methylation', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*amino acid', '*asparagine synthetase', '*cell metabolism', '*chromatin modification', '*stress response', '*tumor metabolism']",PMC6901317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed untargeted serum metabolomic profiling for 44 AML patients receiving treatment based on ATRA and valproic acid combined with low-dose cytotoxic drugs (cytarabine, hydroxyurea, 6-mercaptopurin) which identified 886 metabolites. When comparing pretreatment samples from responders and non-responders, metabolites mainly belonging to amino acid and lipid (i.e., fatty acid) pathways were altered. Furthermore, patients with rapidly progressive disease showed an extensively altered lipid metabolism. Both ATRA and valproic acid monotherapy also altered the amino acid and lipid metabolite profiles; however, these changes were only highly significant for valproic acid treatment. Twenty-three metabolites were significantly altered by seven-day valproic acid treatment (p < 0.05, q < 0.05), where the majority of altered metabolites belonged to lipid (especially fatty acid metabolism) and amino acid pathways, including several carnitines.

CD19 is a marker on the surface of normal B cells as well as most B-cell malignancies, and thus has a role as an effective target for CAR T-cell therapy. In numerous clinical data, successes with cell therapy have provided anticancer therapy as a potential therapeutic option for patients who are resistant to standard chemotherapies. However, recent growing evidence showed the limitations of the treatment such as antigen-positive relapse due to poor CAR T-cell persistence and antigen-negative relapses associated with CAR-driven mutations, alternative splicing, epitope masking, low antigen density, and lineage switching. The understanding of the resistance mechanisms to the cell therapy has developed novel potential treatment strategies, including dual-targeting therapy (dual and tandem CAR), and armored and universal CAR T-cell therapies. In this review, we provide an overview of resistance mechanisms to CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in B-cell malignancies and also review therapeutic strategies to overcome these resistances.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell hematologic malignancies', 'CAR T-cell', 'drug resistance']",PMC6834308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a case-control design, we aimed to explore whether maternal diabetes is associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer in the offspring. Combining data from population-based registries, we analyzed a total of 2,029 cases, that is, persons with childhood cancer diagnosed under the age of 20 years between years 1996-2014 and a total of 10,103 matched population controls. The mothers of the cases/controls and their diagnoses of diabetes (DM) before/during pregnancy as well as their insulin/metformin prescriptions during pregnancy were identified. Conditional logistic regression modeling was used to analyze the risk of childhood cancer. The OR for childhood cancer among those exposed to any maternal diabetes was 1.32 (95% CI 1.14-1.54) compared to the offspring of the nondiabetic mothers. The effect of maternal diabetes on the risk of childhood cancer remained elevated even after adjusting for maternal age, parity and smoking. Our data suggest that maternal diabetes medication may reduce the risk for childhood cancer (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.36-1.94), especially in gestational diabetes (adjusted OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.05-1.25), compared to the diabetic mothers without medication. The risk of childhood leukemia was significantly higher among children exposed to any maternal diabetes (OR 1.36, CI 1.04-1.77) compared to the unexposed.

We hypothesized that this technology may be more suitable for evaluation of fully engrafted patients following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). To address this question, we developed a hybrid-capture NGS panel utilizing unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to detect variants at 0.1% VAF or below across 22 genes frequently mutated in myeloid disorders and applied it to a retrospective sample set of blood and bone marrow DNA samples previously evaluated as negative for disease via standard-of-care short tandem repeat (STR)-based engraftment testing and hematopathology analysis in our laboratory. Of 30 patients who demonstrated trackable mutations in the 22 genes at eventual relapse by standard NGS analysis, we were able to definitively detect relapse-associated mutations in 18/30 (60%) at previously disease-negative timepoints collected 20-100 days prior to relapse date. MRD was detected in both bone marrow (15/28, 53.6%) and peripheral blood samples (9/18, 50%), while showing excellent technical specificity in our sample set. We also confirmed the disappearance of all MRD signal with increasing time prior to relapse (>100 days), indicating true clinical specificity, even using genes commonly associated with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). This study highlights the efficacy of a highly sensitive, NGS panel-based approach to early detection of relapse in AML and supports the clinical validity of extending MRD analysis across many genes in the post-transplant setting.",,,,,PMC6816574,"['Reagents and supplies used in the study were purchased using funds from the', 'AbbVie-Uchicago collaboration grant C101076 awarded to Jeremy P Segal.

We evaluated whether a higher dosage of PEG-asparaginase and early intensification of triple intrathecal therapy would improve systemic and CNS control. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2017, 598 consecutive patients age 0 to 18 years received risk-directed chemotherapy without prophylactic cranial irradiation in the St Jude Total Therapy Study 16. Patients were randomly assigned to receive PEG-asparaginase 3,500 U/m(2) versus the conventional 2,500 U/m(2). Patients presenting features that were associated with increased risk of CNS relapse received two extra doses of intrathecal therapy during the first 2 weeks of remission induction. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free survival and overall survival rates for the 598 patients were 88.2% (95% CI, 84.9% to 91.5%) and 94.1% (95% CI, 91.7% to 96.5%), respectively. Cumulative risk of any-isolated or combined-CNS relapse was 1.5% (95% CI, 0.5% to 2.5%). Higher doses of PEG-asparaginase did not affect treatment outcome. T-cell phenotype was the only independent risk factor for any CNS relapse (hazard ratio, 5.15; 95% CI, 1.3 to 20.6; P = . 021). Among 359 patients with features that were associated with increased risk for CNS relapse, the 5-year rate of any CNS relapse was significantly lower than that among 248 patients with the same features treated in the previous Total Therapy Study 15 (1.8% [95% CI, 0.4% to 3.3%] v 5.7% [95% CI, 2.8% to 8.6%]; P = .008). There were no significant differences in the cumulative risk of seizure or infection during induction between patients who did or did not receive the two extra doses of intrathecal treatment. CONCLUSION: Higher doses of PEG-asparaginase failed to improve outcome, but additional intrathecal therapy during early induction seemed to contribute to improved CNS control without excessive toxicity for high-risk patients.",,"['R35 CA197695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM118578/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA176063/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC7351342,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00274937'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent germline genomic studies have revealed that at least 5 - 10% of children with cancer (and approximately 3 - 4% of children with ALL) develop the disease due to an underlying genetic predisposition.Areas covered: This review discusses several recently identified ALL predisposing conditions and provides updates on other more well-established syndromes. It also covers topics related to the evaluation and management of children and family members at increased ALL risk.Expert opinion: Germline predisposition is gaining recognition as an important risk factor underlying the development of pediatric ALL. The challenge now lies in how best to capitalize on germline genetic information to improve ALL diagnosis, treatment, and perhaps even prevention.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*familial studies', '*genetic predisposition', '*genome wide association studies (GWAS)', '*hematologic malignancy', '*transcription factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until recently, beclin-1 was a protein known mainly for its role as a critical regulator of autophagy. In this issue of the JCI, Tan et al. describe the effects of the beclin-1 conditional myeloid cell-specific deletion in mice, in which immunostimulation resulted in hypersensitive neutrophils. The chronic proinflammatory effect of these neutrophils triggered spontaneous B cell malignancies to develop. Such tumorigenic effects were mediated primarily by IL-21 and CD40 signaling, leading to the upregulation of tolerogenic molecules, such as IL-10 and PD-L1. The authors went on to examine samples derived from patient lymphoid malignancies and showed that beclin-1 expression in neutrophils positively correlated with pre-B cell leukemia/lymphoma. Overall, the study provides an elegant model for neutrophil-driven carcinogenesis and identifies potential targets for immunotherapy of B cell malignancies.",,"['P50 CA107399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA213131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA215183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6877294,,,,['J Clin Invest. 2019 Dec 2;129(12):5261-5277.

Induced pluripotent stem cells offer the ability to model disease and develop new treatment strategies. JMML is frequently associated with mutations in PTPN11. Children with Noonan syndrome, a development disorder, have an increased incidence of JMML associated with specific germline mutations in PTPN11. We undertook a proteomic assessment of myeloid cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells obtained from Noonan syndrome patients with PTPN11 mutations, either associated or not associated with an increased incidence of JMML. We report that the proteomic perturbations induced by the leukemia-associated PTPN11 mutations are associated with TP53 and NF-Kkappab signaling. We have previously shown that MYC is involved in the differential gene expression observed in Noonan syndrome patients associated with an increased incidence of JMML. Thus, we employed drugs to target these pathways and demonstrate differential effects on clonogenic hematopoietic cells derived from Noonan syndrome patients, who develop JMML and those who do not. Further, we demonstrated these small molecular inhibitors, JQ1 and CBL0137, preferentially extinguish primitive hematopoietic cells from sporadic JMML patients as opposed to cells from healthy individuals.",,"['MR/M008959/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R35 HL135742/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CBL0137', '*Induced pluripotent stem cells', '*Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', '*PTPN11', '*curaxin']",PMC6942217,,['NIHMS1061043'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 27.,"BACKGROUND: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents effectively improve the hemoglobin levels in a fraction of anemic patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Higher doses (HD) of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) have been proposed to overcome suboptimal response rates observed in MDS patients treated with lower ""standard doses"" (SD) of rhEPO. However, a direct comparison between the different doses of rhEPO is lacking. METHODS: A cohort of 104 MDS patients treated with HD was retrospectively compared to 208 patients treated with SD in a propensity score-matched analysis to evaluate hematological improvement-erythroid (HI-E) rate induced by the different doses of rhEPO. The impact of rhEPO doses on survival and progression to leukemia was also investigated. RESULTS: Overall HI-E rate was 52.6%. No difference was observed between different rhEPO doses (P = .28) in matched cohorts; in a subgroup analysis, transfusion-dependent patients and patients with higher IPSS-R score obtained a higher HI-E rate with HD, although without significant impact on overall survival (OS). Achievement of HI-E resulted in superior OS. At univariate analysis, a higher HI-E rate was observed in transfusion-independent patients (P < .001), with a lower IPSS-R score (P < .001) and lower serum EPO levels (P = .027). Multivariate analysis confirmed that rhEPO doses were not significantly related to HI-E (P = .26). There was no significant difference in OS or progression to leukemia in patients treated with HD vs SD. CONCLUSION: SD are substantially equally effective to HD to improve anemia and influencing survival in MDS patients stratified according to similar propensity to be exposed to rhEPO treatment.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

We present a case of a 76-year-old man with stable chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presented to the emergency department (ED) with an onset of right axillary lymphadenitis after recovering from a recent cat bite on the ipsilateral finger. Doppler ultrasound demonstrated an irregular, circumscribed 5cm x 4cm, hypoechoic mass with mild vascular flow consistent with an enlarged abnormal lymph node. The patient was diagnosed with cat scratch disease and discharged on oral antibiotics with spontaneous drainage of the purulent materials in subsequent outpatient oncology visits. This case highlights the classic presentation of this rare disease in an immunocompromised patient with feline contact. Early antibiotics should be considered for at-risk and immunocompromised patients due to low sensitivity and specificity for Bartonella serologic tests. CLL can also present with similar progressive lymphadenopathy with severe systemic symptoms and extranodal involvement that requires emergent oncologic interventions and diagnostic vigilance.","['Copyright (c) 2019, Balakumar et al.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['adult', 'bartonella henselae', 'cat scratch disease', 'clinical images', 'outcome', 'treatment']",PMC6812694,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, cytotoxicity of GGA has also been reported. Some studies have reported that GGA suppresses cell growth and induces apoptosis in cell models of human leukemia, ovarian carcinoma, and colon cancer in vitro. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether GGA can have a cytotoxic effect on a human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2), and human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK) in normal-glucose and high-glucose environments (NG and HG, respectively). The results showed that 100 muM GGA inhibited proliferation of HeLa cells only in NG environment despite inhibiting proliferation of Caco-2 and HEK cells regardless of glucose concentration. Cell viability assay revealed that GGA decreased viability of HeLa, Caco-2, and HEK cells only in NG environment. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the type of cell death was a combination of necrosis and apoptosis. Our study revealed that difference in cytotoxicity of GGA is influenced by glucose condition. The cytotoxic effects of GGA are attenuated in the HG condition. Since both cytotoxic and cytoprotective effects are reported about GGA, further research is needed about the mechanism of the cytotoxic effects.","['(c) Yuko Nakano et al. 2019; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Caco-2', 'HEK293', 'HeLa', 'cytotoxicity', 'geranylgeranylacetone']",PMC6814082,['No competing financial interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among 69 eligible patients (33 male, 36 female), endocrine late effects were identified in 56 patients (81.1%). The median age at the last visit to our endocrinology department was 17.4 years (range: 7.1-35.3 years). The most common primary cancer was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (22 patients, 31.8%). Forty-four patients (64%) were treated using radiation therapy. A primary brain tumor and high doses (>/=6 g/m(2)) of cyclophosphamide were significantly associated with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Our present study suggests that high doses of cyclophosphamide is a risk factor for GHD. Adult heights and pubertal growth spurts of patients treated with radiation therapy were significantly lower than patients not treated with radiation therapy. Our retrospective study reconfirmed that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) were associated with elevated risks of primary hypothyroidism. However, it is unclear whether GVHD induces thyroid dysfunction. Gonadal radiation and busulfan were associated with primary hypogonadism as reported in previous studies. We found high doses of cyclophosphamide to be involved in pituitary disorders. We suggest that pediatric endocrinologists should discuss the potential effects of radiation therapy on adult height and pubertal growth spurt in CCS patients. Moreover, patients who have been treated with high doses of cyclophosphamide or have chronic GVHD require long-term follow-up for endocrine late effects.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood cancer survivors', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Endocrine late effects', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Radiation therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Nov 13.,"Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) is a targeted treatment for adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). InO was previously studied in INO-VATE, an international, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial comparing InO against standard of care (SoC). In the present subgroup analysis, we evaluated outcomes in the 55 Asian patients who were randomized in INO-VATE (31 InO and 24 SoC). Complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) was achieved in 22/31 patients treated with InO versus 5/24 treated with SoC. In the InO arm, more of the patients achieving CR/CRi were minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative (17/22 versus 1/5), and more patients proceeded directly to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (15/31 versus 3/24). Median overall survival for the respective arms was 5.8 versus 3.9 months (hazard ratio 0.67; 97.5% CI 0.28, 1.62). In the safety analysis (n = 51), the most common adverse events were hematologic. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was reported in five InO patients and one SoC patient. In conclusion, Asian patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL experienced improved efficacy with InO versus SoC, with an efficacy and safety profile consistent with results of the overall INO-VATE population.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01564784.",,['Not applicable/Pfizer'],['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Asian', 'Inotuzumab ozogamicin', 'Relapsed/refractory']",,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01564784'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of most salvage therapies is based on anthracycline combinations. In highly pretreated patients who are not eligible for anthracycline-based protocols therapeutic alternatives are limited. For this particular group we evaluated the efficacy and safety of fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG) in combination with etoposide (FLAG-Eto) in 36 patients. The complete remission rate (CR) was 25.7% with a median overall survival of 6 months (95% CI 4.5-7.7). The median disease-free survival for CR/CRi/MLFS (CR/CR with incomplete he-matological recovery/morphologic leukemia-free state) patients was 8 months (95% CI 0.6-15.5). The mortality rate on day 30 was 8% and increased on day 60 to 17%.

However, the effects of dasatinib on microglial and/or astrocytic neuroinflammatory responses and its mechanism of action have not been studied in detail. METHODS: BV2 microglial cells, primary astrocytes, or primary microglial cells were treated with dasatinib (100 or 250 nM) or vehicle (1% DMSO) for 30 min or 2 h followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 200 ng/ml or 1 mug/ml) or PBS for 5.5 h. RT-PCR, real-time PCR; immunocytochemistry; subcellular fractionation; and immunohistochemistry were subsequently conducted to determine the effects of dasatinib on LPS-induced neuroinflammation. In addition, wild-type mice were injected with dasatinib (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily for 4 days or 20 mg/kg, orally administered (p.o.) daily for 4 days or 2 weeks) or vehicle (4% DMSO + 30% polyethylene glycol (PEG) + 5% Tween 80), followed by injection with LPS (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or PBS. Then, immunohistochemistry was performed, and plasma IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha levels were analyzed by ELISA. RESULTS: Dasatinib regulates LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in BV2 microglial cells, primary microglial cells, and primary astrocytes. In BV2 microglial cells, dasatinib regulates LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine levels by regulating TLR4/AKT and/or TLR4/ERK signaling. In addition, intraperitoneal injection and oral administration of dasatinib suppress LPS-induced microglial/astrocyte activation, proinflammatory cytokine levels (including brain and plasma levels), and neutrophil rolling in the brains of wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that dasatinib modulates LPS-induced microglial and astrocytic activation, proinflammatory cytokine levels, and neutrophil rolling in the brain.",,"['19-BR-02-02/Ministry of science, ICT & Future Planning', 'NRF-2019R1A2B5B01070108/National Research Foundation of the Korean government']",['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'Astrocytes', 'LPS', 'Microglia', 'Neuroinflammation', 'STAT3']",PMC6815018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The variability observed in clinical responses on this type of tumours to treatments, the high toxicity of current protocols and the poor prognosis of patients with relapse or refractory make it urgent to find less toxic and more effective therapies in the context of a personalized medicine of precision. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing and RNAseq were performed on DNA and RNA respectively, extracted of a bone marrow sample from a patient diagnosed with tumour primary T-ALL and double negative thymocytes from thymus control samples. We used PanDrugs, a computational resource to propose pharmacological therapies based on our experimental results, including lists of variants and genes. We extend the possible therapeutic options for the patient by taking into account multiple genomic events potentially sensitive to a treatment, the context of the pathway and the pharmacological evidence already known by large-scale experiments. RESULTS: As a proof-of-principle we used next-generation-sequencing technologies (Whole Exome Sequencing and RNA-Sequencing) in a case of diagnosed Pro-T acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We identified 689 disease-causing mutations involving 308 genes, as well as multiple fusion transcript variants, alternative splicing, and 6652 genes with at least one principal isoform significantly deregulated. Only 12 genes, with 27 pathogenic gene variants, were among the most frequently mutated ones in this type of lymphoproliferative disorder. Among them, 5 variants detected in CTCF, FBXW7, JAK1, NOTCH1 and WT1 genes have not yet been reported in T-ALL pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Personalized genomic medicine is a therapeutic approach involving the use of an individual's information data to tailor drug therapy. Implementing bioinformatics platform PanDrugs enables us to propose a prioritized list of anticancer drugs as the best theoretical therapeutic candidates to treat this patient has been the goal of this article. Of note, most of the proposed drugs are not being yet considered in the clinical practice of this type of cancer opening up the approach of new treatment possibilities.",,"['RTI2018-093330-B_100/Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion', 'SAF2015-70561-R/Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad', 'BES-2013-065740/Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad', 'CIVP19S7917/Fundacion Ramon Areces', 'B2017/BMD-3778; LINFOMAS-CM/Comunidad de Madrid', 'AECC, 2018; PROYE18054PIRI/Fundacion Cientifica Asociacion Espanola Contra el', 'Cancer', 'ACCI-CIBERER-17/Instituto de Salud Carlos III']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer genomics', 'Druggable genome', 'In silico prescription', 'Next-generation sequencing technologies', 'PanDrugs', 'Personalized precision medicine', 'Precision oncology', 'T-ALL', 'Targeted therapy', 'Translational bioinformatics']",PMC6815385,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases (n ALL=252; n AML=40) were diagnosed between 1995 and 2000 (aged <15yearsat diagnosis) and identified from the Costa Rican Cancer Registry and the National Children's Hospital. A total of 578 frequency-matched population controls were sampled from the National Birth Registry. Parental tobacco smoking was assessed via face-to-face interviews. We used logistic regression models to examine the association of paternal and maternal tobacco smoking before conception, during pregnancy, and after birth with childhood ALL and AML risk, adjusted for child sex, birth year, maternal/paternal age, and parental education. RESULTS: Paternal smoking before conception, during pregnancy, and after birth was associated with an increased risk of childhood AML (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.51, 95% CI: 1.21-5.17; OR: 3.21, 95% CI: 1.56-6.60; and OR: 2.83, 95% CI: 1.36-5.90, respectively). Maternal smoking during pregnancy was also associated with a modest, but imprecise increase in AML risk. We observed null associations of maternal and paternal smoking with ALL in the offspring. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest an association between parental smoking and risk of AML, but not ALL, in Costa Rican children. These findings add to the established evidence of numerous health risks associated with smoking and highlight the potential harm of smoking during sensitive windows of the development of fetus and child.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we characterized the tubulin-binding activity, the mechanism of action, and the in vivo anti-leukemia efficacy of three 3,4,5-trimethoxy-N-acylhydrazones. We show that all compounds target the colchicine-binding site of tubulin and that none is a substrate of ABC transporters. The crystal structure of the tubulin-bound N-(1'-naphthyl)-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzohydrazide (12) revealed steric hindrance on the T7 loop movement of beta-tubulin, thereby rendering tubulin assembly incompetent. Using dose escalation and short-term repeated dose studies, we further report that this compound class is well tolerated to >100 mg/kg in mice. We finally observed that intraperitoneally administered compound 12 significantly prolonged the overall survival of mice transplanted with both sensitive and multidrug-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Taken together, this work describes promising colchicine-site-targeting tubulin inhibitors featuring favorable therapeutic effects against ALL and multidrug-resistant cells.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Oct 22.,"The fusion oncogene, promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha), is crucial for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) pathogenesis. Previous studies have reported that PML-RARalpha is cleaved by neutrophil elastase (NE), an early myeloid-specific serine protease, leading to translocation of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the PML protein to the N-terminal of RARalpha. This study was designed to evaluate the value of NLS-RARalpha in the early diagnosis of APL. To investigate the potential functional role of NLS-RARalpha in leukemogenesis, HL-60 and U937 cell lines were transfected with NLS-RARalpha lentivirus and negative control (LVNC). The results showed that the induced expression of NLS-RARalpha down-regulated expressions of CD11b, CD11c, and CD14 compared to the LVNC group induced by 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3). This suggested that NLS-RARalpha overexpression inhibited granulocytic and monocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. In addition, Wright-Giemsa staining, flow cytometry, respiratory burst assay, and NBT reduction assay all confirmed the importance of NLS-RARalpha in differentiation. The mechanistic investigations revealed that induced NLS-RARalpha expression inhibited 1,25(OH)2D3-induced granulocytic differentiation by regulating the cell cycle regulators p19(INK4D), p21(WAF1/CIP1), cyclinD1, cyclin E1, and pRB. Furthermore, the cleaved protein NLS-RARalpha enhanced the oncogenicity of U937 cells in NOD/SCID mice. These findings collectively demonstrated that NLS-RARalpha blocked granulocytic and monocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells by inhibiting the downstream targets of the RARalpha signal pathway and the cell cycle. This may provide a promising new target and method for diagnosing and treating APL.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Oct 25.,"INTRODUCTION: The nuclear pore complex is comprised of approximately 30 proteins named nucleoporins (Nups) and tightly regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules across the nuclear membrane. Genetic alterations in many NUP genes are associated with many human maladies, such as neurological disease, autoimmune disorders and cancer. METHODS: We reviewed the status quo of recent advancement of the knowledge of oncogenic role of nucleoporins in human carcinogenesis, focusing on major non-hematological malignancies in the recent literature. Both clinical study-derived and experiment-based reports were critically reviewed. We have also discussed the potential of nucleoporins as novel cancer biomarkers and promising therapeutic target against human malignancies. RESULTS: Several Nups such as Nup53, Nup88, Nup98, Nup160 and Nup214 modulated a plethora of cellular and physiological pathways involved in tumorigenesis such as GSK3beta-Snail, Wnt/beta-Catenin and RanGap1/RanBP2 signaling axes, DNA damage response, resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Although classically, majority of studies have shown oncogenic roles of nucleoporins as genetic fusion partners in several types of leukemia, emerging evidence suggests that nucleoporins also modulate many cellular signaling pathways that are associated with several major non-hematological malignancies, such as carcinomas of skin, breast, lung, prostate and colon. Hence, nucleoporins are emerging as novel therapeutic targets in human tumors.",,"['BT/HRD/35/02/2006/Department of Biotechnology, Government of India']",['NOTNLM'],"['Biomarker', 'Cancer', 'Nuclear pore complex', 'Nucleoporins', 'Signaling pathway']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 25.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the predictive value of the in vitro chemosensitivity using ATP-TCA method to compare the clinical efficacy of patients with AML. METHODS: Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples were collected from 65 patients with AML, and the in vitro chemosensitivity of four drugs (cytarabine/idarubicin/decitabine/aclacinomycin) was measured by an ATP-tumor chemosensitivity assay. RESULTS: Aclacinomycin and cytarabine had the highest chemosensitivity rates (66.7%, 8/12 and 58.5%, 38/65, respectively), while idarubicin and decitabine had rates of 6.5% (3/46) and 0% (0/35), respectively. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 66.2% (43/65) of patients, and there was a statistically significant correlation between CR and in vitro chemosensitivity for cytarabine (47.7% vs 18.5%, p = 0.002), but not for the anthracyclines (p = 0.950). In addition, three other factors significantly correlated with CR: disease status (p = 0.005), FLT3-ITD/TKD mutation (p = 0.003) and chemotherapy regimens (p = 0.004).

The expression of this gene is regulated by microRNAs, transcription factors and genetic variations. A number of studies have recently shown that BCL11A is involved in beta-hemoglobinopathies, hematological malignancies, malignant solid tumors, 2p15-p16.1 microdeletion syndrome, and Type II diabetes.

Epub 2019 Oct 25.,"Changes in transient receptor potential (TRP) Ca(2+) permeable channels are associated with development and progression of different types of cancer. Herein, we report data relative to the expression and function of TRP vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) channels in cancer. Overexpression of TRPV2 is observed in high-grade urothelial cancers and treatment with the TRPV2 agonist cannabidiol induces apoptosis. In prostate cancer, TRPV2 promotes migration and invasion, and TRPV2 overexpression characterizes the castration-resistant phenotype. In breast cancer cells, inhibition of TRPV2 by tranilast reduces the insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulated proliferation. TRPV2 overexpression in triple-negative breast cancer cells is associated with high recurrence-free survival. Increased TRPV2 overexpression is present in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with advanced disease, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. Increased TRPV2 transcripts have been found both in benign hepatoma and in hepatocarcinomas, where TRPV2 expression is associated with portal vein invasion and reduction of cancer stem cell expression. TRPV2 expression and function has been also evaluated in gliomagenesis. This receptor negatively controls survival, proliferation, and resistance to CD95- or BCNU-induced apoptosis. In glioblastoma stem cells, TRPV2 activation promotes differentiation and inhibits the proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In glioblastoma, the TRPV2 is part of an interactome-based signature complex, which is negatively associated with survival, and it is expressed in high risk of recurrence and temozolomide-resistant patients. Finally, also in hematological malignancies, such as myeloma or acute myeloid leukemia, TRPV2 might represent a target for novel therapeutic approaches. Overall, these findings demonstrate that TRPV2 exhibits an oncogenic activity in different types of cancers, controlling survival, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and invasion signaling pathways. Thus, it prompts the pharmacological use of TRPV2 targeting in the control of cancer progression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting of p53-MDM2 interaction to reactivate p53 function is therefore an attractive therapeutic approach for AML. Here we show that an orally active inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction, DS-5272, causes dramatic tumor regressions of MLL-AF9-driven AML in vivo with a tolerable toxicity. However, the antileukemia effect of DS-5272 is markedly attenuated in immunodeficient mice, indicating the critical impact of systemic immune responses that drive p53-mediated leukemia suppression. In relation to this, DS-5272 triggers immune-inflammatory responses in MLL-AF9 cells including upregulation of Hif1alpha and PD-L1, and inhibition of the Hif1alpha-PD-L1 axis sensitizes AML cells to p53 activation. We also found that NK cells are important mediators of antileukemia immunity.

Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family proteins are newly identified cancer-related epigenetic regulators, which have a role in the pathogenesis and progression of osteosarcoma. In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo anti-osteosarcoma activity by targeting BET with a PROTAC molecule BETd-260. The results showed that BETd-260 completely depletes BET proteins and potently suppresses cell viability in MNNG/HOS, Saos-2, MG-63, and SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cell lines. Compared with BET inhibitors HJB-97 and JQ1, the activity of BETd-260 increased over 1000 times. Moreover, BETd-260 substantially inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, Bcl-xl while increased the expression of pro-apoptotic Noxa, which resulted in massive apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells within hours. In addition, pro-oncogenic protein c-Myc also was substantially inhibited by BETd-260 in the OS cells. Of note, BETd-260 induced degradation of BET proteins, triggered apoptosis in xenograft osteosarcoma tumor tissue, and profoundly inhibited the growth of cell-derived and patient-derived osteosarcoma xenografts in mice.

To address this issue we synthesized a series of seven triple-modified 4-bromothiocolchicine analogues with amide moieties. These novel derivatives were active in the nanomolar range against several different cancer cell lines and primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, specifically compounds: 5-9 against primary ALL-5 (IC50=5.3-14nM), 5, 7-9 against A549 (IC50=10nM), 5, 7-9 against MCF-7 (IC50=11nM), 5-9 against LoVo (IC50=7-12nM), and 5, 7-9 against LoVo/DX (IC50=48-87nM). These IC50 values were lower than those obtained for unmodified colchicine and common anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin. Further studies revealed that colchicine and selected analogues induced characteristics of apoptotic cell death but manifested their effects in different phases of the cell cycle in MCF-7 versus ALL-5 cells. Specifically, while colchicine and the studied derivatives arrested MCF-7 cells in mitosis, very little mitotically arrested ALL-5 cells were observed, suggesting effects were manifest instead in interphase. We also developed an in silico model of the mode of binding of these compounds to their primary target, beta-tubulin. We conducted a correlation analysis (linear regression) between the calculated binding energies of colchicine derivatives and their anti-proliferative activity, and determined that the obtained correlation coefficients strongly depend on the type of cells used.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 Oct 22.,"To date, the prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM) in patients harboring cytogenetic abnormalities (CA) involving t (4; 14) and deletion of chromosome 17 remains poor despite recent advances in drug development that include the use of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) such as lenalidomide for MM. To address this issue, we have developed a novel phenylphthalimide derivative, TC11, that is structurally related to IMiDs. It remains unclear how TC11 induces apoptosis of MM cells with high-risk CA. Here, we show that TC11 does not induce degradation of CRBN's substrates, IKZF1/3 and CK1alpha, and induces apoptosis of CRBN-silenced MM; this effect was independent of the cereblon (CRBN) pathway, which is involved in the mechanism of action of IMiDs used for the treatment of MM. We also revealed that TC11, in contrast to existing IMiDs, induced degradation of MCL1 and activation of caspase-9. Furthermore, inhibition of CDK1 by CGP74514A prevented TC11-induced MCL1 degradation, caspase-9 activation, and the subsequent apoptotic cell death. We showed that ectopic MCL1 expression rescued apoptosis of MM. These observations suggest that TC11 induces apoptotic death caused by degradation of MCL1 during prolonged mitotic arrest. Therefore, our findings suggest that TC11 is a potential drug candidate for high-risk MM.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Epub 2019 Oct 25.,"OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to evaluate the pattern of occurrence of adverse drug reactions and drug-drug interaction in a pediatric oncology unit of a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Oncology, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Hospital, India. Patients were monitored actively for the occurrences of any adverse drug reaction during the study period. Patient's demographic details, clinical, and treatment data were collected for drug-drug interaction analysis. The detected adverse drug reaction was assessed for causality, severity, and preventability. Drug-drug interaction identified was rated based on their level of urgency and the nature of actions necessary to respond to an interaction. RESULTS: Of 176 patients, 118 were detected for the occurrence of various adverse drug reaction. The majority of the cases were suffering with acute lymphocytic leukemia (67.9%). Vincristine was noted for a maximum number of adverse drug reaction in cytotoxic drugs. Rash is the most frequently occurred reaction. Assessment of causality showed that the majority of cases are ""probable"" (60.16%). In evaluating the severity of adverse drug reactions, 57.6% reactions were moderately severe and 74.5% of the reactions were preventable. Upon assessing the drug-drug interaction, 38.13% of the prescription needs to be monitored and 10 drug-drug interactions were under the risk category of ""X."" The majority of the adverse drug reaction was moderately severe in nature and those were preventable. CONCLUSION: Since pediatrics are vulnerable population, they must have a thorough surveillance system for adverse drug reaction and drug-drug interaction; thereby, a positive impact on the medication-use system and improved patient care can be achieved.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Up-to-date database', 'causality', 'preventability', 'severity', 'vulnerable population']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its expression may be a useful marker to predict the diagnosis and the risk stratification of patients with AML. METHODS: This study aimed to characterize the expression pattern of SALL4 gene in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Quantitative Real-time PCR was used to determine the expression level of the gene in peripheral blood of 52 Egyptian adult AML patients and 10 healthy control cases. Our study was done in the National Cancer Institute during the period of time between December 2014 and June 2015. RESULTS: The observed data revealed that none of the studied controls expressed SALL4 > 1.0 RQ and there was a highly statistically significant difference between cases and controls regarding SALL4 gene expression where all cases showed higher expression of SALL4 than controls with p value <0.001. CONCLUSION: In AML, SALL4 is one of few genes that bridge the self-renewal properties of ESCs, normal HSCs and LSCs. Their expression is easily determined by real time PCR. They may be useful markers to predict prognosis and help to stratify patients into risk adapted groups.

Overexpression of the mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) gene has been explored in many tumors. However, the role of MDM2 -309T>G (rs2279744) polymorphism in AML remains unclear. We have performed this study to examine the association of MDM2 -309T>G with AML in an Iranian population. METHODS: We have examined the association of N MDM2 -309T>G polymorphism in 73 cases diagnosed with AML and 80 healthy controls by tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR assay. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated on the risk genotypes and alleles. RESULTS: The TT, GG and GG genotypes of MDM2 -309T>G polymorphism in patients were 32.9%, 23.2% and 43.9%, while in controls were 86.2%, 7.5% and 6.3%, respectively. Moreover, Frequency of mutant allele (G) was 55.6% in cases with AML and 10.0% in controls. The mutant homozygote genotype (GG) was associated with an increased susceptibility to AML (OR 1.471; 95% CI: 1.062-1.844; p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the MDM2 -309T>G polymorphism was significantly associated with increased risk of AML in the Iranian population. Thus, the MDM2 -309T>G polymorphism might be useful genetic susceptibility factors in the pathogenesis of AML.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['MDM2 -309T>G', 'Mouse Double Minute 2', 'Polymorphism', 'acute myeloid leukemia']",PMC6982679,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, anxiety and psychological stress have a negative effect on the health of parents, and fatigue causes a sense of weakness and reduces the capacity for mental and physical activity, and insomnia, as well as stress and inability to perform their occupational and social functions. This study aimed to determine the effect of relaxation techniques on anxiety, fatigue, and sleep quality of parents of children with leukemia under chemotherapy in South East Iran in 2015. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial study. The study population included parents of children with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy who were admitted to a teaching hospital in South East Iran. One hundred twenty parents were randomly assigned to control and intervention groups, and the experimental group was provided with Benson relaxation technique. Data collection tool included a demographic questionnaire, state-trait anxiety inventory, Brief Fatigue Inventory, and sleep quality inventory. Data analysis was done by SPSS 16 and paired t-test, Wilcoxon, Mann- Whitney, regression, One - Way ANOVA and Pearson tests were performed, and p </= 0.05 was statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean score of state anxiety in the intervention group was 60.86 +/- 8.95 and 35.95 +/- 4.61 before and after the intervention, respectively. The mean score of trait anxiety was 56.56 +/- 4.75 and 34.45 +/- 4.95. The mean score of the fatigue was 73.83 +/- 14.63 and 43.71 +/- 11. 06, and the mean score of the quality of sleep was 13.5 +/- 6.05 and 5.7 +/- 3.43 before and after the intervention respectively. There was a statistically significant difference among state-trait anxiety, fatigue, and sleep quality in intervention and control groups after the intervention. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between fatigue and age, but there was no statistically significant relationship among the mean fatigue, weight, the number of sons and daughters, education, occupation, gender, place of residence and income (p> 0.05). There was no statistically significant relationship among the quality of sleep of parents, education, gender, and place of residence, but there was a statistically significant relationship between state anxiety and education (p</=0.05). CONCLUSION: The results can predispose family-centered nursing care to support more the parents of children with cancer in the face of the stress of illness.

Historically, the identification of genetic alterations in AML focused on protein-coding genes to provide biomarkers and to understand the molecular complexity of AML. Despite these findings and because of the heterogeneity of this disease, questions as to the molecular mechanisms underlying AML development and progression remained unsolved. Recently, transcriptome-wide profiling approaches have uncovered a large family of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Larger than 200 nucleotides and with no apparent protein coding potential, lncRNAs could unveil a new set of players in AML development. Originally considered as dark matter, lncRNAs have critical roles to play in the different steps of gene expression and thus affect cellular homeostasis including proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration or genomic stability. Consequently, lncRNAs are found to be differentially expressed in tumors, notably in AML, and linked to the transformation of healthy cells into leukemic cells. In this review, we aim to summarize the knowledge concerning lncRNAs functions and implications in AML, with a particular emphasis on their prognostic and therapeutic potential.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'biomarkers', 'long noncoding RNA']",PMC6896193,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a variety of mostly retrospective studies have shown that individuals in AML remission who tested positive for MRD at specific time-points or had increasing MRD levels are at significantly higher risk of relapse and death compared to MRD-negative patients. However, these studies differ with respect to the ""MRD-target"", time-point of MRD determination, material analyzed, and method applied. How this probably very valuable MRD information in individual patients may be adapted in the daily clinical routine, e.g., to separate patients who need more aggressive therapies from those who may be spared additional-potentially toxic-therapies is still a work-in-progress. With the exception of MRD assessment in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the lack of randomized, prospective trials renders MRD-based decisions and clinical implications in AML a difficult task. As of today, we still do not have proof that early intervention in MRD-positive AML patients would improve outcomes, although this is very likely.

Most of the infected subjects are asymptomatic, but severe clinical disorders appear as a neurodegenerative disease (HTLV-1 associated myelopathy-HAM) or a lymphoprolipherative disorder (Adult T Leukemia/Lymphoma-ATLL) and in other target organs of the human body. HTLV-1 infections are frequently asymptomatic, but there is a large spectrum of diseases that have been described along the years. The mechanisms by which the virus interacts with the host, the different modes of response of the host to the infection, and the immunogenic characteristics of the host are some of the interesting and unanswered questions that may direct the outcome of the disease.

Using pertussis toxins and YM-254890, we demonstrated that SP induces Ca(2+) mobilization and degranulation via both the Galphai and Galphaq family of G proteins in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells stably expressing MRGPRX2. To determine the roles of MRGPRX2's transmembrane (TM) and intracellular domains on SP-induced responses, we utilized information obtained from both structural modeling and naturally occurring MRGPRX2 missense variants. We found that highly conserved residues in TM6 (I225) and TM7 (Y279) of MRGPRX2 are essential for SP-induced Ca(2+) mobilization and degranulation in transiently transfected RBL-2H3 cells. Cells expressing missense variants in the receptor's conserved residues (V123F and V282M) as well as intracellular loops (R138C and R141C) failed to respond to SP. By contrast, replacement of all five Ser/Thr residues with Ala and missense variants (S325L and L329Q) in MRGPRX2's carboxyl-terminus resulted in enhanced mast cell activation by SP when compared to the wild-type receptor. These findings suggest that MRGPRX2 utilizes conserved residues in its TM domains and intracellular loops for coupling to G proteins and likely undergoes desensitization via phosphorylation at Ser/Thr residues in its carboxyl-terminus. Furthermore, identification of gain and loss of function MRGPRX2 variants has important clinical implications for SP-mediated neurogenic inflammation and other chronic inflammatory diseases.",,['R01-AI124182/NH/NIH HHS/United States'],['NOTNLM'],"['MRGPRX2', 'mast cells', 'missense variants', 'neurogenic inflammation', 'substance P']",PMC6862462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-33 production augments the course of inflammation after cell damage or death. It is discharged into the extracellular space. IL-33 is regarded as an ""alarmin"" able to stimulate several effectors of the immune system, regulating numerous immune responses comprising cancer immune reactions. IL-33 has been demonstrated to influence tumorigenesis. However, as far as this cytokine is concerned, we are faced with what has sometimes been defined as the IL-33 paradox. Several studies have demonstrated a relevant role of IL-33 to numerous malignancies, where it may have pro- and-less frequently-antitumorigenic actions. In the field of hematological malignancies, the role of IL-33 seems even more complex. Although we can affirm the existence of a negative role of IL-33 in Chronic myelogenos leukemia (CML) and in lymphoproliferative diseases and a positive role in pathologies such as Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the action of IL-33 seems to be multiple and sometimes contradictory within the same pathology.

A sensitive and rapid method has been developed and validated as per regulatory guideline for the simultaneous quantitation of enasidenib and its active metabolite, AGI-16903 in mice plasma using an LC-MS/MS. Enasidenib and AGI-16903 along with internal standard were extracted from mice plasma using simple protein precipitation method. Chromatographic resolution of enasidenib, AGI-16903 and the internal standard (close analogue of AGI-16903) was achieved on a Chromolith RP-18e column using 0.2% formic acid:acetonitrile (15:85, v/v) as an eluent, which was delivered at a flow-rate of 1.2 mL/min. The MS/MS ion transitions monitored were m/z 474.1-->267.2, 402.1-->188.1 and 421.0-->146.1 for enasidenib, AGI-16903 and the internal standard, respectively. The linearity range was 1.01-3023 ng/mL for both enasidenib and AGI-16903. The within-run and between-run accuracy and within-run and between-run precision were in the range of - 2.29 to 2.72 (as one value is in negative side). and 4.65-9.82%, respectively for enasidenib; 0.19-10.3 and 3.22-9.22%, respectively for AGI-16903. Both enasidenib and AGI-16903 were found to be stable in stability (up to three freeze-thaw cycles and for long-term at -80 degrees C for 30 days) and processed (bench-top for 6 h and in in-injector for 24 h) samples.

However, the underlying mechanisms of ketamine-associated cystitis still remain unclear. Bladder tissues of rats were stained by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE). The viability of human uroepithelial cells (SV-HUC-1 cells) was determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). Apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were examined by flow cytometry. Additionally, the expressions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta and IL-18 were respectively determined by reverse transcription quantitative (RTq)-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA and protein levels of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), cleaved caspase 3, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3), thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), Catalase and MnSOD were examined by RT-qPCR and Western blot. Small interfering RNA target TXNIP transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000. We found that ketamine effectively damaged bladder tissues of rats and promoted apoptosis through regulating the expression levels of GRP78, CHOP, Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved Caspase-3 proteins in vivo and in vitro. NLRP3 inflammatory body and TXNIP were activated by ketamine, which was supported by the changes in TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 and IL-18 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, knocking down TXNIP reversed the effects of ketamine on apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammatory body in SV-HUC-1 cells. Meanwhile, the changes of Catalase and MnSOD showed that ROS was enhanced by ketamine, however, such an effect was ameliorated by down-regulation of TXNIP in SV-HUC-1 cells.

Resting echocardiogram is the standard procedure for monitoring cardiac health but this method may not be sensitive enough to detect subclinical injury. Exercise echocardiography may provide a viable alternative. METHODS: Nineteen (9 males; age, 19 +/- 3 yr) anthracycline-treated survivors of childhood leukemia and 17 (8 males) healthy individuals of similar age (22 +/- 2 yr) were recruited. All survivors had normal resting echocardiography upon recruitment. Exercise echocardiography was performed using contemporary imaging techniques. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), body composition, and cardiorespiratory fitness (V O2peak) were assessed to determine predisposition to additional disease. RESULTS: Mitral valve peak flow velocity in late diastole (interaction, P = 0.007) increased from rest in survivors (P = 0.023) and controls (P = 0.020) immediately postexercise but did not recover again in the survivors (exercise-recovery, P = 0.784) after recuperation. Consequently, E/A ratio (interaction, P < 0.001) was lower in the survivors at recovery (P < 0.001). Survivors had reduced FMD (7.88 +/- 1.70 vs 9.65 +/- 2.83; P = 0.030), maximal and recovery HR (P = 0.001; P < 0.001), minute ventilation (P < 0.001), and V O2peak (absolute, 2.64 +/- 0.62 vs 3.14 +/- 0.74 L.min, P = 0.034; relative, 36.78 +/- 11.49 vs 45.14 +/- 6.80 mL.kg.min; P = 0.013) compared with controls. They also had higher total body fat (percentage, P = 0.034; mass, P = 0.024) and fat mass in the central (P = 0.050), peripheral (P = 0.039) and visceral (P < 0.001) regions. Survivors matched controls with regard to height (173.0 +/- 7.8 cm vs 173.8 +/- 9.1 cm; P = 0.796), body mass (76.16 +/- 19.05 kg vs 70.07 +/- 13.96 kg; P = 0.287) and body mass index (25.2 +/- 5.1 vs 22.9 +/- 2.7; P = 0.109). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise echocardiography unmasked subclinical diastolic dysfunction that may indicate late anthracycline toxicity in apparently healthy survivors of childhood leukemia. Presence of secondary risk factors indicates increased predisposition to comorbidities and highlights the importance of assessing cardiovascular health during follow-up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To identify the frequency of uncertainty and its associated factors in adults scheduled to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study with analytical purposes, information on sociodemographic and clinical variables was collected. Fifty patients were diagnosed with lymphoma, myeloma, or leukemia from a high-complexity hospital. Mishel's Scale of Uncertainty in Illness validated in Spanish was applied. A multivariate analysis was performed through logistic regression. RESULTS: Approximately 74% of participants had a high level of uncertainty. The education level (odds ratio [OR], 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-15.3), family history of cancer (OR, 30.7; 95% CI, 2.7-349), and previous radiotherapy treatment (OR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.004-0.48) were associated with the uncertainty level. CONCLUSIONS: Uncertainty is experienced by patients with hematologic cancer, and factors associated should be recognized to diminish the negative effects produced by this. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This experience of uncertainty and its associated factors must be visible in patients scheduled to undergo transplantation. This allows nurses to carry out interventions that have an impact on the cognitive ability mediated by information and education. Reducing the effects that uncertainty has on the overall experience of patients, it is vital for nursing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we evaluated bone status, expressed as bone mineral density (BMD), and endocrine functions including PTH, TSH, free T4, testosterone, SHBG, FSH, LH, and IGF-1, in 20 adult leukemia patients >10 years after allo-SCT. A low BMD (Z score <-2.0) was observed in two patients; two patients had osteoporotic fractures, and two had a unilateral avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Elevated PTH was observed in 30% of patients, and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) was low (<50 nmol/L) in 45% of the patients. The majority of the patients had thyroid tests within the reference range, while elevated FSH values were present in 8 of 12 males. We conclude that adult leukemia patients have relatively well-preserved BMD >10 years post-allo-SCT. Prophylactic treatment of osteoporosis should be individualized, but control of BMD is necessary for long-term follow-up. Control of PTH and vitamin D levels before and after allo-SCT is recommended, and vitamin D supplementation should be considered if indicated.

Another approach uses DNA/RNA heteroduplex oligonucleotides (HDOs). Here, we developed an antisense double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide (ADO) by modification of the complementary RNA in an HDO to generate DNA for increasing resistance to nucleases. Naked BCR-ABL-targeting ADO was significantly more potent than siRNA at reducing BCR-ABL chimeric mRNA expression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines. Further, naked BCR-ABL-targeting ADO suppressed BCR-ABL protein levels in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited CML cell proliferation, and augmented the inhibitory effects of imatinib mesylate.

Infiltrating immune and stromal cells are important components of the BM microenvironment and significantly influence the progression of AML. This study aimed to elucidate the value of immune/stromal cell-associated genes for AML prognosis by integrated bioinformatics analysis. We obtained expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and used the ESTIMATE algorithm to calculate immune scores and stromal scores; we then identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on these scores. Overall survival analysis was applied to reveal common DEGs of prognostic value. Subsequently, we conducted a functional enrichment analysis, generated a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and performed an interrelation analysis of immune system processes, showing that these genes are mainly associated with the immune/inflammatory response. Finally, eight genes (CD163, CYP27A1, KCNA5, PPM1J, FOLR1, IL1R2, MYOF, VSIG2) were verified to be significantly associated with AML prognosis in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. In summary, we identified key microenvironment-related genes that affect the outcomes of AML patients and might serve as therapeutic targets.",,"['91742110/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'LY19H080004/Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (CN)']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Bioinformatics analysis', 'Immune microenvironment', 'Overall survival']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 24.,"Despite great interest, the mechanism of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) release is not fully understood and some aspects of this process, e.g. the role of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), still remain unclear. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the mechanisms underlying RNS-induced formation of NETs and contribution of RNS to NETs release triggered by various physiological and synthetic stimuli. The involvement of RNS in NETs formation was studied in primary human neutrophils and differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60 cells). RNS (peroxynitrite and nitric oxide) efficiently induced NETs release and potentiated NETs-inducing properties of platelet activating factor and lipopolysaccharide. RNS-induced NETs formation was independent of autophagy and histone citrullination, but dependent on the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and myeloperoxidase, as well as selective degradation of histones H2A and H2B by neutrophil elastase. Additionally, NADPH oxidase activity was required to release NETs upon stimulation with NO, as shown in NADPH-deficient neutrophils isolated from patients with chronic granulomatous disease. The role of RNS was further supported by increased RNS synthesis upon stimulation of NETs release with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore A23187. Scavenging or inhibition of RNS formation diminished NETs release triggered by these stimuli while scavenging of peroxynitrite inhibited NO-induced NETs formation. Our data suggest that RNS may act as mediators and inducers of NETs release. These processes are PI3K-dependent and ROS-dependent. Since inflammatory reactions are often accompanied by nitrosative stress and NETs formation, our studies shed a new light on possible mechanisms engaged in various immune-mediated conditions.",,"['2015/19/N/NZ6/01317/Narodowe Centrum Nauki', 'POWROTY/2016-2/7/Fundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej', 'START 2019/Fundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej']",['NOTNLM'],"['Autophagy', 'Neutrophil extracellular traps', 'Nitric oxide', 'Peroxynitrite', 'Phosphoinositide 3-kinases', 'Reactive nitrogen species']",PMC7366602,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook a multicenter clinical trial to determine toxicity, feasibility, and response for this therapy. A total of 25 pediatric/young adult patients (age, 1-22.5 years) with R/R B-ALL were treated with 19-28z CAR T cells. Conditioning chemotherapy included high-dose (3 g/m2) cyclophosphamide (HD-Cy) for 17 patients and low-dose (</=1.5 g/m2) cyclophosphamide (LD-Cy) for 8 patients. Fifteen patients had pretreatment minimal residual disease (MRD; <5% blasts in bone marrow), and 10 patients had pretreatment morphologic evidence of disease (>/=5% blasts in bone marrow). All toxicities were reversible, including severe cytokine release syndrome in 16% (4 of 25) and severe neurotoxicity in 28% (7 of 25) of patients. Treated patients were assessed for response, and, among the evaluable patients (n = 24), response and peak CAR T-cell expansion were superior in the HD-Cy/MRD cohorts, as compared with the LD-Cy/morphologic cohorts without an increase in toxicity. Our data support the safety of CD19-specific CAR T-cell therapy for R/R B-ALL.

Although these short duplications occur in 25% of AML patients, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying their formation. Understanding the origin of FLT3-ITDs would advance our understanding of the genesis of AML. We analyzed the sequence and molecular anatomy of 300 FLT3-ITDs to address this issue, including 114 ITDs with additional nucleotides of unknown origin located between the 2 copies of the repeat. We observed anatomy consistent with replication slippage, but could only identify the germline microhomology (1-6 bp) anticipated to prime such slippage in one-third of FLT3-ITDs. We explain the paradox of the ""missing"" microhomology in the majority of FLT3-ITDs through occult microhomology: specifically, by priming through use of nontemplated nucleotides (N-nucleotides) added by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). We suggest that TdT-mediated nucleotide addition in excess of that required for priming creates N-regions at the duplication junctions, explaining the additional nucleotides observed at this position. FLT3-ITD N-regions have a G/C content (66.9%), dinucleotide composition (P < .001), and length characteristics consistent with synthesis by TdT. AML types with high TdT show an increased incidence of FLT3-ITDs (M0; P = .0017). These results point to an unexpected role for the lymphoid enzyme TdT in priming FLT3-ITDs. Although the physiological role of TdT is to increase antigenic diversity through N-nucleotide addition during V(D)J recombination of IG/TCR genes, here we propose that illegitimate TdT activity makes a significant contribution to the genesis of AML.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,['Blood. 2019 Dec 19;134(25):2229-2231.

AML with mutated NPM1 is recognized as a separate entity in the World Health Organization 2016 classification and carries a relatively favorable prognosis. NPM1 mutations are predominantly 4-bp duplications or insertions in the terminal exon that arise through an unknown mechanism. Here we analyze 2430 NPM1 mutations from 2329 adult and 101 pediatric patients to address their origin. We show that NPM1 mutations display the hallmarks of replication slippage, but lack suitable germline microhomology available for priming. Insertion mutations display G/C-rich N-nucleotide tracts, with a significant bias toward polypurine and polypyrimidine stacking (P < .001). These features suggest terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) primes replication slippage through N-nucleotide addition, with longer syntheses manifesting as N-regions. The recurrent type A, type D, and type B mutations require 1, 2, and 3 N-nucleotide extensions of T, CC, and CAT, respectively, with the last nucleotide used as occult microhomology. This TdT-mutator model successfully predicts the relative incidence of the 256 potential 4-bp insertion/duplication mutations at position c.863_864 over 4 orders of magnitude (rho = 0.484, P < .0001). Children have a different NPM1 mutation spectrum to adults, including a shift away from type A mutations and toward longer N-regions, consistent with higher TdT activity in pediatric myeloid stem cells. These findings complement our FLT3-ITD data, suggesting illegitimate TdT activity contributes to around one-half of AMLs. AML may therefore reflect the price for adaptive immunity.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,['Blood. 2019 Dec 19;134(25):2229-2231. PMID: 31856273'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trehalose (Tre) exhibits powerful neuroprotective effects in certain brain injury models. Herein, we revealed the specific molecular mechanism underlying the protective effects of Tre against Cd-induced brain damage in rats. Firstly, the results showed that Tre significantly ameliorated brain pathological injury induced by Cd. Secondly, Cd-induced down-regulation of total anti-oxidation capacity (T-AOC) and up-regulation of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) in brain tissues were significantly reversed by Tre treatment. Importantly, the augmentation of nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) caused by Cd was significantly inhibited by Tre treatment. Thirdly, the levels of autophagy marker proteins were measured and the results showed that Tre significantly reversed the up-regulation of light chain 3II (LC-3II) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM-1/p62) caused by Cd exposure. Finally, the apoptosis rate and the levels of apoptosis marker proteins including B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax) were also measured and the results showed that Cd-induced apoptosis was markedly inhibited by Tre treatment. Collectively, our data suggested that Tre exerted its neuroprotective effects by ameliorating oxidative stress, autophagy inhibition, and apoptosis induced by Cd in rat brains. In addition, the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which is continuously activated by Cd, may contribute to brain injury.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antileukemia activity of Atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on human leukemia cells was investigated. Atorvastatin inhibited K562 and HL60 cell proliferation, induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in K562 cells by down-regulating cyclinB1 and cdc2, but G0/G1 arrest in HL60 cells by up-regulating p27 and down-regulating cyclinD1 and p-pRb. Atorvastatin also induced apoptosis in both cell lines, in which the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related mitochondrial apoptotic signaling might be involved, with increase of ROS and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of cytochrome C into cytosol, and activation of Bax/Caspase-9/Caspase-3/PARP pathway. Inhibition of YAP nuclear localization and activation by Atorvastatin was reversed by the addition of mevalonate, GGPP, or FPP. Further, the effects on cell cycle arrest- and apoptosis- related proteins by Atorvastatin were alleviated by addition of mevalonate, suggesting the antileukemia effect of Atorvastatin might be through mevalonate-YAP axis in K562 and HL60 cells.

KDM1A is a core component of the chromatin binding CoREST complex. Together with histone deacetylases CoREST regulates gene expression by histone 3 demethylation and deacetylation. The transcription factors GFI1 and GFI1B (for growth factor independence) are major interaction partners of KDM1A and recruit the CoREST complex to chromatin in myeloid cells.

This process, known as immunogenic cell death, is characterized by a variety of tumor cell modifications, i.e., cell surface translocation of calreticulin, extracellular release of adenosine triphosphate and pro-inflammatory factors, such as high mobility group box 1 proteins. However, in addition to with immunogenic cell death, chemotherapy is known to induce inflammatory modifications within the tumor microenvironment, which may also elicit immunosuppressive pathways. In particular, DCs may be driven to acquire tolerogenic features, such as the overexpression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygensase 1, which may ultimately hamper anti-tumor T-cells via the induction of T regulatory cells. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about the mechanisms and effects by which chemotherapy results in both activation and suppression of anti-tumor immune response. Indeed, a better understanding of the whole process underlying chemotherapy-induced alterations of the immunological tumor microenvironment has important clinical implications to fully exploit the immunogenic potential of anti-leukemia agents and tune their application.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Ocadlikova, Lecciso, Isidori, Loscocco, Visani, Amadori, Cavo', 'and Curti.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['T regulatory cells', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'dendritic cells', 'immunogenic cell death', 'immunosuppression']",PMC6794495,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LP success can depend on the size and anatomy of the patient and the skill of the hematologist. The main objective was to determine the influence of body mass index (BMI) on LP outcomes. Materials and Methods: Adults with lymphoid malignancies requiring LP were included prospectively over one year; hematology residents performed most procedures. A 22-gauge Quincke needle was employed. Comparison between non-traumatic vs. traumatic LPs according to BMI, CNS relapse, and residents' year was performed. Results: Fifty-four patients with a mean age of 31.5+/-15.57 years were included. Diagnosis was Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-B (74%), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-T (13%) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (13%). 227 LPs were performed, 121 (53.3%) successful, 98 (43.2%) traumatic, 11 (11.2%) TLPs were macroscopically detectable and 87 (88%) microscopic; 8 (3.5%) were dry-taps. Median time between punctures was 11 days (1-202). Median BMI was 25 (22.8-39.6). Main indication for LP was prophylactic (74.5%); 39.2% were performed by first-year, 35.2% by second-year, 19.6% by third-year hematology residents. No difference (p = 0.145) for a TLP was found among residents. A BMI >/=30 (p = 0.040), non-palpable intervertebral space (p = 0.001) and more than one attempt (p = 0.001) were significant for TLP. TLP was not associated with CNS relapse (p = 0.962). Conclusion: Obesity predicted a TLP. A traumatic puncture did not increase the risk of CNS relapse at one-year follow-up.","['Copyright : (c) International Journal of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell', 'Research & Tehran University of Medical Sciences.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Central nervous system (CNS) relapse', 'Lumbar puncture', 'Obesity', 'Traumatic lumbar puncture']",PMC6801327,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the anti-cancer effect of Artemisia annua extract (AAE), a Chinese herbal medicine alone and in combination with a microtubule binding agent used in ALL treatment, vincristine (VCR), in B-Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Nalm-6 and Reh cells. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxic activity of AAE and VCR was determined using MTT assay in Nalm-6, and Reh cell lines and synergism was evaluated using the CompuSyn software. Caspase 3 activity and Annexin/PI staining were performed for apoptosis assessment. The expression level of apoptosis-related genes, caspase 3, Bax and Bcl-2 were determined using real time-PCR. One-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey multiple comparisons were used for statistical analysis. Results: Our findings revealed that a single administration of AAE exerted an anti-leukemic effect in both ALL-derived cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the growth inhibitory activity of the extract was more potentiated when combined with 0.1 and 1 nM VCR through caspase 3-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis showed that VCR-induced cytotoxicity was augmented by AAE through alteration of Bax, and Bcl-2 mRNA expression. Conclusion: Overall, owing to the nontoxic nature of AAE and its explicit role in enhancing VCR effectiveness, our study provided new insight into the development of a novel combinatorial approach in ALL using natural herbs. The practical implication of the research requires further investigation through clinical trials, opening avenues for forthcoming treatment improvements.","['Copyright : (c) International Journal of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell', 'Research & Tehran University of Medical Sciences.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Extract', 'Vincristine']",PMC6801329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most important ingredient of this family is amygdalin that is believed to have anti-tumor and analgesic properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-proliferative effects of Armeniacae semen extract on the acute leukemia, NALM-6, and KG-1 cell lines, and investigate the effect of the extract on apoptosis of these cell lines and caspase-3 gene expression. Materials and Methods: We prepared aqueous, ethyl acetate, and hydro alcoholic extracts of the Armeniacae semen. The NALM-6 and KG-1 cell lines and mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy controls were treated with different doses of the extracts for 48 hours, and then cell viability was investigated with the MTT test. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography was done for amygdalin identification. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using the Annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometric kit, and caspase-3 gene expression was evaluated. Results: MTT test revealed that the strongest Inhibition Concentration (IC50) in KG-1 and NALM-6 cell lines was related to the ethyl acetate extract. This extract did not have toxic effects on PBMCs. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the ethyl acetate extract at its IC50 concentration led to almost 50% apoptosis in both cell lines after 48 hours. In the molecular examination, after treatment, a significant increase was seen in caspase-3 gene expression in NALM6 and KG1 cells compared to the control (P<0.001 and P <0.05, respectively). Conclusion: Our data confirmed that the ethyl acetate extract of Prunusarmeniaca could reduce the proliferation of KG-1 and NALM-6 cell lines probably by activating the apoptotic pathway.","['Copyright : (c) International Journal of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell', 'Research & Tehran University of Medical Sciences.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Acute leukemia cell lines', 'Armeniacae semen', 'Caspase-3']",PMC6801328,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to the endothelium as a potential target for pharmacological intervention. Defibrotide (DF) is a drug with an endothelium-protective effect that has been approved for the treatment of veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Clinical data suggest that DF also reduces the incidence of aGVHD; however, the mechanisms of DF-mediated aGVHD regulation have not been examined. To investigate possible DF-mediated prophylactic and therapeutic mechanisms in aGVHD, we performed in vitro studies using endothelial cell (EC) lines. We found that DF significantly and dose-dependently suppressed EC proliferation and notably reduced their ability to form vascular tubes in Matrigel. To explore whether DF administered prophylactically or therapeutically has a significant effect on aGVHD endothelial dysfunction, ECs were exposed to media containing sera from patients with aGVHD (n = 22) in the absence or presence of DF and from patients that did not develop aGVHD (n = 13). ECs upregulated adhesion molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1), the adherence junction protein VE-cadherin, von Willebrand factor (VWF), and Akt phosphorylation in response to aGVHD sera. These responses were suppressed upon treatment with DF. In summary, DF inhibits vascular angiogenesis and endothelial activation induced by sera from aGVHD patients. Our results support the view that DF has notable positive effects on endothelial biology during aGVHD.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Martinez-Sanchez, Hamelmann, Palomo, Mir, Moreno-Castano,', 'Torramade, Rovira, Escolar, Cordes, Kalupa, Mertlitz, Riesner, Carreras, Penack', 'and Diaz-Ricart.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute GVHD', '*angiogenesis', '*defibrotide', '*endothelial dysfunction', '*hematopoietic cell transplantation']",PMC6794443,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 24.,"The bone marrow (BM) niche impacts the progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by favoring the chemoresistance of AML cells. Intimate interactions between leukemic cells and BM mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) play key roles in this process. Direct intercellular communications between hematopoietic cells and BM-MSCs involve connexins, components of gap junctions. We postulated that blocking gap junction assembly could modify cell-cell interactions in the leukemic niche and consequently the chemoresistance. The comparison of BM-MSCs from AML patients and healthy donors revealed a specific profile of connexins in BM-MSCs of the leukemic niche and the effects of carbenoxolone (CBX), a gap junction disruptor, were evaluated on AML cells. CBX presents an antileukemic effect without affecting normal BM-CD34(+) progenitor cells. The proapoptotic effect of CBX on AML cells is in line with the extinction of energy metabolism. CBX acts synergistically with cytarabine (Ara-C) in vitro and in vivo. Coculture experiments of AML cells with BM-MSCs revealed that CBX neutralizes the protective effect of the niche against the Ara-C-induced apoptosis of leukemic cells.

Epub 2019 Oct 24.,"Metabolic reprogramming of leukemia cells is important for survival, proliferation, and drug resistance under conditions of metabolic stress in the bone marrow. Deregulation of cellular metabolism, leading to development of leukemia, occurs through abnormally high expression of transcription factors such as MYC and Ecotropic Virus Integration site 1 protein homolog (EVI1). Overexpression of EVI1 in adults and children with mixed lineage leukemia-rearrangement acute myeloid leukemia (MLL-r AML) has a very poor prognosis. To identify a metabolic inhibitor for EVI1-induced metabolic reprogramming in MLL-r AML, we used an XFp extracellular flux analyzer to examine metabolic changes during leukemia development in mouse models of AML expressing MLL-AF9 and Evi1 (Evi1/MF9). Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in Evi1/MF9 AML cells accelerated prior to activation of glycolysis, with a higher dependency on glutamine as an energy source. Furthermore, EVI1 played a role in glycolysis as well as driving production of metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. L-asparaginase (L-asp) exacerbated growth inhibition induced by glutamine starvation and suppressed OXPHOS and proliferation of Evi1/MF9 both in vitro and in vivo; high sensitivity to L-asp was caused by low expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and L-asp-induced suppression of glutamine metabolism. In addition, samples from patients with EVI1(+)MF9 showed low ASNS expression, suggesting that it is a sensitive marker of L-asp treatment. Clarification of metabolic reprogramming in EVI1(+) leukemia cells may aid development of treatments for EVI1(+)MF9 refractory leukemia.",['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,PMC7395283,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 28.,"INTRODUCTION: Venetoclax is a highly effective agent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Phase I/II clinical trials have shown it to be safe and effective in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Adverse events were consistent with package labeling despite escalation to high doses. To the best of our knowledge, venetoclax use outside the setting of a clinical trial of NHL has not been reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of 34 adult patients who had been treated off-label with venetoclax-containing regimens from 2016 to 2018. RESULTS: Of the 34 patients with NHL treated with venetoclax therapy, 13 had had high-grade B-cell lymphoma/diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 10 mantle cell lymphoma, 5 transformed follicular lymphoma, 2 Richter transformation, 2 marginal zone lymphoma, 1 follicular lymphoma, and 1 post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. The patients had received a median of 4 previous therapies. The overall response rate was 26% (3% with a complete response and 35% with stable disease). The median venetoclax dose achieved was 400 mg. Of those receiving combination therapy, 18% had undergone radiation and 62% had received other systemic antineoplastic therapy. The median progression-free and overall survival for the cohort was 2 and 4.5 months, respectively. Adverse events occurred in 76% of the patients during venetoclax therapy. The adverse events included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, tumor lysis syndrome, infection, neutropenic fever, diarrhea, and 1 opportunistic infection. CONCLUSION: Venetoclax therapy in a real-world cohort offered modest benefits in heavily pretreated patients. Adverse events were observed at a greater incidence than in the clinical trials. A wide heterogeneity of venetoclax dose escalation, multiagent combinations, and timing of initiation were identified and require investigation in subsequent clinical trials.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Oct 21.,"BACKGROUND: Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a human retrovirus that causes a lifelong infection. Several diseases, including an aggressive form of leukaemia, have been designated as associated with HTLV-1, whereby having HTLV-1 is a necessary condition for diagnosis. Beyond these diseases, there is uncertainty about other health effects of HTLV-1. We aimed to synthesise evidence from epidemiological studies on associations between health outcomes and HTLV-1. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, and Global Health for publications from their inception to July, 2018. We included cohort, case-control, and controlled cross-sectional studies that compared mortality or morbidity between people with and without HTLV-1. We excluded studies of psychiatric conditions, of symptoms or clinical findings only, of people who had undergone blood transfusion or organ transplant, and of population groups defined by a behavioural characteristic putting them at increased risk of co-infection with another virus. We extracted the risk estimates (relative risks [RRs] or odds ratios [ORs]) that reflected the greatest degree of control for potential confounders. We did a random-effects meta-analysis for groups of effect estimates where case ascertainment methods, age groups, and confounders were similar, presenting pooled estimates with 95% CIs and prediction intervals. FINDINGS: Of the 3318 identified studies, 39 met the inclusion criteria, examining 42 clinical conditions between them. The adjusted risk of death due to any cause was higher in people with HTLV-1 when compared with HTLV-1-negative counterparts (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.37-1.80). From meta-analysis, HTLV-1 was associated with increased odds of seborrheic dermatitis (OR 3.95, 95% CI 1.99-7.81), Sjogren's syndrome (3.25, 1.85-5.70), and, inversely, with lower relative risk of gastric cancer (RR 0.45, 0.28-0.71). There were a further 14 diseases with significant associations or substantially elevated risk with HTLV-1 from single studies (eczema [children]; bronchiectasis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis [analysed together]; asthma [males]; fibromyalgia; rheumatoid arthritis; arthritis; tuberculosis; kidney and bladder infections; dermatophytosis; community acquired pneumonia; strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome; liver cancer; lymphoma other than adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma; and cervical cancer). INTERPRETATION: There is a broad range of diseases studied in association with HTLV-1. However, the elevated risk for death among people with HTLV-1 is not explained by available studies of morbidity. Many of the diseases shown to be associated with HTLV-1 are not fatal, and those that are (eg, leukaemia) occur too rarely to account for the observed mortality effect. There are substantial research gaps in relation to HTLV-1 and cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and metabolic disease. The burden of disease associated with the virus might be broader than generally recognised. FUNDING: Commonwealth Department of Health, Australia.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 Oct 24.,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis, the most common neoplastic disease of cattle, which is closely related to human T-cell leukemia viruses. BLV has spread worldwide and causes a serious problem for the cattle industry. The cellular receptor specifically binds with viral envelope glycoprotein (Env), and this attachment mediates cell fusion to lead virus entry. BLV Env reportedly binds to cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1)/solute carrier family 7 member 1 (SLC7A1), but whether the CAT1/SLC7A1 is an actual receptor for BLV remains unknown. Here, we showed that CAT1 functioned as an infection receptor, interacting with BLV particles. Cells expressing undetectable CAT1 levels were resistant to BLV infection but became highly susceptible upon CAT1 overexpression. CAT1 exhibited specific binding to BLV particles on the cell surface and colocalized with the Env in endomembrane compartments and membrane. Knockdown of CAT1 in permissive cells significantly reduced binding to BLV particles and BLV infection. Expression of CAT1 from various species demonstrated no species specificity for BLV infection, implicating CAT1 as a functional BLV receptor responsible for its broad host range. These findings provide insights for BLV infection and for developing new strategies for treating BLV and preventing its spread.-Bai, L., Sato, H., Kubo, Y., Wada, S., Aida, Y.

Here, we offer new evidence that ORP4L interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the IP3 receptor type 1 (ITPR1) in Jurkat T cells. ORP4L enables IP3 binding to ITPR1; a truncated construct that lacks the ITPR1-binding region retains the ability to increase IP3 production but fails to mediate IP3 and ITPR1 binding. In association with this ability of ORP4L, it enhances Ca(2+) release from the ER and subsequent cytosolic and mitochondrial parallel Ca(2+) spike oscillations that stimulate mitochondrial energetics and thus maintains cell survival. These data support a novel model in which ORP4L is a cofactor of ITPR1, which increases ITPR1 sensitivity to IP3 and enables ER Ca(2+) release.-Cao, X., Chen, J., Li, D., Xie, P., Xu, M., Lin, W., Li, S., Pan, G., Tang, Y., Xu, J., Olkkonen, V.

Epub 2019 Oct 24.,"Over the past decades, studies of phytochemicals as modifiers of radiotherapeutic efficacy have become increasingly popular to improve the treatment outcome of human malignancies. In the current comprehensive review article, radiosensitizing effects of curcumin, a yellow-colored polyphenolic constituent of turmeric, in various preclinical cancer models, both In Vitro and In Vivo, are presented. Attenuation of radioadaptation and augmentation of irradiation-induced cancer cell killing are achieved through multifaceted action of curcumin on suppression of prosurvival and antiapoptotic factors. Most importantly, curcumin can block radiation-triggered NF-kappaB signaling pathway and downregulate downstream effector proteins, thereby conferring potentiation of radioresponses. Based on the elucidated molecular mechanisms but also due to its safety profile and low cost, curcumin might be considered a promising adjuvant agent to enhance radiotherapeutic efficacy in the treatment of various cancer types formed in different human organ systems. Further efforts to translate the current preclinical knowledge to the real application of curcumin in combinatorial radiotherapeutic strategies in clinical settings are necessary.AbbreviationsAKTprotein kinase BARMSalveolar rhabdomyosarcomaATMataxia telangiectasia mutatedBaxBcl-2-associated X proteinBcl-2B-cell lymphoma 2CDC2cyclin-dependent kinase 2Bcl-xLB-cell lymphoma-extra largec-FLIPcellular FLICE-like inhibitory proteinCDDPcisplatinCOX-2cyclooxygenase-2cyt ccytochrome cDNA-PKcsDNA-dependent protein kinaseEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorEMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseESEwing`s sarcomaETS2erythroblastosis virus transcription factor 2GBMglioblastoma multiformeHCChepatocellular carcinomaHNSCChead and neck squamous cell carcinomaIAPinhibitor of apoptosis proteinIkappaBalphainhibitor of kappaB alphaIKKinhibitor of kappaB kinaseIRionizing radiationlncRNAlong non-coding RNAlucluciferaseMcl-1myeloid cell leukemia-1MDR1multidrug resistance protein 1miRmicroRNAMMP-9matrix metalloproteinase-9mTORmammalian target of rapamycinNBneuroblastomaNF-kappaBnuclear factor-kappaBNPCnasopharyngeal carcinomaNSCLCnon-small cell lung cancerOSCCoral squamous cell carcinomaPARPpoly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerasepH2AXphosphorylated histone 2AX-immunoreactivePI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasePrp4KPre-mRNA processing factor 4 kinaseRCCrenal cell carcinomaROSreactive oxygen speciesSCCsquamous cell carcinomaSLNsolid lipid nanoparticleSOD2superoxide dismutase 2TERTtelomerase reverse transcriptaseTNF-alphatumor necrosis factor-alphaTxnRd1thioredoxin reductase-1VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorXIAPX-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteinDeltaPsimmitochondrial membrane potential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data Sources: A literature search of PubMed (1966 to September 2019) was conducted using the keywords mogamulizumab, KW-0761, and lymphoma. Data were also obtained from package inserts and meeting abstracts. Study Selection and Data Extraction: All relevant published articles, package inserts, and unpublished meeting abstracts on mogamulizumab for the treatment of T-cell lymphomas were reviewed. Data Synthesis: Mogamulizumab is an anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) monoclonal antibody that has demonstrated activity in various T-cell lymphomas. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sezary syndrome (SS) who have been treated with at least 1 prior line of therapy. Mogamulizumab demonstrated significant improvement in progression-free survival compared with vorinostat in patients with relapsed or refractory MF or SS. Serious adverse events associated with mogamulizumab include infusion-related reactions, cutaneous drug eruption, and autoimmune complications. Mogamulizumab administration in the preallogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant setting can increase the risk for severe posttransplant graft-versus-host disease. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Mogamulizumab is a first-in-class CCR4 inhibitor, providing a new option in the treatment of relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Although not currently FDA approved for this indication, mogamulizumab may have some utility for the treatment of relapsed adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.

Epub 2019 Oct 25.,"The Human T-Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) affects up to 10 million people worldwide. It is directly associated to one of the most aggressive T cell malignancies: Adult T Cell Leukemia-Lymphoma (ATLL) and a progressive neurological disorder, Tropical Spastic Paraparesis/ HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy (TSP/HAM). Also, infected patients tend to have more severe forms of infectious diseases such as Strongyloidiasis and Tuberculosis. HTLV spreads through parenteral, sexual, and vertical (mother-to-child) routes. Effective viral transmission is produced mainly by cell to cell mechanism, unlike other retroviruses such as HIV, which usually spread infecting cells in a cell-free form. HTLV also has a peculiar distribution, with clusters of high endemicity in nearby areas of very low prevalence or absence of the virus. This could be explained by factors including a possible founder effect, the predominance of mother to child transmission and the cell-to-cell trans-mission mechanisms. More data on viral epidemiology are needed in order to develop strategies in endemic areas aimed at reducing viral dissemination. In this review, we critically analyze HTLV-1 pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, associated diseases, preventive strategies, and treatments, with emphasis to the emerging risk for Europe and particularly Spain, focusing on prevention methods to avoid viral transmission and associated diseases.","['(c)The Author 2019.

Methods: Microarray analysis was used to screen differentially expressed microRNAs and mRNAs in human AML cells. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qRCR) was used to detect the expressions of miR-23a-3p and SMCA in human AML cell line U937. TargetScan database was used to analyze the correlation between miR-23a-3p and SMC1A. Double luciferase reporter gene was used to detect the interaction between miR-23a-3p and SMC1A. The effect of miR-23a-3p expression on the proliferation of U937 cells was detected by clonal assay. The migration, apoptosis, cell cycle and caspase-3 activity of U937 cells regulated by miR-23a-3p were detected by cell scratch assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of Bax and Bcl-2 in U937 cells. Results: Compared with human normal monocyte SC group (1.00), the expression of miR-23a-3p in U937 cells was up-regulated (2.56+/-0.78) (P<0.01), while the expression of SMC1A was down-regulated (0.48+/-0.56, P<0.01). miR-23a-3p specifically bond to SMC1A 3'UTR and regulated the expression activity of SMC1A. Overexpression of miR-23a-3p promoted the proliferation and migration of U937 cells and inhibited the apoptosis of U937 cells, while up-regulation of SMC1A inhibited the proliferation and migration of U937 cells and promoted the apoptosis of U937 cells.

The difference was statistically significant (all P<0.05). The proportions of G(0)/G(1) phase, G(2)/M phase and S phase cells in the group of miR-23a-3p mimics+ pcDNA3.1-SMC1A were (36.88+/-0.21)%, (30.44+/-0.33)% and (32.88+/-0.16)%, respectively, without significant difference when compared with those of the miR-23a-3p mimics group (P>0.05). The relative expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 protein in the negative control group were 0.55+/-0.45 and 0.31+/-0.54, respectively. Overexpression of miR-23a-3p inhibited the expression of Bax protein in U937 cells (0.23+/-0.13, P<0.001), promoted the expression of Bcl-2 protein (0.50+/-0.23, P<0.01), while SMC1A increased the expression of Bax protein in U937 cells (0.40+/-0.11, P<0.01), and inhibited the expression of Bcl-2 protein (0.37+/-0.15).

The spleen was enlarged to 16 cm below the ribs, the neck lymph nodes was rapidly enlarged, and the superior vena cava syndrome appeared, which were mainly attributed to venetoclax resistance; so BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib) was used continuously after venetoclax discontinuation. Partial remission (PR) was achieved without lymphocytosis after 2 months, then ibrutinib was combined with CAR-T cells targeting CD19 antigen.

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) is detectable during homeostasis and increases in hypoplasia due to genetic defects or treatment with cytoreductive agents. Conversely, Flt3+ AML is associated with depletion of Flt3L to undetectable levels. After induction chemotherapy, Flt3L is restored in patients entering complete remission (CR) but remains depressed in those with refractory disease. Weekly sampling reveals marked differences in the kinetics of Flt3L response during the first 6 weeks of treatment, proportionate to the clearance of blasts and cellularity of the bone marrow. In the UK NCRI AML17 trial, Flt3L was measured at day 26 in a subgroup of 140 patients with Flt3 mutation randomized to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib or placebo. In these patients, attainment of CR was associated with higher Flt3L at day 26 (Mann-Whitney UP < .0001). Day 26 Flt3L was also associated with survival; Flt3L </=291 pg/mL was associated with inferior event-free survival (EFS), and Flt3L >1185 pg/mL was associated with higher overall survival (OS; P = .0119). The separation of EFS and OS curves increased when minimal residual disease (MRD) status was combined with Flt3L measurement, and Flt3L retained a near-significant association with survival after adjusting for MRD in a proportional hazards model. Serial measurement of Flt3L in patients who had received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for AML illustrates the potential value of monitoring Flt3L to identify relapse. Measurement of Flt3L is a noninvasive test with the potential to inform clinical decisions in patients with AML.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['C30484/A21025/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,PMC6849950,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, by releasing growth factors, they may enhance neoplastic proliferation. We hypothesize that platelet count correlates with platelet-dependent pathologies, even within the range of hemostatic competence. Because platelet production is promoted by thrombopoietin signaling through the myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (cMPL), a receptor expressed on megakaryocytes, we evaluated the feasibility of selective targeting of hepatic thrombopoietin production to test this hypothesis. We synthesized murine- and primate-specific antisense oligonucleotides (THPO-ASO) that silence hepatic thrombopoietin gene (THPO) expression without blocking extrahepatic THPO. Repeated doses of THPO-ASO were administered to mice and a baboon, causing a sustained 50% decline in plasma thrombopoietin levels and platelet count within 4 weeks in both species. To investigate whether reducing platelet count within the translationally relevant hemostatic range could alter a neoplastic process, we administered THPO-ASO to 6-week-old transgenic MMTV-PyMT mice that develop early ductal atypia that progresses into cMPL-negative fatal metastatic breast cancer within 2 to 3 months. THPO-ASO treatment increased the average time to euthanasia (primary humane endpoint) at 2 cm3 combined palpable tumor volume. Our results show that THPO-ASO reduced blood platelet count, plasma platelet factor 4, vascular endothelial growth factor, thrombopoietin levels, bone marrow megakaryocyte density, tumor growth rate, proliferation index, vascularization, platelet and macrophage content, and pulmonary metastases vs untreated controls. These findings confirm that sustained and moderate pharmacological platelet count reduction is feasible with THPO-ASO administration and can delay progression of certain platelet-dependent pathological processes within a safe hemostatic platelet count range.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['U01 CA224012/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC6849943,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, RS can also be observed in patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The objective of this study was to characterize RS in patients with AML. Clinically, RS-AML is enriched for ELN adverse risk (55%). In line with this finding, 35% of all cases had complex cytogenetic aberrancies, and TP53 was most recurrently mutated in this cohort (37%), followed by DNMT3A (26%), RUNX1 (25%), TET2 (20%), and ASXL1 (19%). In contrast to RS-MDS, the incidence of SF3B1 mutations was low (8%). Whole-exome sequencing and SNP array analysis on a subset of patients did not uncover a single genetic defect underlying the RS phenotype. Shared genetic defects between erythroblasts and total mononuclear cell fraction indicate common ancestry for the erythroid lineage and the myeloid blast cells in patients with RS-AML. RNA sequencing analysis on CD34+ AML cells revealed differential gene expression between RS-AML and non RS-AML cases, including genes involved in megakaryocyte and erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, several heme metabolism-related genes were found to be upregulated in RS- CD34+ AML cells, as was observed in SF3B1mut MDS. These results demonstrate that although the genetic background of RS-AML differs from that of RS-MDS, they have certain downstream effector pathways in common.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,PMC6849935,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A greater understanding of the implications of MEK inhibition on immune responses may lead to a greater understanding of immune evasion and more rational combinations with immunotherapies. This study describes the impact of trametinib on both T cells and AML blast cells by using an immunosuppressive mouse model of AML and primary patient samples. We also used a large AML database of functional drug screens to understand characteristics of trametinib-sensitive samples. In the mouse model, trametinib increased T-cell viability and restored T-cell proliferation. Importantly, we report greater proliferation in the CD8+CD44+ effector subpopulation and impaired activation of CD8+CD62L+ naive cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that trametinib-sensitive samples have an inflammatory gene expression profile, and we also observed increased programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on trametinib-sensitive samples.

Limited data are available on the prognostic value of MRD response after relapse. We evaluated the relationship between MRD response and outcomes in blinatumomab-treated adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell precursor ALL. Of 90 patients with complete remission (CR) or CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), 64 (71.1%) achieved a complete MRD response (no detectable individual rearrangements of immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor genes by polymerase chain reaction [PCR] at a minimum sensitivity level of 10-4). Eleven patients had MRD <10-4. Therefore, overall, 75 (83.3%) experienced an MRD response (no detectable MRD or detectable MRD) measured by PCR within the first 2 treatment cycles. Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were significantly longer in patients who achieved CR/CRh and MRD response (median, 20.6 and 9.0 months, respectively) compared with CR/CRh patients without MRD response (median, 12.5 and 2.3 months, respectively). In conclusion, longer durations of OS and RFS associated with MRD response support the value of achieving MRD response and its use as a prognostic factor for blinatumomab treatment in R/R ALL.

Relapse of disease after SCT represents failure of GVL and is now the major cause of treatment failure. We sought to augment GVL effects in patients (n = 29) relapsing after SCT in a prospective phase I/II clinical trial of dose-escalated pegylated interferon-2alpha (peg-IFNalpha). The administration of peg-IFNalpha after reinduction chemotherapy, with or without subsequent donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), resulted in a 2-year overall survival (OS) of 31% (95% confidence interval, 17.3%-49.2%), which rejects the null hypothesis of 7% generated by observations in an institutional historical cohort. As expected, peg-IFNalpha was associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and hematological toxicity, which was manageable with scheduled dose modifications. Progression-free survival (PFS) was greatest in patients who experienced GVHD, although the majority of those patients still eventually progressed. Higher PFS and OS were associated with pretreatment proportions of immune cell populations with regulatory function, including mucosal invariant T cells, regulatory T cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, independent of any association with GVHD. Peg-IFNalpha administration after relapse thus constitutes a logical strategy to invoke GVL effects and should be studied in a larger, multicenter cohort.

However, approximately 40% of patients with pediatric AML relapse, resulting in a relatively low overall survival rate of approximately 70%. The objective of this study was to reveal the comprehensive genetic background of pediatric AML. We performed transcriptome analysis (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]) in 139 of the 369 patients with de novo pediatric AML who were enrolled in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group AML-05 trial and investigated correlations between genetic aberrations and clinical information. Using RNA-seq, we identified 54 in-frame gene fusions and 1 RUNX1 out-of-frame fusion in 53 of 139 patients. Moreover, we found at least 258 gene fusions in 369 patients (70%) through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and RNA-seq. Five gene rearrangements were newly identified, namely, NPM1-CCDC28A, TRIP12-NPM1, MLLT10-DNAJC1, TBL1XR1-RARB, and RUNX1-FNBP1. In addition, we found rare gene rearrangements, namely, MYB-GATA1, NPM1-MLF1, ETV6-NCOA2, ETV6-MECOM, ETV6-CTNNB1, RUNX1-PRDM16, RUNX1-CBFA2T2, and RUNX1-CBFA2T3. Among the remaining 111 patients, KMT2A-PTD, biallelic CEBPA, and NPM1 gene mutations were found in 11, 23, and 17 patients, respectively. These mutations were completely mutually exclusive with any gene fusions. RNA-seq unmasked the complexity of gene rearrangements and mutations in pediatric AML. We identified potentially disease-causing alterations in nearly all patients with AML, including novel gene fusions. Our results indicated that a subset of patients with pediatric AML represent a distinct entity that may be discriminated from their adult counterparts. Based on these results, risk stratification should be reconsidered.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,PMC6849955,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic mutations in CMML are heterogeneous and only partially explain the variability in clinical outcomes. Recent data suggest that cardiovascular morbidity is increased in CMML and contributes to reduced survival. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), the presence of mutated blood cells in hematologically normal individuals, is a precursor of age-related myeloid neoplasms and associated with increased cardiovascular risk. To isolate CMML-specific alterations from those related to aging, we performed RNA sequencing and DNA methylation profiling on purified monocytes from CMML patients and from age-matched (old) and young healthy controls. We found that the transcriptional signature of CMML monocytes is highly proinflammatory, with upregulation of multiple inflammatory pathways, including tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-6 and -17 signaling, whereas age per se does not significantly contribute to this pattern. We observed no consistent correlations between aberrant gene expression and CpG island methylation, suggesting that proinflammatory signaling in CMML monocytes is governed by multiple and complex regulatory mechanisms. We propose that proinflammatory monocytes contribute to cardiovascular morbidity in CMML patients and promote progression by selection of mutated cell clones.

Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) variant curation expert panels are developing disease-associated gene specifications using the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) guidelines to reduce curation discrepancies. The ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel (MM-VCEP) was created collaboratively between the American Society of Hematology and ClinGen to perform gene- and disease-specific modifications for inherited myeloid malignancies. The MM-VCEP began optimizing ACMG/AMP rules for RUNX1 because many germline variants have been described in patients with familial platelet disorder with a predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia, characterized by thrombocytopenia, platelet functional/ultrastructural defects, and a predisposition to hematologic malignancies. The 28 ACMG/AMP codes were tailored for RUNX1 variants by modifying gene/disease specifications, incorporating strength adjustments of existing rules, or both. Key specifications included calculation of minor allele frequency thresholds, formulating a semi-quantitative approach to counting multiple independent variant occurrences, identifying functional domains and mutational hotspots, establishing functional assay thresholds, and characterizing phenotype-specific guidelines. Preliminary rules were tested by using a pilot set of 52 variants; among these, 50 were previously classified as benign/likely benign, pathogenic/likely pathogenic, variant of unknown significance (VUS), or conflicting interpretations (CONF) in ClinVar. The application of RUNX1-specific criteria resulted in a reduction in CONF and VUS variants by 33%, emphasizing the benefit of gene-specific criteria and sharing internal laboratory data.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['R01 CA229875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U41 HG009649/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U41 HG009650/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6849945,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(CLL), the most common adulthood leukemia in Western countries, is a very heterogeneous disease characterized by a peripheral accumulation of abnormal CD5+ B lymphocytes in the immune system. Despite new therapeutic developments, there remains an unmet medical need for CLL. Here, we demonstrate that the use of N-methylated thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)-derived peptides is an efficient way to kill the malignant CLL cells, including those from high-risk individuals with poor clinical prognosis, del11q, del17p, 2p gain, or complex karyotype. PKT16, our hit N-methylated peptide, triggers the elimination of the leukemic cells, sparing the nontumor cells, including the hematopoietic precursors, and reduces the in vivo tumor burden of a CLL-xenograft mice model. A complementary analysis underscores the improved cytotoxic efficiency of PKT16 compared with the previously described TSP-1-derived probes, such as PKHB1. PKT16 elicits an original caspase-independent programmed necrotic mode of cell death, different from necroptosis or ferroptosis, implicating an intracellular Ca2+ deregulation that provokes mitochondrial damage, cell cycle arrest, and the specific death of the malignant CLL cells. The activation of the Galphai proteins and the subsequent drop of cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels and protein kinase A activity regulate this cytotoxic cascade. Remarkably, PKT16 induces the molecular hallmarks of immunogenic cell death, as defined by the calreticulin plasma membrane exposure and the release of adenosine triphosphate and high-mobility group box 1 protein from the dying CLL cells. Thus, PKT16 appears to be able to stimulate an anticancer in vivo immune response. Collectively, our results pave the way toward the development of an efficient strategy against CLL.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,PMC6849937,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

of patients with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is mainly compromised by leukemia relapse, carrying dismal prognosis. As novel individualized therapeutic approaches are urgently needed, we performed whole-exome sequencing of leukemic blasts of 10 children with post-allo-SCT relapses with the aim of thoroughly characterizing the mutational landscape and identifying druggable mutations. We found that post-allo-SCT ALL relapses display highly diverse and mostly patient-individual genetic lesions. Moreover, mutational cluster analysis showed substantial clonal dynamics during leukemia progression from initial diagnosis to relapse after allo-SCT. Only very few alterations stayed constant over time. This dynamic clonality was exemplified by the detection of thiopurine resistance-mediating mutations in the nucleotidase NT5C2 in 3 patients' first relapses, which disappeared in the post-allo-SCT relapses on relief of selective pressure of maintenance chemotherapy. Moreover, we identified TP53 mutations in 4 of 10 patients after allo-SCT, reflecting acquired chemoresistance associated with selective pressure of prior antineoplastic treatment. Finally, in 9 of 10 children's post-allo-SCT relapse, we found alterations in genes for which targeted therapies with novel agents are readily available.

Venetoclax was available prior to approval off-label. We assessed our single-institution off-label experience with venetoclax/azacitidine, comparing outcomes with a clinical trial cohort that administered this regimen at the same institution. Thirty-three untreated AML patients unfit or unwilling to receive induction chemotherapy and prescribed venetoclax/azacitidine off-trial were retrospectively analyzed and compared with 33 patients who received the same therapy on trial. Outcomes were compared, and comparisons were made to a theoretical scenario in which off-trial patients received induction. Digital droplet polymerase chain reaction evaluated measurable residual disease (MRD). Off-trial venetoclax was attainable in nearly all patients for whom this was desired. The complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete blood count recovery rate was 63.3% for off-trial patients who received treatment and 84.9% for trial patients (P = .081). The median overall survival for off-trial patients who received treatment was 381 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 174, not reached) vs 880 days (95% CI, 384, not reached) for trial patients (P = .041). Prior exposure to hypomethylating agents was associated with worse outcomes. Response rates with venetoclax/azacitidine were not inferior to a theoretical scenario in which patients received induction, and early death rates were less than expected with induction. MRD negativity was achievable. Newly diagnosed AML patients treated in a ""real-world"" scenario with off-trial venetoclax/azacitidine had inferior outcomes compared with patients treated in the setting of a clinical trial.

Epub 2019 Oct 3.,"Recent studies examined the possibility to overcome imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients by combination therapy with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands. Pioglitazone, a full PPARgamma agonist, improved the survival of patients by the gradual elimination of the residual CML stem cell pool. To evaluate the importance of the pharmacological profile of PPARgamma agonists on the ability to circumvent resistance, the partial PPARgamma agonist 4'-((2-propyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)methyl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carboxylic acid, derived from telmisartan, and other related derivatives were investigated. The 4-substituted benzimidazole derivatives bearing a [1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carboxamide moiety sensitized K562-resistant cells to imatinib treatment. Especially the derivatives 18a-f, which did not activate PPARgamma to more than 40% at 10muM, retrieved the cytotoxicity of imatinib in these cells. The cell death modulating properties were higher than that of pioglitazone. It is of interest to note that all novel compounds were not cytotoxic neither on non-resistant nor on resistant cells. They exerted antitumor potency only in combination with imatinib.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

ITC derivatives were tested in clinical trials (NCT00005883, NCT01265953, NCT01790204) and preclinical studies aimed to inhibit tumor growth and modulation of their microenvironment. Although efficacy of ITCs was demonstrated with several leukemic cell lines, the final steps of BITC-induced apoptosis were not completely elucidated in the literature. Therefore, we focused on morphological and biochemical events occurring upon treatment of U937 leukemia cells with BITC. Micromolar concentrations of BITC induced cytotoxicity in U937 cells, with major features resembling the hallmarks of apoptosis: phosphatidylserine exposure, low mitochondrial membrane potential, and presence of PARP cleavage by caspases. Disassembly to apoptotic bodies, a final step of classic apoptosis, was not observed. While tracing the signalling pathways, our results showed increased levels of BAG-1 and PUMA proteins, but in contrast to other models of ITCs-induced apoptosis, downregulation of Mcl-1 protein was not noticed. Additionally, BITC-induced dying U937 cells released lower levels of chemoattractants, such as IL-8 and MCP-1, when compared to cells undergoing classical apoptosis. This may disrupt clearance of cell debris by macrophages in vivo (efferocytosis), and in turn affect the inflammatory response. In summary, BITC inhibits tumor growth which makes it a good candidate for supporting cancer treatment. However, atypical apoptosis of leukemic U937 cells induced with BITC may affect the ability of phagocytes to effectively scavenge cellular debris, which poses a question of BITC effectiveness as a chemopreventive agent for leukemias.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 24.,"INTRODUCTION: Monocytosis is a frequent trigger for blood smear review in a routine hematology laboratory whereas chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is infrequent and arises mostly in elderly patients. In order to define the best workflow for monocytosis, we studied three diagnostic approaches: the classical morphology approach (blood smear review), the flow cytometry assay (quantification of monocyte subsets as described by Selimoglu-Buet et al in 2015), and the ""mono-dysplasia-score"" also referred to as ""Monoscore (as described by our team in 2018 using the structural parameters of the Sysmex XN analyzers). METHODS: Studying a multicentric cohort of 196 nonclonal monocytoses and CMML patients aged over 50 years, we compared the diagnostic performance of the three approaches alone and in combination to propose a diagnostic decision tree. RESULTS: In patients presenting with additional criteria for slide review to monocytosis (37% of our cohort), we propose to sequentially combine morphology, Monoscore, and flow cytometry. On the contrary, for patients with isolated monocytosis (63%), slide review is not mandatory and we suggest performing flow cytometry depending on the Monoscore value. Using the proposed algorithm, 98% of CMML patients would have been correctly identified, slide review rate drastically reduced, and flow cytometry would have been carried out in 44% of patients. CONCLUSION: We have shown that implementation of Monoscore is a useful input filter to significantly reduce slide reviews without losing sensitivity and that flow cytometry is a performant technique in the second step of the diagnostic workup of CMML.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

However, soon after their introduction into clinical practice, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) emerged as their main non-hematological and among dose-limiting adverse events. It is generally perceived that vinca alkaloids and the antiangiogenic agent thalidomide are more neurotoxic, compared to eribulin. The exposure to these chemotherapeutic agents is associated with an axonal, length-dependent, sensory polyneuropathy of mild to moderate severity, whereas it is considered that the peripheral nerve damage, unless severe, usually resolves soon after treatment discontinuation. Advanced age, high initial and prolonged dosing, coadministration of other neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and pre-existing neuropathy are the common risk factors. Pharmacogenetic biomarkers might be used to define patients at increased susceptibility of CIPN. Currently, there is no established therapy for CIPN prevention or treatment; symptomatic treatment for neuropathic pain and dose reduction or withdrawal in severe cases is considered, at the cost of reduced cancer therapeutic efficacy. This review critically examines the pathogenesis, epidemiology, risk factors (both clinical and pharmacogenetic), clinical phenotype and management of CIPN as a result of exposure to vinca alkaloids, thalidomide and its analogue lenalidomide as also eribulin.",['(c) 2019 Peripheral Nerve Society.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['assessment', 'eribulin', 'peripheral neurotoxicity', 'thalidomide', 'vinca alkaloids']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its prognostic value in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been established and MRD measured at the end of induction is increasingly used to guide further therapy. Although MRD detectable immediately before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is known to be associated with poor outcomes, it is unclear if or to what extent this differs with different types of conditioning. METHODS: In this retrospective registry study, we explored whether measurable residual disease (MRD) before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with different outcomes in recipients of myeloablative total body irradiation (TBI)-based versus chemotherapy-based conditioning. We analyzed outcomes of 2780 patients (median age 38 years, range 18-72) who underwent first HCT in complete remission between 2000 and 2017 using sibling or unrelated donors. RESULTS: In 1816 of patients, no disease was detectable, and in 964 patients, MRD was positive. Conditioning was TBI-based in 2122 (76%) transplants. In the whole cohort MRD positivity was a significant independent factor for lower overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS), and for higher relapse incidence (RI), with respective hazard ratios (HR, 95% confidence intervals) of 1.19 (1.02-1.39), 1.26 (1.1-1.44), and 1.51 (1.26-1.8). TBI was associated with a higher OS, LFS, and lower RI with HR of 0.75 (0.62-0.90), 0.70 (0.60-0.82), and 0.60 (0.49-0.74), respectively. No significant interaction was found between MRD status and conditioning. When investigating the impact of MRD separately in the TBI and chemotherapy-based conditioning cohorts by multivariate analysis, we found MRD positivity to be associated with lower OS and LFS and higher RI in the TBI group, and with higher RI in the chemotherapy group. TBI-based conditioning was associated with improved outcomes in both MRD-negative and MRD-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this large study, we confirmed that patients who are MRD-negative prior to HCT achieve superior outcomes. This is particularly apparent if TBI conditioning is used. All patients with ALL irrespective of MRD status benefit from TBI-based conditioning in the myeloablative setting.",,['DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Allogeneic', '*Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*Measurable residual disease', '*Myeloablative conditioning', '*Total body irradiation']",PMC6813121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to investigate the anticancer effects of esculetin against the human leukemia HL-60 cells. METHODS: CCK-8 assay was used to assess cell viability. DAPI and annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining was performed to investigate the induction of apoptosis. Autophagy was detected by electron microscopic analysis. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis and Western blotting was used to estimate protein expression. RESULTS: Esculetin suppressed the proliferation of HL-60 cells dose-dependently. The IC50 of esculetin against HL-60 cells was observed to be 20 microM. The anticancer effects of esculetin against HL-60 cells occurred though different mechanisms. Esculetin induced apoptosis and autophagy in leukemia cells, which were accompanied by alteration in the expression of apoptosis as well as autophagy-related proteins. Esculetin also triggered G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in HL-60 cells, which was also accompanied by suppression of Cyclin D1 and D3. Esculetin could also block the Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway in leukemia cells in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that esculetin inhibits the growth of leukemia cells and hence may prove beneficial for treating leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in TET2 have been identified in a number of haematological malignancies, including leukaemias and lymphomas. In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), loss of TET2 function drives DNA methylation and gene silencing, contributing to disease pathogenesis and progression, making it an interesting target. Although such mutations are considered rare, there is an increasing body in the literature identifying them as unfavourable prognostic markers in AML. The hypomethylating agent nucleoside analogue 5-azacytidine is used in the treatment of AML and other haematological malignancies i.e. myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It functions by re-activating silenced genes is responsible for cytosine methylation, thereby driving differentiation and also promoting apoptosis of dysfunctional haematological cells. The present review article deals with the consequences of DNA methylation in relation to TET2 in AML, focusing on the potential prognostic effect of TET2 gene mutations, along with demethylating epigenetic strategies towards prediction of therapeutic response. The necessity for personalized therapeutic regimes, especially for older patients suffering from AML with mutated TET2 and/or other genetic alterations, along with its prognostication are also underlined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression levels of miRNA-409-5p and NUP43 in peripheral blood of CML children and healthy controls were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry were conducted to evaluate the regulatory effect of miRNA-409-5p on proliferative potential and cell cycle progression of CML cells. Protein levels of PCNA, c-Myc, and cyclin D1 in CML were examined by Western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay verified the binding of target gene NUP43 to miRNA-409-5p. Finally, the potential effect of miRNA-409-5p on Imatinib resistance in CML was elucidated. RESULTS: Compared with healthy children, miRNA-409-5p expression in peripheral blood of CML children markedly decreased. Similarly, miRNA-409-5p expression was lower in CML cells. Contrary to the expression pattern of miRNA-409-5p, NUP43 was highly expressed in CML. The miRNA-409-5p overexpression remarkably inhibited proliferative potential and arrested cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase. Protein levels of PCNA, c-Myc, and cyclin D1 were downregulated in CML cells overexpressing miRNA-409-5p. The knockdown of miRNA-409-5p obtained the opposite trends. NUP43 was proved to be the target gene of miRNA-409-5p and negatively regulated by miRNA-409-5p. After overexpression of miRNA-409-5p, Imatinib treatment elevated proliferation inhibition and cell cycle arrest of K562 and KG-1a cells. CONCLUSIONS: MiRNA-409-5p is lowly expressed in child CML, which inhibits proliferative potential and cell cycle progression by upregulating NUP43 expression. In addition, miRNA-409-5p overexpression enhances Imatinib resistance in CML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CBA mouse model is used to study radiation leukaemogenesis mechanisms with Sfpi1/PU.1 deletion and point mutation already identified as driving events during AML development. To identify new pathways, we analysed 123 mouse radiation-induced AML (rAML) samples for the presence of mutations identified previously in human AML and found three genes to be mutated; Sfpi1 R235 (68%), Flt3-ITD (4%) and Kras G12 (3%), of which G12R was previously unreported. Importantly, a significant decrease in Sfpi1 gene expression is found almost exclusively in rAML samples without an Sfpi1 R235 mutation and is specifically associated with up-regulation of mir-1983 and mir-582-5p. Moreover, this down-regulation of Sfpi1 mRNA is negatively correlated with DNA methylation levels at specific CpG sites upstream of the Sfpi1 transcriptional start site. The down regulation of Sfpi1/PU.1 has also been reported in human AML cases revealing one common pathway of myeloid disruption between mouse and human AML where dysregulation of Sfpi1/PU.1 is a necessary step in AML development.",['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Early disease detection, fast results, point-of-care sensing, and cost are among the most prevalent issues that need further exploration in this field. Herein, studies are focused on overcoming these problems by developing an electrochemical device able to detect telomerase as a cancer biomarker. Electrochemical platforms and techniques are more appealing for cancer detection, offering lower costs than the established cancer detection methods, high sensitivity inherent to the technique, rapid signal processing, and their capacity of being miniaturized. Therefore, Au interdigital electrodes and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to detect telomerase activity in acute T cell leukemia. Different cancer cell concentrations were evaluated, and a detection limit of 1.9 x 10(5) cells/mL was obtained. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to characterize the telomerase substrate (TS) DNA probe self-assembled monolayer on gold electrode surfaces. Atomic force microscopy displayed three-dimensional images of the surface to establish a height difference of 9.0 nm between the bare electrode and TS-modified Au electrodes. The TS probe is rich in guanines, thus forming secondary structures known as G-quadruplex that can be triggered with a fluorescence probe. Confocal microscopy fluorescence images showed the formation of DNA G-quadruplex because of TS elongation by telomerase on the Au electrode surface. Moreover, electrodes exposed to telomerase containing 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (ddGTP) did not exhibit high fluorescence, as ddGTP is a telomerase inhibitor, thus making this device suitable for telomerase inhibitors capacity studies. The electrochemical method and Au microchip device may be developed as a biosensor for a point-of-care medical device.",['Copyright (c) 2019 American Chemical Society.'],,,,PMC6796945,['The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore hypothesized that addressing DOK1 may be useful for cancer immunotherapy. DOK1 mRNA and DOK1 protein expression were downregulated in tumor cells of gastric cancer patients (n = 249). Conversely, its expression was up-regulated in cases positive for Epstein Barr Virus (EBV+) together with genes related to macrophage biology and targets of clinical immunotherapy such as programmed-cell-death-ligand-1 (PD-L1). Notably, high DOK1 positivity in stroma cells conferred poor prognosis in patients and correlated with high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase in CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages. In macrophages derived from human monocytic leukemia cell lines, DOK1 (i) was inducible by agonists of the anti-diabetic transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), (ii) increased polarization towards an inflammatory phenotype, (iii) augmented nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and (iv) reduced PD-L1 expression. These properties empowered DOK1+ macrophages to decrease the viability of human gastric cancer cells in contact-dependent co-cultures. DOK1 also reduced PD-L1 expression in human primary blood monocytes. Our data propose that the drugability of DOK1 may be exploited to reprogram myeloid cells and enforce the innate immune response against EBV+ human gastric cancer.","['(c) 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*DOK1', '*Gastric cancer', '*PD-L1', '*PPAR', '*macrophage']",PMC6791443,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report a quick, simple and facile method of engineering human platelets to generate drug loaded platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) by top-down approach, which are biocompatible and naturally target leukemia cells. Drug loaded PMPs and cancer cell uptake were characterized by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis and fluorimetry. Effective drug delivery was tested in cancer cell lines as well as in clinical samples from leukemia patients. We explored that PMPs are capable of carrying multiple drug payloads, have long shelf life and can be harvested in large quantity in short period. Importantly, PMPs exhibited remarkably higher toxicity towards cancer cells than free drug and had lower escape into extravascular spaces. Transfer of drug to cancer cells of leukemia patients was significantly higher than free drug, when delivered through PMPs.

Acquired and inherent resistance to kinase inhibitors, however, is becoming an increasingly important challenge for the clinical success of such therapeutics, and often arises from mutations in the drug-binding domain of the target kinase. To identify possible causes of resistance to MEK inhibition, we generated a model of resistance by long-term treatment of AML cells with AZD6244 (selumetinib). Remarkably, resistance to MEK inhibition was due to acquired PTEN haploinsufficiency, rather than mutation of MEK. Resistance via this mechanism was confirmed using CRISPR/Cas9 technology targeting exon 5 of PTEN.

We aimed to explore the functions of RPPH1 in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The expression of RPPH1 was examined in blood samples of AML patients and human AML cell lines including THP-1 and HL-60. The microRNAs (miRNAs) targets of RPPH1 were predicted with online tools and validated with the dual luciferase reporter assay. The malignant behaviors of AML cells with lentivirus medicated knockdown of RPPH1 and/or administration of miR-330-5p inhibitor were assessed. Cell proliferation was determined by the CCK-8 and EdU incorporation methods, and cell invasion and migration were assayed with transwell experiments. The effects of RPPH1 knockdown on in vivo tumor growth were evaluated in nude mice with xenografted THP-1 cells. RPPH1 was expressed in the AML tissues and cell lines and its high expression predicted worse overall survival in AML patients. miR-330-5p was validated to be a direct target of RPPH1. Knockdown of RPPH1 suppressed the proliferation, invasion and migration ability of human AML cells, which was partially reversed by additional administration with miR-330-5p inhibitor. RPPH1 knockdown significantly inhibited the growth of xenografted THP-1 tumor in nude mice. Our work highlights the contributions of RPPH1 in promoting AML progression through targeting miR-330-5p, and suggests that the RPPH1/miR-330-5p axis is a potential target for AML treatments.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Lei et al.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['RPPH1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'long non-coding RNA', 'miR-330-5p']",PMC6806202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the incidence, genetic characteristics, and prognosis of leukemias with concurrent pathogenic FGs, which commonly reported in hematological malignancies in 8226 leukemia patients. A total of 25 patients with coexistence of double FGs were identified, accounting for 0.30% of all cases enrolled. More than half of the cases (14/25, 56%) were diagnosed as chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated or blast phase, another six and five cases were acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, respectively. Most cases (20/25, 80%) carried constitutively activated tyrosine kinases FGs (BCR-ABL1 or ETV6-PDGFRB) and transcription factors associated FGs simultaneously. Of the 11 patients with contemporaneous karyotype, 5 (45%) showed visible chromosomal abnormalities corresponding to both FGs. The concurrency of FGs was often associated with disease progressions. The prognosis was pessimistic for patients with concurrent FGs, even with the combination of targeted therapy and chemotherapy. Performing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as soon as possible after complete remission can ameliorate the dismal prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 23.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is ubiquitous in the adult population, is causally associated with human malignancies. Like many infectious agents, EBV has evolved strategies to block host cell death, including through expression of viral homologues of cellular BCL-2 pro-survival proteins (vBCL-2s), such as BHRF1. Small molecule inhibitors of the cellular pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins, termed 'BH3-mimetics', have entered clinical trials for blood cancers with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax already approved for treatment of therapy refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia in the elderly. The generation of BH3-mimetics that could specifically target vBCL-2 proteins may be an attractive therapeutic option for virus-associated cancers, since these drugs would be expected to only kill virally infected cells with only minimal side effects on normal healthy tissues. To achieve this, a better understanding of the contribution of vBCL-2 proteins to tumorigenesis and insights into their biochemical functions is needed. In the context of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), BHRF1 expression conferred strong resistance to diverse apoptotic stimuli. Furthermore, BHRF1 expression in mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells accelerated MYC-induced lymphoma development in a model of BL. BHRF1 interacts with the cellular pro-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, BIM, BID, PUMA and BAK, but its capability to inhibit apoptosis could not be mapped solely to one of these interactions, suggesting plasticity is a key feature of BHRF1. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a site in BHRF1 that was critical for its interaction with PUMA and blocking DNA-damage-induced apoptosis, identifying a potentially therapeutically targetable vulnerability in BHRF1.",,"['G0901755/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/N023781/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'C5575/A15032 /CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,PMC7206097,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy has limited effect, while allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) plus sorafenib maintenance is a promising protocol to improve their therapeutic outcome. However, the prognostic significance of FLT3-ITD mutant status remains controversial. To investigate this, we detected FLT3-ITD mutant ratio (high and low) and length (long and short) in enrolled 184 CN-AML patients without NPM1 mutation, and evaluated their impact on complete remission (CR), overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and relapse risk (RR) after chemotherapy or allo-HSCT plus sorafenib maintenance. Our studies showed that FLT3-ITD mutation had negative impact on chemotherapeutic response, OS and RFS in CN-AML patients. There was no significant difference in CR rate between high and low ratio, or long and short length. Increasing ITD mutant ratio and length were associated with decreasing OS, and long length had shorter RFS and higher RR than the short after chemotherapy. Allo-HSCT plus sorafenib maintenance was an effective strategy to improve RFS and decrease relapse probability in FLT3-ITD AML patients, and benefited to these regardless of mutant ratio, and those with long length instead of the short.",,"['81570152/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By fitting a Cox-LASSO regression model to the clinical outcome and gene-expression levels of LSC enriched genes in 163 pediatric participants of the AML02 multi-center clinical trial (NCT00136084), we developed a six-gene LSC score of prognostic value in pediatric AML (pLSC6). In the AML02 cohort, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of patients within low-pLSC6 group (n = 97) was 78.3 (95% CI = 70.5-86.9%) as compared with 34.5(95% CI = 24.7-48.2 %) in patients within high-pLSC6 group (n = 66 subjects), p < 0.00001. pLSC6 remained significantly associated with EFS and overall survival (OS) after adjusting for induction 1-MRD status, risk-group, FLT3-status, WBC-count at diagnosis and age. pLSC6 formula developed in the AML02 cohort was validated in the pediatric AML-TARGET project data (n = 205), confirming its prognostic value in both single-predictor and multiple-predictor Cox regression models. In both cohorts, pLSC6 predicted outcome of transplant patients, suggesting it as a useful criterion for transplant referrals.

Epub 2019 Oct 24.,"Thiopurines are widely used as antileukemia agents and immunosuppressants. Recent large-scale clinical studies revealed a strong association between the NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys (NUDT15(R139C)) polymorphism and severe thiopurine-induced leukocytopenia. We established knock-in mice harboring p.Arg138Cys (Nudt15(R138C)), which corresponds to the human polymorphism. A clinically relevant dose of mercaptopurine (MP) induced lethal cytopenia in Nudt15(R138C)-harboring mice. MP dose reduction attenuated the hematopoietic toxicity, phenocopying clinical observations and providing Nudt15 genotype-based tolerable doses of MP. High-dose MP induced acute damage to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in Nudt15(R138C/R138C) mice. A competitive transplantation assay revealed that not only Nudt15(R138C/R138C) HSPCs, but also Nudt15(+/R138C) HSPCs suffered stronger damage than Nudt15(+/+) HSPCs, even by lower-dose MP, after long-term administration. In a Nudt15 genotype-based posttransplantation leukemia recurrence model generated by bone marrow replacement with congenic wild-type cells and a small number of leukemia stem cells, MP prolonged the survival of mice with posttransplantation Nudt15(R138C/R138C) leukemia recurrence. In conclusion, our model will facilitate NUDT15 genotype-based precision medicine by providing safer estimates for MP dosing, and our findings highlighted the high susceptibility of hematopoietic stem cells to MP and suggested that exploiting thiopurine toxicity might be a novel treatment approach for leukemia in NUDT15(R139C)-harboring patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 23.,"The wingless and integration site growth factor-5a (Wnt5a) is a ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor-1 (ROR1). Because both Wnt5a and ROR1 are expressed in circulating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, and because in other cell types, STAT3, which is constitutively activated in CLL, induces Wnt5a signaling, we wondered whether STAT3 induces the expression of Wnt5a in CLL cells. Sequence analysis detected four putative STAT3 binding sites in close proximity to the Wnt5a gene promoter's start codon. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA revealed that STAT3 binds to the Wnt5a gene promoter, and a luciferase assay showed that STAT3 activates the Wnt5a gene. Additionally, transfection of peripheral blood CLL cells with STAT3 short hairpin RNA downregulated Wnt5a mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that STAT3 binds to the Wnt5a gene promoter and induces the expression of Wnt5a in CLL cells. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy determined that both Wnt5a and its receptor ROR1 are coexpressed on the surface of CLL cells, and Western immunoblotting showed an inverse correlation between Wnt5a and ROR1 protein levels, implying that, regardless of CLL cells' ROR1 levels, blocking the interaction between Wnt5a and ROR1 might be beneficial to patients with CLL. Indeed, transfection of CLL cells with Wnt5a small interfering RNA reduced Wnt5a mRNA and protein levels and significantly increased the spontaneous apoptotic rate of CLL cells. Taken together, our data unravel an autonomous STAT3-driven prosurvival circuit that provides circulating CLL cells with a microenvironment-independent survival advantage.","['Copyright (c) 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC6864283,,['NIHMS1540718'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present two cases of CMML and two cases of MDS with this challenging symptom. In two of them, the pruritus preceded the diagnosis of MDS/CMML by months. Various chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressive options were used with variable success. In one of the cases, the pruritus persisted despite achieving morphological remission of CMML with azacitidine but had a remarkable complete response to cladribine. The pathogenesis of intractable itching in CMML and MDS remains unclear but seems to be linked to the biology of these diseases and could precede definitive diagnostic features. Earlier diagnosis of these myeloid disorders may therefore be aided by increasing awareness among clinicians of the association with pruritus.","['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2019.

Epub 2019 Jun 28.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) increases with age. The overall prognosis remains poor for older patients. Studies on the efficacy of decitabine, an epigenetic agent, in older patients with AML have reported conflicting results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this meta-analysis, we performed a literature search and collected 38 studies (including 3298 patients with AML) to evaluate the role of decitabine in elderly patients with AML. We used complete response (CR) or overall response (OR) rate as indicators of effectiveness. RESULTS: Patients treated with decitabine have a higher CR/OR rate than those treated with low-dose cytarabine (CR, 2.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.64-4.14; OR, 4.88; 95% CI, 1.98-12.04) or CAG/HAG (low-dose epirubicin and cytarabine with granulocyte stimulating factor/low-dose homoharringtonine and cytarabine with granulocyte stimulating factor) regimens (CR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.98-3.23; OR, 2.89; 95% CI, 2.24-3.73). However, patients treated with decitabine had a CR rate equivalent to those treated with intensive chemotherapy (CR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.28-1.22; P = .15). Use of decitabine in combination with other regimens resulted in a higher CR/OR rate than did use of decitabine alone (P < .001); there was no significant difference in infection rates and early death rates (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The findings presented in this article show that decitabine is effective and safe for the treatment of older patients with AML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Sep 28.,"Multiple retrospective studies have demonstrated an association between cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and reduced risk of AML relapse. However, the potential mechanism explaining this association remains elusive. We investigated a homogeneous cohort of 288 adult patients with AML in remission who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) from matched sibling/unrelated donors between 1995 and 2011. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was greater in patients without CMV reactivation compared with those with reactivation (30.2% vs. 12.1%, p=0.001) in a landmark analysis. In multivariate analyses CMV reactivation was independently associated with reduced relapse risk (HR: 0.49 [0.25-0.95], p=0.036) and increased non-relapse mortality (26.5% vs. 13.1%, p=0.002) resulting in similar 5-year overall survival (64.5% vs. 59.1%, p=0.8). In further subgroup analyses the protective effect of CMV reactivation was significant in patients who received HCT from donors with KIR Bx compared to KIR AA (11.7% vs. 29.5%, p=0.01). Likewise, the protective effect of CMV reactivation was more significant when the donors had 2DS1 activating KIR (11.5% vs. 30.7%, p=0.05) compared with those without 2DS1 (14.3% vs. 27.5%, p=0.12). Our data independently confirmed the association between CMV reactivation and AML relapse, suggesting the involvement of donor KIR genotypes and NK cell-mediated graft-versus-leukemia effect.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 Sep 5.,"OBJECTIVE: Sepsis represents an acute life-threatening disorder resulting from a dysregulated host response. For patients who survive sepsis, there remains long-term consequences, including impaired inflammation, as a result of profound immunosuppression. The mechanisms involved in this long-lasting deficient immune response are poorly defined. Approach and Results: Sepsis was induced using the murine model of cecal ligation and puncture. Following a full recovery period from sepsis physiology, mice were subjected to our wound healing model and wound macrophages (CD11b+, CD3-, CD19-, Ly6G-) were sorted. Post-sepsis mice demonstrated impaired wound healing and decreased reepithelization in comparison to controls. Further, post-sepsis bone marrow-derived macrophages and wound macrophages exhibited decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines vital for wound repair (IL [interleukin]-1beta, IL-12, and IL-23). To evaluate if decreased inflammatory gene expression was secondary to epigenetic modification, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation on post-sepsis bone marrow-derived macrophages and wound macrophages. This demonstrated decreased expression of Mll1, an epigenetic enzyme, and impaired histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (activation mark) at NFkappaB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells)-binding sites on inflammatory gene promoters in bone marrow-derived macrophages and wound macrophages from postcecal ligation and puncture mice. Bone marrow transplantation studies demonstrated epigenetic modifications initiate in bone marrow progenitor/stem cells following sepsis resulting in lasting impairment in peripheral macrophage function. Importantly, human peripheral blood leukocytes from post-septic patients demonstrate a significant reduction in MLL1 compared with nonseptic controls.

Epub 2019 Oct 23.,"PURPOSE: Minimal residual disease (MRD) helps to accurately assess when children with late bone marrow relapses of B-cell precursor (BCP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) will benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). More detailed dissection of MRD response heterogeneity and the specific genetic aberrations could improve current practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MRD was assessed after induction treatment and at different times during relapse treatment until allo-HSCT (indicated in poor responders to induction; MRD >/= 10(-3)) for patients being treated for late BCP-ALL bone marrow relapses (n = 413; median follow-up, 9.4 years) in the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 trial/registry (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00114348). RESULTS: Patients with both good (MRD < 10(-3)) and poor responses to induction treatment reached excellent event-free survival (EFS; 72% v 65%) and overall survival (OS; 82% v 74%). Patients with MRD of 10(-2) or greater after induction had reduced EFS (56%), and their MRD persisted until allo-HSCT more frequently than it did in patients with MRD of 10(-3) or greater to less than 10(-2) (P = .037). Patients with 25% or more leukemic blasts after induction (early nonresponders) had the poorest prognosis (EFS, 22%). Interestingly, patients with MRD of 10(-3) or greater before allo-HSCT (late nonresponders) still had an EFS of 50% and OS of 63%, which in principle justifies allo-HSCT in these patients. From a panel of selected candidate genes, TP53 alterations (frequency, 8%) were the only genetic alteration with independent prognostic value in any MRD-based response subgroup. CONCLUSION: After induction treatment, MRD-based treatment stratification resulted in excellent survival in patients with late relapsed BCP-ALL. Prognosis could be further improved in very poor responders by intensifying treatment directly after induction. TP53 alterations can be defined as a novel genetic high-risk marker in all MRD response groups in late relapsed BCP-ALL. Here we identified early and late nonresponders to be considered as events in future trials.",,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00114348'],,,,,,['ALL-REZ BFM Trial Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 23.,"CONTEXT.-: In the 2016 update of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematopoietic neoplasms, BCR-ABL1-like B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL) is added as a new provisional entity that lacks the BCR-ABL1 translocation but shows a pattern of gene expression very similar to that seen in B-ALL with BCR-ABL1. OBJECTIVE.-: To review the kinase-activating alterations and the diagnostic approach for BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL. DATA SOURCES.-: We provide a comprehensive review of BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL based on recent literature and the 2016 update of the World Health Organization classification of hematopoietic neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS.-: Several types of kinase-activating alterations (fusions or mutations) are identified in BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL. The main categories are alterations in the ABL class family of genes, encompassing ABL1, ABL2, PDGFRB, PDGFRA (rare), and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) fusions, or the JAK2 class family of genes, encompassing alterations in JAK2, CRLF2, EPOR, and other genes in this pathway. These alterations determine the sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As a wide variety of genomic alterations are included in this category, the diagnosis of BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL is extremely complex. Stepwise algorithms and comprehensive unbiased testing are the 2 ways to approach the diagnosis of BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These agents are nucleoside analogues and are considered antimetabolites, interfering or competing with nucleoside triphosphates in the synthesis of DNA or RNA or both. The agents are analogues of adenine or guanine and generally have excellent activity against leukemias and lymphomas, perhaps because of their preferential uptake, activation and effects in lymphoid tissue. The thiopurines include mercaptopurine, azathiopurine and thioguanine, which are active against several forms of leukemia and are also used as immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of autoimmune conditions (Crohn disease, autoimmune hepatitis, lupus nephritis) and in regimens to prevent transplant rejection. All three agents are generally well tolerated and commonly used in cancer chemotherapy as well as autoimmune conditions. The other antineoplastic purine analogues are used almost exclusively for malignant conditions, typically leukemia or lymphomas. Fludarabine is the most commonly used of these purine analogues and is a first line agent in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Fludarabine also has profound immunosuppressive activity and is used in nonmyeloablative regimens in preparation for hematopoietic cell transplantation. Because of its immunosuppressive activity, fludarabine is associated with reactivation of viral infections, including hepatitis B. Cladribine and pentostatin are adenosine derivatives and are used predominantly for hairy cell leukemia. They have minimal hepatotoxic potential, at least at the doses that are used to treat hairy cell leukemia. Clofarabine is also an adenosine derivative and is used as therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, mostly in children who have failed previous therapies. Nelarabine is a guanine derivative and is used in T cell malignancies, usually after failure of prior therapies. Both of these agents are associated with high rates of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy, but are very rare causes of clinically apparent liver injury. Thus, all of the purine analogues have some degree of direct hepatotoxic potential. In the doses and regimens in current use, this hepatotoxicity is generally mild and manifested only by transient, mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations. For many of these agents, however, more clinically apparent liver injury has been described, particularly with mercaptopurine and azathioprine.

Protein kinases are ubiquitous intracellular and cell surface proteins that play critical roles in cell signaling pathways involved in metabolism, injury responses, adaption, growth and differentiation. They act by adding a phosphate group to a protein (phosphorylation), usually on a specific amino acid which often makes the protein or enzyme ""active"". The human genome has more than 500 protein kinases and they can be classified as (1) tyrosine, (2) serine-theonine or (3) nonspecific (both), based upon their amino acid specificity. Many protein kinases are cell surface receptors and act to initiate an intracellular pathway of activation, after the receptor is engaged by its ligand, typically a cytokine or growth factor. Inhibitors of these kinases are called protein kinase receptor inhibitors. Other kinases are intracellular and take part in cell signaling. These kinases can be targeted by ""non-receptor"" protein kinases. Finally, some kinase inhibitors have specificity for multiple kinases and are called ""multi-kinase inhibitors."" Protein kinases can be specifically involved in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation and mutations may lead to unregulated growth and proliferation that is typical of cancerous cells. These mutated protein kinases represent an attractive target for anticancer agents. The potent activity and lack of generalized toxicity of the kinase inhibitors relate to the specificity of antagonist for the mutated protein. In like manner, their toxicity often relates to off-target activity, either to the unmutated kinase or to closely related, normal kinases. The protein kinases can be categorized based upon the amino acid that they phosphorylate: either serine, threonine or tyrosine. The tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors were the initial and are perhaps the best characterized kinase inhibitors. The protein kinase inhibitors are relatively recently developed agents, all having been introduced since 2001. They are unique and represent a major advance in cancer chemotherapy, away from broadly cytotoxic agents and towards drugs that specifically target the molecular abnormalities of cancer cells. The initial tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for use in the United States was imatinib (Gleevec: 2001) which is used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has a mutated kinase receptor (BCR-ABL) that is created by the specific translocation that creates the Philadelphia chromosome. Imatinib is a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase.

They generally have limited but important uses, and often have significant hepatotoxicity. The antineoplastic agents are not easily classified. Historically, they are categorized as (1) alkylating agents, (2) antimetabolites, (3) natural products, (4) hormones and antagonists, and (5) miscellaneous. In recent years, however, the miscellaneous group has come to include some of the most important agents. Anticancer agents can also be classified by indication (lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, solid tumor), mechanism of action (such as alkylating agents, antibiotics, biological response modifiers, antiandrogens, topoisomerase inhibitors or protein kinase inhibitors), chemical structure (folic acid analog, platinum coordination complex, purine or pyrimidine analog, monoclonal antibody) or as cytotoxic or nonspecific vs noncytotoxic or targeted. The classification used in LiverTox represents a mixture of these systems, which generally follow those given in modern pharmacology textbooks. Almost all antineoplastic agents have some degree of hepatotoxicity, and the liver injury is usually due to direct, intrinsic toxicity. The typical manifestation is an elevation in liver enzymes or bilirubin during therapy that reverses rapidly with stopping treatment or dose modification. This type of hepatotoxicity is dose related and generally self-limiting, but can be severe, progressive and even fatal as can occur with sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or acute toxic hepatic injury. The antineoplastic agents often have a narrow toxic-therapeutic ratio, although the usual dose limiting toxicity is myelosuppression. Nevertheless, liver injury also can be dose limiting, which generally becomes clear in early dose finding studies. For this reason, many antineoplastic agents acquire a reputation for hepatotoxicity based upon premarketing studies, but are later found to be reasonably well tolerated and only rare causes of clinically significant liver injury when given in lower doses. Antineoplastic agents that are well known to cause significant direct hepatotoxicity when given in moderate to high doses (particularly when used in myeloablation before hematopoietic cell transplantation) include busulfan, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, cytarabine, fluorouracil, carboplatin and L-asparaginase. At lower doses, these agents are well tolerated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20191024,['20211007'],['National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases'],['LiverTox: Clinical and Research Information on Drug-Induced Liver Injury'],['2019/10/24 06:01'],,,,,,,

In this review, we provide an overview of the practical aspects of a chimeric antigen T cell receptor (CAR-T) program development and the steps necessary for its successful implementation. RECENT FINDINGS: CAR-T therapy is a complex process and poses significant challenges as institutions prepare to deliver this therapy as a standard of care for the eligible patients. It requires a rigorous infrastructure with specific clinical, administrative, and regulatory demands. Institutions that led the clinical trials for CAR-T have adopted various approaches to integrate commercial CAR-T products into their program.

We risk-stratified HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (AC) and indolent adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cases based on the CADM1(+) percentage, in which HTLV-1-infected clones are efficiently enriched. AC and indolent ATL cases were initially classified according to their CADM1(+) cell percentage. Follow-up clinical and flow cytometric data were obtained for 71 cases. In G1 (CADM1(+) </= 10%) and G2 (10% < CADM1(+) </= 25%) cases, no apparent clinical disease progression was observed. In G3 (25% < CADM1(+) </= 50%) cases, five out of nine (55.5%) cases progressed from AC to smoldering-type ATL. In G4 (50% < CADM1(+) ) cases, the cumulative incidence of receiving systemic chemotherapy at 3 years was 28.4%. Our results indicate that the percentage of the CD4(+) CADM1(+) population predicts clinical disease progression: G1 and G2 cases, including AC cases, are stable and considered to be at low risk; G3 cases, including advanced AC cases and smoldering-type ATL cases based on the Shimoyama criteria, are considered to have intermediate risk; and G4 cases, which are mainly indolent ATL cases, are unstable and at high risk of acute transformation.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Oct 22.,"Leukemic cancer stem cells (LSCs), aberrantly overexpressing CD45RA are among the major causes of relapse following chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and serve as a highly sensitive marker for predicting relapse occurrence following chemotherapy. The main purpose of current study was to develop a sensitive approach for detecting LSCs based on a conjugate of an anti-CD45 scFv and quantum dot. The variable light and heavy chain sequences of a recently developed anti-CD45RA monoclonal antibody were derived from hybridoma cells and PCR amplified to construct scFv. Following insertion of scFv gene into a pET32a-lic vector and expression in Escherichia coli and purification, the purified scFv, was conjugated with carbon dots (C dots) and used for the detection of CD45RA (+)cells while CD45RA-cells served as negative control. Subsequently, Functional activity of the conjugate was analyzed by flow cytometry and ICC to detect the cell surface antigen binding and detection ability. Based on results, purified CD45RA scFv conjugated C dots could specifically recognize CD45RA positive cells, but not any CD45RA negative ones. In conclusion, here we developed a low-cost but very efficient approach for detection of CD45RA positive cells including LSCs.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CD45RA', 'Carbon dots', 'Conjugation', 'Leukemic cancer stem cell', 'scFv']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloid sarcoma occurs most commonly in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and less with other hematological disorders. A 57-year-old female presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Radiological studies showed concentric bowel thickening in distal ileum that caused nearly total luminal compromise and signs of obstruction in proximal ileal bowel loops. She underwent laparotomic surgery and ileal resection was done. Diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma was made by histopathological examination of surgical specimens. Bone marrow biopsy was done to rule out systemic acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Results of bone marrow biopsy were within normal limits. Finally, the patient was diagnosed as de novo myeloid sarcoma. Although the histopathological examination makes a definitive diagnosis, imaging allows to locate the lesion, evaluate its complications, and guide for correct biopsy. Accurate diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma has important prognostic value as transformation to AML can happen without chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

History was remarkable only for a minor trauma 2 days before the onset of symptoms; the boy fell on his buttocks but was walking normally in the following days. No fever was reported. Pain was also present at night, with no response to oral ibuprofen.On physical examination, the patient refused to stand on his left leg, palpation of the left buttock evoked pain, and exorotation and abduction of the left hip were only moderately limited, without local signs of inflammation such as redness, swelling or skin warming. Blood tests showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (98 mm/hour, normal value <20 mm/hour) with normal C reactive protein (CRP) level (0.5 mg/dL, normal value <0.5 mg/dL). His white cell count was 12 110 x 10(9)/L, haemoglobin was 127 g/L and PLT was 430 x 10(9)/L. Creatine kinase values were within the normal range.An X-ray of the pelvis was unremarkable. An ultrasound of the left hip showed a 2 mm articular effusion.

Epub 2019 Oct 22.,"Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has led to an unprecedented understanding of gene expression and regulation in individual cells. Many scRNA-Seq approaches rely upon the template switching property of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV)-type reverse transcriptases. Template switching is believed to happen in a sequential process involving nontemplated addition of three protruding nucleotides (+CCC) to the 3'-end of the nascent cDNA, which can then anneal to the matching rGrGrG 3'-end of the template-switching oligo (TSO), allowing the reverse transcriptase (RT) to switch templates and continue copying the TSO sequence. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of template switching biases with respect to the RNA template, specifically of the role of the sequence and nature of its 5'-end (capped versus noncapped) in these biases. Our findings confirmed that the presence of a 5'-m(7)G cap enhances template switching efficiency. We also profiled the composition of the nontemplated addition in the absence of TSO and observed that the 5'-end of RNA template influences the terminal transferase activity of the RT. Furthermore, we found that designing new TSOs that pair with the most common nontemplated additions did little to improve template switching efficiency. Our results provide evidence suggesting that, in contrast to the current understanding of the template switching process, nontemplated addition and template switching are concurrent and competing processes.",['(c) 2019 Wulf et al.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA polymerase', '*RNA', '*deep sequencing', '*enzyme mechanism', '*molecular biology', '*non-templated addition', '*reverse transcriptase', '*reverse transcription', '*single-cell RNA sequencing', '*template switching']",PMC6885630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 22.,"A myriad of protein partners modulate the activity of the human DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), whose interactions with these other proteins are frequently altered during oncogenesis. We show here that the tumor suppressor p53 decreases DNMT3A activity by forming a heterotetramer complex with DNMT3A. Mutational and modeling experiments suggested that p53 interacts with the same region in DNMT3A as does the structurally characterized DNMT3L. We observed that the p53-mediated repression of DNMT3A activity is blocked by amino acid substitutions within this interface, but surprisingly, also by a distal DNMT3A residue, R882H. DNMT3A R882H occurs frequently in various cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, and our results suggest that the effects of R882H and other DNMT3A mutations may go beyond changes in DNMT3A methylation activity. To further understand the dynamics of how protein-protein interactions modulate DNMT3A activity, we determined that p53 has a greater affinity for DNMT3A than for DNMT3L and that p53 readily displaces DNMT3L from the DNMT3A:DNMT3L heterotetramer. Interestingly, this occurred even when the preformed DNMT3A:DNMT3L complex was actively methylating DNA. The frequently identified p53 substitutions (R248W and R273H), whereas able to regulate DNMT3A function when forming the DNMT3A:p53 heterotetramer, no longer displaced DNMT3L from the DNMT3A:DNMT3L heterotetramer. The results of our work highlight the complex interplay between DNMT3A, p53, and DNMT3L and how these interactions are further modulated by clinically derived mutations in each of the interacting partners.",['(c) 2019 Sandoval and Reich.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA demethylation', '*DNMT3A', '*allosteric regulation', '*epigenetics', '*nucleic acid enzymology', '*p53', '*protein-protein interaction']",PMC6885622,,,"['PDB/5YX2', 'PDB/3TS8', 'PDB/1KZY', 'PDB/5ECG', 'PDB/2QRV']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 13.,"We established that loss of miR-15a/16-1 genes on chromosome 13q14 is the most common alteration in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and that miR-15/16 are crucial negative regulator of BCL-2, an antiapoptotic gene overexpressed in most CLLs and in many other malignancies. We have also shown that miR-15/16 target ROR1, a cell surface receptor for Wnt5a which can enhance growth/survival of CLL cells. Interestingly, ROR1 is expressed by many cancers, but not by normal adult tissues. Moreover, Venetoclax, the anti-Bcl-2 drug, and Cirmtuzumab, the monoclonal antibody against ROR1, are synergistic in killing CLL cells. Since an additional miR-15/16 locus exists on chromosome 3q25 (miR-15b/16-2), we generated a knocked out mouse model to study its the role in cancer. We observed that the KO mice developed predominantly CLL. Thus, we generated a double knock out mouse model where both miR-15/16 loci were deleted. Surprisingly we observed that 77% of double KO mice developed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Based on these evidences, we anticipate that also AMLs with low miR-15/16 expression, overexpression of BCL2 and expression of ROR1, would show an excellent response to a combination therapy with Venetoclax and Cirmtuzumab, since both drugs target the same malignant cells that have lost miR-15/16.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

treatment of B-cell malignancy. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and infection are the most common adverse events during CAR T-cell therapy. Similar clinical presentation of concurrent CRS and infection makes it difficult to differentially diagnose and timely treat the condition. METHODS: We analyzed the features of infection events during the first 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion (CTI) in 109 patients from three clinical trials (ChiCTR-OPN-16008526, ChiCTR-OPC-16009113, ChiCTR-OPN-16009847). Based on the dynamic changes of interleukin (IL)-6 and ferritin, we proposed the ""double peaks of IL-6"" pattern as a feature of life-threatening infection during the first 30 days after CTI. Meanwhile, we screened candidate biomarkers from 70-biomarker panel to establish a prediction model for life-threatening infection. RESULTS: In this study, 19 patients (17.4%) experienced a total of 19 infection events during the first 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion. Eleven patients (10.1%) had grade 4-5 infection, which were all bacterial infection and predominantly sepsis (N = 9). ""Double peaks of IL-6"" appeared in 9 out of 11 patients with life-threatening infection. The prediction model of three-cytokines (IL-8, IL-1beta and interferon-gamma) could predict life-threatening infection with high sensitivity (training: 100.0%; validation: 100.0%) and specificity (training: 97.6%; validation: 82.8%).

Transformation of CMML to secondary AML (sAML) is one of the leading causes of death in CMML patients. Previously, we observed that transcription factor RUNX1 mutations (RUNX1-MT) coexisted with ASXL1-MT in CMML and at myeloid blast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. The contribution of RUNX1 mutations in the pathogenesis of myeloid transformation in ASXL1-mutated leukemia, however, remains unclear. METHODS: To evaluate the leukemogenic role of RUNX1-MT in ASXL1-mutated cells, we co-expressed RUNX1-MT (R135T) and ASXL1-MT (R693X) in different cell lines and performed immunoblot, co-immunoprecipitation, gene expression microarray, quantitative RT-PCR, cell proliferation, differentiation, and clonogenic assays for in vitro functional analyses. The in vivo effect was investigated using the C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model. RESULTS: Co-expression of two mutant genes increased myeloid stem cells in animal model, suggesting that cooperation of RUNX1 and ASXL1 mutations played a critical role in leukemia transformation. The expression of RUNX1 mutant in ASXL1-mutated myeloid cells augmented proliferation, blocked differentiation, and increased self-renewal activity. At 9 months post-BMT, mice harboring combined RUNX1 and ASXL1 mutations developed disease characterized by marked splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and leukocytosis with a shorter latency. Mice transduced with both ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations enhanced inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) expression in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow cells. Bone marrow samples from CMML showed that ID1 overexpressed in coexisted mutations of RUNX1 and ASXL1 compared to normal control and either RUNX1-MT or ASXL1-MT samples. Moreover, the RUNX1 mutant protein was more stable than WT and increased HIF1-alpha and its target ID1 gene expression in ASXL1 mutant cells. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated the biological and functional evidence for the critical role of RUNX1-MT in ASXL1-mutated leukemia in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ASXL1', '*HIF-1alpha', '*ID1', '*Myeloid transformation', '*RUNX1']",PMC6805634,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While reports of localized CMV infections in asymptomatic patients exist, disseminated CMV disease has not been described. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the first case of disseminated CMV infection in a 75-year-old male diagnosed with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia with massive bone marrow infiltration. Despite 6-cycle R-bendamustine chemotherapy resulted in a good partial response, the patient developed persistent fever and severe weight loss. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood revealed the presence of CMV-DNA, while the fundus oculi examination revealed bilateral CMV retinitis. Treatment with induction and maintenance drugs was complicated by neutropenia and deterioration of renal function with electrolyte imbalance. From an immunological standpoint, we observed a profound imbalances in phenotype and function of B- and T-cell subsets, with a high proportion of circulating total, activated CD69+ and CD80+ B-cells, a low gamma/delta T-cell frequency with a high proportion of CD69- and CD38-expressing cells, and hyperactivated/exhausted CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell phenotypes unable to face CMV challenge. CONCLUSIONS: We hereby describe a severe form of disseminated CMV disease after R-bendamustine treatment. Our observations strongly support the careful clinical monitoring of CMV reactivation/infection in oncologic patients undergoing this therapeutic regimen.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cells', 'Bendamustine', 'Disseminated CMV', 'Lymphoma', 'T-cells']",PMC6806551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drugs inhibiting B-cell-receptor (BCR)-associated kinases, including BTK inhibitors, act on B cells and on a wide spectrum of tissues and cells, including innate immunity cells. Thus, alterations in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) kinase function could lead to an impairment of innate immune cells functions and to an increased infectious risk in patients receiving BTK inhibitors. We analyzed in vivo neutrophils oxidative burst, neutrophils granules release and cytokine production in relapsed/refractory CLL patients treated over time with ibrutinib as single-agent. We observed a dramatic reduction of neutrophils oxidative burst, Fc gamma receptors (FcgammaRs)-mediated degranulation and IL-8 plasma levels already after the first forty-eight hours of therapy with ibrutinib. However, ibrutinib treatment did not alter the surface expression of CD11b nor cytokine and proteinases release not mediated by FcgammaRs engagement. After three weeks, oxidative burst was still impaired, while degranulation and IL-8 levels were restored. In a group of CLL patients who survived for more than three years, all processes triggered by FcgammaRs completely recovered except the release of neutrophil elastase (NE) and IL-8. In conclusion, during the initial phases of ibrutinib therapy, the reduction of IL-8, NE, myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels and oxidative burst negatively impacted on mechanisms involved in neutrophils microbicidal activity.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the incidence of comorbidities and drug utilization data remain unknown. When conducting trials to develop new drugs in rare disease such as HAM/TSP, historical control data obtained from registry studies would be useful, as cohorts in rare disease tend to be small. Long-term follow-up of patients with a chronic disease can also be challenging. In this study, we addressed the following two goals using registry data on patients (n = 486) enrolled in the Japanese HAM/TSP patient registry ""HAM-net"" from 2012 to 2016: 1) to clarify the epidemiological information of HAM/TSP such as the incidence of comorbidities and drug utilization and 2) to provide the real-world data on changes in lower limb motor dysfunction. RESULTS: In HAM-net-registered patients, common comorbidities were fractures, herpes zoster, and uveitis, with incidences of 55.5, 10.4, and 6.5, respectively, per 1000 person-years. Every year, oral steroid treatment was administered in 48.2-50.7% of the HAM-net-registered patients and interferon-alpha treatment was used in 2.6-3.5% of patients. The median dose of oral prednisolone was low at 5.0 mg/day. The incidence of fractures and herpes zoster tended to be higher in the steroid-treated group than in the untreated group (fractures: 61.0 vs. 48.3, herpes zoster: 12.7 vs. 8.8, per 1000 person-years). The analysis of chronological change in Osame motor disability score (OMDS) indicated that the mean change in OMDS was + 0.20 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.14-0.25] per year in the one-year observation group (n = 346) and + 0.57 (95% CI: 0.42-0.73) over four years in the four-year observation group (n = 148). Significant deterioration of OMDS was noted in all subgroups with varying steroid use status. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the incidence of comorbidities and drug utilization data in patients with HAM/TSP using registry data. Furthermore, this study provided real-world data on chronological changes in lower limb motor dysfunction in patients with HAM/TSP, indicating the utility of these data as historical controls.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HAM/TSP', '*HTLV-1', '*Historical control', '*Real-world data']",PMC6802124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Nov 1.,"The quantification of cellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) levels is important for studying pathologies, genome integrity, DNA repair, and the efficacy of pharmacological drug treatments. Current standard methods, such as enzymatic assays or high-performance liquid chromatography, are complicated, costly, and labor-intensive, and alternative techniques that simplify dNTP quantification would present very useful complementary approaches. Here, we present a dNTP assay based on isothermal rolling circle amplification (RCA) and rapid time-gated Forster resonance energy transfer (TG-FRET), which used a commercial clinical plate reader system. Despite the relatively simple assay format, limits of detection down to a few picomoles of and excellent specificity for each dNTP against the other dNTPs, rNTPs, and dUTP evidenced the strong performance of the assay. Direct applicability of RCA-FRET to applied nucleic acid research was demonstrated by quantifying all dNTPs in CEM-SS leukemia cells with and without hydroxyurea or auranofin treatment. Both pharmacological agents could reduce the dNTP production in a time- and dose-dependent manner. RCA-FRET provides simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific quantification of intracellular dNTPs and has the potential to become an advanced tool for both fundamental and applied dNTP research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of progestogens on the uterus remains to be elucidated. Here we examine the effect of excessive progestogen administration on embryo implantation focusing on the function of uterine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine that is induced by estrogen and essential for embryo attachment. Treatment of wild-type (WT) female mice with vehicle (control), LNG at the dose of 300 mug/kg/day and P4 at the dose of 10 mg/day from day 1 to day 4 of pregnancy was conducted. LNG-treated and P4-treated mice showed embryo attachment failure on day 5 of pregnancy (The rate of mice with embryo attachment sites [%MAS], 11% and 13%, respectively), while all the control mice had normal attachment sites. Uterine LIF expression was significantly reduced in LNG-treated and P4-treated mice on day 4 evening. Administration of recombinant LIF (rLIF) at the dose of 24 mug/day on day 4 significantly rescued embryo attachment failure in LNG-treated and P4-treated mice (%MAS, 80% and 75%, respectively). Estradiol (E2) administration also rescued embryo attachment failure in LNG-treated mice (%MAS, 83%). Furthermore, excess P4 treatment before implantation decreased decidual P4 receptor (PGR) expression and induced decidualization defect apart from LIF downregulation. These findings indicate that progestogens cause embryo attachment inhibition through downregulation of uterine LIF expression and compromised decidualization through downregulation of PGR independently of LIF reduction. This study may contribute to a better understanding of contraceptive action of progestogens.","['(c) Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

The intestinal amebiasis in patients with acute leukemia of novo, after the start of chemotherapy (CT) in the Hematology Service of the CMN 20 de Noviembre is 12%, even if patients show a negative baseline coprological test. Objective: To find out if the administration of tinidazole, in patients with acute leukemia and negative coprological test, at the beginning of the CT, decreases the incidence of amoebic colitis during the induction to remission. Method: Prospective and not comparative study. Patients with de novo diagnosis of acute leukemia who initiate induction and initial coprological CT. Tinidazole was indicated, 2 g/day for 5 days in the first week of CT started. They were monitored until the induction was concluded and hematopoietic recovery started. Results: 38 patients, 15 women and 23 men with a mean age of 44 years (16-72), with acute lymphoblastic leukemia 19, myeloblastic 16 and promyelocytic 3. Cases without and with intestinal amebiasis were 35 and 3, respectively. Patients with amebiasis only received tinidazole for 3 days and it was given 2 days after the CT started. Conclusion: Tinidazole, in patients with acute de novo leukemia who initiate induction CT, is effective in the prevention of intestinal amebiasis, during the induction stage, if administered at 2 g/day, for five days, starting on day 1 of the CT.",['Copyright: (c) 2019 Permanyer.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Amebiasis', 'Chemotherapy', 'Tinidazole']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 22.,"RAD51, is a key homologous recombination protein that repairs DNA damage and maintains gene diversity and stability. Previous studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of RAD51 is associated with chemotherapy resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy, and enhanced activity of DNA damage repair (DDR) systems contributes to resistance of adult Tcell leukemialymphoma (ATL) resistance to chemotherapy. Thus, targeting RAD51 is a potential strategy for the sensitization of ATL cells to chemotherapeutic drugs by inducing DNA damage. In general, cells can repair minor DNA damage through DDR; however, serious DNA damage may cause cell toxicity in cells which cannot be restored. In the present, down regulation of RAD51 by shRNA and imatinib sensitized Jurkat cells to etoposide by decreasing the activity of homologous recombination (HR). We found that the suppression of RAD51 by shRNA inhibited tumor cells proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of Jurkat cells after etoposide treatment. Importantly, downregulation of RAD51 by imatinib obviously increased the apoptosis of Jurkat cell after etoposide treatment. These results demonstrated that RAD51 may be of great value to as a novel target for the clinical treatment of adult Tcell leukemialymphoma (ATL), and it may improve the survival of leukemia patients.",,,,,PMC6859462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the gene mutation profile in this subtype of leukemia remains unclear. In addition, the clinical and prognostic effects of different mutant genes may be underestimated. In the present study, gene sequencing was conducted at diagnosis and relapse with nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) in 64 patients with newly diagnosed AEAML, and 44/64 (68.8%) patients were found to present with a median of 2 (110) recurrent mutations at diagnosis and 6/11 (54.5%) cases were found to present with genetic alterations at relapse. cKIT mutation was the most common in this cohort, with an incidence of 27/64 (42.2%) at diagnosis, followed by ASXL1 (n=10, 15.6%), MET (n=8, 12.5%), MLH1 (n=6, 9.4%), TET2 (n=5, 7.8%), and FBXW7, TP53 and DNMT3A (n=5, 7.8%). Survival analysis showed that cKIT (exon 8, 17) but not exon 10 adversely affected survival. In addition, ASXL1 and TP53 were poor impact factors for recurrencefree survival (RFS) (P<0.05), and ASXL1, MET, FBXW7 and TP53 had a negative impact on overall survival (OS) (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that cKIT (exon 8, 17) [RFS: hazard ratio (HR) 3.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.547.34, P=0.002; OS: HR 2.84, 95% CI 1.206.71, P=0.018] and ASXL1 mutations (RFS: HR 3.13, 95% CI 1.347.32, P=0.009; OS: HR 3.94, 95% CI 1.629.61, P=0.003) were independent adverse factors for survival. Further, comutation of these two genes showed even worse effect on disease outcome. Collectively, additional gene mutations play critical role in AEAML. CKIT and ASXL1 mutations are the two most common mutations in this subtype of leukemia. CKIT (exon 8, 17) but not exon 10, and also the ASXL1 mutation poorly affect the disease outcome of this disease.",,,,,PMC6826310,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay, Trypan blue exclusion assay, Annexin V/propidium iodide test, cell cycle analysis, Transwell migration and invasion assays, the fluorescence staining of betacatenin and Factin as well as reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed to achieve the research goal. Furthermore, the nature of the interaction between fisetin and arsenic trioxide in the K562 cells was analyzed according to the ChouTalalay medianeffect method. We found that low concentrations of fisetin had not only a negligible effect on the viability and apoptosis of the K562 cells, but also modulated the mRNA levels of selected metastaticrelated markers, accompanied by an increase in the migratory and invasive properties of these cancer cells. Although some markers of cell death were significantly elevated in response to fisetin treatment, these were counterbalanced through antiapoptotic and prosurvival signals. With decreasing concentrations of fisetin and arsenic trioxide, the antagonistic interactions between the 2 agents increased. On the whole, the findings of this study suggest that careful consideration should be taken when advising cancer patients to take fisetin as a dietary supplement and when considering fisetin as a potential candidate for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.

Epub 2019 Oct 14.,"Due to the discovery of their role in intracellular communications, exosomes, which carry information specific to the cell of origin, have garnered considerable attention in cancer research. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest the possibility of isolating different exosome subpopulations based on target antigens at the cell surface. Philadelphia chromosomepositive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative neoplasia characterized by the breakpoint cluster regionprotooncogene 1 tyrosineprotein kinase (BCRABL1) fusiongene, derived from the t (9;22) translocation. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) target BCRABL1 protein and induce major or deep molecular responses in the majority of patients. Despite the fact that several studies have demonstrated the persistence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow niche, even following treatment, TKIs prolong patient survival time and facilitate treatmentfree remission. These characteristics render CML a plausible model for investigating the feasibility of tumorderived exosome fraction enrichment. In the present study, patients in the chronic phase (CP) of CML were treated with TKIs, and the quantification of the BCRABL1 exosomal transcript was performed using digital PCR (dPCR). The possibility of tumorderived exosomes enrichment was confirmed, and for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the detection of the BCRABL1 transcript highlighted the presence of active leukemic cells in patients with CPCML. According to these findings, tumorderived exosomes may be considered a novel tool for the identification of active leukemic cells, and for the assessment of innovative monitoring focused on the biological functions of exosomes in CML.",,,,,PMC6844640,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 10.,"B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is important for the development and maturation of normal B-cells and plays a key role in B-cell malignancies. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a crucial terminal kinase enzyme in BCR signaling, has emerged as an attractive target and has been successfully applied in the treatment of hematological malignancies. Ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, has demonstrated marked efficacy and tolerability in treatment-naive, relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Ibrutinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CLL/SLL, MCL, marginal zone lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and by the China FDA for the treatment of CLL/SLL and MCL. Clinical trials of ibrutinib, as a single agent or combined with chemoimmunotherapy and other promising novel agents in the treatment of B-cell malignancy therapy, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, multiple myeloma, primary and secondary CNS lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-cell lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndrome, are ongoing (https://clinicaltrials.gov/). The aim of the present review was mainly to cover the clinical developments regarding the use of ibrutinib in the treatment of CLL/SLL, as well as its safety and toxicity profile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, to understand the effect of LIFR on pathogenesis of neural tube defects, we explored spatiotemporal expression of LIFR at different stages of fetal development in normal and neural tube defect embryos. Spina bifida aperta was induced with all-trans retinoic acid on embryonic day 10 in rats, and the spatiotemporal expression of LIFR was investigated in spina bifida aperta rats and healthy rats from embryonic day 11 to 17. Real time-polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay were used to examine mRNA and protein expression of LIFR in healthy control and neural tube defect embryos. Results of the animal experiment demonstrated that expression of LIFR protein and mRNA in the spinal cords of normal rat embryos increased with embryonic development. LIFR was significantly downregulated in the spinal cords of spina bifida aperta rats compared with healthy rats from embryonic days 11 to 17. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of LIFR in placenta and spinal cord in spina bifida aperta rat embryos was decreased compared with that in control embryos at embryonic day 15. Results from human embryo specimens showed that LIFR mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated in spinal cords of human fetuses with neural tube defects compared with normal controls at a gestational age of 24 to 33 weeks. The results were consistent with the down-regulation of LIFR in the animal experiments. Our study revealed spatiotemporal changes in expression of LIFR during embryonic neurulation. Thus, LIFR might play a specific role in neural tube development.

Epub 2019 Nov 29.,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid malignancy in children. Despite current aggressive treatment regimens, the prognosis for high-risk NB patients remains poor, with the survival of less than 40%. Amplification/stabilization of MYCN oncogene, in NB is associated with a high risk of recurrence. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics. The deregulated expression of microRNA (miR) is reported in NB; nonetheless, its effect on MYCN regulation is poorly understood. First, we identified that miR-15a-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-16-5p (hereafter miR-15a, miR-15b or miR-16) were down-regulated in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) with high MYCN expression. MiR targeting sequences on MYCN mRNA were predicted using online databases such as TargetScan and miR database. The R2 database, containing 105 NB patients, showed an inverse correlation between MYCN mRNA and deleted in lymphocytic leukemia (DLEU) 2, a host gene of miR-15. Moreover, overexpression of miR-15a, miR-15b or miR-16 significantly reduced the levels of MYCN mRNA and N-Myc protein. Conversely, inhibiting miR dramatically enhanced MYCN mRNA and N-Myc protein levels, as well as increasing mRNA half-life in NB cells. By performing immunoprecipitation assays of argonaute-2 (Ago2), a core component of the RNA-induced silencing complex, we showed that miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-16 interact with MYCN mRNA. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-16 bind with 3'UTR of MYCN mRNA, resulting in MYCN suppression. Moreover, induced expression of miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-16 significantly reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NB cells. Finally, transplanting miR-15a-, miR-15b- and miR-16-expressing NB cells into NSG mice repressed tumor formation and MYCN expression. These data suggest that miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-16 exert a tumor-suppressive function in NB by targeting MYCN. Therefore, these miRs could be considered as potential targets for NB treatment.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

We performed a prospective phase I/II multisite trial of clofarabine with 2 Gy total body irradiation as non-myeloablative conditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in adults with acute myeloid leukemia who were unfit for more intense regimens. Our main objective was to improve the 6-month relapse rate following non-myeloablative conditioning, while maintaining historic rates of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and engraftment. Forty-four patients, 53 to 74 (median: 69) years, were treated with clofarabine at 150 to 250 mg/m(2) , of whom 36 were treated at the maximum protocol-specified dose. One patient developed multifactorial acute kidney injury and another developed multiorgan failure, but no other grade 3 to 5 non-hematologic toxicities were observed. All patients fully engrafted. The 6-month relapse rate was 16% (95% CI, 5%-27%) among all patients and 14% (95% CI, 3%-26%) among high-risk patients treated at the maximum dose, meeting the pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint. Overall survival was 55% (95% CI, 40%-70%) and leukemia-free survival was 52% (95% CI, 37%-67%) at 2 years. Compared to a historical high-risk cohort treated with the combination of fludarabine at 90 mg/m(2) and 2 Gy TBI, protocol patients treated with the clofarabine-TBI regimen had lower rates of overall mortality (HR of 0.50, 95% CI, 0.28-0.91), disease progression or death (HR 0.48, 95% CI, 0.27-0.85), and morphologic relapse (HR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.69), and comparable NRM (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.36-2.00). The combination of clofarabine with TBI warrants further investigation in patients with high-risk AML.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['P01 CA078902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6904507,,['NIHMS1055849'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEC) can trans-differentiate into myofibroblasts to produce extracellular matrix proteins and contribute to renal fibrosis. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a cytokine upregulated in RTECs during renal fibrosis. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of CTGF transcription by megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1). Genetic deletion or pharmaceutical inhibition of MKL1 in mice mitigated renal fibrosis following the unilateral ureteral obstruction procedure. Notably, MKL1 deficiency in mice downregulated CTGF expression in the kidneys. Likewise, MKL1 knockdown or inhibition in RTEs blunted TGF-beta induced CTGF expression. Further, it was discovered that MKL1 bound directly to the CTGF promoter by interacting with SMAD3 to activate CTGF transcription. In addition, MKL1 mediated the interplay between p300 and WDR5 to regulate CTGF transcription. CTGF knockdown dampened TGF-beta induced pro-fibrogenic response in RTEs. MKL1 activity was reciprocally regulated by CTGF. In conclusion, we propose that targeting the MKL1-CTGF axis may generate novel therapeutic solutions against aberrant renal fibrogenesis.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*epigenetics', '*renal fibrosis', '*transcription factor', '*transcriptional regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: SFs were treated with GFX at different concentrations (0.009375%-0.3%), and their viability was detected by MTT method. The cell morphology was observed using light/transmission electron microscope. The plasma membrane permeability was measured by AO/EB double-staining. Then cell cycle, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) were analyzed by flow cytometry. DNA damage was analyzed by electrophoresis and immunostaining. ELISA was used to evaluate the caspase-3/-8/-9 activation. Finally, Western blotting was applied for detecting the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins. RESULTS: Morphological changes and reduced viability of GFX-treated SFs demonstrated that GFX above 0.009375% had cytotoxicity to SFs with dependence of concentration and time. GFX-treating cells also showed G1 phase arrest, increased membrane permeability, PS externalization and DNA damage, which indicated that GFX induced apoptosis of SFs. Additionally, GFX could activate the caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, induce MTP disruption, downregulate B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell leukemia-XL (Bcl-XL), and upregulate Bcl-2 assaciated X protein (Bax), Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad), Bcl-2 interacting domain (Bid) and cytoplasmic cytochrome C in SFs, suggesting that caspase-dependent extrinsic and intrinsic pathways were related to GFX-contributed apoptosis of SFs.

The underlying mechanisms of drug resistance are complicated and have not been fully understood. Here, we found that miR-199a-5p levels were significantly reduced in refractory/relapsed AML patients compared to those who achieved complete remission after chemotherapy. Consistently, miR-199a-5p was markedly decreased in Adriamycin-resistant AML K562/ADM cells in contrast with Adriamycin-sensitive K562 cells, and its decrement dramatically correlated with the chemoresistance of AML cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the basic and Adriamycin-induced autophagic activity in K562/ADM cells was higher than that in K562 cells. This inducible autophagy played a prosurvival role and contributed to the development of acquired drug resistance. Importantly, we investigated that miR-199a-5p could negatively regulate autophagy, at least in part, by inhibiting damage regulator autophagy modulator (DRAM1) expression at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. miR-199a-5p bound directly to the 3'-UTR of DRAM1 mRNA which was a functional target of miR-199a-5p. Indeed, downregulation of DRAM1 gene by siRNA in K562/ADM cells resulted in autophagy suppression and chemosensitivity restoration. These results revealed that the miR-199a-5p/DRAM1/autophagy signaling represented a novel pathway regulating chemoresistance, indicating a potential therapeutic strategy for the intervention in drug-resistant AML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Yang Li et al.'],,,,PMC6766143,['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There, high extracellular levels of nucleotides, mainly NAD(+) and ATP, are catabolized by different ectonucleotidases, which can be divided in two families according to substrate specificity: on one side those that metabolize NAD(+), including CD38, CD157, and CD203a; on the other, those that convert ATP, namely CD39 (and other ENTPDases) and CD73. They generate products that modulate intracellular calcium levels and that activate purinergic receptors. They can also converge on adenosine generation with profound effects, both on leukemic cells, enhancing chemoresistance and homing, and on non-malignant immune cells, polarizing them toward tolerance. This review will first provide an overview of ectonucleotidases expression within the immune system, in physiological and pathological conditions. We will then focus on different hematological malignancies, discussing their role as disease markers and possibly pathogenic agents.

The substantial risks and cost associated with this procedure render it unfeasible on a large scale. This strategy also indicates that a common pathway toward a cure for both HIV and cancer may exist. Successful approaches to curing both diseases should ideally possess three components, i.e., (1) direct targeting of pathological cells (neoplastic cells in cancer and the HIV-infected reservoir cells), (2) subsequent impediment to reconstitution of the pool of pathological cells and (3) sustained, immunologic control of the disease (both diseases are characterized by detrimental immune hyper-activation that hinders successful establishment of immunity). In this review, we explore medications that are either investigational or FDA-approved anticancer treatments that may be employed to achieve the goal of curing HIV-1. These include: thioredoxin reductase inhibitors (phases 1-3), immune checkpoint inhibitors (phases 1, 3), Jak inhibitors (FDA approved for arthritis and multiple cancer indications, summarized in Table 1). Of note, some of these medications such as arsenic trioxide and Jak inhibitors may also reversibly down regulate CCR5 expression on CD4(+) T-cells, thus escaping the ethical issues of inducing or transferring mutations in CCR5 that are presently the subject of interest as it relates to HIV-1 cure strategies.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Gavegnano, Savarino, Owanikoko and Marconi.']",['P30 AI050409/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV', '*apoptosis of HIV infected CD4 T cells', '*eradication', '*immunomodulator', '*inflammation', '*latent reservoir HIV infected CD4 T cells']",PMC6788429,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanistic explanations for why a low number of mutations suffice to induce leukemogenesis are therefore required. Here we demonstrate that transgenic overexpression of the wild type sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1P3) in murine hematopoietic stem cells is sufficient to induce a transplantable myeloid leukemia. In contrast, S1P3 expression in more mature compartments does not cause malignant transformation. Treatment with the sphingosine phosphate receptor modulator Fingolimod, which prevents receptor signaling, normalized peripheral blood cell counts and reduced spleen sizes in S1P3 expressing mice. Gene expression analyses in AML patients revealed elevated S1P3 expression specifically in two molecular subclasses. Our data suggest a previously unrecognized contribution of wild type S1P3 signaling to leukemogenesis that warrants the exploration of S1P3 antagonists in preclinical AML models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 21.,"PURPOSE: Induction chemotherapy results in complete remission (CR) rates of 20% to 50% among patients with poor-risk AML. Selinexor is an oral selective inhibitor of nuclear export with promising single-agent activity. By inhibiting the primary export protein, XPO1, selinexor localizes and activates tumor suppressor proteins in the nucleus and inhibits DNA damage repair, rationalizing combination with DNA-damaging agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-arm phase I clinical trial of selinexor combined with cytarabine and daunorubicin (7+3). Dose escalation was selinexor alone (3+3) with an expansion at the MTD. Cohorts 1 and 2 received 60 and 80 mg orally, respectively, twice weekly during induction. Consolidation cycles (</= 2) with selinexor at induction dose plus 5+2 were allowed for patients who achieved CR. MTD and recommended phase II dose of selinexor were the primary endpoints. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with poor-risk AML were enrolled. All 21 patients were included in the safety evaluations and survival analyses (4 in each of 2 cohorts; 13 in the expansion); 8 (53%) of the 19 patients evaluable for response achieved CR/CRi. MTD was not reached. Selinexor 80 mg (orally, twice weekly) was used in the expansion phase. The most common grade 3/4 nonhematologic treatment-emergent adverse events were febrile neutropenia (67%), diarrhea (29%), hyponatremia (29%), and sepsis (14%). At median follow-up (28.9 months), 38% of patients were alive. Median overall survival was 10.3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Selinexor plus 7+3 is a safe regimen for patients with newly diagnosed poor-risk AML and warrants further investigation in a larger clinical trial.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],['P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC7787346,,['NIHMS1653153'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 18.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the roles of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), inosine triphosphatase (ITPA), and Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) in 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) sensitivity during treatment of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). STUDY DESIGN: The study included 102 pediatric patients with ALL subject to the Nordic society Of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL-2000 and ALL-2008 protocols. Episodes of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, TPMT sequence variants, as well as 6-MP end doses, were collected retrospectively from medical records. TPMT, ITPA, and NUDT15 sequence variants were analyzed using pyrosequencing. RESULTS: TPMT variants were associated with a reduced risk of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia during the maintenance II period (P = .019 and P < .0001, respectively). In addition, a NUDT15 variant was associated with a lower end dose of 6-MP (P = .0097), but not with neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. ITPA variants were not associated with an increased risk of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, nor lower end dose of 6-MP. However, when analyzing the entire treatment period, ITPA variants were associated with a decreased risk of febrile neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: White blood cell count-based dose adjustments are regularly performed for known TPMT- deficient patients and results in a reduced risk of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Also in NUDT15-deficient patients dose adjustments are performed as indicated by low end dose of 6-MP. ITPA-deficient patients had a decreased risk of febrile neutropenia when analyzing the entire treatment period. Our data suggest that NUDT15 plays an important role in 6-MP treatment and the results should be confirmed in larger cohorts.

METHODS: Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received blinatumomab at the University of Maryland Marlene & Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center from March 1, 2015 to April 30, 2018 were included. The primary objective of this study was to identify the frequency and severity of blinatumomab toxicities that led to drug therapy modifications; secondary objectives were to identify the frequency and duration of modifications and the total dose and duration of therapy received. RESULTS: This study included 23 patients. Seventy-eight percent of patients experienced cytokine release syndrome and/or neurotoxicity. Eighteen drug therapy modifications occurred due to toxicity with a median interruption time of nine hours. Drug therapy was continued for the majority of grade 1 or 2 events and discontinued during grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity. The median number of days of therapy delivered was 28 days (range, 27-35). A median of 2 h (range, 0-16) of therapy or 0.2% (range, 0-2.4) of a total 28-day cycle was lost due to transition of care. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study demonstrates a single center experience with blinatumomab toxicity management and appropriate delivery of drug during transitions of care. Overall, these results support to the importance of institutional guidelines in place to facilitate safe and effective delivery of blinatumomab.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'blinatumomab', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'neurotoxicity', 'transitions of care']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some relation has been observed between Vitamin D insufficiency and poor outcome in ALL though evidence is limited. Methods: A prospective observational study was done including children (1-15 years) with newly diagnosed ALL. Vitamin D estimation was performed at baseline and at end of induction chemotherapy. Results: Ninety-three patients were recruited in the study. Majority of them belonged to lower socio-economic status (75.3%), and were from rural background (89.2%). Vitamin D deficiency was found in 84.95% of the study population. Seventy-five children (80.6%) completed induction, 9 (9.7%) abandoned treatment and 9 (9.7%) died during induction. Vitamin D levels were significantly low in children with ALL who died (P = 0.016), who had complications (P = 0.002), females (P = 0.036), and those with high risk ALL (P = 0.001). There was a significant drop in the Vitamin D levels (P < 0.001) from pre to post induction phase of chemotherapy. Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in patients with ALL and is also associated with adverse outcome in these children. Further studies are needed on possible benefits of vitamin D supplementation for preventing complications during treatment of ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PTPN11 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, non-receptor type 11) encoding protein SHP2, a positive transducer of RTKs (Receptor Tyrosine Kinases) and cytokine receptors, can play a significant role in bovine oocyte maturation and embryo development, but this phenomenon has not yet been explored. Here, we used different growth factors, cytokines, selective activator, and a specific inhibitor of SHP2 to ascertain its role in bovine oocyte developmental stages in vitro. We found that SHP2 became activated by growth factors and cytokines treatment and was highly involved in the activation of oocyte maturation and embryo development pathways. Activation of SHP2 triggered MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases) and PI3K/AKT (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Protein kinase B) signaling cascades, which is not only important for GVBD (germinal vesical breakdown) induction but also for maternal mRNA translation. Inhibition of phosphatase activity of SHP2 with PHPS1 (Phenylhydrazonopyrazolone sulfonate 1) reduced oocytes maturation as well as bovine blastocyst ICM (inner cell mass) volume. Supplementation of LIF (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor) to embryos showed an unconventional direct relation between p-SHP2 and p-STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) for blastocyst ICM development. Other than growth factors and cytokines, cisplatin was used to activate SHP2.

Promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARa) sets the cellular landscape of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by repressing the transcription of RARa target genes and disrupting PML-NBs. The RAR receptors control the homeostasis of tissue growth, modeling and regeneration, and PML-NBs are involved in self-renewal of normal and cancer stem cells, DNA damage response, senescence and stress response. The additional somatic mutations in APL mainly involve FLT3, WT1, NRAS, KRAS, ARID1B and ARID1A genes. The treatment outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed APL improved dramatically since the advent of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). ATRA activates the transcription of blocked genes and degrades PML-RARalpha, while ATO degrades PML-RARa by promoting apoptosis and has a pro-oxidant effect. The resistance to ATRA and ATO may derive from the mutations in the RARa ligand binding domain (LBD) and in the PML-B2 domain of PML-RARa, but such mutations cannot explain the majority of resistances experienced in the clinic, globally accounting for 5-10% of cases. Several studies are ongoing to unravel clonal evolution and resistance, suggesting the therapeutic potential of new retinoid molecules and combinatorial treatments of ATRA or ATO with different drugs acting through alternative mechanisms of action, which may lead to synergistic effects on growth control or the induction of apoptosis in APL cells.",,"['#21267/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', ""2017WXR7ZT/Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca""]",['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'ATO', 'ATRA', 'NGS', 'ascorbate', 'resistance', 'therapy']",PMC6826966,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also an intrinsically disordered protein when not engaged with transcriptional binding partners and degraded upon transcriptional coactivation. Given the amplified expression of SRC-3 in breast cancers, the objective of this study was to determine how increasing SRC-3 protein levels are regulated in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We found that endogenous SRC-3 was expelled from the nucleus in vesicle-like spheres under normal growth conditions suggesting that this form of nuclear exclusion of SRC-3 is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating nuclear SRC-3 protein. Only SRC-3 not associated with CREB-binding protein (CBP) was extruded from the nucleus. We found that overexpression in MCF-7 cells results in aneuploid senescence and cell death with frequent formation of nuclear aggregates which were consistently juxtaposed to perinuclear microtubules. Transfected SRC-3 was SUMOylated and caused redistribution of nuclear promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies and perturbation of the nuclear membrane lamin B1, hallmarks of nucleophagy. Increased SRC-3 protein-induced autophagy and resulted in SUMO-1 localization to the nuclear membrane and formation of protrusions variously containing SRC-3 and chromatin. Aspects of SRC-3 overexpression and toxicity were recapitulated following treatment with clinically relevant agents that stabilize SRC-3 in breast cancer cells.

Epub 2019 Oct 21.,"OBJECTIVES: This article reports a study of cell mechanics in patient-derived (primary) B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cells treated with antibodies against integrins. Leukemia cell adhesion to stromal cells mediates chemotherapeutic drug resistance, also known as cell adhesion-mediated chemotherapeutic drug resistance. We have previously shown that antibodies against integrin alpha4 and alpha6 adhesion molecules can de-adhere ALL cells from stromal cells or counter-receptors. Because drug-resistant cells are more deformable, as evaluated by single-beam acoustic tweezers, we hypothesized that changes in cell mechanics might contribute to the de-adhesive effect of integrin-targeting antibodies. METHODS: In this study, the deformability of primary pre-B ALL cells was evaluated by single-beam acoustic tweezers after treatments with the de-adhering antibody Tysabri or P5G10 against integrin alpha4 and alpha6 adhesion molecules. RESULTS: We demonstrated that primary ALL cells treated with P5G10 expressed decreased deformability compared with immunoglobulin G1 -treated control cells (P < .05). Tysabri did not show an effect on deformability (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that decreased deformability is associated with an integrin alpha6 blockade. Further assessments of the functional roles of deformability and integrin blockades in B-ALL cell drug resistance and deformability, respectively, are necessary.",['(c) 2019 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.'],"['R01 CA172896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA172896/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['acoustic tweezers', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'antibody', 'deformability', 'drug resistance', 'integrins']",PMC7493593,,['NIHMS1623897'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As specified in the manufacturers' instructions, once the components-sterile water and cytarabine powder-are unpackaged and mixed, the solution begins to degrade after 6 hours at room temperature and 12 hours at 4 degrees C. To evaluate how to avoid wasting the drug in short-term, low-dose treatment regimens, the reconstituted samples, stored at 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C, were analyzed every day of the test week by reversed-phase HPLC and high-field NMR spectroscopy. All the samples remained unchanged for the entire week, which corresponds to the time required to administer the entire commercial drug package during low-dose therapeutic regimens. The drug solution was stored in a glass container at 4 degrees C in an ordinary freezer and drawn with sterile plastic syringes; during this period, no bacterial or fungal contamination was observed. Our findings show that an cytarabine solution prepared and stored in the original vials retains its efficacy and safety and can, therefore, be divided into small doses to be administered over more days, thus avoiding unnecessary expensive and harmful waste of the drug preparation. Moreover, patients who require daily administration of the drug could undergo the infusion at home without need to go to hospital. The stability of the aliquots would help decrease hospitalization costs.",,,,,PMC6903421,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They provide the theory and key practical aspects of flow cytometry enabling immunologists to avoid the common errors that often undermine immunological data. Notably, there are comprehensive sections of all major immune cell types with helpful Tables detailing phenotypes in murine and human cells. The latest flow cytometry techniques and applications are also described, featuring examples of the data that can be generated and, importantly, how the data can be analysed.

Prognosis is usually with grim. PDZ and LIM domain proteins (PDLIM) are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell differentiation, organ development, neural signaling or tumorigenesis. The clinical and prognostic value of the PDLIM family in AML is unclear. To understand the role of PDLIM expression in AML, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was screened and 155 de novo AML patients with complete clinical information and the expression data of the PDLIM family were included in the study. The clinical and molecular characteristics associated with the expression of different members of the PDLIM family were summarized using various statistical methods. In 84 patients who only received chemotherapy, univariate analysis indicated that high expression of PDLIM2 or PDLIM7 was associated with shorter EFS and OS (both P<0.05 for PDLIM2, and both P<0.01 for PDLIM7). Multivariate analysis suggested that high expression of PDLIM7 was an independent risk factor for EFS and OS (both P<0.05). In the other 71 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), survival was unaffected by PDLIM expressions. In summary, high expression of PDLIM2 and PDLIM7, especially the latter, could serve as adverse prognostic factors for AML, but their prognostic effects could be reversed by allo-HSCT.",['AJTR Copyright (c) 2019.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'PDLIM', 'mutational spectrum', 'next generation sequencing', 'prognosis']",PMC6789254,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitant multidrug resistance of cells remains the greatest clinical obstacle in the effective treatment of blood and solid tumors. Natural products have been identified that possess the capacity to modulate chemotherapeutic resistance and induce apopotosis. In this study, we generated adriamycin-resistant K562 leukemia (K562/RA) cells and compared the responses of sensitive and resistant leukemia cells to the natural products arsenic trioxide (ATO) and resveratrol (Rsv), with a view to determining whether Rsv potentiates the sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to ATO-induced apoptosis and the associated molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that resistance of K562/RA cells induced by adriamycin treatment was significantly higher (115.81-fold) than that of parental K562 cells. Simultaneously, K562/RA cells were cross-resistant to multiple agents, with the exception of ATO. Rsv enhanced the sensitivity of K562/RA cells to ATO and reduced the required dose of ATO as well as associated adverse reactions by promoting the proliferation inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects of ATO, which may be associated with reduced expression of the drug resistance genes mdr1/P-gp, mrp1/MRP1 and bcrp/BCRP, as well as the apoptotic inhibitory genes bcl-2, NF-kappaB and P53, and conversely, activation of caspase-3.

Therefore, we tested rare cytogenetic abnormalities occurring in childhood AL and its effect on clinical prognosis in patients diagnosed at our institution from 2010 to 2017. Results: Among 150 cases of AL, we detected 9 cases with rare chromosomal abnormalities. We found two hypodiploid (2n-) cases: 2n-,t (5;14)(q31;q32) and t (3;11;19)(q21;q23;q13.1) in ALL patients. AML patients showed t (7;14)(q22;q32), t (11;17)(p15;q21), t (11;20) (p15;q11), t (12;17)(q15;q23) and t (11;20)(p15;q11).

Numerous studies have evaluated FLT3 targeting as single agent and in combination approaches in frontline and relapsed AML. At this time, midostaurin, a multikinase inhibitor, is the only FLT3-inhibitor that is US FDA approved to be used in combination with induction therapy in the frontline FLT3-mutated AML setting based on improved overall survival noted in the RATIFY Phase III trial. The utility of midostaurin in maintenance post stem cell transplantation has shown promising results and further studies are still ongoing. In this review, we discuss the studies that led to the inception of midostaurin as a targeted kinase inhibitor, its evaluation in AML, the early clinical trials and the large Phase III clinical trial that led to its eventual US FDA-approval in FLT3-mutated AML. Our review also discusses data on midostaurin adverse effects, mechanisms of resistance and limitations of its utility. We further discuss emerging second-generation FLT3 inhibitors, with a focus on quizartinib and gilteritinib and future directions to enhance FLT3-inhibitor efficacy and overcome mechanisms of resistance.",['(c) 2019 Abbas et al.'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009666/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'midostaurin']",PMC6782026,"['MA and HAA have no conflicts of interest in this work.

A variety of mutations have been identified at the molecular level, such as those in the IDH1/2 gene, which causes a gain of function of the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme, generating high levels of the (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate oncometabolite, which competitively inhibits dioxygenase enzymes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of IDH1/2 gene mutations in AML patients and their impact on survival. Materials and methods: A total of 101 patients with a diagnosis of AML were included; mononuclear cells were obtained for DNA extraction and purification. Mutations were detected using TaqMan competitive allele-specific probes (castPCR). Overall survival curves were plotted using IBM SPSS Statistics 23 software. Results: The frequency of IDH gene mutations was 19.8%. For the IDH1 gene, 13.8% of the mutations identified included R132H, V178I, G105G and R132C. The frequency of mutations of the IDH2 gene was 5.9%; the variants included R172K and R140Q. The mean survival time in patients without IDH1 gene mutations was 173.15 days (120.20-226.10), while the mean survival time for patients with mutations was 54.95 days (9.7-100.18), p = 0.001. Conclusion: The frequency of IDH1 and IDH2 gene mutations in the sample was similar to that reported in other studies. The analysis of these mutations in AML patients is of great importance as a prognostic factor due to their impact on survival and their use as potential therapeutic targets or as targets of inhibitors of IDH1(Ivosidenib, Tibsovo) and IDH2 (Enasidenib, Idhifa).",['(c) 2019 Olarte et al.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'competitive allele specific TaqMan', 'isocitrate dehydrogenase']",PMC6781602,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pathological MYC activity gain in lymphomas is able to overcome its regulation by repressors, which leads to bypassing the affinity-based selection of B-cells. Arguably the MYC activity gain is the most constantly observed phenomenon (>70% of cases) in transformed FL/MALT/CLL (Richter's transformation) and co-occurs with specific aberrations such as the loss of p53, CDKN2A/B, or gain of BCL2/BCL6. Here we summarize recent progress in the understanding of MYC regulatory network in lymphoma B-cells and highlight its involvement in lymphomas' histological transformation by regulating cyclins, CDKs, p21, p27, BCL2, E2F, FOXP1, BCR signaling components, and non-coding microRNA (miRNA) genes such as miR-150, miR-29, miR-17-92, and miR-34a.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Lymphomas', '*MYC', '*indolent mature B-cell malignancies', '*microRNA', '*transformation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients underwent apheresis the day after CD34(+) counts reached >/=20/microL and an additional dose of G-CSF. Peripheral arterial and intravenous lines were inserted in pediatric intensive care unit under local anesthetic and/or sedation, omitting the need for general anesthesia as well as facilitating an uninterrupted apheresis flow. Larger apheresis total blood volumes were processed in patients weighing </=20 kg. The minimal dose of >/=2 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg was successfully collected in 98.4% of all patients. The optimal dose of 3-5 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg was collected in 96% of patients scheduled for a single aHSCT, 87.5% for tandem, and 100% for triple aHSCT. All HPC collections were completed in one apheresis session. Mobilization after </=3 chemotherapy cycles and cycles including cyclophosphamide resulted in a significantly higher yield of CD34(+) cells. CONCLUSION: Our approach to HPC mobilization by means of chemotherapy and single myeloid growth factor combined with optimal collection timing facilitated by continuous apheresis flow resulted in highly effective HPC harvest in children and adolescents with high-risk cancers.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],['NOTNLM'],"['*granulocyte colony-stimulating factor', '*hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization', '*peripheral blood progenitor cell apheresis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This analysis aimed to identify the association between exercise intolerance and neurocognitive impairments in ALL survivors. METHODS: Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, results from a 2-hour standardized neuropsychological assessment, and self-report questionnaires were obtained for 341 adult survivors of childhood ALL and 288 controls. Multivariable modeling was used to test associations between oxygen uptake at 85% estimated heart rate (rpkVO2 ) and neuropsychological test and self-reported questionnaire domains, adjusted for sex, age at diagnosis, cranial radiation, anthracycline, and methotrexate exposure and tobacco smoking status. RESULTS: Compared with controls, survivors had worse rpkVO2 and performance on verbal intelligence, focused attention, verbal fluency, working memory, dominant/nondominant motor speed, visual-motor speed, memory span, and reading and math measures (all P < .001). In adjusted models, exercise intolerance was associated with decreases in performance of verbal ability, focused attention, verbal fluency, working memory, dominant motor speed, nondominant motor speed, visual-motor speed, memory span, reading academics, and math academics in survivors.

Epub 2019 Oct 17.,"BACKGROUND: End-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) is the strongest predictor of relapse in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but an understanding of the biological pathways underlying early treatment response remains elusive. We hypothesized that metabolomic profiling of diagnostic bone marrow plasma could provide insights into the underlying biology of early treatment response and inform treatment strategies for high-risk patients. METHODS: We performed global metabolomic profiling of samples from discovery (N=93) and replication (N=62) cohorts treated at Texas Children's Hospital. Next, we tested the cytotoxicity of drugs targeting central carbon metabolism in cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells. FINDINGS: Metabolite set enrichment analysis identified altered central carbon and amino acid metabolism in MRD-positive patients from both cohorts at a 5% false discovery rate. Metabolites from these pathways were used as inputs for unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Two distinct clusters were identified, which were independently associated with MRD after adjustment for immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and NCI risk group. Three nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors, which reduce glycolytic/TCA cycle activities, demonstrated nanomolar-range cytotoxicity in B- and T-ALL cell lines and PDX cells. INTERPRETATION: This study provides new insights into the role of central carbon metabolism in early treatment response and as a potential targetable pathway in high-risk disease.

STUDY DESIGN: For whole exome sequencing analysis, we selected 44 children born small for gestational age with persistent short stature, and additional features, such as dysmorphic face, major malformation, developmental delay, and/or intellectual disability. Seven patients had negative candidate gene testing based on clinical suspicion and 37 patients had syndromic conditions of unknown etiology. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients, 15 (34%) had pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in genes already associated with growth disturbance: COL2A1 (n = 2), SRCAP (n = 2), AFF4, ACTG1, ANKRD11, BCL11B, BRCA1, CDKN1C, GINS1, INPP5K, KIF11, KMT2A, and POC1A (n = 1 each). Most of the genes found to be deleterious participate in fundamental cellular processes, such as cell replication and DNA repair.

Epub 2019 Oct 19.,"Mutational profiling, usually by targeted next-generation sequencing, is increasingly performed on patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated myelofibrosis (MF), whether primary (PMF) or post-polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia (post-PV/ET MF). ""Driver"" mutations in JAK2, MPL and indels in CALR underlie the vast majority of cases of PMF and post-ET MF; the remainder ( approximately 10%) lack identifiable driver mutations, but other clonal markers are usually detectable. Nearly all patients with post-PV MF carry activating JAK2 mutations. In both PMF and post-ET MF, type 1/-like CALR mutations confer a favorable prognosis. Since both type 1/-like and type 2/-like CALR mutations have essentially the same functional consequence, this is a subject of intense research. Additional, ""non-driver"" mutations, mostly affecting genes encoding epigenetic modifiers or spliceosome components, e.g., ASXL1, EZH2, TET2, DNMT3A, SRSF2 and U2AF1, are frequently found; some of these are associated with inferior survival and have been incorporated into prognostic models.

Epub 2019 Oct 17.,"BACKGROUND: Adolescents (aged 10-17 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) have unfavourable disease features and an inferior outcome when compared with younger children, but it is still unclear if differences in disease biology and prognosis exist between adolescents older or younger than 15 years. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed outcomes of 1094 adolescents with ALL, aged 10-17 years, treated within the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 trial, overall and by the age groups 10-14 and 15-17 years. FINDINGS: Compared with younger children (aged 1-9 years, n = 3647), adolescents had a statistically inferior 5-year event-free survival (EFS) [74.6% (1.3) vs. 84.4% (0.6)] and overall survival (OS) [83.4% (1.1) vs. 92.7% (0.4); p < 0.001]. Clinical and biological disease characteristics did not differ between the two subgroups of adolescents, including minimal residual disease (MRD) results during initial therapy, except for ETV6-RUNX1 frequency and gender. With a median follow-up of 8.8 years, the 5-year EFS and OS were 76.2% (1.5) and 84.9% (1.3), respectively, for those aged 10-14 years and 70.0% (2.8) and 78.8% (2.5) for those aged 15-17 years (p = 0.06; 0.05). There was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of relapses [17.8% (1.4) and 18.3% (2.4); p = 0.98], while the incidence of treatment-related deaths as a first event was 2.6% (0.6) versus 7.4% (1.6) (p < 0.001) with, in particular, a higher incidence in the high-risk arm. INTERPRETATION: Further prospective studies and biological investigations are required to define optimal treatment for adolescents, in particular for those aged 15-17 years. Newer agents (immunotherapy, targeted therapy) in early treatment phases of patients at higher risk of treatment failure could replace most toxic treatment elements, with the aim of reducing both toxicity and the risk of relapses.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 Oct 17.,"Serum is an important component in cell culture medium. It also possesses potent antioxidant properties. Therefore, the conventional protocols for detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cultured cells with fluorescent probes include washing and suspending cells with serum-free buffers, such as PBS. This transient serum deprivation is essential for the ROS detecting. Unfortunately, it may also cause unexpected results, which push us to choose more optimal experiment conditions. In the present study, we found an acute lytic cell death induced by xanthohumol (XN), which obstructed ROS detecting in human leukemia cell line HL-60 cells. XN induced ROS burst, caused cell swelling, membrane permeability increase, LDH release, and ultimately an acute lytic cell death and cell rupture. These effects could be alleviated by the antioxidant N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Apoptosis, pyroptosis or necroptosis were not observed in this process. Results also indicated that 2% serum addition had already completely scavenged ROS induced by 10muM XN. Taken together, it is strongly suggested to detecting ROS in a serum-free medium when studying where and how ROS generated in cells. The concentration at the ROS maximum point (10muM XN in this study) can be selected as the optimal concentration.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 Oct 17.,"Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a cancer of hematopoietic stem cells with a rapid progression. Recent studies indicated that endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) are potential risk factors for AML progression. Our present data showed that an industrial endocrine disrupting chemical, Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), can promote the proliferation of AML cells and decrease their sensitivity to daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (Ara-C) treatments. Further, BBP can increase the glucose consumption, lactate generation, and ATP levels of AML cells. Among the measured glycolysis-related genes, BBP can increase the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4), a mitochondrial protein that regulates the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle. The inhibitor of PDK4 or its specific siRNA can attenuate BBP-induced cell proliferation and ATP generation, which suggested the essential roles of PDK4 in BBP-induced glycolysis and proliferation. Further, BBP can increase the mRNA stability of PDK4, while had no effect on its transcription and protein stability. miR-15b-5p can bind with the 3'UTR of PDK4 to decrease its mRNA stability, while BBP can decrease the expression of miR-15b-5p in AML cells. Collectively, our data showed that BBP can trigger the malignancy of AML cells via regulation of miR-15b-5p/PDK4 signals.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 Oct 17.,"Monoclonal antibodies ofatumumab (anti-CD20) and alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) which are approved for usage in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), efficiently activate the classical complement pathway. However complement is an exhaustible component and high doses of its activators may deplete complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) potential, thus reducing the effect of repeated mAb dosing. Widely used method to measure CDC activity of patients' serum is hemolytic assay (CH50) on sheep erythrocytes. Despite its simplicity, such CH50 assay may not reflect pivotal interactions between patient serum and human complement inhibitors on the surface of target cells. We propose calcein release assay performed on tumor cells similar to those targeted by therapeutic antibodies as an alternative method. We analyzed serum samples collected from 12 patients participating in the clinical study, receiving s.c. 30mg alemtuzumab three times per week combined with i.v. ofatumumab at an initial dose of 300mg in week 3 further escalated to 2000mg every other week. All serum samples were measured by hemolytic assay on sheep erythrocytes as well as using calcein release assay on CD20-positive Raji cells. Our data show that results obtained from both assays are related to each other at the level of the whole group (n=96 samples, Spearman r=0.504, p<.001) but may substantially differ when analyzing individual patients. Furthermore, by using CDC assay on Raji cells, we found that in the presented clinical study CDC serum potential was not significantly affected when measured before consecutive administrations in most of the patients.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Oct 16.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are a form of autologous immunotherapy that has changed the therapeutic landscape of hematologic malignancies. CAR T cell therapy involves collection of a patient's T cells by apheresis, ex vivo genetic modification of the T cells to encode a synthetic receptor that binds a specific tumor antigen, and infusion of the T cells back into the patient. With the unprecedented success of CAR T cells in leukemia and lymphoma, a growing number of preclinical studies and clinical trials have focused on translating this treatment to solid tumors. In non-hematologic malignancies, however, response rates have been much less favorable. Some of the most significant challenges for CAR T cell immunotherapy in solid cancers include a paucity of unique tumor target antigens, limited CAR T cell trafficking to tumor sites, tumor heterogeneity and antigen loss, and the severely immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This review article provides an update on completed and ongoing clinical trials of CAR T cells for solid tumors, as well as an overview of strategies to improve CAR T cell efficacy in non-hematologic malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Oct 11.,"OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Busulfan/cyclophosphamide (Bu/Cy) and busulfan/fludarabine (Bu/Flu) are both standard myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). We compared the effectiveness of these regimens with a focus on quality of life (QOL). METHODS: This was a single center, retrospective analysis of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients who underwent a first T-cell replete HLA-8/8 matched related or unrelated donor alloHCT. Patients received a myeloablative regimen of either parenteral Bu/Cy or Bu/Flu. Outcomes assessed included infections, graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), relapse, relapse mortality (RM), relapse-free survival (RFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), overall survival (OS), and QOL. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2017, 126 AML and 84 MDS adult patients age >/=18years were identified meeting inclusion criteria. In terms of QOL, there were no significant differences between Bu/Cy and Bu/Flu cohorts in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant Scale (FACT-BMT) scores or mucositis severity for either AML or MDS patients. Amongst AML patients, those receiving Bu/Flu had more rapid neutrophil and platelet recovery and a shorter length of hospital stay (LOS); there were no differences in the other posttransplant outcomes. Similarly, amongst MDS patients, those receiving Bu/Flu had more rapid platelet recovery and a shorter LOS as well as more CMV infections, but less NRM and no differences in other outcomes. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that myeloablative Bu/Flu conditioning has comparable clinical and QOL outcomes to Bu/Cy.","['Copyright (c) 2019 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

Epub 2019 Oct 16.,"Human Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells respond to small phosphorus-containing compounds, often called phosphoantigens, which are now known to be intracellular ligands of the immune receptor butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1). In order to compare the efficiency of butyrophilin ligands, we developed a luciferase-based lysis assay that measures the direct cytolysis by Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells of luciferase-expressing K562 leukemia cells sensitized by phosphoantigen prodrugs. Our results show that the luciferase-based lysis assay allows in vitro and in vivo assessment of phosphoantigen activity in a way that does not require the extensive processing of flow cytometry or ELISA based approaches. In cellular assays, the structure activity relationships of phosphoantigen prodrugs correlate with ELISA-based activation assays, though phosphoantigen induced target cell lysis occurs at lower concentrations relative to T cell interferon gamma production measured by ELISA. In mice dosed with phosphoantigens, a racemic aryl phosphonamidate prodrug, methyl 2-[[[(E)-5-hydroxy-4-methyl-pent-3-enyl]-(1-naphthyloxy)phosphoryl]amino]acetate (1-Nap/GlyOMe C-HMBP, 5), sensitized subcutaneous K562 tumors within minutes, and this effect was maintained at least four hours after treatment. In vivo activity of compound 5 was stronger than that of an equivalent dose of zoledronate. This luciferase lysis assay can be used for evaluation of phosphoantigens due to its time efficiency, high sensitivity, and in vivo compatibility and demonstrates rapid in vitro and in vivo sensitization of tumor cells by phosphoantigen prodrugs.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated whether elimination of this step would still give equivalent results and compared the accuracy of variant allele fraction (VAF) between polymerase chain reaction/capillary electrophoresis (PCR/CE) vs next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods. METHODS: Total leukocyte vs blast-enriched whole-blood aliquots were tested for FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain mutations by PCR/CE. VAF of the ITD mutations was also compared with NGS VAF. RESULTS: Blast-enriched vs total leukocyte specimens showed 100% concordance in the 25 positive specimens. VAF was consistently lower by NGS, with poorer fidelity to PCR/CE VAF as the ITD size increased. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports elimination of the blast enrichment step without compromising results or sensitivity. In addition, since NGS shows a loose correlation with PCR/CE quantitative results, NGS VAF should not be reported for FLT3 ITDs.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

Epub 2019 Oct 18.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults and overall survival remains poor. Chemotherapy is the standard of care for intensive induction therapy. Patients who achieve a complete remission require post-remission therapies to prevent relapse. There is no standard of care for patients with minimal residual disease (MRD), and stem cell transplantation is a salvage therapy. Considering the AML genetic heterogeneity and the leukemia immune-suppressive properties, novel cellular immune therapies to effectively harness immunological responses to prevent relapse are needed. We developed a novel modality of immune therapy consisting of monocytes reprogrammed with lentiviral vectors expressing GM-CSF, IFN-alpha and antigens. Preclinical studies in humanized mice showed that the reprogrammed monocytes self-differentiated into highly viable induced dendritic cells (iDCs) in vivo which migrated effectively to lymph nodes, producing remarkable effects in the de novo regeneration of T and B cell responses. For the first-in-man clinical trial, the patient's monocytes will be transduced with an integrase-defective tricistronic lentiviral vector expressing GM-CSF, IFN-alpha and a truncated WT1 antigen. For transplanted patients, pre-clinical development of iDCs co-expressing cytomegalovirus antigens is ongoing. To simplify the product chain for a de-centralized supply model, we are currently exploring a closed automated system for a short two-day manufacturing of iDCs.

Epub 2019 Oct 18.,"Treatment results for multiple myeloma and plasma cell leukemia have considerably improved, but cure remains elusive and establishing new therapeutic approaches constitutes a major unmet clinical need. We analyzed the anti-myeloma properties of the aza-anthracenedione pixantrone which has been successfully used in a phase III study for the treatment of patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as monotherapy as well as in combination regimes in vitro and in an adapted in vivo model (ex ovo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay). Pixantrone significantly inhibited proliferation and metabolic activity of all investigated myeloma cell lines. Importantly, anti-myeloma effects were more pronounced in tumor cell lines than in stromal cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy controls. Apoptosis of myeloma cell lines was observed only after a 7-day incubation period, indicating a fast cytostatic and a slower cytotoxic effect of this drug. Pixantrone reduced the viability of primary plasma cells of patients and induced downregulation of myeloma-cell growth in the CAM assay. Additionally, we demonstrate in vitro synergism between pixantrone and the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat with respect to its anti-proliferative features. From these data, we conclude that systematic investigations of the clinical usefulness of pixantrone in the framework of controlled clinical trials are clearly indicated (e.g., in penta-refractory patients).",,['278570/FPT7/2007-2013'],['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-myeloma activity', 'Drug screening', 'Multiple myeloma', 'Pixantrone', 'Plasma cell leukemia']",PMC6848044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 18.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with poor outcomes, especially in older patients in whom the disease is most common. B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) is an antiapoptotic protein involved in the survival and maintenance of AML, and it is overexpressed in the leukemia stem cell population. Venetoclax is an oral BCL-2 protein inhibitor recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in combination with a hypomethylating agent (HMA) (azacitidine or decitabine) or low-dose cytarabine for front-line treatment of AML in older patients or those unfit for induction chemotherapy. Given that its mechanism of action is unique, it is not surprising that this widely effective therapy presents unique challenges, including but not limited to the rapidity of responses, the rate and depth of cytopenias, and issues related to drug-drug interactions. With the recent FDA approval and increasingly widespread use, we aim here to summarize, based on evidence and experience, emerging management strategies for the combination of HMAs and venetoclax in the treatment of AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 18.,"RAS-pathway mutations are recurrent events in myeloid malignancies. However, there is limited data on the significance of RAS-pathway mutations in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). We analyzed next-generation sequencing data of 16 genes, including RAS-pathway genes, from 723 patients with primary and secondary MF across three international centers and evaluated their significance. N/KRAS variants were present in 6% of patients and were typically sub-clonal (median VAF = 20%) relative to other genes variants. RAS variants were associated with advanced MF features including leukocytosis (p = 0.02), high somatic mutation burden (p < 0.01) and the presence of established ""molecular high-risk"" (MHR) mutations. MF patients with N/KRAS mutations had shorter 3-year overall survival (OS) (34% vs 58%, p < 0.001) and higher incidence of acute myeloid leukemia at 3 years (18% vs 11%, p = 0.03). In a multivariate Cox model, RAS mutations were associated with decreased OS (HR 1.93, p < 0.001). We created a novel score to predict OS incorporating RAS mutations, and it predicted OS across training and validation cohorts. Patients with intermediate risk/high-risk DIPSS with RAS mutations who received ruxolitinib had a nonsignificant longer 2-year OS relative to those who did not receive ruxolitinib.

We provide evidence that CDK8 has a key role in B-ALL. Loss of CDK8 in leukemia mouse models significantly enhances disease latency and prevents disease maintenance. Loss of CDK8 is associated with pronounced transcriptional changes, whereas inhibiting CDK8 kinase activity has minimal effects. Gene set enrichment analysis suggests that the mTOR signaling pathway is deregulated in CDK8-deficient cells and, accordingly, these cells are highly sensitive to mTOR inhibitors. Analysis of large cohorts of human ALL and AML patients reveals a significant correlation between the level of CDK8 and of mTOR pathway members. We have synthesized a small molecule YKL-06-101 that combines mTOR inhibition and degradation of CDK8, and induces cell death in human leukemic cells. We propose that simultaneous CDK8 degradation and mTOR inhibition might represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ALL patients.",,['P 27248/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,PMC6802219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, novel and effective therapeutics are urgently required. In this study, the authors sought to explore the kinomic landscape of GBM from a previously underutilized approach (i.e., spatial heterogeneity), followed by validation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) targeting according to this stepwise kinomic-based novel approach. METHODS: Twelve GBM tumor samples were obtained and characterized histopathologically from 2 patients with GBM. PamStation peptide-array analysis of these tissues was performed to measure the kinomic activity of each sample. The Ivy GBM database was then utilized to determine the intratumoral spatial localization of BTK activity by investigating the expression of BTK-related transcription factors (TFs) within tumors. Genetic inhibition of BTK family members through lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown was performed to determine their function in the core-like and edge-like GBM neurosphere models. Finally, the small-molecule inhibitor of BTK, ONO/GS-4059, which is currently under clinical investigation in nonbrain cancers, was applied for pharmacological inhibition of regionally specified newly established GBM edge and core neurosphere models. RESULTS: Kinomic investigation identified two major subclusters of GBM tissues from both patients exhibiting distinct profiles of kinase activity. Comparatively, in these spatially defined subgroups, BTK was the centric kinase differentially expressed. According to the Ivy GBM database, BTK-related TFs were highly expressed in the tumor core, but not in edge counterparts. Short hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing of BTK in previously established edge- and core-like GBM neurospheres demonstrated increased apoptotic activity with predominance of the sub-G1 phase of core-like neurospheres compared to edge-like neurospheres. Lastly, pharmacological inhibition of BTK by ONO/GS-4059 resulted in growth inhibition of regionally derived GBM core cells and, to a lesser extent, their edge counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies significant heterogeneity in kinase activity both within and across distinct GBM tumors. The study findings indicate that BTK activity is elevated in the classically therapy-resistant GBM tumor core. Given these findings, targeting GBM's resistant core through BTK may potentially provide therapeutic benefit for patients with GBM.",,"['R01 CA183991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201402/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS083767/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS087913/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['BTK', ""BTK = Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", 'CLL = chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'EGF = epidermal growth factor', 'EGFR = endothelial growth factor receptor', 'FITC = fluorescein isothiocyanate', 'GAP = Glioblastoma Atlas Project', 'GBM = glioblastoma', 'GSC = glioma stemlike cell', 'IDH = isocitrate dehydrogenase', 'MCL = mantle cell lymphoma', 'ONO/GS-4059', 'PCA = principal component analysis', 'PDGFR = platelet-derived endothelial growth factor', 'PI = propidium iodide', 'PTK = protein tyrosine kinase', 'TF = transcription factor', 'UAB = University of Alabama at Birmingham', 'bFGF = basic fibroblast growth factor', 'glioblastoma', 'kinomics', 'oncology', 'protein kinase', 'shRNA = short hairpin RNA']",PMC7961807,,['NIHMS1672987'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 18.,"Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an indolent B-cell malignancy characterized by high initial sensitivity to purine analog chemotherapy, minimal residual disease (MRD) frequently accompanying complete remission (CR), and relapses requiring additional treatment. Repeat chemotherapy shows decreasing efficacy and increasing toxicity with each course. Newer therapies targeting BRAF/MEK or Bruton's tyrosine kinase are effective but generally leave MRD. Rituximab has modest activity as a single agent and can achieve MRD-negative CR in combination with purine analogs, but there is significant toxicity from the chemotherapy. Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk (Moxe) is a biologic containing an antibody fragment (Fv) binding to CD22, attached to a portion of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. Binding to CD22 enables the toxin to enter and kill cells. Moxe is administered by 30-minute infusions on days 1, 3, and 5 of up to six cycles spaced 4 weeks apart. In phase I testing, 64% of 33 patients at the highest dose level achieved CR, most without MRD. Lack of MRD correlated with prolonged CR duration; of 11 MRD-negative CRs, 10 were still in CR after a median of 42 months of observation. In pivotal testing, 75% of 80 patients had a hematologic response, 41% with CR; 82% (27/33) of CRs were MRD-negative, and only 4 of the 27 MRD-negative patients relapsed during the follow-up period. Hemolytic uremic syndrome and capillary leak syndrome were each observed in 9% of patients, all reversible. In September 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Moxe for the treatment of relapsed/refractory HCL after >/=2 prior therapies. Moxe is undergoing further development in combination with rituximab. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) has effective treatments including purine analogs with and without rituximab, and oral inhibitors of BRAF, MEK and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Despite these therapies, relapse occurs, and moxetumomab pasudotox has an important role in relapsed and refractory HCL because of its ability to achieve high rates of complete remissions (CRs) without chemotherapy; most of these CRs are without minimal residual disease (MRD). CR duration is enhanced in patients who achieve eradication of MRD. To improve the efficacy of this recombinant immunotoxin, a phase I trial is underway in combination with rituximab to reduce tumor burden and decrease immunogenicity.","['Published 2019.

Epub 2019 Oct 18.,"MicroRNA-150-5p (miR-150-5p) plays a complex role in normal early hematopoietic development and is also implicated in the development of various different leukemias. We have reported previously that, in myeloid and lymphoid malignancies associated with dysregulated fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) activities, miR-150-5p is down-regulated compared with healthy cells. Here, using murine cells, we found that this down-regulation is accompanied by CpG methylation of the miR-150-5p promoter region. Of note, analysis of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cohorts also revealed an inverse relationship between miR-150-5p expression and disease progression. We also found that the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) enzyme is highly up-regulated in FGFR1-driven leukemias and lymphomas and that FGFR1 inhibition reduces DNMT1 expression. DNMT1 knockdown in stem cell leukemia/lymphoma (SCLL) cells increased miR-150-5p levels and reduced levels of the MYB proto-oncogene transcription factor, a key regulator of leukemogenesis. FGFR1 directly activates the MYC proto-oncogene basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, which, as we show here, binds and activates the DNMT1 promoter. MYC knockdown decreased DNMT1 expression, which, in turn, increased miR-150-5p expression. One of the known targets of miR-150-5p is MYB, and treatment of leukemic cells with the MYB inhibitor mebendazole dose-dependently increased apoptosis and reduced cell viability. Moreover, mebendazole treatment of murine xenografts models of FGFR1-driven leukemias enhanced survival. These findings provide evidence that MYC activates MYB by up-regulating DNMT1, which silences miR-150-5p and promotes SCLL progression. We propose that inclusion of mebendazole in a combination therapy with FGFR1 inhibitors may be a valuable option to manage SCLL.",['(c) 2019 Hu et al.'],['R01 CA076167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NOTNLM'],"['*DNMT1', '*MYB', '*Myc (c-Myc)', '*epigenetics', '*fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)', '*leukemia', '*microRNA (miRNA)']",PMC6885633,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 15.,"Friend leukemia integration 1 (Fli-1) is a member of the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor family. Fli-1 regulates normal hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis, and its aberrant expression underlies virus-induced leukemias and various types of human cancers. NANOGP8, a retro-pseudogene of stem cell mediator NANOG, is expressed predominantly in cancer cells and plays a role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that Fli-1 expression enhances human acute T-cell leukemia Jurkat cell proliferation and that Fli-1 acts as a transcriptional activator of NANOGP8 expression in these cells. NANOGP8 and Fli-1 are highly expressed in Jurkat cells, whereas NANOG was undetectable at both the RNA and protein levels. Moreover, the expression of endogenous NANOGP8 was significantly influenced by gain of function and loss of function of Fli-1. Promoter-reporter assays showed that NANOGP8 transcription was significantly upregulated by dose-dependent Fli-1 overexpression. A series of deletion mutagenesis of NANOGP8 promoter sequence revealed that NANOGP8 promoter activity was tightly regulated and found the minimal promoter region sufficient to activate NANOGP8 transcription mediated by Fli-1. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis of the putative binding site abolished both NANOGP8 full-length and minimal promoter activities. Binding assays revealed that Fli-1 directly interacts with the potent binding site in NANOG promoter region. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Fli-1 is a novel upstream transcriptional activator of NANOGP8 and provide the molecular details of Fli-1-mediated NANOGP8 gene expression.

Epub 2019 Oct 18.,"PURPOSE: The optimal treatment of newly diagnosed nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is ill defined. We therefore conducted a retrospective analysis using the database of the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The long-term course of 471 patients with NLPHL (early stages, n = 251; intermediate stages, n = 76; advanced stages, n = 144) who had received stage-adapted first-line treatment in the randomized GHSG HD7 to HD15 studies was investigated. Treatment consisted of radiotherapy alone, chemotherapy alone, or combined-modality approaches. RESULTS: The median age at NLPHL diagnosis was 39 years (range, 16 to 75 years). Patients were mostly male (75.8%). The median observation time was 9.2 years. At 10 years, progression-free survival and overall survival estimates were 75.5% and 92.1% (early stages, 79.7% and 93.3%; intermediate stages, 72.1% and 96.2%; advanced stages, 69.8% and 87.4%), respectively. A total of 48 patients (10.2%) developed a second malignancy during follow-up (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, n = 13; leukemia, n = 6; solid tumor, n = 25; unspecified malignancy, n = 4). Death occurred in 43 patients (9.1%). However, only a minority of deaths were NLPHL related (n = 10), whereas second malignancies (n = 20) and nonmalignant conditions possibly associated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy (n = 13) caused the death in the majority of patients. CONCLUSION: The overall outcome of patients with NLPHL who had received Hodgkin lymphoma-directed first-line treatment in randomized GHSG trial protocols was good. Nonetheless, treatment optimization is still necessary to reduce toxicity in standard-risk patients and to improve the prognosis in high-risk patients.",,,,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2020 Mar 1;38(7):662-668.

Epub 2019 Oct 18.,"BACKGROUND: A single-arm, phase 2 trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell-engaging antibody construct, in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a rare hematologic malignancy with limited treatment options. This study compared outcomes with blinatumomab with those of a historical control treated with the standard of care (SOC). METHODS: The blinatumomab trial enrolled adult patients with Ph+ ALL who were r/r to at least 1 second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (n = 45). Propensity score analysis (PSA) was used to compare outcomes with blinatumomab with those of an external cohort of similar patients receiving SOC chemotherapy (n = 55). The PSA mitigated confounding variables between studies by adjusting for imbalances in the age at diagnosis and start of treatment, sex, duration from diagnosis to most recent treatment, prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, prior salvage therapy, and number of salvage therapies. Bayesian data augmentation was applied to improve power to 80% with data from a phase 3 blinatumomab study in r/r Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL. RESULTS: In the PSA, the rate of complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery was 36% for blinatumomab and 25% for SOC, and this resulted in an odds ratio of 1.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-3.89) or 1.70 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.94-2.94) with Bayesian data augmentation. Overall survival favored blinatumomab over SOC, with a hazard ratio of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.57-1.14) or 0.77 (95% CrI, 0.61-0.96) with Bayesian data augmentation. CONCLUSIONS: These results further support blinatumomab as a treatment option for patients with r/r Ph+ ALL.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Nov 7.,"Although acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous malignance, the common molecular mechanisms shared by different AML subtypes play critical roles in AML development. It is possible to identify new drugs that are effective for various AML subtypes based on the common molecular mechanisms. Therefore, we developed a hypothesis-driven bioinformatic drug screening framework by integrating multiple omics data. In this study, we identified that chlorprothixene, a dopamine receptor antagonist, could effectively inhibit growth of AML cells from different subtypes. RNA-seq analysis suggested that chlorprothixene perturbed a series of crucial biological processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy in AML cells. Further investigations indicated that chlorprothixene could induce both apoptosis and autophagy in AML cells, and apoptosis and autophagy could act as partners to induce cell death cooperatively. Remarkably, chlorprothixene was found to inhibit tumor growth and induce in situ leukemic cell apoptosis in the murine xenograft model. Furthermore, chlorprothixene treatment could reduce the level of oncofusion proteins PML-RARalpha and AML1-ETO, thus elevate the expression of apoptosis-related genes, and lead to AML cell death. Our results provided new insights for drug repositioning of AML therapy and confirmed that chlorprothixene might be a potential candidate for treatment of different subtypes of AML by reducing expression of oncofusion proteins.

Epub 2019 Oct 18.,"BACKGROUND: The 5-year survival for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is greater than 90%. One late effect of pediatric ALL associated with numerous long-term difficulties is neurocognitive deficits. The experience at our institution, as well as conversations with oncologists at other institutions, suggests an increase in the use of sedation during lumbar punctures (LPs) for treatment of pediatric ALL. Among the most common Children's Oncology Group (COG) ALL protocols, approximately 30 LPs are performed over 2-3 years. Studies in animals reveal that sedation drugs may harm the developing brain. Gaps in knowledge exist regarding their use in children, particularly repeated exposures. The purpose of this study is to summarize sedation practices for LPs related to the treatment of ALL at COG institutions. METHODS: Responsible Individuals (RIs) of the Cancer Control Committee of COG were invited to complete an internet-based survey about sedation practices at their institutions. RESULTS: Surveys were sent to 103 RIs with a 62% response rate (N = 64). A combined 2018 new patients with ALL were seen each year (mean = 31.5, range = 3-110) at the participating institutions. The majority (96%) of children with ALL received sedation for LPs. While there was considerable variability across institutions in the type of sedation given, the most common was propofol alone (n = 36, 56%). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of children with ALL receive sedation for LPs; however, there is variation in the medication used. Better understanding of sedation practices in children with ALL may inform future research to investigate which methods are the safest, with an emphasis on long-term neurocognitive late effects.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*anesthesia', '*late effects of cancer treatment', '*lumbar puncture', '*neurotoxicity of therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We included 129 patients (median age: 5.33 years) receiving 565 asparaginase doses. CARs were observed following 25 asparaginase doses (19/361 [5.3%] pegaspargase). A total of 224 asparaginase activity levels were ordered in 88 patients. Following receipt of 190 asparaginase activity results, asparaginase therapy was continued, modified, or premedicated in 188 (98.9%), 1 (0.005%), and 1 (0.005%) cases, respectively. Inadequate asparaginase activity was observed in three patients receiving Erwinia asparaginase. Asparaginase activity monitoring allowed patients with pegaspargase-associated CAR and adequate activity to continue therapy unchanged and was cost neutral.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*asparaginase', '*pediatrics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During analysis of a whole-exome-sequenced cohort of heterogeneous CHD patients, we identified a de novo missense variant, PBX1:c.551G>C p.R184P, in a patient with tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve and extra-cardiac phenotypes. Functional analysis of this variant by creating a CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited mouse model revealed multiple congenital anomalies. Congenital heart defects (persistent truncus arteriosus and ventricular septal defect), hypoplastic lungs, hypoplastic/ectopic kidneys, aplastic adrenal glands and spleen, as well as atretic trachea and palate defects were observed in the homozygous mutant embryos at multiple stages of development. We also observed developmental anomalies in a proportion of heterozygous embryos, suggestive of a dominant mode of inheritance. Analysis of gene expression and protein levels revealed that although Pbx1 transcripts are higher in homozygotes, amounts of PBX1 protein are significantly decreased. Here, we have presented the first functional model of a missense PBX1 variant and provided strong evidence that p.R184P is disease-causal. Our findings also expand the phenotypic spectrum associated with pathogenic PBX1 variants in both humans and mice.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

METHODS: One case of APL-like acute leukemia with a t (11;12) (p15;q13) translocation is reported and related literature is retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A rare acute myeloid leukemia with a t (11;12) (p15;q13) translocation was diagnosed by morphology, immunophenotyping, chromosome analysis, and fusion gene detection, without finding a classical t (15;17) (q24.1;q21.1) translocation and the PML-RARa fusion gene. The patient responded poorly to differentiation induction therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). In the three previous cases re-ported, poor results were obtained with ATRA and/or ATO therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We reported a rare meaningful AML patient with t (11;12) (p15;q13). Standard AML regimens may be preferred. These APL-like leukemias may benefit from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation treatment.

Some 41 patients received an unmanipulated graft followed by PT-Cy for graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. A total of 151 patients were transplanted with CD3-depleted peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) by either CD34(+) selection, CD3(+) CD19(+) depletion, TCRalphabeta(+) CD19(+) depletion or CD45RA(+) depletion, added to CD34(+) selection for GvHD prophylaxis. The PBSCs were the only source in patients following ex vivo TCD haplo-HSCT; bone marrow was the source in 9 of 41 patients following PT-CY haplo-HSCT. Engraftment was achieved in 91.3% of cases. A donor younger than 30 years, and the development of chronic GvHD were positive factors influencing survival, whereas positive minimal residual disease (MRD) before transplant and lymphoid disease were negative factors. The probability of relapse increased with lymphoid malignancies, a donor killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) haplotype A and positive MRD pretransplant. No difference was found in overall survival, disease-free survival or relapse incidence between the two platforms. Relapse is still of concern in both platforms, and it should be the focus of future efforts.

Epub 2019 Oct 17.,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin K2 (VK2) has been reported to induce apoptosis in many types of cancer cells including leukemia. However, there are no precise reports regarding the breast cancer cells. From the stand point of clinical implications of VK2 including chemoprevention, we investigated the effects of VK2 on breast cancer cell lines. METHODS: Breast cancer cell lines were cultured with VK2, and the cytotoxicity and cell death phenotype were examined. The HL-60 leukemia cells were used as a control for VK2-induced apoptosis. RESULTS: VK2 exhibited the cytotoxic effect, especially in triple negative breast cancer cell lines, namely, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. However, in contrast to HL-60 cells, typical features of the cells undergoing apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation, nuclear fragments, and cleavage of caspase-3 were not detected. Transmission electron microscopy exhibited an increased number of autophagosomes/autolysosomes with plasma membrane integrity. An autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine, apparently attenuated VK2-induced cytotoxicity, which indicated the involvement of autophagy-dependent cell death. Interestingly, both VK2-induced non-apoptotic cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells and VK2-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells were suppressed in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers. Therefore, ROS production by VK2 seems to be located up-stream in the molecular machinery for both the types of cell death execution. CONCLUSION: The VK2 induced non-apoptotic cell death along with autophagy, in triple negative breast cancer cell lines. Cell death phenotype induced by VK2 appears to differ among the type of cancers. This suggests the possibility of using VK2 for the breast cancer therapy.",,"['S1411011/the Strategic Research Foundation at Private University from the', 'Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology', 'JP26460478/JSPS KAKENHI']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Breast cancer', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Vitamin K2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this phase I/II study, we aimed to reduce the risk of viral complications and disease relapses by administrating donor-derived CD8(pos) T cells directed against cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and adenovirus antigens, tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA). Twenty-seven of thirty-six screened HLA-A*02:01(pos) patients and their CMV(pos) and/or EBV(pos) donors were included. Using MHC-I-Streptamers, 27 T-cell products were generated containing a median of 5.2 x 10(6) cells. Twenty-four products were administered without infusion-related complications at a median of 58 days post alloSCT. No patients developed graft-versus-host disease during follow-up. Five patients showed disease progression without coinciding expansion of TAA/MiHA-specific T cells. Eight patients experienced CMV- and/or EBV-reactivations. Four of these reactivations were clinically relevant requiring antiviral treatment, of which two progressed to viral disease. All resolved ultimately. In 2/4 patients with EBV-reactivations and 6/8 patients with CMV-reactivations, viral loads were followed by the expansion of donor-derived virus target-antigen-specific T cells. In conclusion, generation of multi-antigen-specific T-cell products was feasible, infusions were well tolerated and expansion of target-antigen-specific T cells coinciding viral reactivations was illustrated in the majority of patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 17.,"Inversion of chromosome 16 (inv(16)) generates a fusion gene CBFB-MYH11, which is a driver mutation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Gene expression profiling suggests that Gata2, a hematopoietic transcription factor, is a top upregulated gene in preleukemic Cbfb-MYH11 knockin mice and is expressed in human inv(16) AML. On the other hand, we have also identified recurrent monoallelic deletions of GATA2 in relapsed human CBF-AML patients. To clarify the role of Gata2 in leukemogenesis by Cbfb-MYH11, we generated conditional Cbfb-MYH11 knockin mice with Gata2 heterozygous knockout. Gata2 heterozygous knockout reduced abnormal myeloid progenitors, which are capable of inducing leukemia in the Cbfb-MYH11 mice. Consequently, Cbfb-MYH11 mice with Gata2 heterozygous knockout developed leukemia with longer latencies than those with intact Gata2. Interestingly, leukemic cells with Gata2 heterozygous knockout gained higher number of mutations and showed more aggressive phenotype in both primary and transplanted mice. Moreover, leukemic cells with Gata2 heterozygous knockout showed higher repopulating capacity in competitive transplantation experiments. In summary, reduction of Gata2 activity affects mutational dynamics of leukemia with delayed leukemia onset in Cbfb-MYH11 knockin mice, but paradoxically results in a more aggressive leukemia phenotype, which may be correlated with leukemia relapse or poor prognosis in human patients.",,['Z01 HG000030/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC7056539,,['NIHMS1541018'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 17.,"CD19-redirected CAR-T immunotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy for treatment of B cell lymphoma, however, many patients often relapsed due to antigen loss. Therefore, it is urgently needed to explore other suitable antigens targeted by CAR-T cells to cure B cell lymphoma. Igbeta is a component of the B cell receptor (BCR) complex, which is highly expressed on the surface of lymphoma cells. In this study, we engineered T cells to express anti-Igbeta CAR with CD28 costimulatory signaling moiety and observed that Igbeta-CAR T cells could efficiently recognize and eliminate Igbeta(+) lymphoma cells both in vitro and in two different lymphoma xenograft models. The specificity of Igbeta-CAR T cells was further confirmed through wild type or mutated Igbeta gene transduction together with Igbeta-specific knockout in target cells. Of note, both the in vitro and in vivo effect of Igbeta CAR-T cells was comparable with that of CD19 CAR-T cells. Importantly, Igbeta CAR-T cells recognized and eradicated patient-derived lymphoma cells in the autologous setting.

Epub 2019 Oct 17.,"CD9 has been implicated in cancer progression but its prognostic relevance and therapeutic potential in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) are largely unknown. In a cohort of pediatric BCP-ALL patients, we found that CD9(+) cases had a significantly lower 5-year relapse-free survival rate than CD9(-) cases. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that CD9 positivity independently predicted inferior survival outcomes, and could be applied with established prognostic features, including prednisone response and cytogenetic status, to refine patient stratification. Administration of CD9 antibody substantially suppressed disease progression in NOD/SCID mice xenografted with CD9(+) cell lines and primary leukemic blasts from patients with high-risk and refractory BCP-ALL, without compromising hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. Combination of anti-CD9 with conventional chemotherapy further reduced leukemic burden and prolonged animal survival. Mechanistically, CD9 blockade inhibited leukemic cell proliferation, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, activated p38, and enhanced chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis. Further, CD9 physically interacted with integrin very late antigen-4, regulated affinity to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and was involved in leukemia-stroma interaction. Collectively, our study established CD9 as a new prognostic marker, validated the preclinical efficacy of CD9 antibody, and laid the foundation for clinical development of CD9-targeted therapy for high-risk and refractory pediatric BCP-ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One difficulty is the paucity of clinical grade manufacturing platforms to support the large scale expansion of highly active NK cells. We created an NK cell feeder cell line termed 'NKF' through overexpressing membrane bound IL-21 that is capable of inducing robust and sustained proliferation (>10,000-fold expansion at 5 weeks) of highly cytotoxic NK cells. The expanded NK cells exhibit increased cytotoxic function against a panel of blood cancer and solid tumor cells as compared to IL-2-activated non-expanded NK cells. The NKF-expanded NK cells also demonstrate efficacy in mouse models of human sarcoma and T cell leukemia. Mechanistic studies revealed that membrane-bound IL-21 leads to an activation of a STAT3/c-Myc pathway and increased NK cell metabolism with a shift towards aerobic glycolysis. The NKF feeder cell line is a promising new platform that enables the large scale proliferation of highly active NK cells in support of large scale third party NK cell clinical studies that have been recently intiatied.

In response, the cell initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR) to reestablish homeostasis. Additionally, in response to ER stress, various cell types mount an inflammatory response involving interleukin (IL)-6. While IL-6 has been widely studied, the impact of ER stress on other members of the IL-6 cytokine family, including oncostatin (OSM), IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) remains to be elucidated. Here, we have examined the expression of the IL-6 family cytokines in response to pharmacologically-induced ER stress in astrocytes and macrophages, which express IL-6 in response to ER stress through different mechanisms. Our findings indicate that, in astrocytes, ER stress regulates mRNA expression of the IL-6 family of cytokines that is, in part, mediated by PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and Janus kinase (JAK) 1. Additionally, in astrocytes, CNTF expression was suppressed through a PERK-dependent mechanism. Macrophages display a different profile of expression of the IL-6 family that is largely independent of PERK. However, IL-6 expression in macrophages was dependent on JAK signaling. Overall, this study demonstrates the cell-specific and differential mechanisms controlling expression of the IL-6 family of cytokines in response to ER stress.",,"['R01 NS099304/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AG052375/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 GM104942/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6797742,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current CNS-directed therapies cause significant toxicities and are only partially effective. Moreover, the impact of the CNS microenvironment on leukemia biology is poorly understood. In this study we showed that leukemia cells associated with the meninges of xenotransplanted mice, or co-cultured with meningeal cells, exhibit enhanced chemoresistance due to effects on both apoptosis balance and quiescence. From a mechanistic standpoint, we found that leukemia chemoresistance is primarily mediated by direct leukemia-meningeal cell interactions and overcome by detaching the leukemia cells from the meninges. Next, we used a co-culture adhesion assay to identify drugs that disrupted leukemia-meningeal adhesion. In addition to identifying several drugs that inhibit canonical cell adhesion targets we found that Me6TREN (Tris[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine), a novel hematopoietic stem cell-mobilizing compound, also disrupted leukemia-meningeal adhesion and enhanced the efficacy of cytarabine in treating CNS leukemia in xenotransplanted mice.

Epub 2019 Oct 5.,"Alterations in normal regulation of gene expression is one of the key features of hematopoietic malignancies. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms that regulate gene expression in these diseases, we dissected the role of the Ikaros protein in leukemia. Ikaros is a DNA-binding, zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional regulator and a tumor suppressor in leukemia. The use of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq-coupled with functional experiments-revealed that Ikaros regulates both the global epigenomic landscape and epigenetic signature at promoter regions of its target genes. Casein kinase II (CK2), an oncogenic kinase that is overexpressed in leukemia, directly phosphorylates Ikaros at multiple, evolutionarily-conserved residues. Phosphorylation of Ikaros impairs the protein's ability to regulate both the transcription of its target genes and global epigenetic landscape in leukemia. Treatment of leukemia cells with a specific inhibitor of CK2 restores Ikaros function, resulting in cytotoxicity of leukemia cells. Here, we review the mechanisms through which the CK2-Ikaros signaling axis regulates the global epigenomic landscape and expression of genes that control cellular proliferation in leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Oct 14.,"Regeneration of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (three major lineages of cardiac tissues) following myocardial infarction is the critical step to recover the function of the damaged heart. Myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 (Meis1) was first discovered in leukemic mice in 1995 and its biological function has been extensively studied in leukemia, hematopoiesis, the embryonic pattering of body axis, eye development and various genetic diseases, such as restless leg syndrome. It was found that Meis1 is highly associated with Hox genes and their cofactors to exert its regulatory effects on multiple intracellular signaling pathways. Recently with the advent of bioinformatics, biochemical methods and advanced genetic engineering tools, new function of Meis1 has been found to be involved in the cell cycle regulation of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. For example, inhibition of Meis1 expression increases the proliferative capacity of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes, whereas overexpression of Meis1 results in the reduction in the length of cardiomyocyte proliferative window. Interestingly, downregulation of one of the circular RNAs, which acts downstream of Meis1 in the cardiomyocytes, promotes angiogenesis and restores the myocardial blood supply, thus reinforcing better regeneration of the damaged heart. It appears that Meis1 may play double roles in modulating proliferation and regeneration of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells post-myocardial infarction. In this review, we propose to summarize the major findings of Meis1 in modulating fetal development and adult abnormalities, especially focusing on the recent discoveries of Meis1 in controlling the fate of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 Oct 14.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by abnormal production of white blood cells, red blood cells or platelets. The leukemia cells communicate with their microenvironment through nano-vesicle exosomes that are 30-100nm in diameter. These nano-vesicles are released from body fluids upon fusion of an endocytic compartment with the cell membrane. Exosomes function as cargo to deliver signaling molecules to distant cells. This allows cross-talk between hematopoietic cells and other distant target cell environments. Exosomes support leukemia growth by acting as messengers between tumor cells and the microenvironment as well as inducing oncogenic factors such as c-Myc. Exosomes have also been used as biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis of leukemia. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are two crucial signaling molecules involved in the AML pathogenesis and MYC stability. GSK-3 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that coordinates with over 40 different proteins during physiological/pathological conditions in blood cells. The dysregulation in GSK-3 has been reported during hematological malignancies. GSK-3 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting c-MYC, MCL-1 and beta-catenin. Conversely, GSK-3 can also act as tumor promoter in some instances. The pharmacological modulators of GSK-3 such as ABT-869, 6-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO), GS-87 and LY2090314 have shown promise in the treatment of hematological malignancy. PP2A is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of hematological malignancy. PP2A-activating drugs (PADs) can effectively antagonize leukemogenesis. The discovery of exosomes, kinase inhibitors and phosphatase activators have provided new hope to the leukemia patients. This review discusses the role of exosomes, GSK-3 and PP2A in the pathogenesis of leukemia. We provide evidence from both preclinical and clinical studies.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Here, we investigate whether oral vitamin C supplementation can correct vitamin C deficiency and affect the 5hmC/5mC ratio in patients with myeloid cancers treated with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis). RESULTS: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot trial (NCT02877277) in Danish patients with myeloid cancers performed during 3 cycles of DNMTi-treatment (5-azacytidine, 100 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days in 28-day cycles) supplemented by oral dose of 500 mg vitamin C (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) daily during the last 2 cycles. Fourteen patients (70%) were deficient in plasma vitamin C (< 23 muM) and four of the remaining six patients were taking vitamin supplements at inclusion. Global DNA methylation was significantly higher in patients with severe vitamin C deficiency (< 11.4 muM; 4.997 vs 4.656% 5mC relative to deoxyguanosine, 95% CI [0.126, 0.556], P = 0.004). Oral supplementation restored plasma vitamin C levels to the normal range in all patients in the vitamin C arm (mean increase 34.85 +/- 7.94 muM, P = 0.0004). We show for the first time that global 5hmC/5mC levels were significantly increased in mononuclear myeloid cells from patients receiving oral vitamin C compared to placebo (0.037% vs - 0.029%, 95% CI [- 0.129, - 0.003], P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of plasma vitamin C by oral supplementation leads to an increase in the 5hmC/5mC ratio compared to placebo-treated patients and may enhance the biological effects of DNMTis. The clinical efficacy of oral vitamin C supplementation to DNMTis should be investigated in a large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Recent studies have reported that cancer-associated chromosomal translocations could juxtapose distant complementary repetitive intronic sequences, resulting in the aberrant formation of circRNAs. However, among the reported fusion genes, only a small number of circRNAs were found to originate from fusion regions during gene translocation. We question if circRNAs could also originate from fusion partners during gene translocation. METHODS: Firstly, we designed divergent primers for qRT-PCR to identify a circRNA circAF4 in AF4 gene and investigated the expression pattern in different types of leukemia samples. Secondly, we designed two small interfering RNAs specially targeting the back-spliced junction point of circAF4 for functional studies. CCK8 cell proliferation and cell cycle assay were performed, and a NOD-SCID mouse model was used to investigate the contribution of circAF4 in leukemogenesis. Finally, luciferase reporter assay, AGO2 RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (FISH) were performed to confirm the relationship of miR-128-3p, circAF4, and MLL-AF4 expression. RESULTS: We discovered a circRNA, named circAF4, originating from the AF4 gene, a partner of the MLL fusion gene in MLL-AF4 leukemia. We showed that circAF4 plays an oncogenic role in MLL-AF4 leukemia and promotes leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, knockdown of circAF4 increases the leukemic cell apoptosis rate in MLL-AF4 leukemia cells, while no effect was observed in leukemia cells that do not carry the MLL-AF4 translocation. Mechanically, circAF4 can act as a miR-128-3p sponge, thereby releasing its inhibition on MLL-AF4 expression. We finally analyzed most of the MLL fusion genes loci and found that a number of circRNAs could originate from these partners, suggesting the potential roles of fusion gene partner-originating circRNAs (named as FP-circRNAs) in leukemia with chromosomal translocations. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the abnormal elevated expression of circAF4 regulates the cell growth via the circAF4/miR-128-3p/MLL-AF4 axis, which could contribute to leukemogenesis, suggesting that circAF4 may be a novel therapeutic target of MLL-AF4 leukemia.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Circular RNA', '*Leukemia progression', '*MLL-AF4 fusion protein']",PMC6798510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, low doses of APE1 inhibitor III increased the cytotoxic efficacy of talazoparib in MDS/CMML and AML cells.

However, there is significant interest in the application of CAR T-cell therapy to other hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma, where the current focus is on the development of B-cell maturation antigen-directed CAR T-cell therapy. Despite the successes achieved to date, there remain significant challenges associated with CAR T-cell therapy and substantial research efforts are underway to develop new targets and approaches.

All Mcm2cre/cre NHD13+ mice develop pre-T LBL, and 26% develop an unrelated, concurrent B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Copy number alteration (CNA) analysis demonstrated that pre-T LBLs were characterized by homozygous deletions of Pten and Tcf3 and partial deletions of Notch1 leading to Notch1 activation. In contrast, BCP-ALLs were characterized by recurrent deletions involving Pax5 and Ptpn1 and copy number gain of Abl1 and Nup214 resulting in a Nup214-Abl1 fusion.

Epub 2019 Oct 17.,"PURPOSE: Therapeutic radiation in childhood cancer has decreased over time with a concomitant increase in chemotherapy. Limited data exist on chemotherapy-associated subsequent malignant neoplasm (SMN) risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: SMNs occurring > 5 years from diagnosis, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers, were evaluated in survivors diagnosed when they were < 21 years old, from 1970 to 1999 in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (median age at diagnosis, 7.0 years; median age at last follow-up, 31.8 years). Thirty-year SMN cumulative incidence and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated by treatment: chemotherapy-only (n = 7,448), chemotherapy plus radiation (n = 10,485), radiation only (n = 2,063), or neither (n = 2,158). Multivariable models were used to assess chemotherapy-associated SMN risk, including dose-response relationships. RESULTS: Of 1,498 SMNs among 1,344 survivors, 229 occurred among 206 survivors treated with chemotherapy only. Thirty-year SMN cumulative incidence was 3.9%, 9.0%, 10.8%, and 3.4% for the chemotherapy-only, chemotherapy plus radiation, radiation-only, or neither-treatment groups, respectively. Chemotherapy-only survivors had a 2.8-fold increased SMN risk compared with the general population (95% CI, 2.5 to 3.2), with SIRs increased for subsequent leukemia/lymphoma (1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.7), breast cancer (4.6; 95% CI, 3.5 to 6.0), soft-tissue sarcoma (3.4; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.7), thyroid cancer (3.8; 95% CI, 2.7 to 5.1), and melanoma (2.3; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.5). SMN rate was associated with > 750 mg/m(2) platinum (relative rate [RR] 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.5), and a dose response was observed between alkylating agents and SMN rate (RR, 1.2/5,000 mg/m(2); 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.3). A linear dose response was also demonstrated between anthracyclines and breast cancer rate (RR, 1.3/100 mg/m(2); 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6). CONCLUSION: Childhood cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy only, particularly higher cumulative doses of platinum and alkylating agents, face increased SMN risk. Linear dose responses were seen between alkylating agents and SMN rates and between anthracyclines and breast cancer rates. Limiting cumulative doses and consideration of alternate chemotherapies may reduce SMN risk.",,"['K08 CA234232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC7001784,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 17.,"Detection of minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is important for guiding patient-specific clinical management. Natural killer (NK) cells can express various markers not typically associated with NK lineage, potentially confounding the detection of MRD by flow cytometry. We have observed CD33 expression on NK cells when evaluating for AML MRD in routine clinical practice in multiple patient samples. To characterize CD33 expression on NK cells, 40 peripheral blood or bone marrow samples with NK cells present at >5% of lymphocytes were selected for further assessment of NK cell phenotype and CD33 expression. Seven of the 40 samples (17.5%) were found to have CD33 expression on at least 5% of the NK cells. The CD33-positive NK cell population accounted for an average of 11.4% of NK cells (median 11.9%, range 8.0-15.3%) and 2.2% of total white cells (median 1.1%, range 0.1-10.1%). This NK cell subset expressed bright CD2, bright CD56, and dim CD16. On average, CD33 expression on NK cells was dimmer than on monocytes (mean median fluorescence intensity ratio 0.4; range 0.1-1.0). This study characterizes expression of CD33 on NK cells. Recognition of this pattern of antigen expression is critical in evaluating samples for MRD in patients with myeloid neoplasms, particularly AML.",['(c) 2019 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*CD33', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*flow cytometry', '*measurable residual disease', '*minimal residual disease', '*natural killer cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At many institutions, IVIG is dosed using total body weight (TBW). Recent evidence suggests that alternative dosing weights reduce waste without compromising clinical outcomes. The objective of this study was to quantify the waste reduction potential generated through the use of alternative IVIG dosing weights. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all IVIG doses administered from January 2011 through January 2016 to adults (>/=18 years). TBW and height at the time of administration were used to calculate prescribed dose (g/kg), ideal body weight (IBW), and adjusted body weight (AdjBW). Three dosing methods were analyzed, as follows: use of AdjBW if TBW is >120% IBW (method 1), AdjBW for all doses (method 2), and IBW for all doses (method 3). Outcomes included potential IVIG use averted, direct drug cost savings, and reductions in outpatient infusion times for each method. RESULTS: A total of 9,918 doses were administered to 2,564 patients over 5 years, representing an average usage of 75,994 g/year. If dosing methods 1, 2, and 3 had been used, the annual use of IVIG would have decreased by 21.9% (16,658 g/year, p < 0.001), 24.2% (18,371 g/year, p < 0.001), and 35.9% (27,252 g/year, p < 0.001), respectively. This translates into average annual cost differences of $2.37 million, $2.62 million, and $3.89 million and average annual outpatient infusion time savings of 841 hours, 920 hours, and 1,366 hours, respectively. CONCLUSION: IVIG dosing optimization through use of alternative dosing weights represents a significant source of waste reduction and cost reduction.","['(c) American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2019.

The objective of this work was to classify the most deleterious mutation in CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (CEBPA) and to predict their influence on the functional, structural, and expression levels by various Bioinformatics analysis tools. Methods: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were claimed from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database and then submitted into various functional analysis tools, which were done to predict the influence of each SNP, followed by structural analysis of modeled protein followed by predicting the mutation effect on energy stability; the most damaging mutations were chosen for additional investigation by Mutation3D, Project hope, ConSurf, BioEdit, and UCSF Chimera tools. Results: A total of 5 mutations out of 248 were likely to be responsible for the structural and functional variations in CEBPA protein, whereas in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) the result showed that among 350 SNPs in the 3'-UTR of CEBPA gene, about 11 SNPs were predicted. Among these 11 SNPs, 65 alleles disrupted a conserved miRNA site and 22 derived alleles created a new site of miRNA. Conclusions: In this study, the impact of functional mutations in the CEBPA gene was investigated through different bioinformatics analysis techniques, which determined that R339W, R288P, N292S, N292T, and D63N are pathogenic mutations that have a possible functional and structural influence, therefore, could be used as genetic biomarkers and may assist in genetic studies with a special consideration of the large heterogeneity of AML.",['(c) The Author(s) 2019.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CEBPA', 'bioinformatics analysis', 'genetic biomarkers', 'malignant disease']",PMC6777061,"['Declaration of conflicting interest:The author(s) declared no potential conflicts', 'of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this', 'article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These manifestations are often overlooked because of the underestimation of the magnitude of the ocular sequelae which may be blinding. Aim: This study aims to describe the ophthalmic findings in adult leukaemic patients at two teaching hospitals in Lagos, Nigeria. Patients and Methods: This was a clinic-based, comparison multicentre study conducted at Lagos University Teaching Hospital and Lagos State University Teaching Hospital over a 9-month period of May 2012-January 2013. The cases were newly diagnosed leukaemic patients (acute and chronic) from the haematology clinics. Controls were escorts of apparently normal patients. Detailed ocular examination was carried out after written informed consent was obtained. Analysis was done using SPSS 17. Results: A total of 160 eyes in 80 individuals examined comprised forty cases and forty controls. The results of the cases were compared with the age- and sex-matched controls. Leukaemic-related ophthalmic manifestations were present in 56 eyes (70.0%) of the cases studied. Findings in cases were periorbital oedema in 8 eyes (10%), subconjunctival haemorrhage in four eyes (5%), intraretinal haemorrhage as found in 25 eyes (31.3%), retinal venous tortuosity in 21 eyes (26.3%), Roth spots in 19 eyes (23.8%) and retinal infiltrates in 17 eyes (21.3%). Conclusion: Ophthalmic disorders occur in adult patients living with leukaemia.

The decision-making experiences of these eight pregnant women with cancer were categorized into three phases: the interaction between the woman and her fetus, family members, and medical staff; confrontation with dilemma and uncertainty; and redefinition of the women's own decisions. CONCLUSIONS: The experience of Japanese pregnant women with cancer in decision-making has two aspects: verbal and nonverbal communication with their surroundings and reflection. The role of a nurse is to guarantee these women continuous communication channels and frank dialogue, to empower them in expressing their thoughts and informational needs to medical staff and family members.",['(c) 2019 Japan Academy of Nursing Science.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Japanese', 'cancer', 'decision-making', 'pregnant women']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 16.,"The landscape of medical sequencing has rapidly changed with the evolution of next generation sequencing (NGS). These technologies have contributed to the molecular characterization of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), through the identification of recurrent gene mutations, which are present in >80% of patients. These mutations contribute to a better classification and risk stratification of the patients. Currently, clinical laboratories include NGS genomic analyses in their routine clinical practice, in an effort to personalize the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of MDS and CMML. NGS technologies have reduced the cost of large-scale sequencing, but there are additional challenges involving the clinical validation of these technologies, as continuous advances are constantly being made. In this context, it is of major importance to standardize the generation, analysis, clinical interpretation and reporting of NGS data. To that end, the Spanish MDS Group (GESMD) has expanded the present set of guidelines, aiming to establish common quality standards for the adequate implementation of NGS and clinical interpretation of the results, hoping that this effort will ultimately contribute to the benefit of patients with myeloid malignancies.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Oct 16.,"Chlordecone, an organochlorine insecticide, was widely used in the French West Indies banana plantations. We set up a cohort of banana plantation workers who worked between 1973 and 1993, the period of authorized use of chlordecone. Vital status and causes of death were collected from French national registries. Workers were followed up from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2015. Cause-specific mortality in the cohort was compared to that of the general population of the French West Indies by computing standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). A total of 11,112 workers (149,526 person-years, 77% men) were included in the mortality analysis, and 3647 deaths occurred over the study period. There was a slight deficit in all-cause mortality, which was statistically significant in men (SMR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.96), but not in women (SMR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.04). All-cancer mortality did not differ significantly from that of the general population (men: SMR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.90-1.03; women: SMR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.89-1.21). Significant excesses of deaths were observed for stomach cancer in women (SMR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.24-2.89) and pancreatic cancer in women farm owners (SMR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.06-4.39).

For both kinds of complexes, homo- and heterobimetallic, at room temperature and in chloroform solution, the NNSS coordination mode (kinetic compounds) turns out to be unstable and therefore the resulting complexes rearrange into a thermodynamically more stable form (NS coordination mode).

Epub 2019 Sep 30.,"Purpose: Long-term venous access is cumbersome in children because of their thin caliber veins, less cooperative nature, and easy compromise of venous integrity. Hence, a study was conducted to evaluate the indication, efficacy, and safety of chemoport in children who require chronic venous access. Materials and Methods: Children who underwent chemoport insertion between January 2008 and December 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. Results: A total of 159 children (169 chemoports) were included in the study. The most common indication for chemoport insertion was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (51.5%). The mean chemoport days were 832+/-666 days. Among the 169 chemoports, 55.0% were removed after treatment completion. The chemoport was not removed in 35.5% of the patients, as 28.4% of the patients were still under treatment and 7.1% died during the treatment. Sixteen patients (0.1 per 1,000 chemoport days) had a premature chemoport removal. The indications were port-related bloodstream infection (12 patients), port pocket infection (1 patient), exposed chemoport (1 patient), and blocked chemoport catheter (2 patients). Twenty-two patients (0.15 per 1,000 chemoport days) had complications of port-related bloodstream infection (0.09 per 1,000 chemoport days), making it the most common. Other complications include block, fracture, arrhythmias, avulsion, bleeding, decubitus-over-port, and port pocket infection. Conclusion: Owing to the safe, reliable, and low complication rate of chemoports, more children can be saved from deadly illnesses. Chemoport is the best option for children who require chronic venous access.","['Copyright (c) 2019, The Korean Society for Vascular Surgery.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse effects', 'Child', 'Indwelilng catheter', 'Leukemia', 'Neoplasms', 'Vascular access devices']",PMC6774434,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors have nothing to disclose.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antibody therapy is reportedly effective against ocular inflammation. However, side effects of TNF-alpha inhibition have been reported, particularly in the form of exacerbation of infections such as tuberculosis. Paradoxical reactions such as exacerbated inflammation are also well known. Around 20 million humans are infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) globally, and this virus can cause adult T-cell leukemia, HTLV-1-associated myelopathy and HTLV-1 uveitis. As for ophthalmic concerns, it has not been identified whether anti-TNF-alpha antibody stimulates HTLV-1-infected cells and ocular cells to induce HTLV-1 uveitis in HTLV-1 carriers. Here we investigated the effects of anti-TNF-alpha antibody on ocular status under HTLV-1 infectious conditions using ocular cells and HTLV-1-infected cells in vitro. We used the ARPE-19 human retinal pigment epithelial cell line as ocular cells considered to play an important role in the blood-ocular barrier, and the MT2 HTLV-1-infected cell line. Jurkat cells were used as controls. Infliximab (IFX) was used as an anti-TNF-alpha antibody to achieve TNF-alpha inhibition. We evaluated the production of inflammatory cytokines and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, proliferation of ARPE-19, expression of TNF-alpha receptor (TNF-R) and HTLV-1 proviral DNA, and the percentage of apoptotic ARPE-19. Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, TNF, and ICAM-1 were significantly elevated through contact between ARPE-19 and MT2. Treatment with IFX tented to inhibit TNF production, although the level of production was low, but changes in IL-6, IL-8, and ICAM-1 remained unaffected. Expression of TNFR was unaltered by IFX treatment. HTLV-1 proviral DNA was not significantly changed with treatment. No change in cell growth rate or apoptotic rate of ARPE-19 was seen with the addition of IFX. In conclusion, IFX did not exacerbate production of inflammatory cytokines, and did not affect expression of TNFR, proliferation of ARPE-19, HTLV-1 proviral load, or apoptosis of ARPE-19. These results suggest that IFX does not exacerbate HTLV-1-related inflammation in the eye and represents an acceptable treatment option under HTLV-1 infectious conditions.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Uchida, Kamoi, Ando, Wei, Karube and Ohno-Matsui.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['anti-TNF-alpha antibody', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type 1', 'infliximab', 'ocular inflammation', 'uveitis']",PMC6759608,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific indigenous Australian populations report infection rates of more than 40%, suggesting a potential evolution of the virus with global implications. HTLV-1 causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), and a neurological disease named HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Even though HTLV-1 transmission primarily occurs from cell-to-cell, there is still a gap of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of viral spread and disease progression. We have recently shown that Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) ubiquitously produced by cells may be used by HTLV-1 to transport viral proteins and RNA, and elicit adverse effects on recipient uninfected cells. The viral proteins Tax and HBZ are involved in disease progression and impairment of autophagy in infected cells. Here, we show that activation of HTLV-1 via ionizing radiation (IR) causes a significant increase of intracellular Tax, but not EV-associated Tax. Also, lower density EVs from HTLV-1-infected cells, separated by an Iodixanol density gradient, are positive for gp61+++/Tax+++/HBZ+ proteins (HTLV-1 EVs). We found that HTLV-1 EVs are not infectious when tested in multiple cell lines. However, these EVs promote cell-to-cell contact of uninfected cells, a phenotype which was enhanced with IR, potentially promoting viral spread. We treated humanized NOG mice with HTLV-1 EVs prior to infection and observed an increase in viral RNA synthesis in mice compared to control (EVs from uninfected cells). Proviral DNA levels were also quantified in blood, lung, spleen, liver, and brain post-treatment with HTLV-1 EVs, and we observed a consistent increase in viral DNA levels across all tissues, especially the brain. Finally, we show direct implications of EVs in viral spread and disease progression and suggest a two-step model of infection including the release of EVs from donor cells and recruitment of recipient cells as well as an increase in recipient cell-to-cell contact promoting viral spread.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Pinto, DeMarino, Pleet, Cowen, Branscome, Al Sharif, Jones,', 'Dutartre, Lepene, Liotta, Mahieux and Kashanchi.']","['R21 AI074410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI078859/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI043894/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 NS109443/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI127351/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS099029/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA', 'HTLV-1', 'RNA', 'cell-to-cell contact', 'extracellular vesicle', 'infection', 'tax', 'viral spread']",PMC6759572,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, even though the clinically relevant F691L gatekeeper mutation conferred resistance to current FLT3 drug quizartinib, PLX3397 remained unaffected. In this study, the protein-ligand interactions between FLT3 kinase domain (wild-type or F691L) and quizartinib or PLX3397 were compared via an integrated computational approach. The classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in conjunction with dynamic cross-correlation (DCC) analysis, solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and free energy calculations indicated that the resistant mutation may induce the conformational change of alphaC-helix and A-loop of the FLT3 protein. The major variations were controlled by the electrostatic interaction and SASA, which were allosterically regulated by residues Glu-661 and Asp-829. When FLT3-F691L was bound to quizartinib, a large conformational change was observed via combination of accelerated MD simulations (aMDs), principal component analysis (PCA), and free energy landscape (FEL) calculations. The umbrella sampling (US) simulations were applied to investigate the dissociation processes of the quizartinib or PLX3397 from FLT3-WT and FLT3-F691L. The calculated results suggested that PLX3397 had similar dissociation processes from both FLT3-WT and FLT3-F691L, but quizartinib dissociated more easily from FLT3-F691L than from FLT3-WT. Thus, reduced residence time was responsible for the FLT3-F691L resistance to inhibitors. These findings indicated that both the conformational changes of alphaC-helix and A-loop and the drug residence time should be considered in the design of drugs so that rational decisions can be made to overcome resistance to FLT3-F691L.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Sun, Xia, Zhao, Zheng, Zhang and Ying.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'F691L', 'FLT3', 'molecular modeling studies', 'resistance mechanism']",PMC6763581,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2019 Dec 12.,"The matrix (MA) domain of HIV-1 Gag plays key roles in virus assembly by targeting the Gag precursor to the plasma membrane and directing the incorporation of the viral envelope (Env) glycoprotein into virions. The latter function appears to be in part dependent on trimerization of the MA domain of Gag during assembly, as disruption of the MA trimer interface impairs Env incorporation. Conversely, many MA mutations that impair Env incorporation can be rescued by compensatory mutations in the trimer interface. In this study, we sought to investigate further the biological significance of MA trimerization by isolating and characterizing compensatory mutations that rescue MA trimer interface mutants with severely impaired Env incorporation. By serially propagating MA trimerization-defective mutants in T cell lines, we identified a number of changes in MA, both within and distant from the trimer interface. The compensatory mutations located within or near the trimer interface restored Env incorporation and particle infectivity and permitted replication in culture. The structure of the MA lattice was interrogated by measuring the cleavage of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) transmembrane Env protein by the viral protease in MLV Env-pseudotyped HIV-1 particles bearing the MA mutations and by performing crystallographic studies of in vitro-assembled MA lattices. These results demonstrate that rescue is associated with structural alterations in MA organization and rescue of MA domain trimer formation. Our data highlight the significance of the trimer interface of the MA domain of Gag as a critical site of protein-protein interaction during HIV-1 assembly and establish the functional importance of trimeric MA for Env incorporation.IMPORTANCE The immature Gag lattice is a critical structural feature of assembling HIV-1 particles, which is primarily important for virion formation and release. While Gag forms a hexameric lattice, driven primarily by the capsid domain, the MA domain additionally trimerizes where three Gag hexamers meet. MA mutants that are defective for trimerization are deficient for Env incorporation and replication, suggesting a requirement for trimerization of the MA domain of Gag in Env incorporation.

Epub 2019 Oct 16.,"BACKGROUND: On the basis of a previous report of increased chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) risk following peptic ulcer, we hypothesized that chronic Helicobacter pylori infection could serve as a risk factor for CML. METHODS: In a population-based, retrospective case-control study, we used Swedish registry data on 980 patients with CML and 4,960 age- and sex-matched controls to investigate associations between markers of previous infection with Helicobacter pylori and CML incidence. RESULTS: Previous diagnoses of dyspepsia, gastritis or peptic ulcers, as well as previous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication, were all associated with a significantly increased risk of CML (RRs, 1.5-2.0; P = 0.0005-0.05). Meanwhile, neither inflammatory bowel disease nor intake of NSAIDs were associated with CML, indicating that it is not gastrointestinal ulcer or inflammation per se that influences risk. CONCLUSIONS: The consistent associations suggest a shared background between gastric conditions and CML, and strengthen the case that Helicobacter pylori could constitute this common risk factor. IMPACT: As the etiology of CML is practically unknown, and Helicobacter pylori could potentially be a therapeutic target, even this indirect evidence encourages further studies on the potential involvement of Helicobacter pylori in CML etiology.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their anti-cancer activity is mediated through interaction of a wide array of activating and inhibitory receptors with their ligands on tumor cells. After activation, NK cells also secrete a variety of pro-inflammatory molecules that contribute to the final immune response by modulating other innate and adaptive immune cells. In this regard, external proteins from NK cell secretome and the mechanisms by which they mediate these responses are poorly defined. METHODS: TRANS-stable-isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (TRANS-SILAC) combined with proteomic was undertaken to identify early materials transferred between cord blood-derived NK cells (CB-NK) and multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Further in vitro and in vivo studies with knock-down of histones and CD138, overexpression of histones and addition of exogenous histones were undertaken to confirm TRANS-SILAC results and to determine functional roles of this material transferred. RESULTS: We describe a novel mechanism by which histones are actively released by NK cells early after contact with MM cells. We show that extracellular histones bind to the heparan sulfate proteoglycan CD138 on the surface of MM cells to promote the creation of immune-tumor cell clusters bringing immune and MM cells into close proximity, and thus facilitating not only NK but also T lymphocyte anti-MM activity. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a novel immunoregulatory role of NK cells against MM cells mediated by histones, and an additional role of NK cells modulating T lymphocytes activity that will open up new avenues to design future immunotherapy clinical strategies.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell-cell communication', '*Histones', '*Immunotherapy', '*Multiple myeloma', '*NK cells']",PMC6794915,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mammals, gain-of-function mutations as well as overexpression of EZH2 have been associated with several tumors, therefore making this subunit a suitable target for the development of selective inhibitors. Indeed, highly specific small-molecule inhibitors of EZH2 have been reported. In plants, mutations in some PRC2 components lead to embryonic lethality, but no trial with any inhibitor has ever been reported. RESULTS: We show here that the 1,5-bis (3-bromo-4-methoxyphenyl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one compound (RDS 3434), previously reported as an EZH2 inhibitor in human leukemia cells, is active on the Arabidopsis catalytic subunit of PRC2, since treatment with the drug reduces the total amount of H3K27me3 in a dose-dependent fashion. Consistently, we show that the expression level of two PRC2 targets is significantly increased following treatment with the RDS 3434 compound. Finally, we show that impairment of H3K27 trimethylation in Arabidopsis seeds and seedlings affects both seed germination and root growth.

Epub 2019 Oct 13.,"Large series of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) after ex vivo T cell-depleted (TCD) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) have not been reported previously. We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 266 patients (median age, 54 years) with AML who received CD34-selected TCD allo-HSCTs while in first (75%) or second (25%) complete remission (CR1/CR2) at a single institution. The conditioning regimens were all myeloablative, and no additional graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was given. The cumulative incidences of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD at 180 days were 14% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10% to 18%) and 3% (95% CI, 1% to 5%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 3 years was 3% (95% CI, 1% to 6%). The 3-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 21% (95% CI, 16% to 26%) and that of relapse was 21% (95% CI, 17% to 27%). Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 1, 3, and 5 years were 75%, 61%, and 56% and 68%, 57%, and 53%, respectively. There were no significant differences in OS, DFS, and relapse rates for patients who underwent transplantation in CR1 and those who did so in CR2. However, patients with high-risk cytogenetics at diagnosis had significantly poorer outcomes. The OS and DFS rates compare favorably with those for unmodified allo-HSCT, but with considerably lower rates of GVHD.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we demonstrate that viral DNA-capture sequencing (DNA-capture-seq) is useful to characterize HTLV-1 proviruses in naturally virus-infected individuals, providing comprehensive information about the proviral structure and the viral integration site. We analyzed peripheral blood from 98 naturally HTLV-1-infected individuals and found that defective proviruses were present not only in patients with leukemia, but also in those with other clinical entities. We further demonstrated that clones with defective-type proviruses exhibited a higher degree of clonal abundance than those with full-length proviruses. The frequency of defective-type proviruses in HTLV-1-infected humanized mice was lower than that in infected individuals, indicating that defective proviruses were rare at the initial phase of infection but preferentially selected during persistent infection. These results demonstrate the robustness of viral DNA-capture-seq for HTLV-1 infection and suggest potential applications for other virus-associated cancers in humans.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Oct 13.,"AIMS: With the improvement of the survival rates in children acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), some children ALL survivors show impaired cognitive function. Methotrexate (MTX), an essential component in ALL treatment, has been reported to be related to neurologic sequelae and to increased oxidative stress through its interactions with enzymes in the folate pathway. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is the main endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, and increased ADMA may result from increased oxidants. Melatonin is an antioxidant; however, its role in MTX neuropathy is not well studied. We developed a rat model mimicking child ALL treatment to explore peripheral and central homocysteine and ADMA regulation after MTX and found potential treatment choice. MAIN METHODS: Preweaning male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Experiment 1 evaluated spatial performance in rats with intrathecal (IT) MTX, intraperitoneal (IP) MTX, or combined IT and IP MTX, protocols mimicking ALL treatment in children. Experiment 2 focused on rats with combined IT and IP MTX, evaluating spatial performance and plasma and dorsal hippocampal homocysteine and ADMA levels, their regulation, and the protective effect of melatonin. KEY FINDINGS: Combined IT and IP MTX treatment caused in spatial deficits in developing rats, and melatonin restored the spatial performance. Alterations in peripheral and central homocysteine and ADMA concentrations and their regulation were found and could be alleviated by melatonin treatment. SIGNIFICANCES: Combined IP and IT MTX treatment caused spatial deficits in developing rats.

Epub 2019 Oct 15.,"Angiogenesis depends on a delicate balance between the different transcription factors, and their control should be considered necessary for preventing or treating diseases. Pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor regulating protein 1 (Prep1) is a homeodomain transcription factor that plays a primary role in organogenesis and metabolism. Observations performed in a Prep1 hypomorphic mouse model, expressing 3-5% of the protein, show an increase of embryonic lethality due, in part, to defects in angiogenesis. In this study, we provide evidence that overexpression of Prep1 in mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) stimulates migration, proliferation, and tube formation. These effects are paralleled by an increase of several proangiogenic factors and by a decrease of the antiangiogenic gene neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 (Notch1). Prep1-mediated angiogenesis involves the activation of the p160 Myb-binding protein (p160)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) pathway. Indeed, Prep1 overexpression increases its binding with p160 and induces a 4-fold increase of p160 and 70% reduction of PGC-1alpha compared with control cells. Incubation of MAECs with a synthetic Prep1(54-72) peptide, mimicking the Prep1 region involved in the interaction with p160, reverts the proangiogenic effects mediated by Prep1. In addition, Prep1 levels increase by 3.2-fold during the fibroblast growth factor beta (bFGF)-mediated endothelial colony-forming cells' activation, whereas Prep1(54-72) peptide reduces the capability of these cells to generate tubular-like structures in response to bFGF, suggesting a possible role of Prep1 both in angiogenesis from preexisting vessels and in postnatal vasculogenesis. Finally, Prep1 hypomorphic heterozygous mice, expressing low levels of Prep1, show attenuated placental angiogenesis and vessel formation within Matrigel plugs. All of these observations indicate that Prep1, complexing with p160, decreases PGC-1alpha and stimulates angiogenesis.-Cimmino, I., Margheri, F., Prisco, F., Perruolo, G., D'Esposito, V., Laurenzana, A., Fibbi, G., Paciello, O., Doti, N., Ruvo, M., Miele, C., Beguinot, F., Formisano, P., Oriente, F.

Epub 2019 Oct 31.,"In line with recent advances in neural drug design and sensitivity prediction, we propose a novel architecture for interpretable prediction of anticancer compound sensitivity using a multimodal attention-based convolutional encoder. Our model is based on the three key pillars of drug sensitivity: compounds' structure in the form of a SMILES sequence, gene expression profiles of tumors, and prior knowledge on intracellular interactions from protein-protein interaction networks. We demonstrate that our multiscale convolutional attention-based encoder significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on Morgan fingerprints and a selection of encoders based on SMILES, as well as the previously reported state-of-the-art for multimodal drug sensitivity prediction (R(2) = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.89). Moreover, the explainability of our approach is demonstrated by a thorough analysis of the attention weights. We show that the attended genes significantly enrich apoptotic processes and that the drug attention is strongly correlated with a standard chemical structure similarity index. Finally, we report a case study of two receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors acting on a leukemia cell line, showcasing the ability of the model to focus on informative genes and submolecular regions of the two compounds. The demonstrated generalizability and the interpretability of our model testify to its potential for in silico prediction of anticancer compound efficacy on unseen cancer cells, positioning it as a valid solution for the development of personalized therapies as well as for the evaluation of candidate compounds in de novo drug design.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CNN', '*EC50', '*GDSC', '*IC50', '*RNN', '*SMILES', '*anticancer compounds', '*attention', '*computational systems biology', '*deep learning', '*drug discovery', '*drug sensitivity', '*drug sensitivity prediction', '*explainability', '*gene expression', '*interpretability', '*lead discovery', '*machine learning', '*molecular fingerprints', '*molecular networks', '*multimodal', '*multiscale', '*personalized medicine', '*precision medicine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, there is an urgent need for elucidation of mechanism(s) underlying drug resistance in AML. In the present study, we found that AML cells showed less susceptibility to adriamycin (ADR) in the presence of hypoxia, while inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) by CdCl2 can make AML cells re-susceptibile to ADR even under hypoxia. Moreover, HIF-1alpha is overexpressed and plays an important role in ADR-resistance maintenance in resistant AML cells. We further found hypoxia or induction of HIF-1alpha can significantly upregulate yes-associated protein (YAP) expression in AML cells, and resistant cells express a high level of YAP. Finally, we found that YAP may not only enhance HIF-1alpha stability but also promote HIF-1alpha's activity on the target gene pyruvate kinase M2. In conclusion, our data indicate that HIF-1alpha or YAP may represent a therapeutic target for overcoming resistance toward adriamycin-based chemotherapy in AML.",['(c) 2019 International Federation for Cell Biology.'],['20161107/Shanghai Fengxian District Science and Technology Development Fund'],['NOTNLM'],"['HIF-1alpha', 'YAP', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'adriamycin', 'hypoxia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemia inhibitory factor (Lif) is known to maintain the pluripotency of stem cells including embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cells at least in vitro, but its actual roles in vivo remain to be elucidated. To clarify the function of Lif in teleost (medaka) testes, we examined the effects of Lif on spermatogenesis in a newly established cell culture system using a cell line (named Mtp1) derived from medaka testicular somatic cells as feeder cells. We found that addition of baculovirus-produced recombinant medaka Lif to the culture medium or co-culture with Lif-overexpressing Mtp1 cells increased the number of spermatogonia. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses of the medaka testes showed that mRNAs and proteins of Lif are expressed in spermatogonia and the surrounding Sertoli cells, with higher expression levels in type A (undifferentiated) spermatogonia than in type B (differentiated) spermatogonia.

METHODS: Totally 160 de novo AML patients were recruited, and their bone marrow samples were collected before treatment for detecting the expressions of AKIP1, CXCL1, and CXCL2 by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Complete remission (CR) was assessed after induction treatment, and event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated. RESULTS: AKIP1 expression was positively associated with CXCL1 (P < .001) and CXCL2 expression (P < .001). AKIP1 high expression was correlated with FAB classification (P = .022), monosomal karyotype (P = .001), and poor risk stratification (P = .013), while CXCL2 high expression was associated with monosomal karyotype (P = .001). As for treatment response, AKIP1 high expression exhibited a trend to be increased in non-CR patients compared with CR patients, while without statistical significance (P = .105). However, no correlation of CXCL1 (P = .418) or CXCL2 (P = .685) with CR achievement was observed. Most importantly, AKIP1 and CXCL1 were negatively correlated with accumulating EFS and OS (all P < .05), while CXCL2 only showed a trend to be negatively associated with accumulating EFS (P = .069) and OS (P = .055; but without statistical significance).

Epub 2019 Oct 16.,"BACKGROUND: This work aimed to evaluate oxidative stress in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with tunisian (IM) vs controls and in CML patients with resistance to IM vs patients without resistance to IM. METHODS: The study included 40 CML patients and 34 controls. Of 40 patients with CML, 26 patients were developed in resistance to IM. The oxidant/antioxidant markers were evaluated by spectrophotometric methods for all used samples. RESULTS: For CML patients, increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) levels were found compared to controls (P < .001; P = .01). Higher catalase (CAT) activity (P = .048) and lower superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, reduced Glutathione (GSH) and vitamin C levels were found in CML patients (P < .001). The comparison between the resistant vs no-resistant CML patients revealed higher MDA level (P = .02) and CAT and SOD activities in IM-resistant patients (P = .04, P = .03). GPx activity was reduced (P = .04). Furthermore, increased mean ratio of MDA/GSH, MDA/GPx, and SOD/(GPx + CAT) was found in IM-resistant patients as compared with no-resistant (P = .01, P = .01, P = .035). The mean ratio of GPx/GSH in the IM-resistant CML patients was lower than in IM no-resistant one (P = .039). For IM-resistant patients, we found negative correlation between MDA level and the ratio SOD/(CAT + GPx) (r = -0.46, P = .002); and positive correlation between SOD and (CAT + GPx) activities (r = 0.38, P = .06) and between GSH level and GPx activity (r = 0.53, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results have shown a highly disturbed oxidative profile in IM-resistant CML patients as compared to no-resistant. The H2 O2 has a key role in the resistance to IM treatment.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

This may result in thrombosis or bleeding complications due to binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers to platelets. Paediatric CML is very rare and no systematic investigation on clinical complications of elevated platelets has been reported. Data on platelet count and associated haemostaseological complications were retrospectively analysed in a cohort of 156 children with CML. Fifty-one percent (81/156) patients presented with thrombocytosis (platelet count> 500 x 10(9) /l), and were extreme (>1 000 x 10(9) /l) in 23/156 (16%). There were no cases of thrombosis but mild bleeding signs were present in 12% (n = 9) children with thrombocytosis. Bleeding occurred without correlation to elevated platelet counts and was associated with reduced large VWF multimers, indicating a diagnosis of acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS), which resolved after initiation of CML treatment. Patients with paediatric CML frequently exhibit high platelet counts not resulting in thrombosis. In patients with thrombocytosis mild bleeding signs due to a low percentage of large VWF multimers can be demonstrated. AVWS may be underdiagnosed in paediatric CML (Clinical-Trials.gov NCT00445822, 9 March 2007).",['(c) 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Sonnenstrahl e. V.

Latent herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) genome remains as an episome in the nucleus of the infected neurons. Accordingly, depending on the location of the viral genomes in the nucleus, they could be targeted by different types of epigenetic regulations important for the establishment and stability of latency, and ultimately for the capacity of HSV-1 to reactivate. Therefore, it is important to take into consideration the interaction of the viral genomes with the nuclear environment to integrate this aspect in the overall set of physiological, immunological, and molecular data that have been produced, and which constitute the main knowledge regarding the biology of HSV-1.

Epub 2019 Oct 15.,"PURPOSE: Microsatellites are widely distributed repetitive DNA motifs, accounting for approximately 3% of the genome. Due to mismatch repair system deficiency, insertion or deletion of repetitive units often occurs, leading to microsatellite instability. In this review, we aimed to explore the relationship between MSI and biological behaviour of colorectal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, lymphoma/leukaemia and endometrial carcinoma, as well as the application of frameshift peptide vaccines in cancer therapy. METHODS: The relevant literature from PubMed and Baidu Xueshu were reviewed in this article. The ClinicalTrials.gov database was searched for clinical trials related to the specific topic. RESULTS: Microsatellite instability is divided into three subtypes: high-level, low-level microsatellite instability, and stable microsatellites. The majority of tumour patients with high-level microsatellite instability often show a better efficacy and prognosis than those with low-level microsatellite instability or stable microsatellites. In coding regions, especially for genes involved in tumourigenesis, microsatellite instability often results in inactivation of proteins and contributes to tumourigenesis. Moreover, the occurrence of microsatellite instability in coding regions can also cause the generation of frameshift peptides that are thought to be unknown and novel to the individual immune system. Thus, these frameshift peptides have the potential to be biomarkers to raise tumour-specific immune responses. CONCLUSION: MSI has the potential to become a key predictor for evaluating the degree of malignancy, efficacy and prognosis of tumours. Clinically, MSI patterns will provide more valuable information for clinicians to create optimal individualized treatment strategies based on frameshift peptides vaccines.",,"['2018-KYYWFMY-0008/Fundamental Research Business Expense of Universities in', 'Heilongjiang Province']",['NOTNLM'],"['Carcinoma', 'Frameshift peptide', 'Microsatellite instability', 'Prognosis', 'Targeted therapies']",PMC6861542,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 15.,"PURPOSE: Ecotropic viral integration site-1 (EVI1) is a transcription factor that contributes to the unfavorable prognosis of leukemia, some epithelial cancers, and glial tumors. However, the biological function of EVI1 in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains unclear. Based on microarray experiments, EVI1 has been reported to regulate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transcription. Signal transduction via EGFR plays an essential role in glioblastoma. Therefore, we performed this study to clarify the importance of EVI1 in GBM by focusing on the regulatory mechanism between EVI1 and EGFR transcription. METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical staining and analyzed the EVI1-expression in glioma tissue. To determine the relationship between EVI1 and EGFR, we induced siRNA-mediated knockdown of EVI1 in GBM cell lines. To investigate the region that was essential for the EVI1 regulation of EGFR expression, we conducted promoter reporter assays. We performed WST-8 assay to investigate whether EVI1 affected on the proliferation of GBM cells or not. RESULTS: It was observed that 22% of GBM tissues had over 33% of tumor cells expressing EVI1, whereas no lower-grade glioma tissue had over 33% by immunohistochemistry. In A172 and YKG1 cells, the expression levels of EGFR and EVI1 correlated. Analysis of the EGFR promoter region revealed that the EGFR promoter (from - 377 to - 266 bp) was essential for the EVI regulation of EGFR expression. We showed that EVI1 influenced the proliferation of A172 and YKG1 cells.

We describe an unusual case of T-ALL presenting with folliculocentric, erythematous papules on the face, histologically resembling mycosis fungoides (MF). Immunostaining for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) was positive in tumor cells, supporting the diagnosis of cutaneous involvement by T-ALL. TdT is a nuclear enzyme expressed by immature lymphoid malignancies, but the expression pattern of this marker is not well characterized in the skin. We aimed to assess TdT staining in skin biopsies with similar-appearing lymphocytic infiltrates. Methods: We evaluated the immunostaining profile of TdT in a cohort of 23 patients, including 13 cases of MF and 10 cases of spongiotic dermatitis. Results: The lymphocytes in the MF and spongiotic dermatitis cases lacked nuclear staining for TdT. Nonspecific, granular, cytoplasmic staining was observed in a small number of background cells. Conclusions: TdT may assist dermatopathologists in discriminating malignant infiltrates of T-ALL from other conditions.","['Copyright (c) 2019 by S.

The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway can contribute to cancer MDR. In the current study, Smoothened (Smo) was selected as the experimental target due to its importance in the Hh pathway in order to evaluate its probable role in pediatric B-ALL drug resistance. Patients and methods: The study included 27 pediatric B-ALL and 16 control bone marrow samples. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to investigate the expression levels of Smo and miR-326 as the key players of the Hh pathway. Western blot analysis was performed. The presence of minimal residual disease was studied using PCR-SSCP. The association between Smo expression and drug resistance was analyzed statistically. Results: Results showed a significant increase in the Smo expression levels in drug-resistant patients in comparison with drug-sensitive children with B-ALL (P=0.0128, AUC=0.82). A considerable negative association between miR-326 and Smo expression levels was identified (r=-0.624, P=0.002). A binomial test confirmed the regulatory role of miR-326 on the translational repression of Smo (P=0.031). Statistics showed no association between Smo and ABCA2 expression levels. However, a significant positive correlation was observed between the Smo and ABCA3 transcripts in the resistant ALL children (r=0.607, P=0.016). Conclusion: Data revealed the possible oncogenic impact of Smo on leukemogenesis and drug resistance in pediatric B-ALL. Upregulation of Smo was introduced, for the first time, as a prognostic factor for drug resistance in childhood B-ALL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows a positive correlation between Smo and ABCA3 expression levels in pediatric B-ALL, explaining a possible mechanism for the development of drug resistance in this cancer.

Epub 2019 Oct 15.,"Targeting Notch signaling has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), particularly in NOTCH1-mutated patients. We provide first evidence that the Notch ligand DLL4 is a potent stimulator of Notch signaling in NOTCH1-mutated CLL cells while increases cell proliferation. Importantly, DLL4 is expressed in histiocytes from the lymph node, both in NOTCH1-mutated and -unmutated cases. We also show that the DLL4-induced activation of the Notch signaling pathway can be efficiently blocked with the specific anti-Notch1 antibody OMP-52M51. Accordingly, OMP-52M51 also reverses Notch-induced MYC, CCND1, and NPM1 gene expression as well as cell proliferation in NOTCH1-mutated CLL cells. In addition, DLL4 stimulation triggers the expression of protumor target genes, such as CXCR4, NRARP, and VEGFA, together with an increase in cell migration and angiogenesis. All these events can be antagonized by OMP-52M51. Collectively, our results emphasize the role of DLL4 stimulation in NOTCH1-mutated CLL and confirm the specific therapeutic targeting of Notch1 as a promising approach for this group of poor prognosis CLL patients.",,,,,PMC7002297,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 15.,"Osteosarcoma is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. Super-enhancers (SE) have been highlighted as critical oncogenic elements required for maintaining the cancer cell characteristics. However, the regulatory role of SEs in osteosarcoma properties has not yet been elucidated. In the current study, we found that osteosarcoma cells and clinical specimens shared a significant fraction of SEs. Moreover, leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) was identified as an essential factor under the control of osteosarcoma-specific SE. The expression of LIF was positively correlated with the stem cell core factor genes in osteosarcoma. Furthermore, LIF recombinant protein-treated osteosarcoma cells displayed enhanced stem cell-like characteristics, such as increased sphere-forming potential, stimulated self-renewal, upregulated metastasis ability, and increased stemness-related gene expression. Notably, the histone 3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) demethylase UTX was found as a key activator of LIF transcription in osteosarcoma. The UTX inhibitor, GSK-J4, induced H3K27me3 accumulation and impaired histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) at LIF gene locus, leading to LIF signaling pathway inhibition. GSK-J4 treatment resulted in profound defects in stem cell-like characteristics and stemness-related gene activation in osteosarcoma by modulating the H3K27ac of NOTCH1 signaling pathway gene loci. The NOTCH1 inhibitor Crenigacestat (TargetMol, T3633) repressed LIF-mediated activation of the stemness-related genes in osteosarcoma patient-derived primary tissues. IMPLICATIONS: This study reveals osteosarcoma SE profiles and uncovers a distinct tumor-stemness epigenetic regulatory mechanism in which an osteosarcoma-specific SE-mediated factor, LIF, promotes osteosarcoma stemness gene activation via NOTCH1 signaling pathway.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of CH increases with age and environmental exposures such as cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The most frequent mutations occur in epigenetic regulators, such as DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1, leading to dysregulation of tumor suppressor function, pathogen response, and inflammation. These dysregulated processes elevate risk of overall mortality, cardiovascular disease, and eventual hematologic malignancy (HM). CH is likely acting as an initiating event leading to HM when followed by cooperating mutations. However, further evidence suggests that CH exerts a bystander influence through its pro-inflammatory properties. Delineating the mechanisms that lead to the onset and expansion of CH as well as its contribution to risk of HM is crucial to defining a management and intervention strategy. In this review, we discuss the potential causes, consequences, technical considerations, and possible management strategies for CH in the context of HMs and pre-HMs.",['Copyright (c) 2020 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.'],,,,PMC7117948,,,,,,['2022/04/01 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have reported that the lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1) is involved in multiple human malignant tumors, while its expression and role in AML is still unexplored. Here, we show that SNHG1 is highly expressed in AML specimens from non-M3 patients, as well as AML cell lines. Meanwhile, upregulation of SNHG1 is correlated with poor prognosis. Notably, SNHG1 facilitates the proliferation and inhibits the apoptosis of AML cells in vitro Consistent with these findings, knockdown of SNHG1 significantly inhibits AML progression in an immunodeficient mouse model. Mechanistically, we found that an anti-tumor microRNA-101 (miR-101) is upregulated and its target genes are downregulated in AML cells after SNHG1 knockdown. Further investigations display that SNHG1 can serve as a competing endogenous RNA to inhibit miR-101. In conclusion, our data indicate that SNHG1 plays an important role in facilitating AML progression at least in part by negatively regulating miR-101, and provides a new target for treating AML.",['(c) 2019.

In this work, we analyzed the effects of morphine on leukemia cells at all stages of development and addressed its underlying mechanism. We showed that clinically relevant concentrations of morphine promoted growth without affecting survival in blast phase-chronic myeloid leukemia (BP-CML) K562 and LAMA84cells. In addition, morphine alleviated the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in BP-CML cells. We further found that morphine increased colony formation and replating capacity of CD34 stem/progenitor derived from BP-CML patients. In addition, morphine alleviated the inhibitory effects of BCR-ABL TKIs in cell survival, colony formation and replating capacity in BP-CML CD34(+)stem/progenitor cells. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that morphine specifically activated Wnt signaling via increasing beta-catenin activity and Wnt target genes transcription in K562 and CD34(+)stem/progenitor cells. The effects of morphine in BP-CML were abolished by Wnt inhibitor LGK-974 or XAV939, which further confirmed that morphine protected BP-CML cells from BCR-ABL TKIs-induced toxicity via activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

Platelet transfusions are commonly given to raise a low platelet count and reduce the risk of clinical bleeding (prophylaxis) or stop active bleeding (therapy). Recent studies have shown that many patients continue to experience bleeding despite the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions. Tranexamic acid is an anti-fibrinolytic, which reduces the breakdown of clots formed in response to bleeding. Anti-fibrinolytics have been shown to prevent bleeding, decrease blood loss and use of red cell transfusions in elective and emergency surgery, and are used widely in these settings. The aim of this trial is to test whether giving tranexamic acid to patients receiving treatment for haematological malignancies reduces the risk of bleeding or death and the need for platelet transfusions. METHODS: This is a multinational randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, superiority trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid (given intravenously or orally) or a matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by site. Patients with haematological malignancies receiving intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation (or both) who are at least 18 years of age and expected to become severely thrombocytopenic for at least 5 days will be eligible for this trial. The primary outcome of the trial is the proportion of patients who died or had bleeding of World Health Organization grade 2 or above during the first 30 days of the trial. We will measure the rates of bleeding daily by using a short, structured assessment of bleeding, and we will record the number of transfusions given to patients. We will assess the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis for 120 days from the start of trial treatment. DISCUSSION: This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of using prophylactic tranexamic acid during a period of intensive chemotherapy and associated thrombocytopenia in people with haematological disorders. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was prospectively registered on Current Controlled Trials on 25 March 2015 (ISRCTN73545489) and is also registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03136445).",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-fibrinolytic', 'Bleeding', 'Chemotherapy', 'Haematological malignancy', 'Haematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'Leukaemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Tranexamic acid']",PMC6792262,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03136445'],,,,,,['TREATT Trial Collaboration (provisional)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor-specific defects in DNA repair mechanisms and activation of alternative repair routes create the opportunity to employ a phenomenon called ""synthetic lethality"" to eliminate cancer cells. Targeting the backup pathways may amplify endogenous and drug-induced DNA damage and lead to specific eradication of cancer cells. So far, the synthetic lethal interaction between BRCA1/2 and PARP1 has been successfully applied as an anticancer treatment. Although PARP1 constitutes a promising target in the treatment of tumors harboring deficiencies in BRCA1/2-mediated homologous recombination (HR), some tumor cells survive, resulting in disease relapse. It has been suggested that alternative RAD52-mediated HR can protect BRCA1/2-deficient cells from the accumulation of DNA damage and the synthetic lethal effect of PARPi. Thus, simultaneous inhibition of RAD52 and PARP1 might result in a robust dual synthetic lethality, effectively eradicating BRCA1/2-deficient tumor cells. In this review, we will discuss the role of RAD52 and its potential application in synthetic lethality-based anticancer therapies.",,"['Translational Research Program award 6565-19/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society', '2016/22/M/NZ7/00375/Narodowe Centrum Nauki', 'R01 CA186238/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'doctoral scholarship Etiuda6 DEC-2018/28/T/NZ7/00105/Polish National Science', 'Center', 'T32 CA009035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA repair', 'PARP1', 'RAD52', 'dual synthetic lethality', 'synthetic lethality']",PMC6827130,"['The authors declare no conflict of interest, financial, or otherwise.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unlikely that they can completely ""cure"" the disease. This might be because some subpopulations of CML-CP cells such as stem and progenitor cells are resistant to chemotherapy, even to the new generation of TKIs. Therefore, it is important to look for new methods of treatment to improve therapeutic outcomes. Previously, we have shown that class I p21-activated serine/threonine kinases (PAKs) remained active in TKI-naive and TKI-treated CML-CP leukemia stem and early progenitor cells. In this study, we aimed to determine if simultaneous inhibition of BCR-ABL1 oncogenic tyrosine kinase and PAK1/2 serine/threonine kinase exert better anti-CML effect than that of individual treatments. PAK1 was inhibited by small-molecule inhibitor IPA-3 (p21-activated kinase inhibitor III), PAK2 was downregulated by specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase was inhibited by imatinib (IM). The studies were conducted by using (i) primary CML-CP stem/early progenitor cells and normal hematopoietic counterparts isolated from the bone marrow of newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP and from healthy donors, respectively, (ii) CML-blast phase cell lines (K562 and KCL-22), and (iii) from BCR-ABL1-transformed 32Dcl3 cell line. Herein, we show that inhibition of the activity of PAK1 and/or PAK2 enhanced the effect of IM against CML cells without affecting the normal cells. We observed that the combined use of IM with IPA-3 increased the inhibition of growth and apoptosis of leukemia cells. To evaluate the type of interaction between the two drugs, we performed median effect analysis. According to our results, the type and strength of drug interaction depend on the concentration of the drugs tested. Generally, combination of IM with IPA-3 at the 50% of the cell kill level (EC50) generated synergistic effect. Based on our results, we hypothesize that IM, a BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, combined with a PAK1/2 inhibitor facilitates eradication of CML-CP cells.",,['2013/11/B/NZ7/02248/Narodowe Centrum Nauki'],['NOTNLM'],"['PAK inhibitors', 'PAK1/2', 'apoptosis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'imatinib (STI571)', 'synergy']",PMC6826736,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence demonstrated the association of TOP2 with topologically associated domains (TAD) boundaries and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites. At these sites, TOP2 promotes interactions between enhancers and gene promoters, and relieves torsional stress that accumulates at these physical barriers. Interestingly, in executing its enzymatic function, TOP2 contributes to DNA fragility through re-ligation failure, which results in persistent DNA breaks when unrepaired or illegitimately repaired. Here, we discuss the biological processes for which TOP2 is required and the steps at which it can introduce DNA breaks. We describe the repair processes that follow removal of TOP2 adducts and the resultant broken DNA ends, and present how these processes can contribute to disease-associated mutations. Furthermore, we examine the involvement of TOP2-induced breaks in the formation of oncogenic translocations of leukemia and papillary thyroid cancer, as well as the role of TOP2 and proteins which repair TOP2 adducts in other diseases. The participation of TOP2 in generating persistent DNA breaks and leading to diseases such as cancer, could have an impact on disease treatment and prevention.",,"['T32 GM008136/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA009109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RO1CA113863/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RO1GM101192/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM139787/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113863/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA fragility', '*DNA repair', '*DNA topoisomerases', '*TOP2 cleavage complex', '*chromatin organization', '*topoisomerases and disease']",PMC6826763,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously identified the LQB-223, 11a-N-Tosyl-5-deoxi-pterocarpan, as a promising compound in sensitizing doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells, with little toxicity to non-neoplastic cells. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying LQB-223 antitumor effects in 2D and 3D models of breast cancer. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells had migration and motility profile assessed by wound-healing and phagokinetic track motility assays, respectively. Cytotoxicity in 3D conformation was evaluated by measuring spheroid size and performing acid phosphatase and gelatin migration assays. Protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting. Our results show that LQB-223, but not doxorubicin treatment, suppressed the migratory and motility capacity of breast cancer cells. In 3D conformation, LQB-223 remarkably decreased cell viability, as well as reduced 3D culture size and migration. Mechanistically, LQB-223-mediated anticancer effects involved decreased proteins levels of XIAP, c-IAP1, and Mcl-1 chemoresistance-related proteins, but not survivin. Survivin knockdown partially potentiated LQB-223-induced cytotoxicity. Additionally, cell treatment with LQB-223 resulted in changes in the mRNA levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers, suggesting that it might modulate cell plasticity. Our data demonstrate that LQB-223 impairs 3D culture growth and migration in 2D and 3D models of breast cancer exhibiting different phenotypes.",,"['E-26/202-798/2017/Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do', 'Rio de Janeiro', 'Finance code 001/Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior', 'N/A/Programa de Oncobiologia/Fundacao do Cancer', ""N/A/L'oreal-UNESCO-ABC For Women in Science"", '304565/2016-4/Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico']",['NOTNLM'],"['LQB-223 compound', 'breast cancer', 'drug resistance']",PMC6834317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our modelling experiments and the chemical structures of the compounds predict the possibility of covalent inhibition. The most effective compounds triggered apoptosis in FLT3-ITD AML cells but had either weak or no effect in FLT3-independent leukemic and non-leukemic cell lines.

Epub 2019 Oct 12.,"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a malignancy of mature T lymphocytes induced by human T-cell leukemia virus-1 and has a poor outcome. New molecular targets for the prevention and treatment of ATL are needed urgently. We previously reported high expression of Sirtuin 1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent histone/protein deacetylase, in primary acute-type ATL cells. NAD(+) biosynthesis via nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) modulates Sirtuin 1 activity. Here, we examined the expression and effects of inhibiting NAMPT, a rate-limiting enzyme in NAD(+) biosynthesis, in ATL cells. We found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with acute-type ATL expressed significantly higher levels of NAMPT protein than cells from healthy subjects. FK866, a NAMPT inhibitor, induced apoptosis of freshly isolated ATL cells ex vivo and HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines in vitro, which was accompanied by activation of caspases, DNA fragmentation, and disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. However, a pan-caspase inhibitor failed to prevent this FK866-induced cell death, while FK866 increased the caspase-independent cell death mediator endonuclease G. Intriguingly, FK866 also activated autophagy, as demonstrated by increases in protein levels of autophagosome marker LC3-II. Thus, FK866 simultaneously activated apoptosis and autophagy. Finally, FK866 treatment markedly decreased the growth of human ATL tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice. We showed that NAMPT is highly expressed in primary ATL cells ex vivo, and that FK866 induces autophagy and caspase-dependent and -independent cell death pathways in vitro and has an anti-tumor activity in vivo. These results suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with this fatal disease.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, an early death (ED) remains one of the main causes of APL treatment failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of 91 children and adolescents with APL, who were consecutively registered at the (name of institution removed) Children's Center from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2017. Data were assessed for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index percentile, initial white blood cell count, peripheral blood blast count, and platelet count, hemoglobin value, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, fibrinogen level, serum creatinine level, APL morphology subtype (classic vs. hypogranular variant M3v), and FLT3 gene mutations. RESULTS: ED occurred in 12 of 91 (13.1%) patients and was mainly related to cerebral thromboembolism. Overall 66% of deaths occurred in the second week after diagnosis. ED was associated with white blood cell >/=10x10 cells/L (odds ratio of 8.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.48-48.26; P=0.0016), initial promyelocytes >/=20x10/L (odds ratio of 9.29; 95% CI=2.45-35.8; P=0.001), morphologic subtype M3v (odds ratio of 3.63; 95% CI=1.04-12.64; P=0.043), and creatinine serum levels >0.7 mg/dL (odds ratio of 6.78; 95% CI=1.83-25.13; P=0.004). In multivariate analyses, ED was associated with initial peripheral promyelocytes >/=20x10 blasts/L and creatinine serum levels >0.7 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: EDs were mainly caused by thrombohemorrhagic events and occurred within the second week after diagnosis. High peripheral promyelocytes and creatinine levels were predictors of ED in APL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of ABCC1-6 gene expression pattern for estimating recurrence in Iranian pediatric patients with ALL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Iranian pediatric patients with approved ALL enrolled in this study as 2 groups of case (relapsed ALL) and control (treated individuals who lasted for >3 years following their final treatment). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was done with GAPDH for expressing ABCC1-6 transporter genes. Cumulative doses of Vincristine, Daunorubicin, and L-Asparginase were checked for each patient. Gathered data analyzed with SPSS version 22 and REST 2009 software. RESULTS: Thirty-nine samples as 23 relapsed ALL and 16 controls enrolled. High expression of ABCC2-6 and low expression of ABCC1 were detected in pediatric patients with relapse. ABCC3 and ABCC4 had significant relation with high-risk patients of NCI group. Also, ABCC4 and ABCC6 had more expression with high doses of Daunorubicin and L-Asparginase.

Constitutive PTN deletion substantially reduced the numbers of CML stem cells capable of initiating CML in vivo. Hematopoietic cell-specific deletion of PTN suppressed CML development in BCR/ABL+ mice, suggesting that cell-autonomous PTN signaling was necessary for CML disease evolution. Mechanistically, PTN promoted CML stem cell survival and TKI resistance via induction of Jun and the unfolded protein response.

Epub 2019 Oct 15.,"This expert review offers a critical synthesis of the latest insights and approaches at targeting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in various cancers such as colorectal cancer, melanoma, leukemia, and breast and lung cancers. Notably, from organogenesis to cancer, the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling displays varied and highly versatile biological functions in animals, with virtually all tissues requiring the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in one way or the other. Aberrant expression of the members of the Wnt/beta-catenin has been implicated in many pathological conditions, particularly in human cancers. Mutations in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway genes have been noted in diverse cancers. Biochemical and genetic data support the idea that inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is beneficial in cancer therapeutics. The interaction of this important pathway with other signaling systems is also noteworthy, but remains as an area for further research and discovery. In addition, formation of different complexes by components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and the precise roles of these complexes in the cytoplasmic milieu are yet to be fully elucidated. This article highlights the latest medical technologies in imaging, single-cell omics, use of artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning techniques), genome sequencing, quantum computing, molecular docking, and computational softwares in modeling interactions between molecules and predicting protein-protein and compound-protein interactions pertinent to the biology and therapeutic value of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. We discuss these emerging technologies in relationship to what is currently needed to move from concept to actionable strategies in translating the Wnt/beta-catenin laboratory discoveries to Wnt-targeted cancer therapies and diagnostics in the clinic.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Wnt protein', '*cancer', '*cancer stem cells', '*clinical trials', '*genetic variation', '*metastasis', '*therapeutic', '*translational medicine', '*beta-catenin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a common finding, and the differential diagnosis can be broadly divided into primary malignant diseases and secondary causes that are expected physiologic responses of the bone marrow. Infections and chronic inflammatory conditions are common causes of secondary leukocytosis. A thorough history, physical examination, and peripheral blood smear are the basis of the initial evaluation. Constitutional symptoms along with an abnormal peripheral blood smear result indicate the need for evaluation for malignancy. Patients with chronic leukemias usually present with less severe symptoms than patients with acute leukemias. Symptoms generally are gradual in onset. Acute leukemias should be recognized quickly because they may be associated with life-threatening complications. Urgent referral to a hematology subspecialist is indicated in cases of suspected acute leukemia.","['Written permission from the American Academy of Family Physicians is required for', 'reproduction of this material in whole or in part in any form or medium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification and development of novel biomarkers could be beneficial for the diagnosis and prognosis of AML patients. Here, we aimed to identify the accurate DNA methylation prognostic signatures for AML patients. The DNA methylation data of AML patients and corresponding clinical information were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. CPG sites that correlates closely with the survival of the AML patients were identified and further combined into CPG sites pairs to screen the survival-related pairs. The prognostic signatures were identified by the C-index and forward search algorithms and validated by the verification group. Finally, the functional enrichment analysis was performed on these CPG sites. As a result, a total of 498 CPG sites associated with the overall survival of AML patients was obtained. A prognostic signature composed of 10 CPG sites pairs was obtained and validated. The functional enrichment analysis showed prognostic genes were mainly enriched in tumor protein processing, cell differentiation, blood leukocyte immunity, and platelet growth factor pathways. In summary, we identified two accurate prognostic methylation signatures (NDRG2 and TLR7), which would be served as a novel therapy target for AML.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*NDRG2', '*TLR7', '*methylation signature', '*prognostic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, administration of interferon-alpha2b to patients takes place thrice in a week due to short in vivo circulation half-life. OBJECTIVE: To extend the circulation half-life of IFN-alpha2b, it is conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG). However, PEGylation may results in reduction of its antiviral and antiproliferative activities but on the other side, it results in prolonged plasma half-life. METHODS: Human interferon-alpha2b was PEGylated with linear 20kDa methoxypolyethlene glycol (mPEG) Propionaldehyde (IFN-Ald20K), Y-Shaped 40kDa mPEG-Propionaldehyde (IFNAld40K), linear 20-kDa mPEG-Succinimidyl Succinate (IFN-NHS20K), and Y shaped 40kDa mPEG-Succinimidyl Succinate (IFN-NHS40K). Impact of PEG size, shape and PEGylation site was studied to establish their relationship with antiprolifetaive activities and serum retention time of PEGylated IFN-alpha2b. RESULT: RP-HPLC studies showed that larger PEGs (40kDa) increased the hydrodynamic volume and increased the serum retention time while antiproliferative activity in HepG2 cell line was decreased with increase in PEGylated interferon-alpha2b size. Molecular docking results also dictated the same effect that increase in PEGylated interferon-alpha2b size results in steric shielding of the receptor-binding site on interferon-alpha2b. IFN-Ald20K showed highest (45%) biological activity with serum half-life 40 hours while IFN-NHS40K showed least (7%) biological activity with serum halflife 56 hours. CONCLUSION: Thus, IFN-Ald40K with 12% residual activity and 62 hours of serum half-life proved to be a potent candidate for anticancer and antiviral effect with enhanced serum retention time.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Interferon-alpha2b', 'PEGylation', 'antiproliferative activities', 'gene cloning', 'molecular docking', 'protein expression.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 22.,"Introduction: Despite advancements over the last 2 years, outcomes for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are poor; however, a greater comprehension of disease mechanisms has driven the investigation of new targeted treatments. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate cell cycle progression, transcription and DNA repair, and are aberrantly expressed in AML. Targeting the CDK pathway is an emerging promising therapeutic strategy in AML.Areas covered: We describe the rationale for targeting CDK9 and CDK4/6, the ongoing preclinical and clinical trials and the potential of these inhibitors in AML. Our analysis included an extensive literature search via the Pubmed database and clinicaltrials.gov (March to August, 2019).Expert opinion: While CDK4/6 inhibitors are early in development for AML, CDK9 inhibition with alvocidib has encouraging clinical activity in newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory AML. Preclinical data suggests that leukemic MCL-1 dependence may predict response to alvocidib. Moreover, MCL-1 plays a key role in resistance to BCL-2 inhibition with venetoclax. Investigational strategies of concomitant BCL-2 and CDK9 inhibition represent a promising therapeutic platform for AML. Furthermore, preclinical data suggests that CDK4/6 inhibition has selective activity in patients with KMT2A-rearrangements and FLT3 mutations. Incorporation of CDK9 and 4/6 inhibitors into the existing therapeutic armamentarium may improve outcomes in AML.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CDK6', 'CDK9', 'MCL-1', 'clinical trials', 'cyclin dependent kinase', 'drug development']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of TKI drug treatment is to provide age- and sex-matched duration of life in a given patient with CML. Personalized CML treatment with TKI drugs is the key strategy. Individual treatment approach includes the harmonization of CML disease characteristics, clinical experience, and best available clinical evidence. Specific CML disease characteristics in a given patient include; CML disease risk, comorbidities, molecular profile, compliance, lifestyle, and drug off-target risk profile. CML research evidence includes; randomized clinical trials indicating the data on the efficacy, safety, tolerability, toxicity, possible long-term adverse events, and pharmacoeconomy of TKIs. Clinical and physician experience includes TKI availability, TKI reimbursability, drug experience, adherence, and BCR-ABL1 monitorization facilities. The key decision of choosing a TKI of choosing TKIs for CML should be made via the consideration of these variables.

In this study, we sought to characterize the distribution of CTLA-4 and T-cell lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) expression on exhausted T cells in different T-cell subsets from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: The coexpression of CTLA-4 and LAG-3 on exhausted CD244(+) and CD57(+) T cells from the CD3(+) , CD4(+) , and CD8(+) T-cell subsets in peripheral blood from 12 patients with newly diagnosed AML was analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry assay. RESULTS: A significantly higher percentage of CTLA-4(+) CD3(+) , CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was found in patients with AML. In addition, higher numbers of both CTLA-4(+) CD244+ and CTLA-4(+) CD57(+) CD3(+) T cells were detected. Interestingly, the increased CTLA-4(+) CD244(+) T cells were predominantly CD4(+) T cells. In contrast, the increased CTLA-4(+) CD57(+) T cells primarily consisted of the CD8(+) T-cell subset. A high proportion of LAG-3(+) T cells was found in only a few cases with AML; however, a significantly higher proportion of coexpression of CTLA-4 and LAG-3 in the CD3(+) and CD8(+) T-cell subsets was detected.

Epub 2019 Oct 14.,"BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids and asparaginase, used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), can cause hypertriglyceridemia. We compared triglyceride levels, risk factors, and associated toxicities in two ALL trials at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital with identical glucocorticoid regimens, but different asparaginase formulations. In Total XV (TXV), native Escherichia coli l-asparaginase was front-line therapy versus the pegylated formulation (PEG-asparaginase) in Total XVI (TXVI). PROCEDURE: Patients enrolled on TXV (n = 498) and TXVI (n = 598) were assigned to low-risk (LR) or standard/high-risk (SHR) treatment arms (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00137111 and NCT00549848). Triglycerides were measured four times and were evaluable in 925 patients (TXV: n = 362; TXVI: n = 563). The genetic contribution was assessed using a triglyceride polygenic risk score (triglyceride-PRS). Osteonecrosis, thrombosis, and pancreatitis were prospectively graded. RESULTS: The largest increase in triglycerides occurred in TXVI SHR patients treated with dexamethasone and PEG-asparaginase (4.5-fold increase; P <1 x 10(-15) ). SHR patients treated with PEG-asparaginase (TXVI) had more severe hypertriglyceridemia (>1000 mg/dL) compared to native l-asparaginase (TXV): 10.5% versus 5.5%, respectively (P = .007). At week 7, triglycerides did not increase with dexamethasone treatment alone (LR patients) but did increase with dexamethasone plus asparaginase (SHR patients). The variability in triglycerides explained by the triglyceride-PRS was highest at baseline and declined with therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia was associated with osteonecrosis (P = .0006) and thrombosis (P = .005), but not pancreatitis (P = .4). CONCLUSION: Triglycerides were affected more by PEG-asparaginase than native l-asparaginase, by asparaginase more than dexamethasone, and by drug effects more than genetics. It is not clear whether triglycerides contribute to thrombosis and osteonecrosis or are biomarkers of the toxicities.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['R01 CA142665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA142665/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'GM115279/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765)/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*asparaginase', '*hypertriglyceridemia']",PMC6868303,,['NIHMS1053621'],"['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00137111', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00549848']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CMV promotes the adaptive differentiation and expansion of an NK cell subset, hallmarked by expression of the CD94/NKG2C receptor with additional characteristic features. We previously reported an association of pretransplant NKG2C+ NK cells with a reduced incidence of CMV infection. We have strengthened the analysis in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an enlarged KTR cohort (n = 145) with homogeneous immunosuppression, excluding cases at low risk of infection (ie, CMV D-R-) or receiving antiviral prophylaxis. Moreover, adaptive NKG2C+ NK cell-associated markers (ie, NKG2A, CD57, Immunoglobulin-like transcript 2 [LIR1 or LILRB1], FcepsilonRI gamma chain, and Prolymphocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger transcription factor) as well as T lymphocyte subsets were assessed by multicolor flow cytometry. The relation of NKG2C+ NK cells with T cells specific for CMV antigens was analyzed in pretransplant patients (n = 29) and healthy controls (n = 28). Multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses supported that NKG2C+ NK cells bearing adaptive markers were specifically associated with a reduced incidence of posttransplant symptomatic CMV infection; no correlation between NKG2C+ NK cells and CMV-specific T cells was observed. These results support that adaptive NKG2C+ NK cells contribute to control CMV infection in KTR.","['(c) 2019 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of', 'Transplant Surgeons.']","['PI13/00598; PI16/00617; RD16/0009/0013/Instituto de Salud Carlos', 'III/International', 'PI16/00617/Instituto de Salud Carlos III/International', 'RD16/0009/0013/Instituto de Salud Carlos III/International', '105/U/2018/Fundacio la Marato de TV3/International', 'SAF2016-80363-C2-1-R/Secretaria de Estado de Investigacion, Desarrollo e', 'Innovacion/International']",['NOTNLM'],"['*basic (laboratory) research/science', '*clinical research/practice', '*immunobiology', '*infection and infectious agents - viral: cytomegalovirus (CMV)', '*infectious disease', '*kidney transplantation/nephrology', '*natural killer (NK) cells/NK receptors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we analysed 723 paediatric AML patients treated on the Japanese AML99 and AML-05 trials to identify characteristics of younger children. We identified patients aged <3 years (the younger group) as a distinct subgroup. KMT2A-rearrangement (KMT2A-R), CBFA2T3-GLIS2, CBFB-MYH11 and NUP98-KDM5A were frequently found in the younger group. Prognostic analyses revealed poor 5-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) in patients with CBFA2T3-GLIS2 (42%, 17% and 83%, respectively) and those with NUP98-KDM5A (33%, 17% and 83%, respectively). Additionally, we identified KMT2A-R and CBFB-MYH11 as age-specific prognostic markers. Regarding KMT2A-R, the younger group had significantly better OS, EFS and CIR than the older group (aged 3 to <18 years) (P = 0.023, 0.011 and <0.001, respectively). Conversely, concerning CBFB-MYH11, the younger group had significantly poor EFS and CIR than the older group (each P < 0.001), suggesting that certain molecular markers are linked to different prognoses according to age.

Our patient received a full course of 7 + 3 chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin. Proximal leg weakness and pain improved markedly following this treatment, establishing a temporal relationship between the possible paraneoplastic manifestation and treatment of underlying disease. Associations between malignancy and myopathies such as polymyositis and dermatomyositis have been well established in the literature.

To determine the implementation status and outcomes of autologous HCT for adults with AML in Japan, we analyzed data from 1,174 patients (including 446 with acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL]) who underwent autologous HCT between 1992 and 2016 consecutively reported to the Japanese nationwide transplantation registry. The annual number of transplantations peaked at 82 cases in 1997, and has recently remained at around 40 cases. The percentage of APL has increased sharply since 2004, and currently exceeds 70%. While most non-APL patients underwent autologous HCT during first complete remission (CR), transplantation during second CR has become mainstream for APL patients since the early 2000s. The 5-year survival, relapse, and non-relapse mortality rates were 55.3%, 42.1%, and 8.6% for non-APL patients, and 87.6%, 12.9%, and 3.4% for APL patients, respectively. Patients transplanted in the later period showed better survival than those transplanted in the earlier period, both for non-APL (P < 0.001) and APL (P = 0.036).

Recently, continuous BCR-ABL gene expression has been found in resistant cells with undetectable BCR-ABL protein expression, indicating that resistance may occur through kinase independent mechanisms, mainly due to the persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). LSCs reside in the bone marrow niche in a quiescent state, and are characterized by a high heterogeneity in genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional mechanisms. New approaches based on single cell genomics have offered the opportunity to identify distinct subpopulations of LSCs at diagnosis and during treatment. In the one hand, TKIs are not able to efficiently kill CML-LSCs, but they may be responsible for the modification of some LSCs characteristics, thus contributing to heterogeneity within the tumor. In the other hand, the bone marrow niche is responsible for the interactions between surrounding stromal cells and LSCs, resulting in the generation of specific signals which could favor LSCs cell cycle arrest and allow them to persist during treatment with TKIs. Additionally, LSCs may themselves alter the niche by expressing various costimulatory molecules and secreting suppressive cytokines, able to target metabolic pathways, create an anti-apoptotic environment, and alter immune system functions. Accordingly, the production of an immunosuppressant milieu may facilitate tumor escape from immune surveillance and induce chemo-resistance. In this review we will focus on BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms, analyzing especially those with a potential clinical impact in the management of CML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Loscocco, Visani, Galimberti, Curti and Isidori.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms', 'TKI', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'epigenetic', 'immune system', 'leukemia stem cells', 'microenvironment', 'resistance']",PMC6769066,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Channel activation enables transportation of potassium ions down their electrochemical gradient. Kv1.3 channel is expressed in many cell types, both normal and cancer. Activity of the channel plays an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Inhibition of Kv1.3 channel may be beneficial in therapy of several diseases including some cancer disorders. This review focuses on Kv1.3 channel as a new potentially attractive molecular target in cancer therapy. In the first part, changes in the channel expression in selected cancer disorders are described. Then, the role of the channel activity in cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis is presented. Finally, it is shown that some low molecular weight organic inhibitors of the channel including selected biologically active plant-derived polycyclic compounds may selectively induce apoptosis of Kv1.3-expressing cancer cells while sparing normal cells and healthy organs.

An unusual outcome of this case is that coengraftment of both cords was established. After 16 months, the patient had relapse of the disease, unfortunately, prompting treatment with alemtuzumab and pentostatin, which resulted in remission once again. Here, we report a unique phenomenon whereby single-cord dominance occurred after treatment with these agents, suggesting that anti-T-cell therapy after transplant may help achieve single-unit dominance.

Epub 2019 Sep 12.,"Hematologic diseases are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that affect people worldwide such as leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myelomas. The aim of this study was to characterize the frequency of hematological diseases in the population of Arica, Chile (18 degrees S, 70 degrees W), between 2011 and 2014. A total of 108 cases of hematologic malignancies were registered at Dr. Juan Noe Crevani Regional Hospital in this period; 40 male and 52 female cases were included in this retrospective and descriptive analysis. The overall median age at diagnosis for hematological malignancies was 59 years (range, 17 to 96 years). The results indicated that the frequency of hematological diseases such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia was not associated with sex, ethnicity and type of disease. However, in 2012 there was an increased number of cases of Hodgkin lymphoma compared with any other year in the study, whereas the number of multiple myeloma cases decreased between 2011 and 2014. No significant differences were observed among different types of disease, nor among the types of leukemia. However, when intervals of age were considered, it was revealed that patients >75 years had the highest incidence of hematological malignancies, mainly multiple myeloma, compared with other age groups. However, young adults were more commonly diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma than other disease types. A non-significant difference was observed in leukemia between 2011 and 2014 when sex was taken into consideration, in which the incidence rate was higher in females compared with males. Hodgkin lymphoma was most commonly at stage II and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was most commonly at stage IV. No significant differences were observed between the nodal and extranodal type, mixed cellularity and nodular sclerosis or in the morphology of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell type. Overall, there was a decrease in the frequency of hematological malignancies between 2011 and 2014, but no significant differences were observed in males or females. This study provided for the first time the pattern and distribution of hematological diseases in Arica, Chile.","['Copyright (c) 2019, Spandidos Publications.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Hodgkin lymphoma', 'frequency', 'hematologic diseases', 'leukemia', 'multiple myeloma', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma']",PMC6781717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 19.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common hematological malignancies. It is difficult to treat since it easily develops resistance to therapeutic drugs. Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), BCL-2 and BCL-XL, which belong to the anti-apoptotic group of proteins in the BCL-2 family, are overexpressed in AML. The effects of inhibitors that target anti-apoptotic proteins of the BCL-2 family in AML were evaluated in the present study. MCL-1 protein levels of HL60, MOLM13, OCI-AML3 and MV4-11 cell lines were investigated. Furthermore, following treatment with MCL-1-selective antagonist A-1210477 and/or BCL-2/BCL-XL antagonist ABT-737, cell viability was detected. The chimera rate of human CD45(+) cells of bone marrow from mouse models was analyzed via flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry using murine tissues (lung, spleen and liver). The data revealed that the HL-60 cell line, which exhibited a low MCL-1 protein level, and MOLM-13 and MV4-11 cell lines, whose MCL level was intermediate, were sensitive to ABT-737, whereas OCI-AML3 cells, which exhibited a high MCL-1 level, were insensitive to ABT-737. However, multiple AML mouse models and AML cell lines were sensitive to the MCL-1-selective antagonist A-1210477. The results of the present study indicated that the MCL-1-selective antagonist could overcome the resistance to the BCL-2/BCL-XL antagonist (ABT-737) in vitro and in vivo.",['Copyright: (c) Wang et al.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-737', 'BCL-2', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'antagonist', 'myeloid cell leukemia 1']",PMC6781566,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, 19 ATO target genes were identified, along with their associated protein-protein interaction networks and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. ATO was found to be associated with multiple types of cancer, and the most common solid cancer was pancreatic cancer. A total of 6 ATO target genes (namely AKT1, CCND1, CDKN2A, IKBKB, MAPK1 and MAPK3) were found to be associated with pancreatic cancer. Next, the mutation information of the 6 ATO target genes in pancreatic cancer was collected. A total of 20 ATO interacting genes were identified, which were mainly involved in hepatitis B, prostate cancer, pathways in cancer, glioma and chronic myeloid leukemia. Finally, the genes CCND1 and MAPK1 were detected to be prognostic factors in patients with pancreatic cancer.

Digital-PCR (dPCR) can be applied to detect the BCR-ABL1 gene with high sensitivity. In the present study, the results of the Clarity dPCR system were compared with those of the RT-qPCR in order to determine whether dPCR can be applied in the clinical setting. A total of 83 patients were included in the present study, and they were divided into two groups according to the results of BCR-ABL1 (IS) during ongoing monitoring. A total of 43 patients with undetectable BCR-ABL1 (IS) where enrolled in group A. BCR-ABL1 testing was performed using the dPCR system on the same peripheral blood samples of patients from group A, and the association between dPCR results and relapse was analyzed. The RT-qPCR platform and dPCR system were used simultaneously to detect the BCR-ABL1 gene of another 40 patients who achieved either partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) or further response. Among patients with undetectable BCR-ABL1 (IS), patients with dPCR-positive disease (BCR-ABL1 >0.1%) were more likely to undergo molecular relapse (P=0.018). The results of dPCR detection of BCR-ABL1% were consistent with the RT-qPCR results (R(2)=0.9510) in patients who achieved PCyR or further response. For samples with BCR-ABL1 (IS) <1.0%, the consistency of the dPCR and RT-qPCR results was better than that of BCR-ABL1 (IS) >1.0% (R(2)=0.9488 vs. R(2)=0.9264 for BCR-ABL1 (IS)). The detection results of the BCR-ABL1 gene in patients with CML using dPCR matched well with those from the RT-qPCR. To conclude, the results of the dPCR system can be applied as a supplement to the RT-qPCR platform, particularly for those with BCR-ABL1 (IS) <1.0%.",['Copyright: (c) Yan et al.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'digital PCR', 'reverse transcription PCR']",PMC6781637,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow specimens and peripheral blood were collected from children with B-ALL (n=38) and healthy controls (n=18). Total RNA was extracted and the expression levels of miR-31 were measured using quantitative PCR. In addition, a receiver operating characteristic curve was generated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the diagnostic value of miR-31 for the development of B-ALL. miR-31 expression was significantly lower in the B-ALL group compared with in the control group (P<0.05). Additionally, the expression levels of miR-31 in the B-ALL group before treatment were markedly lower than in the B-ALL group after treatment, and miR-31 expression was significantly lower after 30 days of treatment compared with after 12 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, miR-31 expression in the group of children >/=10 years of age was higher than that in the group of children <10 years of age. Furthermore, the expression levels of miR-31 were higher in the low-risk group compared with in the medium- and high-risk groups (P<0.05). When the cutoff value was set at 1.8, the AUC of miR-31 for B-ALL diagnosis was 0.915 (95% CI, 0.828-1.000; P<0.0001), with a sensitivity and specificity of 80.8 and 100%, respectively.

However, treatment effectiveness for patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been less satisfactory compared with patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The present study described a case of refractory follicular lymphoma. A high expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) was measured on CD3(+) T cells (80.90%) in peripheral blood samples obtained from the patient enrolled in this study, indicating that treatment with autologous CAR-T 19 cell therapy may not be successful. Therefore, a therapy regimen consisting of CAR-T 19 cells in combination with a reduced dose of nivolumab (1.5 mg/kg) for PD-1 blockade was used. A low dose of PD-1 blockade therapy was used to reduce the adverse effects associated with the combination of a PD-1 inhibitor and CAR-T 19 cells.

In addition, TAF-Ibeta-knockdown (KD) cells were generated via RNA interference. TAF-Ibeta KD not only inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cells but also induced apoptosis. Furthermore, it was revealed that the mechanism underlying these effects may be associated with the upregulation of protein phosphatase type 2A and inhibition of the protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta signaling pathway.

As a potential treatment for leukemia, immunotherapy has become a new research hotspot. This research aimed at exploring the status and trends of current researches on immunotherapy for childhood leukemia through bibliometric analysis. Methods: The Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science core collection database was searched for articles on immunotherapy and childhood leukemia using a computer. Time period for retrieval was from the beginning of the database to June 15, 2019. The top 100 highly cited articles were selected to extract their information on publication year, authors, title, publication journal, number of citations, author's affiliations, country, and so on. These general information and bibliometric data were collected for analysis. VOSviewer software was used to generate a figure for keywords' co-occurrence network and a figure for researcher's coauthorship network that visualized reference and cooperation patterns for different terms in the 100 articles. Results: The number of citations in the top 100 articles ranged from 17 to 471. These articles were published in 52 different publications. The top four journals in terms of the number of our selected articles were Leukemia (11 articles), Blood (10 articles), Bone Marrow Transplantation (6 articles), and Clinical Cancer Research. The most frequently nominated author was T. Klingebiel from Goethe University Frankfurt, and of the top 100 articles, 12 listed his name. These top 100 articles were published after the year 2000. Most of these articles were original (67%). The United States and Germany were the major countries researching immunotherapy for childhood leukemia and made significant contributions to the combat against the disease. Adoptive immunotherapy and stem cell transplantation appeared more frequently in keywords. Conclusions: This study analyzed the top 100 highly cited articles on immunotherapy for childhood leukemia and provided insights into the features and research hotspots of the articles on this issue.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Zhong, Li, Zhu, Zhang, Zou and Jin.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['VOSviewer', 'Web of Science', 'bibliometrics', 'childhood leukemia', 'immunotherapy']",PMC6769078,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study intended to evaluate synergistic effects of NG and VPA on cell viability and apoptosis in K562 cells. K562 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated FBS. They were treated with different doses of NG, VPA and cisplatin for 24, 48, and 72 h, and MTT assay was performed to analyze cell viability. Also, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured in RPMI-1640 media and incubated with NG (200 muM), VAP (100 muM), NG+VPA (150 muM) and cisplatin (8 muM) to evaluate cytotoxicity. IC50 of the drugs, when they were applied separately and in combination, were calculated using the COMPUSYN software. DNA electrophoresis, TUNEL assay, and Hoechst staining were performed to investigate apoptosis induction. RT-PCR was used for the evaluation of apoptotic genes expression. The results of the MTT assay showed that cell viability decreased at all applied doses of NG and VPA. It was noticed that the cytotoxic effects of these drugs were dose- and time-dependent. Based on the COMPUSYN output, the combination of the drugs (VPA and NG) in a certain ratio concentration synergistically decreased cell viability. Cisplatin significantly decreased cell viability of PBMCs and K562 cells. Also, the combination drug had cytotoxic effect and significantly reduced viability of K562 cells compared with PBMCs and control cells. In the target cells treated with this combination, Bax and caspase-3 expression increased but Bcl-2 expression decreased. These results suggest that NG, VPA, and their combination decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This study suggests that this combination therapy can be considered for further evaluation as an effective chemotherapeutic strategy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Aalaei et al.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['K562 cells', 'apoptosis', 'combination therapy', 'cytotoxicity', 'nitroglycerine', 'valproic acid']",PMC6785758,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the role of PRMT5 in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using an enzymatic dead version of PRMT5 and a PRMT5-specific inhibitor, we demonstrated the requirement of the catalytic activity of PRMT5 for the survival of AML cells. We then identified PRMT5 substrates using multiplexed quantitative proteomics and investigated their role in the survival of AML cells. We found that the function of the splicing regulator SRSF1 relies on its methylation by PRMT5 and that loss of PRMT5 leads to changes in alternative splicing of multiple essential genes.

Epub 2019 Oct 14.,"Inappropriate localization of proteins can interfere with normal cellular function and drive tumor development. To understand how this contributes to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we compared the nuclear proteome and transcriptome of AML blasts with normal human CD34(+) cells. Analysis of the proteome identified networks and processes that significantly affected transcription regulation including misexpression of 11 transcription factors with seven proteins not previously implicated in AML. Transcriptome analysis identified changes in 40 transcription factors but none of these were predictive of changes at the protein level. The highest differentially expressed protein in AML nuclei compared with normal CD34(+) nuclei (not previously implicated in AML) was S100A4. In an extended cohort, we found that over-expression of nuclear S100A4 was highly prevalent in AML (83%; 20/24 AML patients). Knock down of S100A4 in AML cell lines strongly impacted their survival whilst normal hemopoietic stem progenitor cells were unaffected. These data are the first analysis of the nuclear proteome in AML and have identified changes in transcription factor expression or regulation of transcription that would not have been seen at the mRNA level. These data also suggest that S100A4 is essential for AML survival and could be a therapeutic target in AML.",,"['15018/LLR_/Blood Cancer UK/United Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', '13029/LLR_/Blood Cancer UK/United Kingdom', 'MR/M008959/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,PMC6995695,,['EMS84513'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 14.,"The NOPHO ALL2008 is a population-based study using an unmodified pediatric protocol in patients 1-45 years of age with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients with T-ALL were given a traditional pediatric scheme if fast responding (minimal residual disease (MRD) < 0.1% day 29), or intensive block-based chemotherapy if slow responding (MRD > 0.1% day 29). Both treatment arms included pediatric doses of high-dose methotrexate and asparaginase. If MRD >/= 5% on day 29 or >/=0.1% after consolidation, patients were assigned to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The 5-year overall survival of the 278 T-ALL patients was 0.75 (95% CI 0.69-0.81), being 0.82 (0.74-0.88) for patients 1.0-9.9 years, 0.76 (0.66-0.86) for those 10.0-17.9 years, and 0.65 (0.55-0.75) for the older patients. The risk of death in first remission was significantly higher in adults (12%) compared with the 1-9 years group (4%). The MRD responses in the three age groups were similar, and only a nonsignificant increase in relapse risk was found in adults. In conclusion, an unmodified pediatric protocol in patients 1-45 years is effective in all age groups. The traditional pediatric treatment schedule was safe for all patients, but the intensive block therapy led to a high toxic death rate in adults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How the relative importance of these factors changes with patient age has not previously been investigated comprehensively. We analyzed data from 3894 patients of all ages uniformly treated in a large clinical trial of myeloma patients, Myeloma XI. Even with novel therapeutic approaches progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are affected by age with a stepwise reduction in PFS and OS with each decade increase. Renal function deteriorated with increasing age whilst the frequency of t(4;14) and del(17p) decreased and gain(1q) increased. The relative contribution of performance status, international staging score and molecular risk to progression-free and overall survival varied by age group. Molecular events have a larger effect on outcome in younger patients with their relative contribution diminishing in the elderly.

Different molecular targets for CBD were proposed, including cannabinoid receptors and some plasma membrane ion channels. Here we have shown that cell lines derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia of T lineage (T-ALL), but not resting healthy T cells, are highly sensitive to CBD treatment. CBD effect does not depend on cannabinoid receptors or plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels. Instead, CBD directly targets mitochondria and alters their capacity to handle Ca(2+). At lethal concentrations, CBD causes mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, stable mitochondrial transition pore formation and cell death. Our results suggest that CBD is an attractive candidate to be included into chemotherapeutic protocols for T-ALL treatment.",,,,,PMC6791884,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 15.,"Owned, free-roaming domestic cats are abundant in the Chilean countryside, having high probability of contact with wildlife and potentially participating as reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens. In the present study, 131 cats from two remote study areas (Valdivia and Chiloe Island) in southern Chile were analyzed for infection/exposure to eight pathogens. Serum samples from 112 cats were tested for antigens against feline leukemia virus (FeLV antigen-ELISA) and antibodies against feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV-ELISA) and canine distemper virus (CDV-serum neutralization), yielded occurrence of 8.9, 1.7 and 0.8% respectively. The presence of DNA of five vector-borne pathogens, piroplasmids, Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp. and Bartonella spp. was investigated in thirty cats. Overall observed occurrence was 6.6% (2/30) for both Anaplasma platys, and B. henselae, and 3.3% (1/30) for both Bartonella sp. and Theileria equi. Observed occurrence for all vector-borne pathogens in Valdivia area was significantly higher than in Chiloe Island (5/15 vs 0/15; P=0.04). Our results represent the first description of exposure to CDV and DNA detection of T. equi and A. platys in domestic cats in Chile.

Bone marrow aspirate showed near total replacement by small round malignant cells. The bone marrow biopsy showed interstitial infiltration by malignant cells, which were CD45- CD3- CD20- MIC2+ FLI1+ and diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma was established. In contrast, flowcytometric immunophenotyping of the bone marrow aspirate showed CD45- cells, which were CD19+ cytCD79a+ CD10+ CD81+ CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD22+ CD20- consistent with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The extended immunostaining panel on bone marrow biopsy also showed positivity for cytCD79a, CD10, CD19, and BCL-2, whereas fluorescent in-situ hybridization for EWSR1 gene rearrangement was negative. Thus, a final diagnosis of CD45- FLI1+ MIC2+ B-ALL was established. Rare cases of CD45- B-ALL with immunoreactivity for MIC2 and Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1) have posed a diagnostic challenge for PSRCTs in the recent past.

Epub 2019 Oct 14.,"A key hallmark of cancer, unlimited replication, requires cancer cells to evade both replicative senescence and potentially lethal chromosomal instability induced by telomere dysfunction. The majority of cancers overcome these critical barriers by upregulating telomerase, a telomere-specific reverse transcriptase. However, a subset of cancers maintains telomere lengths by the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. The presence of ALT is strongly associated with recurrent cancer-specific somatic inactivating mutations in the ATRX-DAXX chromatin-remodeling complex. Here, we generate an ALT-positive adenocarcinoma cell line following functional inactivation of ATRX and telomerase in a telomerase-positive adenocarcinoma cell line. Inactivating mutations in ATRX were introduced using CRISPR-cas9 nickase into two prostate cancer cell lines, LAPC-4 (derived from a lymph node metastasis) and CWR22Rv1 (sourced from a xenograft established from a primary prostate cancer). In LAPC-4, but not CWR22Rv1, abolishing ATRX was sufficient to induce multiple ALT-associated hallmarks, including the presence of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (APB), extrachromosomal telomere C-circles, and dramatic telomere length heterogeneity. However, telomerase activity was still present in these ATRX(KO) cells. Telomerase activity was subsequently crippled in these LAPC-4 ATRX(KO) cells by introducing mutations in the TERC locus, the essential RNA component of telomerase. These LAPC-4 ATRX(KO) TERC(mut) cells continued to proliferate long-term and retained ALT-associated hallmarks, thereby demonstrating their reliance on the ALT mechanism for telomere maintenance. IMPLICATIONS: These prostate cancer cell line models provide a unique system to explore the distinct molecular alterations that occur upon induction of ALT, and may be useful tools to screen for ALT-specific therapies.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['F32 CA213742/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009110/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6891209,,['NIHMS1541225'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Children aged</=19 years and diagnosed with childhood cancer from 1968 to 2016 were identified in the Danish Cancer Registry and 25 randomly selected cancer-free controls per case were matched by age and sex. Parents were identified in the Danish Civil Registration System and employment histories were retrieved from a nationwide mandatory pension fund. The probability of exposure to diesel engine exhaust was assessed using a validated job exposure matrix. Conditional logistic regression was used for estimation of ORs, including their 95% CIs. RESULTS: Maternal employment in industries with diesel engine exhaust exposure was associated with an increased risk of CNS cancers (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.74) and of astrocytoma (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.14) in offspring. The highest OR for these cancers were seen for mothers with highest probability of exposure to diesel engine exhaust. For fathers, ORs for cancers under study were close to one. No increased risks of leukaemias were found for either mothers or fathers employed in diesel industries. CONCLUSIONS: Risks were increased for CNS and astrocytoma for maternal employment in industries with diesel engine exhaust.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Epub 2019 Oct 14.,"Major advances in our understanding of cancer pathogenesis and therapy have come from efforts to catalog genomic alterations in cancer. A growing number of large-scale genomic studies have uncovered mutations that drive cancer by perturbing cotranscriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. These include alterations that affect each phase of RNA processing, including splicing, transport, editing, and decay of messenger RNA. The discovery of these events illuminates a number of novel therapeutic vulnerabilities generated by aberrant RNA processing in cancer, several of which have progressed to clinical development. SIGNIFICANCE: There is increased recognition that genetic alterations affecting RNA splicing and polyadenylation are common in cancer and may generate novel therapeutic opportunities.

In the present study, we investigated the characteristics and the clinical outcomes of patients categorized as MDS-U based on 2008 World Health Organization criteria (WHO) in a single center comparing to other MDS groups. Out of eight hundred and two patients who met WHO criteria for MDS at our institution, ninety patients (11%) were initially classified as MDS-U. Upon pathological review, only half of the cases were confirmed to be MDS-U. With follow up, half of the MDS-U cases were reclassified to another subtype.

The Philadelphia chromosome contains a fusion gene called BCR-ABL1. The BCR-ABL1 codes for an aberrantly functioning tyrosine kinase that drives the malignant proliferation of the founding clone. The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) represents a landmark in the treatment of CML, that has led to tremendous improvement in the remission and survival rates. Since the introduction of imatinib, the first TKI, several other TKI have been approved that further broadened the arsenal against CML. Patients treated with TKIs require sensitive monitoring of BCR-ABL1 transcripts with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCT), which has become an essential part of managing patients with CML. In this review, we discuss the importance of the BCR-ABL1 assay, and we highlight the growing importance of BCR-ABL1 dynamics. We also introduce a mathematical correction for the BCR-ABL1 assay that could help homogenizing the use of the ABL1 as a control gene.

As a fertility preserving strategy, several centers collect testicular biopsies to cryopreserve spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) world-wide. One of the most promising therapeutic strategies is to transplant SSCs back into the seminiferous tubules to initiate endogenous spermatogenesis. However, to obtain sufficient numbers of SSC to warrant transplantation, in vitro propagation of cells is needed together with proper validation of their stem cell identity. Materials and Methods: A minute amount of testicular biopsies (between 5 mg and 10 mg) were processed by mechanical and enzymatic digestion. SSCs were enriched by differential plating method in StemPro-34 medium supplemented with several growth factors. SSC-like cell clusters (SSCLCs) were passaged five times. SSCLCs were identified by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining, using protein expression patterns in testis biopsies as reference. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of SSC markers LIN-28 homolog A (LIN28A), G antigen 1 (GAGE1), promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF), integrin alpha 6 (ITGA6), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) and integrin beta 1 (ITGB1) were also used to validate the SSC-like cell identity. Results: Proliferation of SSCLCs was achieved. The presence of SSCs in SSCLCs was confirmed by positive immunostaining of LIN28, UCHL1 and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for LIN28A, UCHL1, PLZF, ITGA6, and ITGB1, respectively. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that SSCs from infant boys possess the capacity for in vitro proliferation and advance a fertility preservation strategy for pre-pubertal boys who may otherwise lose their fertility.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Dong, Kristensen, Hildorf, Gul, Clasen-Linde, Fedder,', 'Hoffmann, Cortes, Thorup and Andersen.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['cryptorchidism', 'fertility cryopreservation', 'in vitro expansion', 'male infertility', 'spermatogonial stem cell']",PMC6761273,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we showed that matrine significantly inhibited the cell proliferation and induced apoptosis by regulating Warburg effect through controlling hexokinases 2 (HK2) expression in myeloid leukemia cells. Interestingly, matrine inhibited the expression of HK2 mediated by reduction in c-Myc binding to HK2 gene intron and led to downregulation of HK2, which upregulated proapoptotic protein Bad and then induced apoptosis. We further demonstrated that matrine could synergize with lonidamine, an inhibitor of HK2, for the treatment of myeloid leukemia, both in vitro and in vivo.

Literature suggests that Asians are predisposed to develop SIADH following VCR administration. However, data regarding the occurrence of SIADH in children with malignancy are limited. This study aims to analyze the incidence, clinical picture, risk factors, management, and outcome of SIADH during induction chemotherapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted among the 166 newly diagnosed pediatric ALL patients who were treated at a tertiary cancer center in India between January 2015 and December 2015. Patients who developed hyponatremia during induction chemotherapy were further investigated for SIADH. RESULTS: The incidence of SIADH was 10.8% (n = 18) with a mean sodium level of 125 mEq/L (114-129 mEq/L). In the preceding 2 weeks, 72% of episodes were associated with the administration of two (n = 6) or three (n = 7) doses of VCR. One child presented with seizures. All the patients were managed with fluid restriction and only two patients required sodium correction with 3% saline. Girls older than 10 years of age showed a marginally significant correlation to develop SIADH (P-value = 0.059). CONCLUSION: We report a higher incidence of SIADH (10.8%) in Indian children, compared to that described in the literature, during induction chemotherapy for ALL. Regular monitoring of sodium levels during this period of chemotherapy is hence essential for the timely diagnosis and appropriate management of SIADH, which in turn will avert complications, including neurological symptoms secondary to SIADH.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'SIADH', 'pediatric', 'vincristine']",,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have indicated that there are a variety of post-translational modifications of the PML protein, such as SUMOylation, ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and acetylation in cells. These modifications of the PML protein can directly affect the formation of PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), repair DNA damage, and modulate cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the abnormal modifications of PML not only result in the occurrence of hematopoietic tumors, but also are closely related to the drug-resistance of cancer. Therefore, investigating the post-translational modifications of PML is significant to uncover the mechanism of formation and functions of PML-NBs, thus contributing to the prevention and treatment of related hematopoietic tumors. In this review, the characteristics of the post-translational modifications of PML protein and the relationship between these modifications and functions of PML-NBs are summarized so as to provide the potential targets for the treatment of related cancers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eight-color flow cytometry was used to dynamically monitor the changes of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets of 41 patients at one year after UCBT, and 10 healthy volunteers were enroled as controls. Patients were divided into two groups according to the DNA load of CMV (DNA copies <1000/ml and DNA copies >/=1000/ml). Comparative analyse of the effect of CMV DNA load on lymphocyte subsets and transplantation outcomes were carried out after transplantation. RESULTS: The high CMV DNA load group showed a faster and expanded T cell reconstitution, and the differences between the two groups were statistically significant at one and nine months after transplantation (0.38x10(9) /L vs 0.25x10(9) /L, P=0.015 and 2.53x10(9) /L vs 1.36x10(9) /L, P=0.006, respectively). Further analysis of T cell subsets suggested that CD8(+) T cells presented a higher and faster recovery in the high DNA load group, and the differences between the two groups were statistically significant at one and nine months after transplantation (0.20x10(9) /L vs 0.10x10(9) /L, P=0.038 and 1.62x10(9) /L vs 0.68x10(9) /L, P=0.003, respectively). In addition, there were no significant differences in levels of B cells, regulatory B cells and NK cells between the two groups. Outcomes after one- and a-half-year transplantation showed that there were no significant difference in relapse, non-relapse mortality and overall survival between the high and the low DNA load groups (7.7% vs 7.5%) (P=0.900) (15.4% vs 21.4%) (P=0.686) and (76.9% vs 78.6%) (P=0.889) respectively. CONCLUSION: The high CMV DNA load induces a faster and long-lasting expansion of T cells, mainly as the expansion of CD8(+) T cells after UCBT. Besides, under the current pre-emptive treatment of CMV, the high CMV DNA load does not affect the early survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia after UCBT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The EMSA and ChIP assay were used to verify whether MZF-1 directly and specifically binds to the core region of MLAA-34 promoter. The over-expression vector and interference vector of MZF-1 were constructed to transfect U937 cells, and RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the transcription and expression changes of MLAA-34 gene. RESULTS: The transcription factor MZF-1 had a regulatory effect on MLAA-34 gene expression, and the relative luciferase activity was decreased after MZF-1 binding point mutation (P<0.01). EMSA and ChIP experiments demonstrated that MZF-1 could directly bind to MLAA-34 promoter and play a regulatory role. In the over-expression test, the increase of MZF-1 could up-regulate the expression of MLAA-34 (P<0.05).

METHODS: The purchased SHI-1 cell line was treated with miR-152 over-expression (miR-152 agomir group) or miR-152 inhibition (miR-152 antagomir group), and the negative control (NC) group was set up. The cell proliferation of each group was detected by CCK-8 assay. Scratch healing assay was employed to determine the migration of cells. Transwell assay was used to measure the invasion of cells. The expressions of Cyclin D1, Caspase-3, MMP-2, TIMP-2, E-cadherin and N-cadherin were detected by Western blot. The flow cyronetry with annexin V-FITC/PI double staining was applied to detect the cell apoptosis. The tumorigenesis of cells was examined by tumor formation experiment in nude mice. RESULTS: Compared with the NC group, the cell proliferation, migration and invasion ability in miR-152 agomir group were significantly decreased (P0.05), while that in miR-152 antagomir were significantly up-regulated (P0.05) . Compared with the NC group, the protein expression of Cyclin D1, MMP-2, N-cadherin were down-regulated in miR-152 agomir group, but the protein expression of Caspase-3, TIMP-2 and E-cadherin were all up-regulated siginificantly. At the same time, the apoptosis were enhanced, but the timorigenicity in nude mice were significantly decreased (all P0.05). The protein expression of Cyclin D1, MMP-2, N-cadherin in miR-152 antagomir group, showed high levels but Caspase-3, TIMP-2 and E-cadherin protein showed low levels in comparison with NC group. At the same time, the apoptosis was decreased but the timorigenicity in nude mice was significantly enhanced (all P0.05) .

METHODS: Forty-seven patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were enrolled in our study and divided into decitabine combination treatment group (22 cases) and traditional treatment group (25 cases). The clinical efficacy was compared between these two groups. Real-time PCR was used to determine the plasma level of miR-140 in AML patients. Decitabine, miR-140 mimic and miR140 inhibitor were used to treat AML HL-60 cells in vitro, the real-time PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expressions of miR-140, TLR4 and NF-kappaB at both mRNA and protein levels. RESULTS: Compared with traditional treatment group, decitabine combination treatment group showed more significant clinical efficacy. Plasma miR-140 level in both 2 treatment groups both decreased, but the plasma miR-140 level was higher in decitabine combination treatment group as compared with traditional treatment group. Experiment in vitro showed that 0.3 mumol/L decitabine significantly inhibited the HL-60 cell proliferation accompanied by up-regulation of miR-140 expression and down-regulation of expression of TLR4 and NF-kappaB. These effects induced by decitabine were partly reversed by pretreating the cells with 200 nmol/L miR-140 inhibitor. CONCLUSION: Decitabine-induced up-regulation of miR-140 expression may be related with its chemotherapeutic effects, and miR-140/TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway may partly mediate the pharmacologic action of decitabine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One hundred sixty-four cases of newly treated adults with ALL from May 2016 to December 2018 were selected. Targeted and specific next-generation sequencing technology was used to detected a total of 16 types of Ph-like ALL mutations, which include IL-7R mutation, and the cilinical features, rate, types and sites of IL-7R were analyzed. RESULTS: IL-7R mutation was determined in 10 cases of 164 adult patients with ALL and the total mutation frequency was 13 times (6.1%). Out of 10 cases 5 cases were male (50%), 5 cases were female (50%). 6 cases of B-ALL ( 60% ) and 4 cases of T-ALL (40%). The mutation site of all cases was located at exon 6, among which 6 cases had replacement mutations, 3 cases had deletion mutations and 4 cases had insertion mutations. In addition, 1 triple and 1 double mutation of IL-7R were found. Besides, six mutation sites were newly identified, including: c.720_724del, c.723_726del, c.721_722insAGTG, c.727_728insTAACGGCCCCCTGCT, c.727_728insATGCAGGGAGCGAA and c.728_729insAAGTGTCA. CONCLUSION: Six novel mutation sites and a poor manifestation of IL-7R have been explored in this research.

The effect of rapamycin on the proliferation of K562 cells was detected by MTT, and the effect of rapamycin on the apoptosis of K562 cells was detected by AnnexinV-FITC/PI double staining. The expression level of EZH2/Hedgehog signaling pathway genes in K562 cells was detected by RT-PCR, and Western blot was used to detect the levels of apoptotic protein and the related signaling pathway proteins in K562 cells. RESULTS: The MTT assay showed that the different concentration of rapamycin had obvious inhibitory effects on the cells, and the survival rate of cells in group C was 37.6%+/-3.4%, which was significantly lower than that of the other groups (P0.05). The apoptosis rate of cells in group C was 93.1%+/-8.1%, which was significantly higher than that of the other groups (P0.05).

All the patients were divided into 3 groups according to cytogenetic data: single t (15; 17) group, t (15; 17) with additional chromosomal abnormality (ACA) group, and normal karyotype group. Then, the prognostic significance of ACAs and complex karyotype were investigated in APL patients. RESULTS: There were 57 cases in the single t (15; 17) group, in which 8 cases died in the first month after induction treatment with early mortality rate of 14%. There were 21 patients in t (15; 17) with ACA group, in which 4 cases died in the first month with early mortality rate of 19%. There were 15 cases in normal chromosome group, in which 5 cases died in the first month with the early mortality rate of 33.3%. There was no statistical difference in the early mortality among 3 groups. All the remaining 76 patients achieved complete hematological remission. These patients were followed up. The median follow-up time was 43.9 months. Among them, only 2 patients in single t (15; 17) group and 1 patient in t (15; 17) with ACA group relapsed. No patient relapsed in normal karyotype group. The relapse rate was 3.5% in single t (15; 17) group and 4.2% in t (15; 17) with ACA group, respectively. There was no statistical difference in the overall survival and disease-free survival rates among 3 groups. Further analysis showed that the patients with complex chromosome karyotypes had lower relapse-free survival rates, but overall survival rates were not significantly different in 3 group. CONCLUSION: In general, ACA can not affect the prognosis of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia in condition of the maintenance treatment based on arsenic trioxide, but the complex chromosomal karyotype may reduce the relapse-free survival rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNC) were isolated from bone marrow samples of ALL children diagnosed in our hospital from May 2018 to November 2018. The cells were divided into control group, miR-221-NC group and miR-221 group. After transfection according to the instructions of Lipofectamine 2000 kit, the levels of miR-221 in each group were detected by RT-PCR. Flow cytometry was used to detect the effects of miR-221 on cell cycle and apoptosis. Transwell assay was used to detect cell migration and invasion. Western blot was used to detect the effects of miR-221 on proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Caspase 3, Cyclin D1 and MMP-9 proteins in BMNC. Luciferase reporter gene assay was used to detect the targeting relationship between miR-221 and Wnt gene. RESULT: The expression level of miR-221 in the miR-221 group was significantly higher than that in the control group and the miR-221-NC group (P0.05). MTT assay showed that, after transfection for 2, 3, 4 and 5 days, the cell proliferation level in miR-221 group was significantly lower than that in the control group and the miR-221-NC group (P0.05). The cell ratio of G0/G1 phase was (73.25+/-8.1)% in the miR-221 group, which was significantly higher than that in the control group and the miR-221-NC group (P0.05); moreover, the cell ratio of S phase in the miR-221 group was (12.37+/-1.6)%which was significantly lower than that in the control group and the miR-221-NC group (P0.05). The percentage of apoptotic cells in the miR-221 group was (24.68+/-3.87)%, which was significantly higher than that in the control group and the miR-221-NC group (P0.05). Transwell cell invasion experiment showed that the number of invasive cells in the miR-221 group was 23.42+/-3.62, which was significantly lower than that in the control group and the miR-221-NC group (P0.05). Transwell cell migration assay showed that the number of migrating cells in the miR-221 group was 34.86+/-5.32, which was significantly lower than that in the control group and the miR-221-NC group (P0.05). The relative level of PCNA, Cyclin D1 and MMP-9 in the miR-221 group was 0.26+/-0.03, 0.17+/-3.61 and 0.14+/-0.02, respectively, which was significantly lower than those in the control group and the miR-221-NC group (P0.05), while the relative level of Caspase-3 in the miR-221 group was 0.37+/-0.05, which was significantly higher than that in the control group and the miR-221-NC group (P0.05). Luciferase reporter assay showed that the activity of luciferase in Wnt wild type plasmid was significantly inhibited by miR-221 (P0.05). CONCLUSION: miR-221 can inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of BMNC, moreover can promote cell apoptosis, which may be related with the inhibition of Wnt/beta- catenin signaling pathway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One hundred eighty-eight AML-M2 patients were retrospectively analyzed for the following parameters including peripheral blood, immune phenotypes, fusion genes and cytogenetics to explore their significance for the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The prognostic factors were also analyzed. RESULTS: Among 188 patients with AML-M2, the chromosomal abnormality with t (8;21), normal chromosome and other abnormalities accounted for 37% (70/188), 41% (77/188) and 22% (41/188), respectively. For the immunopheno typing of M2 patients, the hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation antigen CD117 (96.1%) were mainly expressed, CD34 (81.6%) and HLA-DR (55.9%), and myeloid-associated antigen of CD13 (90.5%) and CD33 (89.4%) were also highly expressed. There were lymphoid-associated antigens expressed in some patients, among which the positive expression rate of CD19 was highest (29.6%), and the next was CD7 (28.5%). The most common accompanied mutations was FLT3 mutation (30.2%). The univariate analysis showed that the patients at age50 years old, without extramedullary infiltration, with positive expression of CD19, NPM-1 (-), CEBPA double mutation(+), and HSCT were significant superior in OS and PFS (P0.05); the multivariate analysis showed that the patient at age50 years old, without extramedullary infiltration, with positive expression of CD19 and CEBPA double mutation (+) were significant superior in OS and PFS (P0.05). The analysis indicated that the Karytypes affected only OS (P0.05), while the NPM-1 gene mutation positive affected only PFS (P0.05). The univarate analysis of factors affecting the survival in 70 AML-M2 patients with t (8;21) abnormatity showed that the C-KIT gene mutation was a poor factor for OS and PFS. CONCLUSION: The clinical characteristics are different between M2 patients with different karyotype, and prognostic analysis shows that the karytypes have an impact on overall survival; age, extramedullary infiltration, CD19 expression and CEBPA double mutation are also the main factors impacting the prognosis of patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 18.,"Non-coding RNAs occupy a significant fraction of the human genome. Their biological significance is backed up by a plethora of emerging evidence. One of the most robust approaches to demonstrate non-coding RNA's biological relevance is through their prognostic value. Using the rich gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Altas (TCGA), we designed Advanced Expression Survival Analysis (AESA), a web tool which provides several novel survival analysis approaches not offered by previous tools. In addition to the common single-gene approach, AESA computes the gene expression composite score of a set of genes for survival analysis and utilizes permutation test or cross-validation to assess the significance of log-rank statistic and the degree of over-fitting. AESA offers survival feature selection with post-selection inference and utilizes expanded TCGA clinical data including overall, disease-specific, disease-free, and progression-free survival information. Users can analyse either protein-coding or non-coding regions of the transcriptome. We demonstrated the effectiveness of AESA using several empirical examples. Our analyses showed that non-coding RNAs perform as well as messenger RNAs in predicting survival of cancer patients. These results reinforce the potential prognostic value of non-coding RNAs. AESA is developed as a module in the freely accessible analysis suite MutEx.

NRG-1 features a multitasking profile tuning regenerative, inflammatory, fibrotic, and metabolic processes. Here, we review the activities of NRG-1 on different cell types and organs and their implication for heart failure progression and its comorbidities. Although, in general, effects of NRG-1 in heart failure are compensatory and beneficial, translation into therapies remains unaccomplished both because of the complexity of the underlying pathways and because of the challenges in the development of therapeutics (proteins, peptides, small molecules, and RNA-based therapies) for tyrosine kinase receptors. Here, we give an overview of the complexity to be faced and how it may be tackled.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*disease progression', '*endothelium', '*heart failure', '*neuregulin-1', '*receptor protein-tyrosine kinases', '*receptor, ErbB4']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 21.,"Myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (ML-DS) is characterized by a predominance of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, the presence of GATA1 mutations and a favorable outcome. Because DS children can also develop conventional acute myeloid leukemia with unfavorable outcome, detection of GATA1 mutations is important for diagnosis of ML-DS. However, myelofibrosis and the significant frequency of dry taps have hampered practical screening of GATA1 mutations using bone marrow (BM) samples. In response to those problems, 82 patients were enrolled in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group AML-D11 study. GATA1 mutations were analyzed by Sanger sequencing (SS) using genomic DNA (gDNA) from BM and cDNA from peripheral blood (PB) followed by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) using pooled diagnostic samples. BM and PB samples were obtained from 71 (87%) and 82 (100%) patients, respectively. GATA1 mutations were detected in 46 (56%) and 58 (71%) patients by SS using BM gDNA and PB cDNA, respectively. Collectively, GATA1 mutations were identified in 73/82 (89%) patients by SS. Targeted NGS detected GATA1 mutations in 74/82 (90%) patients. Finally, combining the results of SS with those of targeted NGS, GATA1 mutations were identified in 80/82 (98%) patients. These results indicate that SS using BM gDNA and PB cDNA is a rapid and useful method for screening for GATA1 mutations in ML-DS patients. Thus, a combination of SS and targeted NGS is a sensitive and useful method to evaluate the actual incidence and clinical significance of GATA1 mutations in ML-DS patients.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*GATA1', '*down syndrome', '*mutation', '*myeloid leukemia', '*next generation sequencing', '*sanger sequencing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 10.,"OBJECTIVE: There are no effective systemic therapies for adenoid cystic cancer (ACC) and lack of tumor lines and mouse models have hindered drug development.We aim to develop MYB-activated models for testing new therapeutic agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied new ACC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and generated a matched cell line from one patient. In addition, we generated a genetically-engineered MYB-NFIB mouse model (GEMM) that was crossed with Ink4a(+/)(-)/Arf(+/)(-) mice to study tumor spectrum and obtain tumor lines. Using human and murine ACC-like tumor lines, we analyzed MYB expression by RNA-Seq and immunoblot and tested efficacy of new MYB inhibitors. RESULTS: We detected MYB-NFIB transcripts in both UFH1 and UFH2 PDX and observed tumor inhibition by MYB depletion using shRNA in vivo. We observed rapid loss of MYB expression when we cultured UFH1 in vitro, but were able to generate a UFH2 tumor cell line that retained MYB expression for 6months. RNA-Seq expression detected an ACC-like mRNA signature in PDX samples and we confirmed an identical KMT2A/MLL variant in UFH2 PDX, matched cell line, and primary biopsy. Although the predominant phenotype of the MYB-NFIB GEMM was B-cell leukemia, we also generated a MYB-activated ACC-like mammary tumor cell line. We observed tumor inhibition using a novel MYB peptidomimetic in both human and murine tumor models. CONCLUSIONS: We generated and studied new murine and human MYB-activated tumor samples and detected growth inhibition with MYB peptidomimetics.

Epub 2019 Sep 8.,"Oxidative modification of cysteine residues has been shown to regulate the activity of several protein-tyrosine kinases. We explored the possibility that Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), a hematopoietic receptor-tyrosine kinase, is subject to this type of regulation. An underlying rationale was that the FLT3 gene is frequently mutated in Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients, and resulting oncogenic variants of FLT3 with 'internal tandem duplications (FLT3ITD)' drive production of reactive oxygen in leukemic cells. FLT3 was moderately activated by treatment of intact cells with hydrogen peroxide. Conversely, FLT3ITD signaling was attenuated by cell treatments with agents inhibiting formation of reactive oxygen species. FLT3 and FLT3ITD incorporated DCP-Bio1, a reagent specifically reacting with sulfenic acid residues. Mutation of FLT3ITD cysteines 695 and 790 reduced DCP-Bio1 incorporation, suggesting that these sites are subject to oxidative modification. Functional characterization of individual FLT3ITD cysteine-to-serine mutants of all 8 cytoplasmic cysteines revealed phenotypes in kinase activity, signal transduction and cell transformation. Replacement of cysteines 681, 694, 695, 807, 925, and 945 attenuated signaling and blocked FLT3ITD-mediated cell transformation, whereas mutation of cysteine 790 enhanced activity of both FLT3ITD and wild-type FLT3. These effects were not related to altered FLT3ITD dimerization, but likely caused by changed intramolecular interactions. The findings identify the functional relevance of all cytoplasmic FLT3ITD cysteines, and indicate the potential for redox regulation of this clinically important oncoprotein.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Oct 9.,"BACKGROUND: Further improvement of preparative regimens before allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an unmet medical need for the growing number of older or comorbid patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of conditioning with treosulfan plus fludarabine compared with reduced-intensity busulfan plus fludarabine in this population. METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in 31 transplantation centres in France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Poland. Eligible patients were 18-70 years, had acute myeloid leukaemia in first or consecutive complete haematological remission (blast counts <5% in bone marrow) or myelodysplastic syndrome (blast counts <20% in bone marrow), Karnofsky index of 60% or higher, and were indicated for allogeneic HSCT but considered at an increased risk for standard myeloablative preparative regimens based on age (>/=50 years), an HSCT-specific comorbidity index of more than 2, or both. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either intravenous 10 g/m(2) treosulfan daily applied as a 2-h infusion for 3 days (days -4 to -2) or 0.8 mg/kg busulfan applied as a 2-h infusion at 6-h intervals on days -4 and -3. Both groups received 30 mg/m(2) intravenous fludarabine daily for 5 days (days -6 to -2). The primary outcome was event-free survival 2 years after HSCT. The non-inferiority margin was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.3. Efficacy was assessed in all patients who received treatment and completed transplantation, and safety in all patients who received treatment. The study is registered with EudraCT (2008-002356-18) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00822393). FINDINGS: Between June 13, 2013, and May 3, 2016, 476 patients were enrolled (240 in the busulfan group received treatment and transplantation, and in the treosulfan group 221 received treatment and 220 transplanation). At the second preplanned interim analysis (Nov 9, 2016), the primary endpoint was met and trial was stopped. Here we present the final confirmatory analysis (data cutoff May 31, 2017). Median follow-up was 15.4 months (IQR 8.8-23.6) for patients treated with treosulfan and 17.4 months (6.3-23.4) for those treated with busulfan. 2-year event-free survival was 64.0% (95% CI 56.0-70.9) in the treosulfan group and 50.4% (42.8-57.5) in the busulfan group (HR 0.65 [95% CI 0.47-0.90]; p<0.0001 for non-inferiority, p=0.0051 for superiority). The most frequently reported grade 3 or higher adverse events were abnormal blood chemistry results (33 [15%] of 221 patients in the treosulfan group vs 35 [15%] of 240 patients in the busulfan group) and gastrointestinal disorders (24 [11%] patients vs 39 [16%] patients). Serious adverse events were reported for 18 (8%) patients in the treosulfan group and 17 (7%) patients in the busulfan group. Causes of deaths were generally transplantation-related. INTERPRETATION: Treosulfan was non-inferior to busulfan when used in combination with fludarabine as a conditioning regimen for allogeneic HSCT for older or comorbid patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. The improved outcomes in patients treated with the treosulfan-fludarabine regimen suggest its potential to become a standard preparative regimen in this population.

Epub 2019 Oct 9.,"BACKGROUND: The ELIANA trial showed that 61 (81%) of 75 paediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia achieved overall remission after treatment with tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor targeted against the CD19 antigen. We aimed to evaluate patient-reported quality of life in these patients before and after tisagenlecleucel infusion. METHODS: ELIANA, a global, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial, was done in 25 hospitals across Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Spain, and the USA. Patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia aged at least 3 years at the time of screening and 21 years or younger at the time of initial diagnosis who were in second or greater bone marrow relapse, chemorefractory, relapsed after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, or were otherwise ineligible for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation were enrolled. Patients received a single intravenous administration of a target dose of 0.2-5 x 10(6) transduced viable T cells per kg for patients weighing 50 kg or less or 0.1-2.5 x 10(8) transduced viable T cells for patients weighing more than 50 kg. The primary outcome, reported previously, was the proportion of patients who achieved remission. A prespecified secondary endpoint, reported here, was patient-reported quality of life measured with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D). Patients completed the questionnaires at baseline, day 28, and months 3, 6, 9, and 12 after treatment. The data collected were summarised using descriptive statistics and post-hoc mixed models for repeated measures. Change from baseline response profiles were illustrated with cumulative distribution function plots. The proportion of patients achieving the minimal clinically important difference and normative mean value were reported. Analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02435849. FINDINGS: Between April 8, 2015, and April 25, 2017, 107 patients were screened, 92 were enrolled, and 75 received tisagenlecleucel. 58 patients aged 8-23 years were included in the analysis of quality of life. At baseline, 50 (86%) patients had completed the PedsQL questionnaire and 48 (83%) had completed the EQ-5D VAS. Improvements in patient-reported quality-of-life scores were observed for all measures at month 3 after tisagenlecleucel infusion (mean change from baseline to month 3 was 13.3 [95% CI 8.9-17.6] for the PedsQL total score and 16.8 [9.4-24.3] for the EQ-5D visual analogue scale). 30 (81%) of 37 patients achieved the minimal clinically important difference at month 3 for the PedsQL total score and 24 (67%) of 36 patients achieved this for the EQ-5D visual analogue scale. INTERPRETATION: These findings, along with the activity and safety results of ELIANA, suggest a favourable benefit-risk profile of tisagenlecleucel in the treatment of paediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

The most frequent initial symptom was visual acuity decrease, with mean initial visual acuity being 20/40, excluding 8 eyes that had vision lower than 20/200. 21 presented unilateral ocular involvement. Vitrectomy was performed in all of them obtaining a dry sample. Vitrectomy was performed in all of the patients obtaining a dry sample. Moreover, the following techniques were done: 5 retinal biopsies, obtaining 5 muestras diluidas, 1 subretinal abscess aspirate and 1 aqueous humor aspirate. The most frequent processing technique that was used was cytology in 25 eyes, followed by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in 11 eyes and culture in 10 eyes. Diagnosis was achieved in 94.5% of patients. Main diagnosis found was lymphoma, followed by toxoplasmosis. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic vitrectomy is very important in ophthalmic inflammation identification. Different techniques for obtaining and processing can be used.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Sociedad Espanola de Oftalmologia. Publicado por Elsevier', 'Espana, S.L.U.

leukemia. Focusing on cytogenetically normal (CN) AML, we previously described an abnormal H3K27me3 enrichment covering 70 kb on the HIST1 cluster (6.p22) in CN-AML patient blasts. Here, we further investigate the molecular, functional, and prognosis significance of this epigenetic alteration named H3K27me3 HIST1 in NPM1-mutated (NPM1mut) CN-AML. RESULTS: We found that three quarter of the NPM1mut CN-AML patients were H3K27me3 HIST1(high). H3K27me3 HIST1(high) group of patients was associated with a favorable outcome independently of known molecular risk factors. In gene expression profiling, the H3K27me3 HIST1(high) mark was associated with lower expression of the histone genes HIST1H1D, HIST1H2BG, HIST1H2AE, and HIST1H3F and an upregulation of genes involved in myelomonocytic differentiation. Mass spectrometry analyses confirmed that the linker histone protein H1d, but not the other histone H1 subtypes, was downregulated in the H3K27me3 HIST1(high) group of patients. H1d knockdown primed ATRA-mediated differentiation of OCI-AML3 and U937 AML cell lines, as assessed on CD11b/CD11c markers, morphological and gene expression analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that NPM1mut AML prognosis depends on the epigenetic silencing of the HIST1 cluster and that, among the H3K27me3 silenced histone genes, HIST1H1D plays a role in AML blast differentiation.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Epigenetics', '*H3K27me3', '*HIST1', '*NPM1']",PMC6790061,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 9.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) can be curative for patients with hematologic malignancies. The ideal conditioning regimen before allo-HSCT has not been established. We conducted a Phase II study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of clofarabine and treosulfan as conditioning regimen before allo-HSCT. The primary objective was to evaluate the cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) on day +100. Forty-four patients (36 with acute myelogenous leukemia, 5 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 3 with myelodysplastic syndromes) were enrolled. The median patient age was 47 years, and the median duration of follow-up was 27 months. The conditioning regimen was based on clofarabine 40 mg/m(2) (days -6 to -2) and treosulfan 14 g/m(2) (days -6 to -4). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells were derived from a sibling (n=22) or a well-matched unrelated donor (n=22). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of antithymocyte globulin, rituximab, cyclosporine, and a short-course of methotrexate. The regimen allowed for rapid engraftment and a 100-day NRM of 18%, due mainly to bacterial infections. The incidences of grade II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD were 16% and 19%, respectively. The rates of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and relapse at 2 years were 51%, 31%, and 50%, respectively. Significantly different outcomes were observed between patients with low-intermediate and patients with high-very high Disease Risk Index (DRI) scores (1-year OS, 78% and 24%, respectively). Our findings show that the use of treosulfan and clofarabine as a conditioning regimen for allo-HSCT is feasible, with a 78% 1-year OS in patients with a low-intermediate DRI score. However, 1-year NRM was 18%, and despite the intensified conditioning regimen, relapse incidence remains a major issue in patients with poor prognostic risk factors.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Oct 9.,"It remains unclear whether the HLA haplotype of unrelated cord blood (UCB) should be matched to that of the patient in single UCB transplantation. Thus, using data from a Japanese registry, we analyzed the effect of haplotype matching on outcomes. Patients with hematologic diseases aged 16 years or older who had undergone their first transplant were included (N=1347). The effects of haplotype matching and high-frequency HLA haplotype on outcomes were analyzed. Median patient age was 55 years. The cumulative incidences of neutrophil engraftment among groups with 0, 1, and 2 HLA haplotype matches were 79%, 82%, and 88%, respectively (P=.008). In a multivariate analysis, the group with 0 haplotype matches was marginally associated with worse neutrophil engraftment (P=.087) and significantly associated with platelet engraftment (P=.044) compared with the group with 1 haplotype match. Two-haplotype matches were associated with a higher risk of relapse. In the group with 1 haplotype match, the top 3 shared haplotypes were ""A*24:02-B*52:01-C*12:02-DRB1*15:02"" (HP-P1), ""A*33:03-B*44:03-C*14:03-DRB1*13:02"" (HP-P2), and ""A*24:02-B*07:02-C*07:02-DRB1*01:01"" (HP-P3). The presence of HP-P2 but not HP-P1 or HP-P3 was associated with a decreased risk of grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (hazard ratio, .56; P=.001) but an increased risk of relapse (hazard ratio, 1.35; P=.045). HLA haplotype matching might be considered to improve engraftment. Two-haplotype matches should be avoided if the relapse risk is high. The haplotype itself may have an effect on the risk of acute graft-versus-host disease and relapse.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Oct 9.,"CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cell immunotherapy is a novel treatment with promising results in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoid malignancies. CAR T cell therapy has known early toxicities of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, but little is known about long-term neuropsychiatric adverse effects. We have used patient-reported outcomes, including Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures, to assess neuropsychiatric and other patient-reported outcomes of 40 patients with relapse/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1 to 5 years after treatment with CD19-targeted CAR T cells. Mean T scores of PROMIS domains of global mental health, global physical health, social function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance were not clinically meaningfully different from the mean in the general US population. However, 19 patients (47.5%) reported at least 1 cognitive difficulty and/or clinically meaningful depression and/or anxiety, and 7 patients (17.5%) scored </=40 in global mental health, indicating at least 1 standard deviation worse than the general population mean. Younger age was associated with worse long-term global mental health (P=.02), anxiety (P=.001), and depression (P= .01). Anxiety before CAR T cell therapy was associated with increased likelihood of anxiety after CAR T cell therapy (P=.001). Fifteen patients (37.5%) reported cognitive difficulties after CAR T cell therapy. Depression before CAR T cell therapy was statistically significantly associated with higher likelihood of self-reported post-CAR T cognitive difficulties (P=.02), and there was a trend for an association between acute neurotoxicity and self-reported post-CAR T cognitive difficulties (P=.08). Having more post-CAR T cognitive difficulties was associated with worse global mental health and global physical health. Our study demonstrates overall good neuropsychiatric outcomes in 40 long-term survivors after CAR T cell therapy. However, nearly 50% of patients in the cohort reported at least 1 clinically meaningful negative neuropsychiatric outcome (anxiety, depression, or cognitive difficulty), indicating that a significant number of patients would likely benefit from mental health services following CAR T cell therapy. Younger age, pre-CAR T anxiety or depression, and acute neurotoxicity may be risk factors for long-term neuropsychiatric problems in this patient population. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Oct 9.,"This study aimed to investigate time-varying effects of graft type on outcomes for patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. For this purpose we analyzed 3952 patients, 720 of whom underwent matched related bone marrow transplantation (BMT), 1004 matched related peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), 856 matched unrelated BMT, and 1372 umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) during complete remission. The 4-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were 59.1%, 52.8%, 59.5%, and 50.6%, respectively. Compared with related BMT, related PBSCT, unrelated BMT, and UCBT were associated with higher risk of nonrelapse mortality and unrelated BMT and UCBT with lower risk of relapse. As a result, both RFS and overall survival were comparable between related BMT and unrelated BMT but were worse for related PBSCT and UCBT than for related BMT. Adverse impact of UCBT was observed only during the early phase of transplant, whereas that of related PBSCT continued even after 2 years post-transplant. Our findings raise concerns about the increased risk of late nonrelapse mortality with the use of PBSC grafts and suggest that related BMT is preferable to related PBSCT; matched unrelated BMT is the next choice in the absence of a matched related donor.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Oct 9.,"Acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are currently genomically characterized by karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), real-time quantitative PCR, and DNA sequencing. Next-generation sequencing offers the promise of detecting all genomic lesions in a single run. However, technical limitations have hampered the detection of chromosomal rearrangements, so most studies are limited to somatic mutation assessment or require the use of RNA-based strategies. To overcome these limitations, we designed a targeted-DNA capture next-generation sequencing approach associated with easy-to-perform public bioinformatic tools for one-step identification of translocations, inversions, and somatic mutations in AML. Thirty well-characterized newly diagnosed myeloid leukemia patients (27 AML and 3 chronic myeloid leukemia) were tested with the panel. Twenty-three of 24 known rearrangements, as well as one novel fusion gene that could not be detected by karyotype/fluorescence in situ hybridization/real-time quantitative PCR, were detected. This strategy also identified all chromosomal breakpoints as potential targets for future high-sensitive minimal residual disease studies. In addition, mutation analysis revealed the presence of missense protein-coding alterations in at least 1 of the 32 genes evaluated in 21 of 30 patients (70%). This strategy may represent a time- and cost-effective diagnostic method for molecular characterization in AML.","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

We collected stool and blood samples at day 15 posttransplant from 150 patients from two centers who underwent myeloablative conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Stool microbiota were detected by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing; inflammatory factors and T lymphocytes were detected by multiplex immunoassays and flow cytometry, respectively. A gut microbiota score (GMS) from a LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) model was developed and validated to predict aGVHD. In the discovery cohort, the GMS could predict II-IV aGVHD (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC] = 0.904, P < .0001). Furthermore, the validation model was consistent with the discovery set (AUC = 0.887, P < .0001). Regulatory T/T-helper 17 (Treg/Th17) cells ratio in the low GMS subgroup was higher compared with the high GMS (P = .012), and the validation set is consistent with the discovery set (P = .003). In addition, high cytokine levels were associated with high GMS. In conclusion, the GMS at neutrophil engraftment could predict aGVHD, and it was a potential and novel method. The GMS was associated with the inflammatory factor and Treg/Th17 balance.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Interestingly, the role of specific circRNAs in leukemogenesis has been disclosed by a few studies, mostly in acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, circRNA expression in B-cells, T-cells and monocytes of healthy subjects is described, including putative new circRNA genes. Expression comparison considered 6,228 circRNAs and highlighted cell population-specific expression and exon usage patterns. Differential expression has been confirmed by qRT-PCR for circRNAs specific of B-cells (circPAX5, circAFF3, circIL4R, and circSETBP1) or T-cells (circIKZF1, circTNIK, circTXK, and circFBXW7), and for circRNAs from intronic (circBCL2) and intergenic regions that were overexpressed in lymphocytes.

In mast cells, the second messenger Ap4A binds to the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1), disrupts its interaction with the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), and eventually activates the transcription of genes downstream of MITF in response to immunostimulation. How the HINT1 protein recognizes and is regulated by Ap4A remain unclear. Here, using eight crystal structures, biochemical experiments, negative stain electron microscopy, and cellular experiments, we report that Ap4A specifically polymerizes HINT1 in solution and in activated rat basophilic leukemia cells. The polymerization interface overlaps with the area on HINT1 for MITF interaction, suggesting a possible competitive mechanism to release MITF for transcriptional activation. The mechanism depends precisely on the length of the phosphodiester linkage of Ap4A. These results highlight a direct polymerization signaling mechanism by the second messenger.",,,,,PMC6789022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2019 Oct.,"Patients harboring germline pathogenic biallelic variants in genes involved in the recognition and repair of DNA damage are known to have a substantially increased cancer risk. Emerging evidence suggests that individuals harboring heterozygous variants in these same genes may also be at heightened, albeit lesser, risk for cancer. Herein, we sought to determine whether heterozygous variants in RECQL4, the gene encoding an essential DNA helicase that is defective in children with the autosomal recessive cancer-predisposing condition Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), are associated with increased risk for childhood cancer. To address this question, we interrogated germline sequence data from 4435 pediatric cancer patients at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and 1127 from the National Cancer Institute Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatment (TARGET) database and identified 24 (0.43%) who harbored loss-of-function (LOF) RECQL4 variants, including five of 249 (2.0%) with osteosarcoma (OS). These RECQL4 variants were significantly overrepresented in children with OS, the cancer most frequently observed in patients with RTS, as compared to 134,187 noncancer controls in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD v2.1; P = 0.00087, odds ratio [OR] = 7.1, 95% CI, 2.9-17). Nine of the 24 (38%) individuals possessed the same c.1573delT (p.Cys525Alafs) variant located in the highly conserved DNA helicase domain, suggesting that disruption of this domain is central to oncogenesis. Altogether these data expand our understanding of the genetic factors predisposing to childhood cancer and reveal a novel association between heterozygous RECQL4 LOF variants and development of pediatric OS.",['(c) 2019 Maciaszek et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hodgkin lymphoma', '*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias', '*craniopharyngioma', '*osteosarcoma', '*pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",PMC6824257,,,"['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01354002', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02530658', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00760656']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether the common IKZF1 polymorphisms rs4132601 T/G and rs111978267 A/G are associated with ALL among a Tunisian pediatric cohort. METHODS: This case-control study involved 170 patients with ALL and 150 control subjects. SNP genotyping was performed by TaqMan(R) SNP Genotyping Assay. RESULTS: The minor allele G of IKZF1 gene polymorphism rs4132601 T/G was significantly higher in ALL cases than in control subjects (P = 0.029), with 1.54-fold increased risk of ALL. The association of rs4132601 with ALL was seen under co-dominant (P = 0.009), recessive (P = 0.006), and additive (P = 0.027) genetic models, of which the co-dominant (P = 0.027) and recessive (P = 0.027) association remained significant after adjusting for covariates, and False Discovery Rate correction. In contrast, no association was noted for rs111978267 variant. Two-locus (rs4132601-rs11978267) IKZF1 haplotype analysis demonstrated association of GA (P = 0.053), with increased ALL risk [OR (95% CI) = 1.58 (1.00-2.51)], which remained significant after controlling for key covariates [aP = 0.046; aOR (95% CI) = 1.61 (1.01-2.57)]. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the association of IKZF1 polymorphism rs4132601 T/G with increased risk of ALL among Tunisian pediatric cohort, with altered phenotypic changes among ALL patients.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Gene polymorphism', '*IKZF1, rs4132601, rs111978267']",PMC6788013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Better treatment options for leukemia are required due to a large number of side effects associated with current therapeutic regimens. In the present study, we sought to determine the pathway of triggering apoptosis of leukemic cells by Ocimum basilicum (O. basilicum) plant extract. MATERIALS/METHODS: Methanolic extract of the O. basilicum plant material was prepared. The crude extract was fractionated into several fractions through column chromatography using ethyl acetate and n-hexane as eluting solvents. Cell viability of leukemic cells was assessed via Cell titer GLO assay and apoptosis was measured through Annexin V/PI staining. Two apoptotic molecules JNK and caspases were analyzed through western blotting while pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFalpha, CCL2 and CXCL8 using qPCR. Fractions were characterized through LC-MS. RESULTS: The most potent with lowest IC50 values among the fractions were BF2 (2:8 n-hexane:ethyl acetate) and BF3 (3:7 n-hexane:ethyl acetate). Cytotoxicity was associated with apoptosis. Apoptosis was found caspasedependent and P-JNK activation was detected sustained. A significant increase in the level of TNF alpha and a decrease in the level of CXCL8 were observed in BF2 and BF3 treated cells. CONCLUSION: The fractions of O. basilicum extract were found to kill cells following JNK pathway activation. Excellent results were obtained with BF2 and BF3 probably due to predominant Epicatechin and Cinnamic acid derivatives in these fractions.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Ocimum basilicum', '*cytokines', '*cytotoxicity', '*leukemia', '*natural products.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, when working with people who are not experts in data science such as doctors, lawyers, and judges among others, finding interpretable algorithms can be a critical success factor. Practitioners have a deep understanding of the individual input variables but far less insight into how they interact with each other. For example, there may be ranges of an input variable for which the observed outcome is significantly more or less likely. This paper describes an algorithm for automatic detection of such thresholds, called the Univariate Flagging Algorithm (UFA). The algorithm searches for a separation that optimizes the difference between separated areas while obtaining a high level of support. We evaluate its performance using six sample datasets and demonstrate that thresholds identified by the algorithm align well with published results and known physiological boundaries. We also introduce two classification approaches that use UFA and show that the performance attained on unseen test data is comparable to or better than traditional classifiers when confidence intervals are considered. We identify conditions under which UFA performs well, including applications with large amounts of missing or noisy data, applications with a large number of inputs relative to observations, and applications where incidence of the target is low. We argue that ease of explanation of the results, robustness to missing data and noise, and detection of low incidence adverse outcomes are desirable features for clinical applications that can be achieved with relatively simple classifier, like UFA.",,,,,PMC6788700,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of the synthesized compounds were tested for their cytotoxic effects on different leukemic cell lines. Of interest, AQ15 exhibited a better selectivity than the reference drug imatinib on cancer cells. Owing to this, AQ15 was selected for a further apoptosis/necrosis evaluation where AQ15-treated K562 cells demonstrated similar apoptotic effects like imatinib-treated cells at their IC50 values. The inhibitory effects of AQ15 and the other three compounds with various activities against eight tyrosine kinases, including ABL1, were investigated. AQ15 showed weak activity against ABL1, and a correlation was observed between the anti-K562 and anti-ABL1 activities. The binding mode of AQ15 into the ATP binding pocket of ABL1 kinase was predicted in silico, showing the formation of some key interactions. In addition, AQ15 was shown to suppress the downstream signaling of BCR-ABL in K562 cells. Finally, AQ15 obviously cleaved DNA in the presence of an iron(II) complex system, indicating that this can be the major mechanism of its antiproliferative action, whereas the mild inhibition of ABL kinase is just in-part mechanism of its overall outstanding cellular activity.",['(c) 2019 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft.'],"['FBA-2016-20662,FBA-2017-24559/Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of', 'Istanbul University', '24659048/Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Exploratory Research']",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA cleavage', 'aminoquinone', 'apoptosis', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'kinase inhibitor', 'plastoquinone', 'structure-activity relationship']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until quite recently, WES has been out of reach for many clinicians and molecular biologists, and it still poses issues or is met with some reluctance with regards to cost versus benefit in terms of effective assay costs, hands-on laboratory work and data analysis bottlenecks. Although WES is used more than ever, it may also be argued that the usage is peaking and that new implementations, or relevance in its current state, will likely be leveling off during the following decade as the price on whole genome sequencing continues to drop. In this review, we focus on the past decade of targeted whole exome sequencing in malignant hematology. We thematically revisit some of the significant discoveries and niches that use next-generation sequencing, and we outline what and how WES has contributed to the field - from clonal hematopoiesis of the aging bone marrow to profiling malignancies down to the single cell.",['(c) 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['Syddansk Universitet/International'],['NOTNLM'],"['*laboratory hematology', '*next generation sequencing', '*sequencing anniversary', '*targeted panel sequencing', '*whole exome sequencing', '*whole genome sequencing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we designed an homologous recombination (HR) plasmid to target of the ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene in the REH cell line containing the ETV6-RUNX1t(12;21) translocation. Cells were cultured and transfected by HR plasmid. The presence of the replacement cassette at specific location in the ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene was verified by PCR and sequencing method. A quantitative gene expression assay was performed to evaluate changes in expression of ETV6, RUNX1, and ETV6/RUNX1 genes following editing. The cell viability was measured by trypan blue staining. The expression of the ETV6 gene was significantly increased in modified cells than unmodified cells by 10.9-fold. In contrast, the expression of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene was significantly decreased in the modified cells compared with unmodified cells by 0.26-fold. The expression of the RUNX1 gene had no significant difference between modified and unmodified cells. The survival rate of edited cells was significantly decreased than unedited cells (p = 013). We designed a gene targeting system based on HR method to correct genes of ETV6 and RUNX1 simultaneously in ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene on chromosome 12 containing ETV6-RUNX1t(12;21) translocation. The modification of this translocation may lead to reducing effects of the fusion gene's damaging and the dosage compensation related to ETV6 and RUNX1 genes and subsequently reduce the effects of leukemia.

Here, we investigated the impact of myeloid Mcl-1 deletion in atherosclerosis. Western type diet fed LDL receptor-deficient mice were transplanted with either wild-type (WT) or LysMCre Mcl-1(fl/fl) (Mcl-1(-/-)) bone marrow. Mcl-1 myeloid deletion resulted in enhanced apoptosis and lipid accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques. In vitro, Mcl-1 deficient macrophages also showed increased lipid accumulation, resulting in increased sensitivity to lipid-induced cell death. However, plaque size, necrotic core and macrophage content were similar in Mcl-1(-/-) compared to WT mice, most likely due to decreased circulating and plaque-residing neutrophils. Interestingly, Mcl-1(-/-) peritoneal foam cells formed up to 45% more multinucleated giant cells (MGCs) in vitro compared to WT, which concurred with an increased MGC presence in atherosclerotic lesions of Mcl-1(-/-) mice. Moreover, analysis of human unstable atherosclerotic lesions also revealed a significant inverse correlation between MGC lesion content and Mcl-1 gene expression, coinciding with the mouse data. Taken together, these findings suggest that myeloid Mcl-1 deletion leads to a more apoptotic, lipid and MGC-enriched phenotype. These potentially pro-atherogenic effects are however counteracted by neutropenia in circulation and plaque.",,,,,PMC6787218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify new regulators of erythropoiesis, we utilize a functional genomic screen for genes affecting expression of the erythroid marker CD235a/GYPA. Among validating hits are genes coding for the N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) mRNA methyltransferase (MTase) complex, including, METTL14, METTL3, and WTAP. We demonstrate that m(6)A MTase activity promotes erythroid gene expression programs through selective translation of ~300 m(6)A marked mRNAs, including those coding for SETD histone methyltransferases, ribosomal components, and polyA RNA binding proteins. Remarkably, loss of m(6)A marks results in dramatic loss of H3K4me3 marks across key erythroid-specific KLF1 transcriptional targets (e.g., Heme biosynthesis genes). Further, each m(6)A MTase subunit and a subset of their mRNAs targets are required for human erythroid specification in primary bone-marrow derived progenitors.

Epub 2019 Oct 10.,"ABL-class fusions other than BCR-ABL1 characterize around 2-3% of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Case series indicated that patients suffering from these subtypes have a dismal outcome and may benefit from the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We analyzed clinical characteristics and outcome of 46 ABL-class fusion positive cases other than BCR-ABL1 treated according to AIEOP-BFM (Associazione Italiana di Ematologia-Oncologia Pediatrica-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) ALL 2000 and 2009 protocols; 13 of them received a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) during different phases of treatment. ABL-class fusion positive cases had a poor early treatment response: minimal residual disease levels of >/=5x10(-4) were observed in 71.4% of patients after induction treatment and in 51.2% after consolidation phase. For the entire cohort of 46 cases, the 5-year probability of event-free survival was 49.1+8.9% and that of overall survival 69.6+7.8%; the cumulative incidence of relapse was 25.6+8.2% and treatment-related mortality (TRM) 20.8+6.8%. One out of 13 cases with TKI added to chemotherapy relapsed while eight of 33 cases without TKI treatment suffered from relapse, including six in 17 patients who had not received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Stem cell transplantation seems to be effective in preventing relapses (only three relapses in 25 patients), but was associated with a very high TRM (6 patients). These data indicate a major need for an early identification of ABL-class fusion positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases and to establish a properly designed, controlled study aimed at investigating the use of TKI, the appropriate chemotherapy backbone and the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Epub 2019 Oct 10.,"The BCL-2-specific inhibitor, ABT-199 (venetoclax) has exhibited remarkable clinical activity in nearly all cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In contrast, responses are usually much less in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), despite high level expression of BCL-2 in over 40% of cases, indicating that co-expression of related anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins may limit the activity of ABT-199. We have investigated the roles of BCL-2 proteins in DLBCL cells using a panel of specific BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3)-mimetics and identified subgroups of these cells that exhibited marked and specific dependency on either BCL-2, BCL-XL or MCL-1 for survival. Dependency was associated with selective sequestration of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM, BAX and BAK by the specific anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein which was important for cellular survival. Sensitivity to BH3-mimetics was independent of genetic alterations involving the BCL-2 family and only partially correlated with protein expression levels. Treatment with ABT-199 displaced BAX and BIM from BCL-2, subsequently leading to BAK activation and apoptosis. In contrast, apoptosis induced by inhibiting BCL-XL with A1331852 was associated with a displacement of both BAX and BAK from BCL-XL and occurred independently of BIM. Finally, the MCL-1 inhibitor S63845 induced mainly BAX-dependent apoptosis mediated by a displacement of BAK, BIM and NOXA from MCL-1. In conclusion, our study indicates that in DLBCL, the heterogeneous response to BH3-mimetics is mediated by selective interactions between BAX, BAK and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins.",['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],['MC_U132670597/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,PMC7395267,,,,,['Haematologica. 2020 Aug;105(8):1993-1996.

Epub 2019 Oct 10.,"Uric acid is a danger signal contributing to inflammation. Its relevance to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) derives from preclinical models where the depletion of uric acid led to improved survival and reduced graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). In a clinical pilot trial, peri-transplant uric acid depletion reduced acute GvHD incidence. This prospective international multicenter study aimed to investigate the association of uric acid serum levels before start of conditioning with alloSCT outcome. We included patients with acute leukemia, lymphoma or myelodysplastic syndrome receiving a first matched sibling alloSCT from peripheral blood, regardless of conditioning. We compared outcomes between patients with high and low uric acid levels with univariate- and multivariate analysis using a cause-specific Cox model. Twenty centers from 10 countries reported data on 366 alloSCT recipients. There were no significant differences in terms of baseline comorbidity and disease stage between the high- and low uric acid group. Patients with uric acid levels above median measured before start of conditioning did not significantly differ from the remaining in terms of acute GvHD grades II-IV incidence (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.5, 95% Confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-2.4, P=0.08). However, they had significantly shorter overall survival (HR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.7-4.7, P<0.0001) and progression free survival (HR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1-2.4, P=0.025). Non-relapse mortality was significantly increased in alloSCT recipients with high uric acid levels (HR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.4-5.0, P=0.003). Finally, the incidence of relapse after alloSCT was increased in patients with higher uric acid levels (HR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.5, P=0.04). We conclude that high uric acid levels before the start of conditioning correlate with increased mortality after alloSCT.",['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],['DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],,,PMC7327652,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we reported that treatment of Mnk inhibitor CGP57380 resulted in decreased Mcl-1 expression while increased c-PARP expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate association between Mcl-1 expression and clinicopathological features of NSCLC, and their correlation between Mcl-1 and both proliferation index (PI) and apoptotic index (AI) in NSCLC patients. METHODS: Tissue microarrays (TMA) including 350 cases of surgically resected NSCLC were utilize and stained with Mcl-1, Ki-67 and c-PARP antibodies, PI and AI were then evaluated, respectively. RESULTS: Higher Mcl-1 expression and PI were observed in NSCLC compared with non-cancerous lung tissues (non-CLT), while AI was significantly lower in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) compared with non-CLT. Additionally, Mcl-1 expression in lung ADC was evidently higher than that of in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The elevated Mcl-1 expression was associated with PI, and inversely related to AI in NSCLC. NSCLC patients with elevated Mcl-1 expression and high PI, or with high Mcl-1 expression and low AI had remarkably shorter overall survival time than these patients with low Mcl-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated expression of Mcl-1 might be inversely proportional to disease progression of NSCLC patients by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, and Mcl-1 might serve as novel biomarker of poor prognosis for NSCLC patients.",,"['81773218/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81703009/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81472773/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'C-PARP', 'Ki-67', 'Mcl-1', 'Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)']",PMC6788105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the activities of IDE in comparison to bendamusine (BEN), a commonly used alkylating agent, in primary CLL cells ex vivo. In contrast to BEN, IDE was cytotoxic to cells from extensively-treated patients, including those with a deletion (del)17p. Cross-resistance was not observed between BEN and IDE, confirming their different modes of cytotoxicity. Marked synergy was seen between BEN and IDE, even in cases that were resistant to BEN or IDE individually, and those with deletion (del) 17p. CD40L/interleukin 4 (IL4) co-treatment mimicking the CLL microenvironment increased resistance to IDE, but synergy was retained. PI3Kdelta-deficient murine splenic B cells were more resistant to IDE and showed reduced synergy with BEN, thus confirming the importance of functional PI3Kdelta protein. Although IDE was observed to induce gammaH2AX, IDE did not enhance activation of the DNA damage response nor DNA repair activity. Interestingly, IDE decreased global RNA synthesis and was antagonistic with 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole 1-b-D-ribofuranoside (DRB), an inhibitor of transcription.

It also shows certain anti-tumor activity, but its clinical application in tumor therapy is limited because high dosage is required. In this study, we demonstrate that M860, a monoclonal antibody against human LF (hLF), could significantly increase the anti-tumor potential of low dosage hLF by forming LF-containing immune complex (IC). Human monocytes primed with LF-IC, but not hLF or M860 alone, or control ICs, showed strong tumoricidal activity on leukemia cell lines Jurkat and Raji through induction of secreted Granzyme B (GzB). LF-IC is able to colligate membrane-bound CD14 (a TLR4 co-receptor) and FcgammaRIIa (a low affinity activating Fcgamma receptor) on the surface of human monocytes, thereby triggering the Syk-PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway leading to GzB production.

Epub 2019 Oct 10.,"Thromboembolism (TE) is a well-recognized complication of pediatric cancer and can lead to mortality and excess morbidity. There is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis in children. We conducted a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis of primary pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in children and adolescents (0-21 years) with cancer. The primary outcomes were objectively proven TE and major bleeding. The network meta-analysis included comparisons of multiple alternatives simultaneously: antithrombin (AT) replacement, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and standard of care (SOC) defined as no thromboprophylaxis or low-dose heparin for catheter patency. Six articles describing 1,318 patients were included (mean age: 6.7 years, 56.7% male). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the underlying diagnosis in 97.5% of patients. All studies were considered at moderate or high risk of bias. LMWH was the only agent associated with lower odds of TE compared with SOC (odds ratio [OR]: 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06-0.81). No statistically significant difference was detected between other thromboprophylaxis modalities and SOC. Tau(2) and I (2) suggested a high degree of heterogeneity. No statistically significant differences in the odds of major bleeding were found between AT replacement, LMWH, VKA, and SOC. Current evidence suggests that low-dose LMWH is effective and safe to prevent TE in children with cancer but is insufficient to conclude if AT replacement or VKA are effective thromboprophylaxis options. Further research, notably randomized controlled trials enrolling children with diverse types of cancer, is crucially needed.",['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

We reported that peri-transplant gut colonization with E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus is associated with lower mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Because most acute leukemia patients undergoing HCT have received intensive chemotherapy (usually requiring prolonged hospitalization) for their underlying disease before HCT, we hypothesized that some may have acquired vanC-positive enterococci during chemotherapy. Therefore, we evaluated the presence of the vanC gene cluster using vanC1 and vanC2/3 qPCR in thrice-weekly collected stool samples from 20 acute leukemia patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. We found that an unexpectedly large proportion of patients have detectable vanC1 and vanC2/3 (15% and 35%, respectively) in at least one stool sample. Comparing qPCR results with 16S rRNA gene sequencing results suggested that E. gallinarum may reach high abundances, potentially persisting into HCT and influencing transplant outcomes.",,,,,PMC6786763,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has context-dependent pro- and anti-cell proliferation functions. Activation of latent TGF-beta1 requires release of the growth factor from pro-complexes and is regulated through TGF-beta binding proteins. Two types of TGF-beta binding partners, latent TGF-beta-binding proteins (LTBPs) and leucine-rich-repeat-containing protein 32 (LRRC32), have been identified and their expression are cell specific. TGF-beta1 also plays important roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. However, the expression of LTBPs and LRRC32 are lacking in myeloid lineage cells and the binding protein of TGF-beta1 in these cells are unknown. Here we show that a novel leucine-rich-repeat-containing protein family member, LRRC33, with high mRNA level in AML cells, to be the binding and regulating protein of TGF-beta1 in AML cells. Using two representative cell lines MV4-11 and AML193, we demonstrate that the protein expression of LRRC33 and TGF-beta1 are correlated. LRRC33 co-localizes and forms complex with latent TGF-beta1 protein on the cell surface and intracellularly in these cells. Similar as in other cell types, the activation of TGF-beta1 in MV4-11 and AML193 cells are also integrin dependent. We anticipate our study to be a starting point of more comprehensive research on LRRC33 as novel TGF-beta regulating protein and potential non-genomic based drug target for AML and other myeloid malignancy.",,,,,PMC6786621,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 10.,"This study was conducted using TagSNPs to systematically explore the relationship between ARID5B polymorphisms and the occurrence, clinical characterization, and prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A total of 569 unrelated AML patients and 410 healthy individuals from West China were recruited, and ARID5B TagSNPs were genotyped using iMLDR((R)) (improved multiplex ligation detection reaction). It was found that the association of ARID5B polymorphisms with AML was most significant in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and exclusively in males, the mutant alleles of rs6415872, rs2393726, rs7073837, rs10821936, and rs7089424 were found to increase the risk of developing APL in men, the odds ratio (OR) were 1.36, 1.74, 1.45, 1.53, and 1.56 (all p < 0.05), respectively. Haplotype analysis revealed that haplotype [AACCG] increased the risk of male APL with an OR of 1.53 (95% confidence interval: 1.10-2.14, p = 0.012). Besides, there was a strong positive additive interaction between rs6415872 and rs10821936, rs7089424, respectively, and cases attributed to the interaction of rs6415872, rs10821936, and rs7089424 accounted for 100%. Furthermore, ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms were found associated with clinical features of AML, and rs6415872 was shown to be an independent prognosis factor in APL patients. Besides, dual luciferase report assay showed that rs6415872 may affect the binding activity of PPARG with ARID5B. ARID5B polymorphisms contribute to male APL risk, clinical feature, and prognosis, suggesting the importance of ARDI5B in AML pathogenesis and development, and the gender and subtype preference may prompt some specific mechanisms of ARID5B. Besides, ARID5B polymorphisms might be a potential prognosis biomarker.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['ARID5B', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'polymorphism', 'prognosis', 'susceptibility']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two pairs of human LA samples and adjacent para-carcinoma tissue samples were collected from our hospital between June 2015 and March 2017. Meanwhile, one normal human pulmonary epithelial cell line BEAS-2B and four human LA cell lines (H1299, PC-9, A549, and SPC-A1) were cultured. The cells' ability of proliferation and migration was detected by MTT assays and Transwell assays, respectively. The target gene was clarified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The related protein and mRNA expression levels were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), respectively. At last, the tumor xenograft model was made for further exploring the mechanism. RESULTS: MiR218 expressions were notably reduced in LA tissues in comparison with controls. In addition, the declined miR218 expressions were correlated with the poor OS and worse clinicopathological parameters of LA patients. Furthermore, miR218 overexpression could suppress the proliferation, migration and invasion capacities of LA cells via regulation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) respectively. Results in the current study also revealed that miR-218 upregulation could suppress the tumor growth rate and tumor size of LA mice. B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 (BMI-1) was confirmed to be a direct target for miR-218 and upregulated in LA tissues, which indicated the poor prognosis of LA patients. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-218 exerted anti-tumor functions in LA partially via the regulation of BMI-1, suggesting that BMI-1/miR-218 axis may provide a novel insight into tumorigenesis and the basis for the development of miRNA-targeting therapies against LA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2021 Apr;25(7):2827.

Epub 2019 Oct 10.,"PURPOSE: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a dreadful event in patients with hematological malignancies (HM). Recent advances have standardized diagnostic, prophylactic and curative therapeutic strategies. We sought to assess whether these advances actually translate into improved survival in critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure and IPA. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicenter study. Adult patients with HM, IPA, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure over a 20-year period (January 1998-December 2017) were included. A cox regression model was used to identify variables independently associated with day-90 survival. RESULTS: Overall, 219 patients were included [138 (63%) men, median age 55 (IQR 44-64)]. Acute myeloid leukemia (30.1%) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (22.8%) were the most frequent malignancies, and 53 (24.2%) were allogeneic stem cell recipients. Day-1 SOFA score was 9 [7-12]. Most patients presented with probable IPA, whereas 15 (7%) underwent lung biopsies or pleurocentesis and met criteria for proven IPA. Overall ICU and day-90 mortality were, respectively, 58.4% and 75.2% (80.4% if invasive mechanical ventilation) without any significant improvement over time. By multivariable analysis adjusted on day-1 SOFA score and ventilation strategies, voriconazole use (HR 0.49, CI 95 0.34-0.73, p < 0.001) and an ICU admission after 2010 (HR 0.67, 0.45-0.99, p = 0.042) were associated with increased survival, whereas a diffuse radiologic pattern (HR 2.07, CI 95 1.33-3.24, p = 0.001) and delayed admission to the ICU (HR 1.51, CI 95 1.05-2.16, p = 0.026) were independently associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: IPA is associated with high mortality rates in critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure. Routine voriconazole and prompt ICU admission are warranted.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Critically ill', '*Fungal infections', '*Hematological malignancies', '*Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 23.,"The 'instructive model' of aberrant DNA methylation in human tumors is based on the observation that CpG islands prone to hypermethylation in cancers are embedded in chromatin enriched in H3K27me3 in human embryonic stem cells (hESC). Recent studies also link methylation of CpG islands to the methylation status of H3K4, where H3K4me3 is inversely correlated with DNA methylation. To provide insight into these conflicting findings, we generated DNA methylation profiles for acute myeloid leukemia samples from patients and leukemic cell lines and integrated them with publicly available ChIp-seq data, containing H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 CpG island occupation in hESC, or hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells (hHSC/MPP). Hypermethylated CpG islands in AML samples displayed H3K27me3 enrichments in hESC and hHSC/MPP; however, ChIp analysis of specific hypermethylated CpG islands revealed a significant reduction in H3K4me3 signal with a concomitant increase in H3K4me0 levels as opposed to a nonsignificant increase in H3K27me3 marks. The integration of AML DNA methylation profiles with the ChIp-seq data in hESC and hHSC/MPP also led to the identification of Iroquois homeobox 2 (IRX2) as a previously unknown factor promoting differentiation of leukemic cells. Our results indicate that in contrast to the 'instructive model', H3K4me3 levels are strongly associated with DNA methylation patterns in AML and have a role in the regulation of critical genes, such as the putative tumor suppressor IRX2.",['(c) 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*histone modifications']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While improved care for congenital heart disease has decreased mortality and morbidity, complications related to immune-mediated diseases continue to limit the life expectancy in Down syndrome. Infectious diseases are common and have a significant effect on development, behaviour and quality of life. Infection frequency and severity are influenced by various anatomical and physiological alterations in addition to immunological changes in Down syndrome. Thus, prevention of respiratory tract infections requires a multifactorial approach. This could include additional active and/or passive immunizations, prophylactic antibiotics, immunoglobulin replacement and ear, nose and throat surgical interventions. Autoimmune conditions like coeliac disease, type I diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease are classically mentioned in the context of Down syndrome. However, autoinflammatory conditions are more prevalent as well. Screening for autoimmune diseases is required and immunosuppression has to be used with caution. Future studies should address optimal screening programmes for immune-mediated diseases in individuals with Down syndrome, as well as the effect of immune modulation, to further decrease morbidity and mortality, and improve the quality of life of individuals with Down syndrome.",['(c) 2019 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Transcriptomic analysis of cells expressing a p50 S80A mutant reveals a critical role for S80 in selectively regulating the TNFalpha inducible expression of a subset of NF-kappaB target genes including pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. S80 phosphorylation regulates the binding of p50 to NF-kappaB binding (kappaB) sites in a sequence specific manner. Specifically, phosphorylation of S80 reduces the binding of p50 at kappaB sites with an adenine at the -1 position. Our analyses demonstrate that p50 S80 phosphorylation predominantly regulates transcription through the p50:p65 heterodimer, where S80 phosphorylation acts in trans to limit the NF-kappaB mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. The regulation of a functional class of pro-inflammatory genes by the interaction of S80 phosphorylated p50 with a specific kappaB sequence describes a novel mechanism for the control of cytokine-induced transcriptional responses.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

However, its incidence and survival trends based on a large sample size have not been reported. Children diagnosed with AML between 1975 and 2014 were accessed from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Incidence and survival trends were evaluated by age-adjusted incidence and relative survival rates (RSRs) and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Cox regression was performed to identify independent risk factors for child AML death. The overall incidence of AML in childhood increased each decade between 1975 and 2014, with the total age-adjusted incidence increasing from 5.766 to 6.615 to 7.478 to 7.607 per 1,000,000 persons. In addition, the relative survival rates of AML in childhood improved significantly, with 5-year RSRs increasing from 22.40% to 39.60% to 55.50% to 68.30% over the past four decades (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, survival disparities among different races and socioeconomic statuses have continued to widen over the past four decades. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed a higher risk of death in Black patients (HR = 1.245, 95% CI: 1.077-1.438, p = 0.003) with Whites as a reference.

Therefore, the identification of an alternative donor with a lower risk of GVHD is important for patients lacking an HLA-identical sibling donor. To date, HLA studies of large cohorts of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (UR-HSCT) have provided important and helpful information for donor selection. In UR-HSCT through Japan Marrow Donor Program, patient and donor HLA-A, -B, and -C, and HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 double mismatches are significant risk factors for severe GVHD and mortality. HLA-DPB1 mismatch does not affect survival; however, it reduces the chances of leukemia relapse. In the analysis of a specific allele effect on transplant outcomes, HLA-C(*)14:02 was significantly associated with an increased risk of severe acute GVHD. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled full-length HLA allele typing. Evolutionary analysis of the entire HLA-DPB1 revealed that a highly conserved region from exon 3 to 3'UTR provoked acute GVHD that was different from a T-cell epitope mismatching algorithm, reflecting exon 2 polymorphisms. Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated the importance of full-length NGS HLA typing on UR-HSCT outcomes. The usage of NGS may provide important information on the implications of the HLA genes in allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'HLA', 'Next-generation sequencing HLA typing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the unique pharmacodynamics exhibited by infants has historically led to independent therapeutic development either in the U.S., Europe, or Japan. To improve the prognosis of infant ALL, it is necessary to uncover a supplementary novel effective agent to be used in combination with the existing conventional multi-agent chemotherapy. Because of the rarity of the disease, this could be only established by an international study, for which the consensus has already been established through discussions between the U.S., Europe, and Japan.

We observed that ALL cells migrate along the external surface of vessels that pass directly between the vertebral or calvarial bone marrow and the subarachnoid space. The basement membrane of these bridging vessels is enriched in laminin. The laminin is recognized by integrin alpha6, which is expressed by ALL cells. The interaction between integrin alpha6 and laminin mediated the invasion of ALL cells. Furthermore, the expression of integrin alpha6 depends on PI3Kdelta activity. Mice with ALL xenografts were treated with a PI3Kdelta inhibitor, which decreased integrin alpha6 expression on ALL cells.

To date, only around a hundred cases have been reported in the literature. Patients with EMS present with various forms of myeloid/lymphoid malignancies, such as myeloproliferative neoplasms, acute myeloid leukemia, and T- or B-linage lymphoblastic lymphoma, which are frequently associated with eosinophilia. Prognosis of EMS is poor and a standard treatment strategy has not yet been established. In contrast to myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms associated with PDGFR-A or PDGFR-B rearrangement, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib is not an effective therapeutic option for EMS patients. Other types of TKI, i.e., PKC412, sorafenib, ponatinib, dasatinib, and dovitinib, show growth-inhibitory effects against the cells harboring several types of FGFR-1 fusion genes in in vitro studies; however, the usefulness of either drug has not been confirmed by clinical trials. Therefore, at present, allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative methods for EMS. Very recently, a phase-2 study with pemigatinib, an inhibitor for FGFR1, showed clinical benefits for EMS patients, including major cytogenetic response, suggesting a new therapeutic option for EMS.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['8p11', 'FGFR1', 'Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms', 'Pemigatinib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five genes (Samd9, Samd9-like (Samd9L), Ezh2, MLL3, and CUX1) have been identified and their myeloid tumor suppression potential has been verified using mouse models. Mice lacking one Samd9L gene developed MDS at an advanced age, whereas mice children harboring a gain-of-function mutation of Samd9 or Samd9L gene suffer from bone marrow failure, which is frequently followed by childhood MDS with -7, suggesting that these tumor-suppressor genes are the key to understanding not only MDS with -7 but also MDS in general.

Print 2019 Dec 12.,"The divergent clinical outcomes of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-2 infections have been attributed to functional differences in their antisense proteins. In contrast to HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), the role of the antisense protein of HTLV-2 (APH-2) in HTLV-2 infection is poorly understood. In previous studies, we identified the endosomal sorting complex required for transport 0 (ESCRT-0) subunit HRS as a novel interaction partner of APH-2 but not HBZ. HRS is a master regulator of endosomal protein sorting for lysosomal degradation and is hijacked by many viruses to promote replication. However, no studies to date have shown a link between HTLVs and HRS. In this study, we sought to characterize the interaction between HRS and APH-2 and to investigate the impact of HRS on the life cycle of HTLV-2. We confirmed a direct specific interaction between APH-2 and HRS and showed that the CC2 domain of HRS and the N-terminal domain of APH-2 mediate their interaction. We demonstrated that HRS recruits APH-2 to early endosomes, possibly furnishing an entry route into the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. We demonstrated that inhibition of this pathway using either bafilomycin or HRS overexpression substantially extends the half-life of APH-2 and stabilizes Tax2B expression levels. We found that HRS enhances Tax2B-mediated long terminal repeat (LTR) activation, while depletion of HRS enhances HTLV-2 production and release, indicating that HRS may have a negative impact on HTLV-2 replication. Overall, our study provides important new insights into the role of the ESCRT-0 HRS protein, and by extension the ESCRT machinery and the endosomal/lysosomal pathway, in HTLV-2 infection.IMPORTANCE While APH-2 is the only viral protein consistently expressed in infected carriers, its role in HTLV-2 infection is poorly understood. In this study, we characterized the interaction between the ESCRT-0 component HRS and APH-2 and explored the role of HRS in HTLV-2 replication. HRS is a master regulator of protein sorting for lysosomal degradation, a feature that is manipulated by several viruses to promote replication. Unexpectedly, we found that HRS targets APH-2 and possibly Tax2B for lysosomal degradation and has an overall negative impact on HTLV-2 replication and release. The negative impact of interactions between HTLV-2 regulatory proteins and HRS, and by extension the ESCRT machinery, may represent an important strategy used by HTLV-2 to limit virus production and to promote persistence, features that may contribute to the limited pathogenic potential of this infection.",['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Microbiology.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*ESCRT', '*HRS', '*HTLV-1', '*HTLV-2', '*lysosomes']",PMC6912118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obtaining venous blood for serological screening, typically performed using enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), is invasive, sometimes socially unacceptable, and has restricted large-scale seroprevalence studies.

Epub 2019 Oct 9.,"Cancers are caused by genomic alterations known as drivers. Hundreds of drivers in coding genes are known but, to date, only a handful of noncoding drivers have been discovered-despite intensive searching(1,2). Attention has recently shifted to the role of altered RNA splicing in cancer; driver mutations that lead to transcriptome-wide aberrant splicing have been identified in multiple types of cancer, although these mutations have only been found in protein-coding splicing factors such as splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1)(3-6). By contrast, cancer-related alterations in the noncoding component of the spliceosome-a series of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)-have barely been studied, owing to the combined challenges of characterizing noncoding cancer drivers and the repetitive nature of snRNA genes(1,7,8). Here we report a highly recurrent A>C somatic mutation at the third base of U1 snRNA in several types of tumour. The primary function of U1 snRNA is to recognize the 5' splice site via base-pairing. This mutation changes the preferential A-U base-pairing between U1 snRNA and the 5' splice site to C-G base-pairing, and thus creates novel splice junctions and alters the splicing pattern of multiple genes-including known drivers of cancer. Clinically, the A>C mutation is associated with heavy alcohol use in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and with the aggressive subtype of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable regions. The mutation in U1 snRNA also independently confers an adverse prognosis to patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Our study demonstrates a noncoding driver in spliceosomal RNAs, reveals a mechanism of aberrant splicing in cancer and may represent a new target for treatment. Our findings also suggest that driver discovery should be extended to a wider range of genomic regions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because prospective randomized trials of in-vivo T cell depletion using anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATLG) in addition to a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate (MTX) led to conflicting outcome results, we evaluated the impact of ATLG on clinical outcome, lymphocyte- and immune reconstitution survival models. In total, 1500 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies received matched unrelated donor (MUD) HCT with cyclosporin and MTX (N = 723, 48%) or with additional ATLG (N = 777, 52%). In the ATLG cohort, grades III-IV acute (12% vs 23%) and extensive chronic GVHD (18% vs 34%) incidences were significantly reduced (P < .0001). Nonrelapse mortality (27% vs 45%) and relapse (30% vs 22%) differed also significantly. Event-free and overall survival estimates at 10 years were 44% and 51% with ATLG and 33% and 35% without ATLG (P < .002 and <.0001). A dose-dependent ATLG effect on lymphocyte- and neutrophil reconstitution was observed. At ATLG exposure, lymphocyte counts and survival associated through a logarithmically increasing function. In this survival model, the lymphocyte count optimum range at exposure was between 0.4 and 1.45/nL (P = .001).

Despite remarkable advances in treatment of cutaneous melanoma, UM remains recalcitrant to chemotherapy, small-molecule kinase inhibitors, and immune-based therapy. Methods: We assessed two sets of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) genes within 9858 tumors across 31 cancer types. An OxPhos inhibitor was used to characterize differential metabolic programming of highly metastatic monosomy 3 (M3) UM. Seahorse analysis and global metabolomics profiling were done to identify metabolic vulnerabilities. Analyses of UM TCGA data set were performed to determine expressions of key OxPhos effectors in M3 and non-M3 UM. We used targeted knockdown of succinate dehydrogenase A (SDHA) to determine the role of SDHA in M3 UM in conferring resistance to OxPhos inhibition. Results: We identified UM to have among the highest median OxPhos levels and showed that M3 UM exhibits a distinct metabolic profile. M3 UM shows markedly low succinate levels and has highly increased levels of SDHA, the enzyme that couples the tricarboxylic acid cycle with OxPhos by oxidizing (lowering) succinate. We showed that SDHA-high M3 UM have elevated expression of key OxPhos molecules, exhibit abundant mitochondrial reserve respiratory capacity, and are resistant to OxPhos antagonism, which can be reversed by SDHA knockdown. Conclusions: Our study has identified a critical metabolic program within poor prognostic M3 UM. In addition to the heightened mitochondrial functional capacity due to elevated SDHA, M3 UM SDHA-high mediate resistance to therapy that is reversible with targeted treatment.",,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA093459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6785781,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many childhood cancers are suspected to have initiated in utero; therefore, we examined the spatial-temporal randomness of the birthplace of children who later developed cancer. METHODS: We performed a space-time cluster analysis using birth addresses of 5,896 cases and 23,369 population-based, age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched controls in California from 1997 to 2007, evaluating 20 types of childhood cancer and three a priori designated subgroups of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We analyzed data using a newly designed semiparametric analysis program, ClustR, and a common algorithm, SaTScan. RESULTS: We observed evidence for nonrandom space-time clustering for ALL diagnosed at 2-6 years of age in the South San Francisco Bay Area (ClustR P = 0.04, SaTScan P = 0.07), and malignant gonadal germ cell tumors in a region of Los Angeles (ClustR P = 0.03, SaTScan P = 0.06). ClustR did not identify evidence of clustering for other childhood cancers, although SaTScan suggested some clustering for Hodgkin lymphoma (P = 0.09), astrocytoma (P = 0.06), and retinoblastoma (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that childhood ALL diagnosed at 2-6 years and malignant gonadal germ cell tumors sporadically occurs in nonrandom space-time clusters. Further research is warranted to identify epidemiologic features that may inform the underlying etiology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 23.,"Juglorubin, juglorescein, and juglocombins A/B are naturally occurring naphthoquinone dimers isolated from Streptomyces sp. These dimers are proposed to be biogenetically derived from juglomycin C, a monomeric naphthoquinone isolated from the same Streptomyces sp. In this study, the dimerization of a juglomycin C derivative, a key step in the total syntheses of these natural products, was investigated. Juglorubin was synthesized from the minor product of the dimerization via the formation of the juglocombin A/B stereoisomers. A mechanism for the dimerization reaction as well as a plausible biosynthetic pathway to obtain juglorubin from juglomycin C are proposed. Furthermore, the antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of five synthetic compounds were evaluated. Among the compounds tested in this study, 1'-O-methyljuglocombin B dimethyl ester and juglomycin C exhibited antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis. 1'-O-Methyljuglocombin B dimethyl ester and juglomycin C showed cytotoxicity against human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells and human leukemia HL-60 cells. 1'-O-Methyljuglocombin B dimethyl ester exhibited cytotoxicity against human normal MRC-5 cells as strong as that against human cancer cells. In contrast, juglomycin C was less toxic against normal MRC-5 cells, indicating a significant selectivity toward cancer cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, DMY downregulated the population of B cells and mast cells and upregulated the population of regulatory T cells in the spleens of ovalbumin-allergic mice. Furthermore, DMY blocked the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI)-IgE interaction, inhibited the release of beta-hexosaminidase and histamine in rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells, and alleviated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reactions.

Epub 2019 Oct 8.,"BACKGROUND: Therapy outcomes for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had substantially improved in the last decades, but variability across racial and ethnic groups was identified in some clinical studies. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether such a difference in outcome is found in the diverse ethnicities in Israel as well. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among 1154 patients (855 Jews, 195 Muslims, 52 Bedouins, 26 Druze, and 26 others) aged 1 to 21 years, who were diagnosed with ALL between 1989 and 2011 and were treated according to the same Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster-based Israel National Study protocols. RESULTS: Bedouins had a higher incidence of t(1;19) (16% vs 3% for non-Bedouins) and a lower incidence of high-hyperdiploidy (10% vs 25% for non-Bedouins) (P = 0.01). Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were poorer for the Bedouins (60.3% +/- 7.2% and 63.1% +/- 7.2%, respectively) compared with the Jews, Muslims, and Druze (80.4% +/- 1.4%, 77.3% +/- 3.2%, and 84% +/- 7.3%, respectively, for EFS [P = 0.02], and 86.3% +/- 1.2%, 82.3% +/- 2.9%, and 88.3% +/- 6.4%, respectively, for OS [P = 0.002]). Adherence to intensive chemotherapy was similar between the Muslims and the Bedouins. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the Bedouins, a highly inbred ethnic Arab people, may be considered a higher risk group that may need more intensive chemotherapy and/or supportive care in order to improve their outcome.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bedouin', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*ethnicity', '*outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 21.,"There have been conflicting results regarding the impact of minimal/measurable disease at transplant on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) outcomes after haploidentical transplantation (haplo-SCT). We assessed the impact of pre-transplant disease status on post-transplant outcomes of 143 patients treated with haplo-SCT using fludarabine-melphalan (FM) conditioning and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy). With a median follow-up of 29 months, the two-year PFS for all patients was 41%. Compared to patients in complete remission (CR) at transplant, those with active disease (n = 29) and CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) (n = 39) had worse PFS. They had hazard ratios (HR) of 3.5 (95% CI: 2.05-6.1; P < .001) and 2.3 (95% CI: 1.3-3.9; P = .002), respectively. Among patients who were in CR at transplant, there were no differences in PFS between those who had minimal residual disease (MRD) positive (n = 24), and MRD negative (n = 41) (HR 1.85, 95%CI: 0.9-4.0; P = .1). In multivariable analysis for patients in CR, only age was predictive for outcomes, while MRD status at transplant did not influence the treatment outcomes. Our findings suggest that haplo-SCT with FM conditioning regimen and PTCy-based GVHD prophylaxis has a protective effect, and may potentially abrogate the inferior outcomes of MRD positivity for patients with AML. Patients with positive MRD may benefit from proceeding urgently to a haplo-SCT, as this does not appear to negatively impact transplant outcomes.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 21.,"Despite the advances in the management of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), relapses remain challenging. We reviewed clinical data from adult patients with Ph + ALL who received frontline hyperCVAD chemotherapy with a TKI to determine their outcomes after first relapse. Patients with first morphological relapse after prior complete remission were evaluated for predictors of response and survival. For 57 of 233 (25%) patients, there was morphological relapse after a median of 15.9 months from first remission [range: 5.3-94]. The choice of salvage treatments was at the discretion of the treating physician. So, 43 (75%) patients received a TKI in combination with their salvage treatment. Second remission was achieved in 41 of 49 (84%) evaluable patients. Median relapse free survival (RFS) was 10.5 months [range, 0.2-81]. The 1-year and 2-year overall survival (OS) were 41% and 20% respectively. On multivariate analysis, only elevated LDH (units/L), the use of first-generation or no TKI at the time of first relapse and the achievement of a major molecular response (MMR) had a significant effect on OS (HR: 2.82, 95% CI:1.11-7.16, P = .029; HR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.07,5.39, P = .034; HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.16-0.94, P = .03, respectively). Whereas, only achievement of MMR was significantly prognostic for RFS with a HR of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.23-0.98, P = .04). The OS and RFS were comparable between recipients and non-recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) at second remission, due to a higher non-relapse mortality (53%) seen in patients who underwent alloHSCT.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 8.,"Although an NPM1 mutation is generally considered to be a good prognostic marker in acute myeloid leukaemia, it has recently been suggested that a higher level of NPM1 mutant (NPM1(MUT) ) alleles relative to wild-type alleles is associated with poor clinical outcome. We therefore sought to confirm this finding in a larger study of 876 NPM1(MUT) cases entered into UK national trials. In univariate analysis, the higher NPM1(MUT) allele burden was associated with a lower complete remission (CR) rate, higher relapse rate and reduced overall survival, but this was largely attributable to the association of the higher NPM1(MUT) allele burden with other known poor risk factors, particularly the presence of a concomitant FLT3 internal tandem duplication. In multivariate analysis, there was no significant impact of the NPM1(MUT) allele burden on CR rates, and the impact on relapse and overall survival, whilst still significant, was greatly reduced. This impact was similar in patients who did or did not receive an allogeneic transplant in first CR. We conclude that the binary presence or absence of an NPM1 mutation, combined with minimal residual disease levels following induction therapy, should continue to be used in therapeutic management rather than stratification according to the NPM1(MUT) level.",['(c) 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['11005/Bloodwise, formerly Leukaemia &amp; Lymphoma Research, United', 'Kingdom/International', '14001/Bloodwise, formerly Leukaemia &amp; Lymphoma Research, United', 'Kingdom/International', 'United Kingdom Medical Research Council/International', ""Department of Health's National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research"", 'Centres/International']",['NOTNLM'],"['*NPM1 mutant', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*prognostic impact', '*therapeutic management', '*variant allele frequency']",,,,,,['Br J Haematol. 2020 Mar;188(6):817-818.

Epub 2019 Oct 8.,"The reason why a few myeloma cells egress from the bone marrow (BM) into peripheral blood (PB) remains unknown. Here, we investigated molecular hallmarks of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to identify the events leading to myeloma trafficking into the bloodstream. After using next-generation flow to isolate matched CTCs and BM tumor cells from 32 patients, we found high correlation in gene expression at single-cell and bulk levels (r >/= 0.94, P = 10(-16)), with only 55 genes differentially expressed between CTCs and BM tumor cells. CTCs overexpressed genes involved in inflammation, hypoxia, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition, whereas genes related with proliferation were downregulated in CTCs. The cancer stem cell marker CD44 was overexpressed in CTCs, and its knockdown significantly reduced migration of MM cells towards SDF1-alpha and their adhesion to fibronectin. Approximately half (29/55) of genes differentially expressed in CTCs were prognostic in patients with newly-diagnosed myeloma (n = 553; CoMMpass). In a multivariate analysis including the R-ISS, overexpression of CENPF and LGALS1 was significantly associated with inferior survival. Altogether, these results help understanding the presence of CTCs in PB and suggest that hypoxic BM niches together with a pro-inflammatory microenvironment induce an arrest in proliferation, forcing tumor cells to circulate in PB and seek other BM niches to continue growing.",,['CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data often complicate the analysis. Here, we introduce a method for analyzing scATAC-seq data, called Single-Cell ATAC-seq analysis via Latent feature Extraction (SCALE). SCALE combines a deep generative framework and a probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model to learn latent features that accurately characterize scATAC-seq data. We validate SCALE on datasets generated on different platforms with different protocols, and having different overall data qualities. SCALE substantially outperforms the other tools in all aspects of scATAC-seq data analysis, including visualization, clustering, and denoising and imputation. Importantly, SCALE also generates interpretable features that directly link to cell populations, and can potentially reveal batch effects in scATAC-seq experiments.",,['R01 MH109665/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC6783552,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 8.,"The genetic and molecular alterations responsible for leukemogenesis and progression of HTLV-infected adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) have not been fully clarified. Previously, we reported that various genes are not only overexpressed but also abnormally spliced in ATL cells. Here, we identified various CASP8 transcript variants in PBMCs from a smoldering-type ATL patient, which encode aberrant truncated caspase 8 (Casp8) isoforms. Among those, we focus on the three transcript variants, CASP8L (including the first 136 bp of the intron 8 between exon 8 and exon 9), CASP8-DeltaE4 (without the exon 4), and CASP8-DeltaE7 (without the exon 7), because they encode isoforms, Casp8L, Casp8-DeltaE4, and Casp8-DeltaE7, respectively, without the C-terminal catalytic domains. In this study, we conducted in vitro characterization and functional analysis of those mutant Casp8 isoforms to clarify their changed functions compared with the wild-type (WT)-Casp8. We demonstrated that these abnormal Casp8 isoforms showed lower ability to induce apoptosis than WT-Casp8 due to their dominant-negative interactions with WT-Casp8, which impair WT-Casp8 homodimerization that is essential for induction of apoptosis. Moreover, Casp8L and Casp8-DeltaE7, which have only two death-effector domains, significantly activated NFkappaB by forming filament-like structures, which probably function as scaffolds for the IKK complex formation. In view of increasing levels of these abnormal CASP8 transcripts in primary PBMCs from HTLV-1 carriers and patients with ATL, we propose a possibility that overexpression of those Casp8 mutants, with lower proapoptotic activities and higher NFkappaB-activating functions than WT-Casp8, may be one of the molecular abnormalities causing malignant transformation and growth of ATL cells. IMPLICATIONS: We describe naturally occurring CASP8 transcription variants in PBMCs from patients with ATL, which encode truncated Casp8-mutant isoforms with lower proapoptotic activities and higher NFkappaB-activating functions compared with WT-Casp8.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MP is a recombinant immunotoxin that consists of an anti-CD22 immunoglobulin variable domain genetically joined to Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38). Unlike most antibody-drug conjugates, which use a chemical linker, recombinant DNA techniques are used to produce MP. MP and its predecessor, BL22, were initially developed to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and HCL. However, MP was found to be particularly effective in HCL due to the high level of CD22 cell-surface expression. The recent pivotal phase 3 trial of MP in relapsed/refractory HCL demonstrated a durable complete remission rate of 30%, and 85% of complete responders achieved minimal residual disease negativity, which is associated with improved disease-free survival outcomes in HCL. In addition to an exceptional depth of response, MP appears to be less immunosuppressive than purine analogs. MP is generally well tolerated but has unique toxicities, including capillary leak syndrome and hemolytic uremic syndrome, which are poorly understood.

However, the impact of response kinetics on multiple myeloma (MM) seems to be different and remains unexplored. The relationship between response kinetics and outcome were assessed in 626 patients with newly diagnosed MM who were included in a prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial (BDH 2008/02). Patients were assigned to either immunomodulatory drug- or proteasome inhibitor-based therapy. The response depth, time to best response (TBR) and duration of best response (DBR) were collected. Depth of response was associated with superior outcomes, consistent with findings from other studies. However, the early responders (defined as TBR </=3 months) showed significantly worse survival compared with late responders. We found that patients with rapid complete remission experienced inferior survivals comparable to those attaining a gradual partial remission. Moreover, 4 distinct response kinetics patterns were identified. Patients with gradual and sustained remission (""U-valley"" pattern) experienced superior outcomes, whereas poor outcomes were observed in rapid and transient responders (""roller coaster"" pattern) (median overall survival, 126 vs 30 months). The effects of response patterns on survival were confirmed in patients at different stages of disease and cytogenetic risk, including transplant-eligible patients and those attaining different extents of response depth. Collectively, our data indicated that slow and gradual response is a favorable prognostic factor in MM. In addition to response depth, the kinetic pattern of response is a simple and powerful predictor for survival even in the era of novel agents.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['P30 CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC6784522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monitoring the expression of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene and identifying ABL kinase mutations are effective means to predict disease relapse and resistance. However, the prognostic impact of BCR-ABL1 signal patterns detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) remains largely unaddressed. METHODS: BCR-ABL1 signal patterns were analyzed using FISH in 243 CML-chronic phase (CML-CP), 17 CML-blast phase (CML-BP) and 52 BCR-ABL1 positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. RESULTS: The patterns of BCR-ABL1 signals presented complexity and diversity. A total of 12 BCR-ABL1 signals were observed in this cohort, including 1R1G2F, 1R1G1F, 2R1G1F, 1R2G1F, 2R2G1F, 1R2G2F, 1R1G3F, 1G3F, 2G3F, 1G4F, 1R1G4F and 1R4F. Complex BCR-ABL1 signal patterns (>/= two types of signal patterns) were observed in 52.9% (n = 9) of the CML-BP patients, followed by 30.8% (n = 16) of the ALL patients and only 2.1% (n = 5) of the CML-CP patients. More importantly, five clonal evolution patterns related to disease progression and relapse were observed, and patients with complex BCR-ABL1 signal patterns had a poorer overall survival (OS) time compared with those with single patterns (5.0 vs.15.0 months, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that complex BCR-ABL1 signal patterns were associated with leukemic clonal evolution and poorer prognosis in BCR-ABL1 positive leukemia.

CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 52-year-old Cameroonian man with acute kidney injury who presented with confusion, abdominal pain, constipation, polyuria, polydipsia, calciphylaxis, enlarged lymph nodes, tachycardia, and a blood pressure of 170/88 mmHg. Laboratory investigations revealed hypercalcemia (total/ionized 199.5/101.75 mg/L), normal serum phosphorus (40.20 mg/L), and a low intact parathyroid hormone (9.70 pg/ml). Complete blood count revealed pancytopenia. Peripheral blood smear confirmed thrombocytopenia but showed neither blasts nor flower cells. Bone marrow aspirate revealed hypocellularity with no blasts or fibrosis. Lymph node biopsy was suggestive of T-cell precursor lymphoma. T-lymphoblastic lymphoma presenting with hypercalcemic crisis and aplastic anemia was diagnosed, and the patient received the cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone protocol of chemotherapy together with filgrastim and whole-blood transfusion for aplastic anemia.

Epub 2019 Oct 9.,"Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors are at risk for developing neurocognitive late effects following intensive medical treatment. Motor impairments have been highlighted as a common neurocognitive late effect, including fine-, gross-, and visual-motor skills. The severity of these motor deficits is variable in the existing literature, warranting additional investigations with more homogenous samples. In addition, there is an even greater paucity regarding the interrelations between motor deficits and the impact motor challenges may have on other domains of functioning, such as academics. Therefore, the present study aimed to characterize motor functioning in children who were treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with chemotherapy (n = 13) in comparison to healthy controls (n = 13). Additionally, this study investigated the relationship between primary (e.g., visual-spatial, fine-motor), secondary (e.g., visual-motor), and tertiary (e.g., academics) skills. The results revealed that oncology survivors had significantly lower fine- and gross-motor skills compared to healthy controls. No significant differences were observed between the groups on visual-perception and visual-motor tasks. Fine-motor functioning was significantly associated with visual-motor functioning in ALL survivors. Motor skills were not related to academic outcomes. The present findings provide evidence for motor impairments in pediatric ALL survivors, along with initial findings highlighting the cascading effect of primary motor impairments on other cognitive domains.

However, the detailed role of lncRNA GAS5 in B lymphocytic leukaemia is still unclear. A qRT-PCR assay was used to examine the levels of lncRNA GAS5 and miR-222 in leukomonocytes of patients with B lymphocytic leukaemia and in healthy donors. Raji cells were transfected with GAS5 overexpression or shRNA-GAS5 plasmids for 48h, and cell proliferation was assessed by the CCK-8 assay, while apoptosis and cell cycle progression were assessed using flow cytometry. The Transwell assay was applied to detect the invasion of Raji cells with GAS5 overexpression or knockdown. The dual luciferase reporter assay and regression curve were conducted to evaluate the binding interaction between lncRNA GAS5 and miR-222. The results showed that the expression of lncRNA GAS5 was decreased in B lymphocytic leukaemia patients compared with the healthy group, and the levels of lncRNA GAS5 in B lymphocytic leukaemia cell lines were significantly higher than those in the normal B cell line, whereas the levels of miR-222 were increased in B lymphocytic leukaemia patients compared with the healthy group. Moreover, cell culture experiments indicated that lncRNA GAS5 overexpression decreased B lymphocytic leukaemia cell proliferation, promoted B lymphocytic leukaemia cell apoptosis, arrested B lymphocytic leukaemia cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and inhibited B lymphocytic leukaemia cell invasion. Finally, the luciferase reporter assay showed a direct target interaction between lncRNA GAS5 and miR-222. The regression analysis showed a negative correlation between the levels of lncRNA GAS5 and miR-222. Thus, our data suggested that lncRNA GAS5 could effectively sponge miR-222 to modulate human B lymphocytic leukaemia cell tumourigenesis and metastasis. This work advances our understanding of the clinical significance of lncRNA GAS5 from the perspective of lncRNA-miRNA regulation.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['B lymphocytic leukaemia', 'lncRNA GAS5/miR-222 axis', 'tumourigenesis and metastasis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate and evaluate the potential clinical significance of serum EV-miR-10b for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Blood samples were collected from a cohort of 95 de novo AML patients and 80 healthy individuals. Of all AML patients, 51 patients were considered as cytogenetic normal AML (CN-AML). Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure the expression levels of serum EV-miR-10b. RESULTS: The extracellular vesicles we extracted from the serum samples were positive for EV/exosome markers including TSG101, CD63, Flotillin-1 and CD9. The expression levels of serum EV-miR-10b were significantly higher in AML/CN-AML patients than healthy controls. In addition, serum EV-miR-10b expression was strongly correlated with aggressive clinical characteristics. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed serum EV-miR-10b yielded an area under the curve of 0.875, with 77.89% specificity and 82.50% sensitivity in identifying AML patients from normal controls. Furthermore, AML patients with higher serum EV-miR-10b expression had significantly shorter survival and serum EV-miR-10b was demonstrated to be an independent prognostic marker for overall survival in AML. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, serum EV-miR-10b might serve as a promising biomarker for predicting the prognosis of AML.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'extracellular vesicle', 'miR-10b', 'prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Clinical characteristics and outcomes of 84 newly diagnosed T-ALL children (63 males and 21 females) treated with CCLG-ALL 2008 protocol from April 2008 to April 2015 in the Department of Pediatric Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences were analyzed retrospectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS), and COX regression was used to evaluate the influencing factors of OS and EFS. Results: (1) Baseline data: 84 children were included, 56 cases (67%) of children were younger than 10 years old. Patients whose white blood cell count>/=50x10(9)/L ranked 70% (59/84). Karyotype: 58% (49/84) with normal karyotype, 10% (8/84) with abnormality of chromosome 11, 8%(7/84) with abnormality of chromosome 9, 2%(2/84) with abnormality in both chromosome 11 and chromosome 9, 8% (7/84) with other complex karyotypes. Fusion gene: 33%(28/84) were SIL-TAL1 positive. The patients were grouped by CCLG-ALL 2008 risk score, 40% (34/84) were in the intermediate risk group and 60% (50/84) in the high risk group. (2) Treatment efficacy: 84 cases were followed up until May 30, 2018. The follow-up time was 42.0 (0.3-120.0) months. The sensitivity rate of prednisone treatment was 56% (47/84); the complete response (CR) rate after the induction therapy of vincristine+daunoblastina+L-asparaginase+dexamethasone (VDLD)(d 33) was 88% (74/84); the total CR rate after VDLD induction combined with cyclophosphamide+cytarabine+6-mercaptopurine (CAM) treatment (d80) was 94% (79/84); the recurrence rate was 24% (20/84). Among the 20 recurrent cases, there were 13 cases (65%) with ultra-early recurrence (within 18 months after diagnosis), 6 cases (30%) with early recurrence (18 to 36 months after diagnosis); 1 patient (5%) with late recurrence (over 36 months after diagnosis). During the follow-up period, twenty-eight children (33%) died (22 cases with recurrence or suspending treatment without remission, 2 cases with infection, 1 case of sudden death in chemotherapy, 1 patient failed in transplantation, 1 patient with severe cirrhosis, and 1 patient with unknown cause). (3) Kaplan-Meier analysis: the 5-year OS and EFS of the 84 children were (63+/-6)% and (60+/-6)% respectively. (4) Efficacy in different risk groups: prednisone sensitivity rates in the two different risk groups were 100% (34/34) and 26% (13/50), respectively (chi(2)=3.237, P<0.05). The CR rates at the end of VDLD induction therapy (d 33) were 100% (34/34) and 80% (40/50), respectively (chi(2)=2.767, P<0.05). The recurrence rate of children in the two groups was 12% (4/34) and 32% (16/50), respectively (chi(2)=4.245, P<0.05).The mortality rates of the two groups were 21% (7/34) and 42% (21/50), respectively (chi(2)=3.198, P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 5-year OS of the two groups were (77+/-7)% and (53+/-8)%; and the 5-year EFS of the two groups were (75+/-8)% and (49+/-8)% (chi(2)=4.235, 3.875, both P<0.05) . (5) COX multivariate regression analysis showed that the classification of risk according to CCLG-ALL 2008 was an important factor influencing the prognosis of children with T-ALL (OR=3.313, 95% CI 1.165-9.422, P=0.025).

It is associated with short survival as well as anticancer drug resistance. Autophagy is a protective mechanism that promotes cancer cell growth and survival under stressed conditions including clinical drug treatment. Here evidences are provided that EVI1 induces autophagy and mediated drug resistance in myeloid leukemia cells. Both knockdown using RNAi and pharmacological inhibition of autophagy significantly increase sensitivity to cytotoxic drug treatment in EVI1high cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that EVI1 regulated autophagy by directly binding to autophagy-related gene autophagy related 7 (ATG7) promoter and transcriptionally upregulating its expression. Notably, ATG7 expression was positively correlated with EVI1 in bone marrow mononuclear cells from myeloid leukemia patients. Acute myeloid leukemia patients with high level of EVI1 are associated with unfavorable overall survival, which was aggravated by simultaneous high expression of ATG7 in these patients. Furthermore, ChIP and firefly luciferase reporter assay identified an EVI1-binding site at 227 upstream promoter region of ATG7 which regulated its transcription. In addition, enforced expression of EVI1 also increased intracellular reactive oxygen species and ATG7 mRNA levels as well as autophagy activity, whereas the increase was attenuated after treatment with reactive oxygen species scavenger, suggesting the involvement of reactive oxygen species in EVI1-induced autophagy. These findings demonstrate that EVI protects myeloid leukemia cell from anticancer drug treatment by inducing autophagy through dual control of ATG7. These results might present a new therapeutic approach for improving treatment outcome in myelogenous leukemia with EVI1high.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

New studies as well as updates of other seminal ones have been recently presented and are likely to change the management of patients with CLL in everyday clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Kinase inhibitors (e.g. ibrutinib and idelalisib) have transformed the treatment paradigm in CLL in both front-line and relapsed/refractory patients. Longer follow-up data are now available supporting the safety of ibrutinib and the continuous administration required per current label. Novel studies show the superiority of the drug alone or in combination with monoclonal antibodies compared with standard chemoimmunotherapy. The combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab (treatment-naive, only in United States) or rituximab (relapsed/refractory) has granted approval from the regulatory authorities in United States and Europe, based on phase 3 randomized studies. These novel chemo-free combinations allow for fixed-duration treatment and undetectable minimal residual disease. Novel targeted strategies including second and third generation BTK and PI3K inhibitors are currently under investigation and promise to further improve the CLL treatment armamentarium. The chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are coming to the stage with promising efficacy and new challenges. SUMMARY: A bright chemo-free era for CLL patients is just around the corner.

Epub 2019 Oct 8.,"BACKGROUND: In elderly patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) responsive to imatinib, the incidence of clinically significant (CS) late chronic anemia is still unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To highlight this issue, we revised retrospectively 81 CML patients aged >60 years treated at our Institution with front-line imatinib for at least 24 months in durable complete cytogenetic response (CCyR). CS late chronic anemia was defined as the presence of persistent (>6 months) and otherwise unexplained Hb levels </=10 g/dL, which occurred >6 months from imatinib start. RESULTS: A condition of CS late chronic anemia occurred in 22 out of 81 patients (27.2%) at different intervals from imatinib start. Seven out of 22 patients (31.8%) needed packed red cell transfusions during the follow-up. At diagnosis, patients who developed CS late chronic anemia were significantly older and had a lower Hb median level. Six out of 22 patients with CS late chronic anemia received subcutaneous recombinant alpha-erythropoietin (EPO) at the standard dosage of 40,000 IU weekly: all 6 patients achieved an erythroid response. A significantly worse event-free survival (EFS) in patients with untreated CS late chronic anemia was observed (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: CS late chronic anemia during long-term treatment with imatinib is a common complication in responsive elderly patients, with worse EFS if untreated. Results with EPO are encouraging, but larger studies are warranted to define its role.","['(c) 2019 S.

Epub 2019 Sep 25.,"The prognosis for many patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poor, mainly due to disease relapse driven by leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Recent studies have highlighted the unique metabolic properties of LSCs, which might represent opportunities for LSC-selective targeting. LSCs characteristically have low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which apparently result from a combination of low mitochondrial activity and high activity of ROS-removing pathways such as autophagy. Due to this low activity, LSCs are highly dependent on mitochondrial regulatory mechanisms. These include the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2, which also has crucial roles in regulating the mitochondrial membrane potential, and proteins involved in mitophagy. Here we review the different pathways that impact mitochondrial activity and redox-regulation, and highlight their relevance for the functionality of both HSCs and LSCs. Additionally, novel AML therapy strategies that are based on interference with those pathways, including the promising BCL-2 inhibitor Venetoclax, are summarized.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Oct 5.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive disease associated with very poor prognosis. Most patients are older than 60 years, and in this group only 5-15% of cases survive over 5 years. Therefore, it is urgent to develop more effective targeted therapies. Inactivation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a recurrent event in AML, and overexpression of its endogenous inhibitor SET is detected in ~30% of patients. The PP2A activating drug FTY720 has potent anti-leukemic effects; nevertheless, FTY720 induces cardiotoxicity at the anti-neoplastic dose. Here, we have developed a series of non-phosphorylable FTY720 analogues as a new therapeutic strategy for AML. Our results show that the lead compound CM-1231 re-activates PP2A by targeting SET-PP2A interaction, inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary patient samples. Notably, CM-1231 did not induce cardiac toxicity, unlike FTY720, in zebrafish models, and reduced the invasion and aggressiveness of AML cells more than FTY720 in zebrafish xenograft models. In conclusion, CM-1231 is safer and more effective than FTY720; therefore, this compound could represent a novel and promising approach for treating AML patients with SET overexpression.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

of multiple myeloma (MM) patients are independently associated with longer survival. Although the tumor suppressor function of intracellular miR-16 in MM plasma cells (PCs) has been elucidated, its extracellular role in maintaining a nonsupportive cancer microenvironment has not been fully explored. Here, we show that miR-16 is abundantly released by MM cells through extracellular vesicles (EVs) and that differences in its intracellular expression as associated with chromosome 13 deletion (Del13) are correlated to extracellular miR-16 levels. We also demonstrate that EVs isolated from MM patients and from the conditioned media of MM-PCs carrying Del13 more strongly differentiate circulating monocytes to M2-tumor supportive macrophages (TAMs), compared with MM-PCs without this chromosomal aberration. Mechanistically, our data show that miR-16 directly targets the IKKalpha/beta complex of the NF-kappaB canonical pathway, which is critical not only in supporting MM cell growth, but also in polarizing macrophages toward an M2 phenotype. By using a miR-15a-16-1-KO mouse model, we found that loss of the miR-16 cluster supports polarization to M2 macrophages. Finally, we demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of miR-16 overexpression in potentiating the anti-MM activity by a proteasome inhibitor in the presence of MM-resident bone marrow TAM.",,"['R01 CA194742/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA186781/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA190045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA234181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow', '*Cancer', '*Hematology', '*Macrophages', '*Oncology']",PMC6948777,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01408225'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 8.,"There is an agreement in the field that interlaboratory reproducibility of flow cytometry measurements as well as the whole studies might be improved by a consensual use of methodological approach. Typically, a consensus is made on a crucial markers needed in the immunostaining panel, sometimes on the particular fluorochrome conjugates and rarely on a complete set of methods for sample preparation. The term ""standardization"" is used to describe the complete set of methodical steps, while ""harmonization"" is used for partial agreement on the method. Standardization can provide a platform for improved reproducibility of cytometry results over prolonged periods of time, across different sites and across different instruments. For the purpose of structured discussion, several desired aims are described: common interpretation of the immunophenotype definition of a target subset, accurate quantification, reproducible pattern of a multicolor immunophenotype, and reproducible intensity of all measured parameters. An overview of how standardization was approached by several large consortia is provided: EuroFlow, The ONE Study, Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC), and several other groups. Their particular aims and the tools adopted to reach those aims are noted. How those standardization efforts were adopted in the field and how the resulting outcome was evaluated is reviewed. Multiple challenges in the instrument hardware design, instrument setup tools, reagent design, and quality features need to be addressed to achieve optimal standardization. Furthermore, the aims of different studies vary, and thus, the reasonable requirements for standardization differ. A framework of reference for the reasonable outcomes of different approaches is offered. Finally, it is argued that complete standardization is important not only for the reproducibility of measurements but also for education, for quality assessment and for algorithmic data analysis.

Epub 2019 Oct 8.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with blood cancers experience high-intensity medical care near the end of life (EOL) and low rates of hospice use; attributes of goals of care (GOC) discussions may partly explain these outcomes. METHODS: By using a retrospective cohort of patients with blood cancer who received care at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and died in 2014, the authors assessed the potential relationship between timing, location, and the involvement of hematologic oncologists in the first GOC discussion with intensity of care near the EOL and timely hospice use. RESULTS: Among 383 patients, 39.2% had leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes, 37.1% had lymphoma, and 23.7% had myeloma. Overall, 65.3% of patients had a documented GOC discussion. Of the first discussions, 33.2% occurred >30 days before death, 34.8% occurred in the outpatient setting, and 46.4% included a hematologic oncologist. In multivariable analyses, having the first discussion >30 days before death (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.17-0.81), in the outpatient setting (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09-0.50), and having a hematologic oncologist present (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.77) were associated with lower odds of intensive care unit admission </=30 days before death. The presence of a hematologic oncologist at the first discussion (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.58-5.96) also was associated with earlier hospice use (>3 days before death). CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of blood cancer decedents, most initial GOC discussions occurred close to death and in the inpatient setting. When discussions were timely, outpatient, or involved hematologic oncologists, patients were less likely to experience intensive health care use near death and were more likely to enroll in hospice.",['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],['K08 CA218295/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NOTNLM'],"['*blood cancers', '*end-of-life care', '*goals of care discussions', '*hematologic oncologists']",PMC6980246,,['NIHMS1050857'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A pathogenetic link with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) has been suggested, due to cases with hybrid morphology as well as overlapping genetic signature. However, a small subset of SEF is negative for MUC4 and lacks the canonical EWSR1/FUS gene rearrangements. Triggered by the identification of recurrent YAP1-KMT2A gene fusions by RNA sequencing in 3 index cases of MUC4-negative, EWSR1/FUS fusion-negative SEF, we further investigated a cohort of 14 similar SEF cases (MUC4-negative, EWSR1/FUS fusion-negative) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and/or DNA-based massively parallel sequencing (MSK-IMPACT) for abnormalities in these genes. Three additional SEFs with KMT2A gene rearrangements and one additional case with YAP1 gene rearrangements were identified by FISH. In addition, one case with YAP1-KMT2A and one with KMT2A-YAP1 fusion were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and MSK-IMPACT, respectively. As a control group, 24 fibromyxoid spindle cell tumors, diagnosed or suspected as fusion-negative LGFMS, were also tested for YAP1 and KMT2A abnormalities by FISH, but none were positive. The YAP1/KMT2A-rearranged SEF group affected patients ranging from 10 to 86 years old (average and median: 45) of both sexes (4 females, 5 males). The tumors involved somatic soft tissues with a wide distribution, including extremities, trunk, neck, and dura. Histologically, the tumors showed variable cellularity, with monotonous ovoid to epithelioid tumor cells and hyalinized collagenous background typical of SEF. More than half of the cases showed infiltrative borders, within fat or skeletal muscle. No LGFMS component was identified.

We investigated the role of PTHrP and MIP-1alpha in the development of local osteolytic lesions in T-cell leukemia through overexpression in Jurkat T-cells. Injections of Jurkat-PTHrP and Jurkat-MIP-1alpha into the tibia and the left ventricle of NSG mice were performed to evaluate tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Jurkat-pcDNA tibial neoplasms grew at a significantly greater rate and total tibial tumor burden was significantly greater than Jurkat-PTHrP neoplasms. Despite the lower tibial tumor burden, Jurkat-PTHrP bone neoplasms had significantly greater osteolysis than Jurkat-pcDNA and Jurkat-MIP-1alpha neoplasms. Jurkat-PTHrP and Jurkat-pcDNA cells preferentially metastasized to bone following intracardiac injection, though the overall metastatic burden was lower in Jurkat-PTHrP mice.

Epub 2019 Sep 1.,"Enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) is known as bovine lymphosarcoma and normally affects the old cattle. EBL is caused by bovine leukemia virus (BLV), which is generally spread all around the world. This virus is transmitted via bovine blood products within and between cattle herds. Glycoprotein GP51 in the blood is responsible for cattle immune responses to BLV. This virus has been previously detected in cattle and even in the calf. However, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first short communication reporting the detection of EBL in calves in Iran. The samples of the present study were obtained from two calves of different mothers within the same dairy farm of 2000 cattle, located near Tehran, Iran. General clinical signs of the two calves, such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature were recorded. The clinical observations were confirmed by hematological tests, histopathological examination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, polymerase chain reaction, and phylogenetic analyses. The originality of the detected virus was assessed by blasting against the other strains of BLV available on the NCBI web page. Regarding the clinical symptoms, bulging eyes were noticeable. Moreover, atypical and malignant lymphocytes were detected in the circulatory system and periorbital tissue. It should be noted that the presence and expression of GP51 in both calves and cattle was similar to the previously detected ones in Korea and Japan. The latter result confirms the originality of retrovirus structural subunit GP51. Similar observations were reported in a six-month follow-up.","['Copyright (c) 2019, Archives of Razi Institute.

The essence of the proposed idea is that these hybrid molecules are able to cleave DNA owing to the fullerene moiety they contain and to simultaneously thermally affect tumor cells via cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond in quadricyclanes under the action of Pd and Pt ions. As a result, testing of the cytotoxic activity in vitro for a number of fullerene C60 hybrids with the norbornadiene or quadricyclane moieties against the human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Jurkat cells) in combination of the known cisplatin drug, which was taken as the source of Pt ions, showed a statistically reliable dose-dependent increase in the number of dead cells in each group, which were formed according to the amount of cisplatin added, in comparison with the control, that is, cells treated with cisplatin or quadricyclane fullerene derivatives alone. Indeed, the difference between the percentages of viable cells after treatment with either cisplatin alone or cisplatin in combination with methanofullerene 5 ranged from approximately 10% (for Pt (0.015 mkM), 5 (0.015 mkM)) to approximately 55% (for Pt (0.03 mkM), 5 (0.045 mkM)).",['Copyright (c) 2019 American Chemical Society.'],,,,PMC6776965,['The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) results in the terminal differentiation of neutrophil granulocytes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we identify and elucidate a novel differentiation-suppressive model of APL involving the histone demethylase KDM3B, which has been identified as a suppressor of the tumor genes involved in hematopoietic malignancies. Methods: First, we established a KDM3B knockdown NB4 cell model to determine the functional characteristics of KDM3B by cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry. Then, we performed ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq to search for potential relationships among KDM3B, histone modification (H3K9me1/me2) and the chromatin state. Finally, molecular biological techniques and a multi-omics analysis were used to explore the role of KDM3B in differentiation of the leukemia cells after ATRA treatment. Results: We found that knocking down KDM3B contributed to the growth of NB4 APL cells via the promotion of cell-cycle progression and blocked granulocytic differentiation. Through global and molecular approaches, we provided futher evidence that knocking down KDM3B altered the global distribution of H3K9me1/me2 and increased the chromatin accessibility. Moreover, knocking down KDM3B inhibited the ATRA-induced degradation of the PML/RARalpha oncoprotein. Conclusion: Our study suggested that KDM3B was able to inhibit APL progression by maintaining chromatin in a compact state and facilitating the ATRA-mediated degradation of PML/RARalpha. Taken together, the results show that KDM3B may be an alternative target for the treatment regimens and the targeted therapy for APL by sustaining the function of PML/RARalpha fusion protein.",['(c) The Author(s) 2019.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'Chromatin accessibility', 'Differentiation', 'H3K9me1/me2', 'KDM3B', 'PML/RARalpha']",PMC6778369,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pathway always dysregulates in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PTEN and P53 are tumor suppressor genes correlated with PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and both have a tight link in regulation of cell proliferation and cell death. In this study, we investigated the effects of dual targeting of PI3K/Akt pathway by combined inhibition with nvp-BKM-120 (PI3K inhibitor) and MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor) in relation with PTEN and P53 on apoptosis and proliferation of leukemia cells. Methods: Both T and B ALL cell lines were treated with both inhibitors alone or in combination with each other, and induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation were evaluated by flow cytometry. Expression levels of PTEN as well as p53 mRNA and protein were measured by real-time qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Results: We indicated that both inhibitors (BKM-120 and MK-2206) decreased cell viability and increased cytotoxicity in leukemia cells. Reduction in Akt phosphorylation increased PTEN and p53 mRNA and p53 protein level (in PTEN positive versus PTEN negative cell lines). Additionally, both inhibitors, particularly in combination with each other, increased apoptosis (evaluated with Annexin V and caspase 3) and reduced proliferation (Ki67 expression) in leukemia cells. However, administration of IL7 downregulated PTEN and P53 mRNA expression and rescued cancer cells following inhibition of BKM-120 and MK-2206.

Most data in paediatric solid tumours are isolated case reports, while there is sparse data in paediatric acute leukaemia. OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to analyze the incidence of DIC in our population of paediatric solid tumours. DESIGN: All records of children <15 years of age registered in the Paediatric Oncology department of our institute with a diagnosis of solid tumour malignancy were retrospectively reviewed for evidence of DIC. RESULTS: Out of the 73 children, 4 have developed DIC, an incidence of 5.5%. The mean age of children who developed DIC was 4.6 years (Range- 2months -15 years) and the majority (2/4- 50%) children were less than 1 year of age. Children with DIC had a male predominance (75%) and the majority (75%) presented in advanced stages of the disease. Of the 10 children with neuroblastoma, 2 (20%) had evidence of DIC. Statistical analysis was done to determine whether any patient characteristic had the propensity to develop DIC. The only factor that attained statistical significance was younger age. CONCLUSION: Disseminated intravascular coagulation though uncommon in children should always be thought of in a child with advanced disease presenting with thrombocytopenia or clinical manifestations of bleeding tendency. An index of suspicion is important for early diagnosis and emergent treatment which eventually improves survival.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Consumption coagulopathy Paediatric solid tumours.', 'DIC']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are characterized by the identification of hairy cells, a specific genetic profile, a different clinical course and the need for appropriate treatment. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of HCL is based on morphological evidence of hairy cells, an HCL immunologic score of three or four based on the CD11C, CD103, CD123, and CD25 expression. Also, the trephine biopsy which makes it possible to specify the degree of tumoral medullary infiltration and the presence of BRAF V600E somatic mutation. RISK STRATIFICATION: Progression of patients with HCL is based on a large splenomegaly, leukocytosis, a high number of hairy cells in the peripheral blood and the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene mutational status. The VH4-34 positive HCL cases are associated with poor prognosis. TREATMENT: Risk adapted therapy with purine nucleoside analogs (PNA) are indicated in symptomatic first line HCL patients. The use of PNA followed by rituximab represents an alternative option. Management of progressive or refractory disease is based on the use of BRAF inhibitors associated or not with MEK inhibitors, recombinant immunoconjugates targeting CD22 or BCR inhibitors.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 7.,"Recent attempts have focused on identifying fewer magnitude of minimal residual disease (MRD) rather than exploring the biological and genetic features of the residual plasma cells (PCs). Here, a cohort of 193 patients with at least one cytogenetic abnormalities (CA) at diagnosis were analyzed, and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) analyses were performed in patient-paired diagnostic and posttherapy samples. Persistent CA in residual PCs were observed for the majority of patients (63%), even detectable in 28/63 (44%) patients with MRD negativity (<10(-4)). The absence of CA in residual PCs was associated with prolonged survival regardless of MRD status. According to the change of the clonal size of specific CA, patients were clustered into five groups, reflecting different patterns of clone selection under therapy pressure. Therapy-induced clonal selection exerted a significant impact on survival (HR = 4.0; P < 0.001). According to the longitudinal cytogenetic studies at relapse, sequential cytogenetic dynamics were observed in most patients, and cytogenetic architecture of residual PCs could to some extent predict the evolutional pattern at relapse. Collectively, the repeat cytogenetic evaluation in residual PCs could not only serves as a good complementary tool for MRD detection, but also provides a better understanding of clinical response and clonal evolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 7.,"Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The diagnosis of WM is established by the presence of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in the bone marrow or other organs, a monoclonal IgM paraproteinemia and the recurrent MYD88 L265P somatic mutation. Some patients with WM can be asymptomatic, in which case treatment is not indicated. However, most patients with WM will become symptomatic during the course of the disease, due to anemia, hyperviscosity, neuropathy, or other processes, necessitating therapy. Current treatment options for symptomatic WM patients include alkylating agents, proteasome inhibitors and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. The approval of the oral Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib alone and in combination with rituximab has expanded the treatment options for WM patients. The present Perspective would focus on exciting treatment strategies under development for WM patients, such as proteasome inhibitors (e.g., ixazomib), BTK inhibitors (e.g., acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, vecabrutinib), BCL2 inhibitors (e.g., venetoclax), and anti-CXCR4 antibodies (e.g., ulocuplumab), among others. It is certainly an exciting time for WM therapy development with novel and promising treatment options in the horizon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, small molecule inhibitors targeting menin-MLL fusion protein interaction have been emerging for the treatment of MLL-rearranged AML. As both inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and menin-MLL interaction target the transcription-regulatory machinery involving epigenetic regulation of chromatin remodeling that governs the expression of genes involved in tumorigenesis, we hypothesized that these two classes of agents might interact to kill MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) AML cells. Here, we report that the combination treatment with subtoxic doses of the HDAC inhibitor chidamide and the menin-MLL interaction inhibitor MI-3 displayed a highly synergistic anti-tumor activity against human MLL-r AML cells in vitro and in vivo, but not those without this genetic aberration. Mechanistically, co-exposure to chidamide and MI-3 led to robust apoptosis in MLL-r AML cells, in association with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and a sharp increase in ROS generation. Combined treatment also disrupted DNA damage checkpoint at the level of CHK1 and CHK2 kinases, rather than their upstream kinases (ATR and ATM), as well as DNA repair likely via homologous recombination (HR), but not non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Genome-wide RNAseq revealed gene expression alterations involving several potential signaling pathways (e.g., cell cycle, DNA repair, MAPK, NF-kappaB) that might account for or contribute to the mechanisms of action underlying anti-leukemia activity of chidamide and MI-3 as a single agent and particularly in combination in MLL-r AML. Collectively, these findings provide a preclinical basis for further clinical investigation of this novel targeted strategy combining HDAC and Menin-MLL interaction inhibitors to improve therapeutic outcomes in a subset of patients with poor-prognostic MLL-r leukemia.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*DNA damage response', '*HDAC inhibitor', '*MLL-rearrangement', '*Menin-MLL interaction inhibitor']",PMC6781368,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising alternative for the treatment of malignant tumors. KillerRed is a genetically encoded red fluorescent protein photosensitizer (PS). In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of KillerRed-mediated PDT on chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells, acute monocytic leukemia NB4 cells, and acute monocytic leukemia THP1 cells. METHODS: KillerRed was expressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified by Q-Sepharose column, and confirmed by western-blotting. The PDT effect on cell proliferation was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Cell apoptosis was determined by PE Annexin V/7-AAD staining and flow cytometry. The distribution of KillerRed in leukemia cells was detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and western-blotting. The ROS generation was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Pure KillerRed was obtained with a yield of about 37 mg per liter of bacterial cells. KillerRed photodynamic inactivated the leukemia cells in a concentration-dependent manner, but exhibited no obvious dark toxicity. PDT mediated by KillerRed could also induce apoptotic response (mainly early apoptosis) in the three cell lines. The CLSM imaging indicated that KillerRed was distributed within the cytoplasm and nuclei of leukemia cells, causing damages to the cytoplasm and leaving the nuclear envelope intact during light irradiation. KillerRed distributed both in the cytosol and nuclei was confirmed by western blotting, and ROS significantly increased in PDT treated cells compared to the cells treated with KillerRed alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrated that KillerRed-mediated PDT could effectively inactivate K562, NB4, and THP1 leukemia cells and trigger cell apoptosis, and it has potential to be used individually or complementally, in the treatment of leukemia.",,"['81401710/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81670157/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2016JZ030/Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province (CN)']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cell proliferation', 'KillerRed', 'Leukemia', 'Photodynamic therapy']",PMC6781363,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 7.,"In Europe, especially in German-speaking countries, administration of mistletoe extracts is the most common and popular complementary and alternative therapy approach reported in oncology. Mistletoe therapy is applied to children with cancer for curative and palliative therapeutic regimes with increasing frequency, but at the same time, there are only a few studies on the effectiveness of this therapy. Therefore, we have investigated the response of various pediatric cell lines (acute myeloid leukemia, Ewing's sarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, and osteosarcoma) to mistletoe extract, abnobaVISCUM Fraxini. Effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution as well as on mitochondrial integrity and caspase-mediated apoptosis were investigated in neuroblastoma cell lines, SH-SY5Y and Kelly. Additionally, in vitro tumor cell migration and invasion were studied. In vivo effects of the mistletoe extract were investigated in a syngeneic neuroblastoma mouse model. We could show that tumor cell lines were from 5- to 640-fold more sensitive to abnobaVISCUM Fraxini treatment than non-tumorigenic fibroblasts, whereby neuroblastoma cell lines were the most sensitive. For two neuroblastoma cell lines, SH-SY5Y and Kelly, induction of caspase-9-mediated apoptosis, a decrease of mitochondrial integrity as well as attenuation of migration and invasion were observed. In vivo experiments revealed a reduction of tumor growth and a prolonged survival of tumor-bearing animals. In summary, we can state that these results provide the first preclinical data for cytotoxic activities of abnobaVISCUM Fraxini for a broad panel of pediatric tumor cell lines, in particular, neuroblastoma cells. Thus, it might be a potential remedy for the supportive treatment of neuroblastoma.",['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Most patients with CML achieve long-term survival similar to individuals without CML due to treatment with TKIs not only in frontline but also in further lines of therapy. The third-generation TKI ponatinib has demonstrated efficacy in patients with refractory CML and Ph+ ALL. Ponatinib is currently the most potent TKI in this setting demonstrating activity against T315I mutant clones. However, ponatinib's safety data revealed a dose-dependent, increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) events. Guidance is needed to evaluate the benefit-risk profile of TKIs, such as ponatinib, and safety measures to prevent treatment-associated CV events. An expert panel of German hematologists and cardiologists summarize current evidence regarding ponatinib's efficacy and CV safety profile.

However, few studies have evaluated changes in the treatment landscape of CML over time. This study assessed the long-term treatment patterns of oral anticancer therapies among patients with CML. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients newly diagnosed with CML between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2016, from 10 integrated healthcare systems. The proportion of patients treated with 5 FDA-approved oral TKI agents-bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib-in the 12 months after diagnosis were measured, overall and by year, between 2000 and 2017. We assessed the use of each oral agent through the fourth-line setting. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the odds of receiving any oral agent, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Among 853 patients with CML, 81% received an oral agent between 2000 and 2017. Use of non-oral therapies decreased from 100% in 2000 to 5% in 2005, coinciding with imatinib uptake from 65% in 2001 to 98% in 2005. Approximately 28% of patients switched to a second-line agent, 9% switched to a third-line agent, and 2% switched to a fourth-line agent. Adjusted analysis showed that age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, and comorbidity burden were statistically significantly associated with odds of receiving an oral agent. CONCLUSIONS: A dramatic shift was seen in CML treatments away from traditional, nonoral chemotherapy toward use of novel oral TKIs between 2000 and 2017. As the costs of oral anticancer agents reach new highs, studies assessing the long-term health and financial outcomes among patients with CML are warranted.",,['U24 CA171524/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC7145440,,['NIHMS1577578'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Triggered by a case of malignant transformation in SC (synovial chondrosarcoma) showing a novel KMT2A-BCOR gene fusion by targeted RNA sequencing, we sought to evaluate the molecular abnormalities in a cohort of 27 SC cases using a combined methodology of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or targeted RNA sequencing. Results showed that FN1 and /or ACVR2A gene rearrangements were noted in 18 cases (67%), with an FN1-ACVR2A fusion being confirmed in 15 (56%) cases. Two cases showed only FN1 gene rearrangement, without other abnormalities. A novel FN1-NFATc2 gene fusion was noted in one case by RNA sequencing. The remaining nine cases showed no abnormalities in FN1 and ACVR2A genes. No additional cases showed BCOR gene alterations. In conclusion, this study confirms that FN1-ACVR2A fusion is the leading pathogenetic event in SC, at even higher frequency than previously reported. FISH methodology emerges as an appropriate tool in the identification of FN1 and ACVR2A gene abnormalities, which can be used in challenging cases. Further studies are needed to determine the recurrent potential of BCOR abnormalities in this disease.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['P30-CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA217694/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140146-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['* ACVR2A', '* FN1', '*BCOR', '*KMT2A', '*synovial chondromatosis']",PMC7147082,,['NIHMS1564831'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone-marrow infiltration pattern, beta2-microglobulin (beta 2-M), cluster of differentiation (CD)38, and ZAP-70 status were recorded. CLLU1 levels were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and expressed as folds. The relationship between CLLU1 and other known prognostic parameters was evaluated. RESULTS: CLLU1 expression was positive in 81 patients and negative in 3 patients. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) CLLU1 level was 6.45 folds (3.75-16.57 folds) in patients with beta 2-M normal values and 16.22 folds (3.91-62.00 folds) in patients with increased beta 2-M (P = .15). Patients with a higher CD38 value than the median level had 3 times higher CLLU1 levels than the other group (P = .07). The median (IQR) CLLU1 level was 4.25 folds (2.75-13.71 folds) in patients with CLL who tested negative on ZAP-70, whereas it was 49.52 folds (15.06-446.36 folds) in those who tested positive via ZAP-70 (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: CLLU1 is a specific parameter to CLL, and its level corresponds well with the ZAP-70 level.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology 2019. All rights reserved.

It is most commonly applied to patients with myeloid malignancies who are not suitable candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. This review highlights the past 2 years of work on stem/progenitor cell products in the field of nonengrafting donor leukocyte infusion (NE-DLI), with a focus on applications of MST in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RECENT FINDINGS: Assessing the utility of MST is hampered by lack of randomized controlled trials and by variability in donor selection algorithms, treatment timing, and unknown factors. The inherent complexity of the bidirectional alloreactive reactions, implicating many cell types, makes it challenging to move beyond correlative, population-level biology toward mechanistic explanations for MST's actions in any given patient-donor pair. Yet there are indicators that by stimulating a recipient-vs.-tumor effect, MST might substantially improve complete remission rates in AML and that it might find a role in postremission therapy. SUMMARY: The mechanistic underpinnings of MST are gradually being disentangled and its clinical development remains in early stages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 15.,"Introduction: Hypereosinophilic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of disorders that may be associated with life-threatening organ injury as a result of tissues infiltration by eosinophils. The main goal of therapy is to mitigate eosinophil-mediated organ damage. When possible, therapy should be directed at the underlying etiology. However, even in the absence of any known cause, when organ damage is present, hypereosinophilia must be treated promptly and aggressively to reduce potential morbidity and mortality.Areas covered: Conventional therapies, including corticosteroids, hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and interferon-alpha, have shown variable efficacy and a non-negligible toxicity emphasizing the need of new therapeutic strategies based on drugs with different mechanisms of action.Expert opinion: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have a central role among targeted therapies of hypereosinophilic syndromes. Imatinib, initially empirically used based on its activity in chronic myeloid leukemia, achieved preliminary excellent results further confirmed in large series of patients. Third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as ponatinib, while active in vitro and in vivo in animals, still deserve confirmation in properly designed clinical trials. In addition, clinical investigation on monoclonal antibodies against interleukin-5, interleukin-5Ralpha, IgE, and CD52 represents a promising area of research.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*FGFR1', '*Hypereosinophilic syndromes', '*PDGFRA', '*PDGFRB', '*alemtuzumab', '*benralizumab', '*chronic eosinophilic leukemia', '*imatinib', '*mepolizumab', '*not otherwise specified']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, rearrangements of three out of four TCR and all BCR loci are used for this purpose. The fourth TCR gene, TRA, has not been used so far due to the lack of a method for its rearrangement detection in genomic DNA. Here we propose the first high-throughput sequencing based method for the identification of clonal TRA gene rearrangements at the DNA level. The method is based on target amplification of the rearranged TRA locus using an advanced multiplex polymerase chain reaction system and high-throughput sequencing, and has been tested on DNA samples from peripheral blood of healthy donors. Combinations of all functional V- and J-segments were detected, indicating the high sensitivity of the method. Additionally, we identified clonal TRA rearrangements in 57 out of 112 tested DNA samples of patients with various T-lineage lymphoproliferative disorders. The method fills the existing gap in utilizing the TRA gene for a wide range of studies, including clonality assessment, MRD monitoring and clonal evolution analysis in different lymphoid malignancies.",['(c) 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['17-75-10113/Russian Science Foundation/International', '18-29-09132/Russian Foundation for Basic Research/International', '18-315-20038/Russian Foundation for Basic Research/International', 'FNBr 65269705/Ministerstvo Zdravotnictvi Ceske Republiky/International']",['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell receptor alpha chain', '*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*clonal rearrangements', '*high-throughput sequencing', '*lymphoproliferative disorders']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, trophoblast cell response to LIF may vary depending on the cell model. Reported differences in the miRNA profile of trophoblastic cells may be responsible for these observations. Therefore, miRNA expression was investigated in four trophoblastic cell lines under LIF stimulation followed by in silico analysis of altered miRNAs and their associated pathways. METHODS: Low density TaqMan miRNA assays were used to quantify levels of 762 mature miRNAs under LIF stimulation in three choriocarcinoma-derived (JEG-3, ACH-3P and AC1-M59) and a trophoblast immortalized (HTR-8/SVneo) cell lines. Expression of selected miRNAs was confirmed in primary trophoblast cells and cell lines by qPCR. Targets and associated pathways of the differentially expressed miRNAs were inferred from the miRTarBase followed by a KEGG Pathway Enrichment Analysis. HTR-8/SVneo and JEG-3cells were transfected with miR-21-mimics and expression of miR-21 targets was assessed by qPCR. RESULTS: A similar number of miRNAs changed in each tested cell line upon LIF stimulation, however, low coincidence of individual miRNA species was observed and occurred more often among choriocarcinoma-derived cells (complete data set at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ under GEO accession number GSE130489). Altered miRNAs were categorized into pathways involved in human diseases, cellular processes and signal transduction. Six cascades were identified as significantly enriched, including JAK/STAT and TGFB-SMAD. Upregulation of miR-21-3p was validated in all cell lines and primary cells and STAT3 was confirmed as its target. DISCUSSION: Dissimilar miRNA responses may be involved in differences of LIF effects on trophoblastic cell lines.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 Oct 2.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with haematological malignancies have higher risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (BSI). Neutropenia resulting from cytotoxic chemotherapy is the most common risk factor. Infections can progress rapidly with poor outcomes. Understanding the epidemiology may enable prevention and effective management. We investigated and compared the incidence of BSI amongst patients with haematological malignancies and neutropenia and examined the changing spectrum of organisms, and their antimicrobial profiles. METHODS: BSI data between July 1st 2009 and June 30th 2015 was reviewed. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty five BSI were identified in 255 neutropenic patients. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) accounted for 40%, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for 22% and Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) for 11.8%. A neutrophil count of <500 cells/muL was present in 93.2%. The overall incidence was 5.40 BSI per 1000 Haematology Occupied Bed days (OBD). Viridans streptococci and Enterococcus species were the most predominant Gram-positives. Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) emerged as the predominant Enterococcus species during the study period. Escherichia coli was the most predominant Gram-negative and Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) were detected in 7.1% of isolates. Amongst the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa dual resistance to Piperacillin-tazobactam and Gentamicin was detected in 5.4%. CONCLUSION: Our incidence of BSI was 5.40 per 1000 OBD, however variability in reporting of rates in neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies makes comparison between studies difficult, highlighting the need for rate reporting standardization. The epidemiology of organisms causing BSI has changed over time.

Dasatinib, a representative of those drugs, acts by inhibiting key proteins included in CML development, predominantly Bcr-Abl and Src. Its advantage is that it shows activity in many cases where other agents bring no improvement due to resistance. Pharmacokinetics of dasatinib has specific characteristics that may play an important role in achieving sufficient exposure in patients. Therefore, the key pharmacokinetic properties are summarized in this report. For example, dasatinib absorption is significantly influenced by gastric pH and its modulation can be a source of serious interactions, as well as simultaneous administration of drugs affecting cytochrome P450.",,['SVV 260373/Univerzita Karlova v Praze'],['NOTNLM'],"['Dasatinib', 'Drug interaction', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'pH-dependent absorption']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the mechanisms of repeat expansions were intensively studied for over two decades, the final picture has yet to emerge. It was important, therefore, to develop a mammalian experimental system for studying repeat instability, which would recapitulate repeat instability observed in human pedigrees. Here, we describe a genetically tractable experimental system to study the instability of (CGG)n repeats in cultured mammalian cells (Kononenko et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol 25:669-676, 2018). It is based on a selectable cassette carrying the HyTK gene under the control of the FMR1 promoter with carrier-size (CGG)n repeats in its 5' UTR, which was integrated into the unique RL5 site in murine erythroid leukemia cells. Expansions of these repeats and/or repeat-induced mutagenesis shut down the reporter, which results in the accumulation of ganciclovir-resistance cells. This system is useful for understanding the genetic controls of repeat instability in mammalian cells. In the long run, it can be adjusted to screen for drugs that either alleviate repeat expansions or reactivate the FMR1 promoter.",,['R35 GM130322/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Fragile X syndrome', '*Mammalian cell culture', '*RNA interference', '*Repeat expansions', '*Repeat-induced mutagenesis', '*Trinucleotide repeats']",PMC7722238,,['NIHMS1650083'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 4.,"Hematologic complete remission (CR) is achievable for most adults with B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). However, minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with hematologic CR is associated with increased risk of relapse, shorter survival, and poorer transplantation outcomes. This study explored the concept of cure in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) BCP-ALL by MRD status at first hematologic CR (CR1) to inform evaluation of the clinical and economic benefits of new agents, where the concept of cure is important but long-term data are not available. The study used modified Delphi methodology involving clinicians experienced in the treatment of adult ALL. Participants completed a questionnaire, which was followed by country-specific panel discussions to discuss results and identify consensus on concepts and definitions. Clinicians from France (n = 4), Germany (n = 4), and the UK (n = 5) took part. Participants described cure in terms of the probability of future relapse. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was the preferred outcome measure to describe cure for the three patient groups considered (patients with MRD at CR1; patients who become negative for MRD after further treatment; patients who continue to have MRD). Consensus was reached on definitions of cure: that cure would begin to be considered at 3 years' RFS and/or would be highly likely at 5 years' RFS. Participants agreed that patients with MRD should usually undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to have the best chance of survival; consensus was reached that alternatives are required when transplantation is not an option. Panels agreed that patients who achieve cure have a higher mortality rate and lower health-related quality of life than the general population. This study provides quantitative and qualitative information on the concept of cure in Ph- BCP-ALL in CR by MRD status applicable to interpreting the value of new therapies.Funding: Amgen.Plain Language Summary: Plain language summary available for this article.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Consensus', '*Cure', '*Delphi technique', '*Immunotherapy', '*MRD', '*Minimal residual disease', '*Relapse-free survival']",PMC6822800,,,['figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.9816290'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study describes the immunogenicity of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) during and after chemotherapy. METHODS: Children with ALL were allocated to study groups and received a single dose of PCV13: group 1, maintenance chemotherapy; group 2, end of chemotherapy; group 3, 6 months after chemotherapy. A protective vaccine response was defined as at least 10 of 12 serotypes (or >83% of serotypes with data) achieving postvaccination serotype-specific immunoglobulin G >/=0.35 microg/mL and >/=4-fold rise, compared to prevaccination at 1 and 12 months. RESULTS: One hundred eighteen children were recruited. Only 12.8% (5/39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3%-27.4%) of patients vaccinated during maintenance (group 1) achieved a protective response at 1 month postvaccination and none had a protective response at 12 months. For group 2 patients, 59.5% (22/37; 95% CI, 42.1%-75.3%) achieved a response at 1 month and 37.9% (11/29; 95% CI, 20.7%-57.7%) maintained immunity at 12 months. For group 3 patients, 56.8% (21/37; 95% CI, 39.5%-72.9%) achieved a protective response at 1 month and 43.3% (13/30; 95% CI, 25.5%-62.6%) maintained immunity at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the earliest time point at which protective immunity can be achieved in children with ALL is on completion of chemotherapy. This is earlier than current recommendations and may improve protection during a period when children are most susceptible to infection.

Epub 2019 Oct 4.,"Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are found in 6% of AML patients. Mutant IDH produces R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG), which induces histone- and DNA-hypermethylation through the inhibition of epigenetic regulators, thus linking metabolism to tumorigenesis. Here we report the biochemical characterization, in vivo antileukemic effects, structural binding, and molecular mechanism of the inhibitor HMS-101, which inhibits the enzymatic activity of mutant IDH1 (IDH1mut). Treatment of IDH1mut primary AML cells reduced 2-hydroxyglutarate levels (2HG) and induced myeloid differentiation in vitro. Co-crystallization of HMS-101 and mutant IDH1 revealed that HMS-101 binds to the active site of IDH1mut in close proximity to the regulatory segment of the enzyme in contrast to other IDH1 inhibitors. HMS-101 also suppressed 2HG production, induced cellular differentiation and prolonged survival in a syngeneic mutant IDH1 mouse model and a patient-derived human AML xenograft model in vivo. Cells treated with HMS-101 showed a marked upregulation of the differentiation-associated transcription factors CEBPA and PU.1, and a decrease in cell cycle regulator cyclin A2.

Epub 2019 Oct 4.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy with a dismal prognosis in patients with resistant or relapsed disease. Although NOTCH is a known driver in T-ALL, its clinical inhibition has significant limitations. Our previous studies suggested that NRARP, a negative regulator of Notch signaling, could have a suppressive role in T-ALL. Here, we report that NRARP levels are significantly increased in primary T-ALL cells suggesting that NRARP is not sufficient to block NOTCH oncogenic signals. Interestingly, although NRARP overexpression blocks NOTCH1 signaling and delays the proliferation of T-ALL cells that display high levels of Notch1 signaling, it promotes the expansion of T-ALL cells with lower levels of Notch1 activity. We found that NRARP interacts with lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) and potentiates Wnt signaling in T-ALL cells with low levels of Notch. Together these results indicate that NRARP plays a dual role in T-ALL pathogenesis, regulating both Notch and Wnt pathways, with opposite functional effects depending on Notch activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, mice transplanted with T-cells co-expressing NOTCH1 and NRARP develop leukemia later than mice transplanted with T-NOTCH1 cells. Importantly, mice transplanted with T-cells overexpressing NRARP alone developed leukemia with similar kinetics to those transplanted with T-NOTCH1 cells. Our findings uncover a role for NRARP in T-ALL pathogenesis and indicate that Notch inhibition may be detrimental for patients with low levels of Notch signaling, which would likely benefit from the use of Wnt signaling inhibitors. Importantly, our findings may extend to other cancers where Notch and Wnt play a role.",,,,,PMC6989401,,['EMS84445'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, over the last few years, novel agents have produced unprecedented outcomes in treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. With the advent of these targeted agents, treatment options have diversified very considerably and new questions have emerged. For example, it is unclear whether these novel agents should be used as sequential monotherapies until disease progression or whether they should preferably be combined in time-limited treatment regimens aimed at achieving deep and durable remissions. While both approaches yield high response rates and long progression-free and overall survival, it remains challenging to identify patients individually for the optimal concept. This review provides guidance in this decision process by presenting evidence on sequential and combined use of novel agents and discussing the advantages and drawbacks of these two approaches.",['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,PMC6821614,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the estimation of GP models is feasible only for low-dimensional datasets ( approximately 200 variables), which severely limits application of the GP-based ARD method for high-throughput sequencing data. In this paper, we provide a nonparametric prescreening method that preserves virtually all the major benefits of the GP-based ARD method and extends its scalability to the typical high-dimensional datasets used in practice. In several simulated test scenarios, the proposed method compared favorably with existing nonparametric dimension reduction/prescreening methods suitable for higher-order interaction searches. As a real-data example, the proposed method was applied to a high-throughput dataset downloaded from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) with measured expression levels of 16,976 genes (after preprocessing) from patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2019 by the Genetics Society of America.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*Gaussian kernel models', '*Gaussian process regression', '*Haseman-Elston regression', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*higher-order gene-by-gene interactions', '*nonlinear dimension reduction']",PMC6893368,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because MMP-9 (a microenvironment component) plays important roles in solid tumor angiogenesis, we have studied whether MMP-9 influenced the angiogenic pattern in CLL cells. Immunofluorescence analyses confirmed the presence of MMP-9 in CLL tissues. MMP-9 interaction with CLL cells increased their MMP-9 expression and secretion into the medium. Accordingly, the conditioned media of MMP-9-primed CLL cells significantly enhanced endothelial cell proliferation, compared to control cells. MMP-9 also increased VEGF and decreased TSP-1 and Ang-2 expression, all at the gene and protein level, inducing a pro-angiogenic pattern in CLL cells. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that downregulation of the selected gene TSP-1 by MMP-9 involved alpha4beta1 integrin, Src kinase family activity and the STAT3 transcription factor.

In the absence of clinical symptoms, cytopenia or organomegaly, the small clones may correspond to monoclonal B-cell leukemia (MBL) diagnosis. Most MBLs harbor a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) phenotype (e.g., CD5(+), CD23(+)) and are referred to as CLL-type MBL. The two other types are atypical CLL-type MBL and non-CLL-type MBL. In addition to the phenotypical classification, the clonal B count is a major issue because of the impact on the prognosis and the risk of progression in CLL. It allows for the discrimination of two distinct types: high-count (HC) MBL and low-count (LC)-MBL based on a cutoff value of 0.5x10(9)/L clonal B cells. LC MBL appears to be very stable over time and is probably related to immunosenescence. Conversely, HC MBL could be a premalignant state before the occurrence of CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Combining morphology, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic and molecular diagnostics reliably separates B-PLL and T-PLL from one another and other disorders. In T-PLL discovery of frequent mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway have increased understanding of disease pathogenesis. Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) produces excellent response rates but long-term remissions are only achieved in a minority following consolidation with allogeneic stem cell transplant. Molecular abnormalities in B-PLL are less understood. Disruption of TP53 is a key finding, conveying chemotherapy resistance requiring novel therapies such as B-cell receptor inhibitors (BCRi).

Among LGLL, the 2016 WHO classification recognizes two different entities, i.e. T-LGLL and the provisional entity Chronic Lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells (CLPD-NK). In both subtypes neutropenia represents the hallmark of the disease and is frequently regarded as the leading reason to start treatment. Leukemic LGLs are characterized by the up-regulation of several pro-survival signaling pathways, the most relevant being the JAK-STAT axis, whose constitutive activation is partly explained by somatic mutations in STAT3 and STAT5b. In addiction, in the last few years, a relationship between STAT3 mutations/activation and the development of neutropenia was found. Given that backbone treatment relying on immunosuppressive agents is generally unsatisfactory, novel agents targeting the JAK/STAT pathway can represent a turning point in LGLL treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Rare leukemias pose additional challenges in this regard as samples may be hard to acquire and when found the underlying pathway may not be attractive to drug development since so few individuals are affected. In this case, it can be useful to identify common mutational overlap among subsets of rare leukemias to increase the number of individuals that may benefit from a targeted therapy. This chapter examines the current mutational landscape of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia with a focus on STAT3 mutations, the most common mutation in LGL leukemia to date. We examined the linkage between these mutations and autoimmune symptoms and disorders, in cases of obvious and suspected LGL leukemia. We then summarized and compared mutations in a set of other rare leukemias that also have JAK/STAT signaling pathway activation brought about by genomic changes. These include T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), select peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Though STAT3 activation is common in these leukemias, the way in which it is achieved, such as the activating cytokine pathway and/or the co-mutational background, is quite diverse.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This is usually the result of a chromosomal translocation that transposes the Bcl-2 gene into the immunoglobulin gene locus. The immunohistochemical assessment of this overexpression can be used as a tool for the differentiation of follicular lymphoma and follicular hyperplasia. In cats, little information about the expression of Bcl-2 in follicular lymphoma exists. We investigated 18 follicular lymphomas histologically and immunohistochemically for the expression of Bcl-2, CD3, CD45R, and feline leukemia virus. Clonality was assessed by PCR for antigen receptor gene rearrangements. Although the histology resembled that of their human counterparts, diffuse expression of Bcl-2 within the follicles of the feline lymphomas, as seen in human cases, was not present. Only single cells within the follicles, comparable to the reactive controls, were positive for Bcl-2 expression. The mean survival time of 4.6 y confirmed the indolent character of the tumor. None of the clinical parameters assessed were statistically significant predictors of survival. Furthermore, a statistically significant difference in survival of animals with or without anti-neoplastic therapy was also not demonstrable.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2', 'Felis catus', 'cats', 'follicular lymphoma']",PMC6900727,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data were collected between January 1998 and December 2014. One hundred four patients met inclusion criteria, and we report the results of 104 pregnancies-conceived by the participant or partner-while being on imatinib therapy for CML. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were male and 46 were female. Eighty-three patients, 20 patients, and one patient were had CML in the chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase, respectively. Of 46 female patients, 21 underwent abortion (spontaneous, n = 36.9; elective termination, n = 8.6%). In the case of full-term pregnancy in the female partners of male patients with CML, all outcomes were uneventful. Of 46 female patients, 25 had full-term pregnancy outcomes. During the pre-imatinib era (total n = 6), patients were treated with hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha, and therapeutic leukapheresis. A total 10 of 19 pregnant patients continued on imatinib until their delivery and experienced the following outcomes: normal full-term deliveries (n = 7), preterm delivery (n = 1), omphalocele (n = 1), and craniosynostosis (n = 1). Of those who discontinued imatinib after counseling (n = 9), eight patients had full-term normal delivery, of which two patients required leukapheresis and one patient expired. All patients who continued on imatinib while pregnant were in complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response (MMR) before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and postpregnancy. Of nine patients who discontinued imatinib, two lost MMR during the third trimester and all of these patients were in complete cytogenetic response and MMR before pregnancy. CONCLUSION: It is clear that there is no standard of care for the best treatment of CML in the case of pregnancy. Interferon and/or leukapheresis will be included as treatment options. Patients can have normal pregnancies even with the administration of imatinib at the risk of congenital anomalies, intervention for which can be done after birth.",,,,,PMC6825245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further mechanistic studies show that CUDC-101 triggers caspase-dependent degradation of the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion protein. As a result, APL and ATO-resistant APL cells undergo apoptosis upon CUDC-101 treatment and this apoptosis-inducing effect is even stronger than that of ATO. Finally, using a xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated that CUDC-101 significantly represses leukemia development in vivo.

This can enhance clinical efficacy of future and novel therapies and reduces any adverse reactions arising from the latter. This review discusses tumor treatment strategies using regulatory T (Treg) cell therapy in a Tumor Microenvironment (TME). It also discusses factors affecting TME instability as well as relevant treatments to prevent future immune disorders. It is prognosticated that PD-1 inhibitors are risky and their adverse effects should be taken into account when they are administered to treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), lung adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. In contrast, Treg molecular markers FoxP3 and CD25 analyzed here have stronger expression in almost all kinds of cancers compared with normal people. However, CD25 inhibitors are more effective compared to FoxP3 inhibitors, especially in combination with TGF-beta blockade, in predicting patient survival. According to the data obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas, we then concentrate on AML immunotherapy and discuss different therapeutic strategies including anti-CD25/IL-2, anti-CTLA-4, anti-IDO, antityrosine kinase receptor, and anti-PI3K therapies and highlight the recent advances and clinical achievements in AML immunotherapy. In order to prognosticate the risk and adverse effects of key target inhibitors (namely against CTLA-4, FoxP3, CD25, and PD-1), we finally analyzed and compared the Cancer Genome Atlas derived from ten common cancers. This review shows that Treg cells are strongly increased in AML and the comparative review of key markers shows that Tregbased immunotherapy is not effective for all kinds of cancer. Therefore, blocking CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Treg cells is suggested in AML more than other kinds of cancer; meanwhile, Treg markers studied in other cancers have also great lessons for AML immunotherapy.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CD25', 'CTLA-4', 'FoxP3', 'PD-1', 'Regulatory T cells', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'tumor microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Nov 14.,"Researchers often use a two-step process to analyze multivariate data. First, dimensionality is reduced using a technique such as principal component analysis, followed by a group comparison using a t -test or analysis of variance. Although this practice is often discouraged, the statistical properties of this procedure are not well understood, starting with the hypothesis being tested. We suggest that this approach might be considering two distinct hypotheses, one of which is a global test of no differences in the mean vectors, and the other being a focused test of a specific linear combination where the coefficients have been estimated from the data. We study the asymptotic properties of the two-sample t -statistic for these two scenarios, assuming a nonsparse setting. We show that the size of the global test agrees with the presumed level but that the test has poor power. In contrast, the size of the focused test can be arbitrarily distorted with certain mean and covariance structures. A simple method is provided to correct the size of the focused test. Data analyses and simulations are used to illustrate the results. Recommendations on the use of this two-step method and the related use of principal components for prediction are provided.",['(c) 2019 The International Biometric Society.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*data reduction', '*pooled covariance', '*principal component analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While its primary clinical use has been in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, its role in the treatment of B cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) is less well established.Areas covered: Herein, the authors provide a brief overview of the market, unmet needs, and how blinatumomab fits in to the evolving armamentarium of lymphoma-directed therapies. The authors address its therapeutic role in salvage therapy for relapsed/refractory NHL, as consolidation for high-risk diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) following ASCT, and through various combinations with other available agents. Moreover, authors highlight key competitors.Expert opinion: Although blinatumomab showed impressive results in phase I and II studies for relapsed/refractory DLBCL, its future utility remains to be seen in this clinical setting due to lack of phase III trial and FDA approval of CD19 CART therapy. A new CD19/CD3 and several CD20/CD3 bispecific antibodies with longer half-life and resultant easier mode of administration which can overcome the major barriers of its use in clinical practice are in the pipeline and their role in NHL treatment are actively explored.",,,['NOTNLM'],"[""*B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", '*Blinatumomab', '*CD19', '*bispecific T cell engager (BiTE)', '*cancer immunotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The safety profile, treatment approach with pharmacokinetic considerations, and evaluation of success for bilateral subdural administration of daptomycin after subdural hematoma (SDH) are assessed. Case Description: A 45-year-old male with a history of AML who underwent chemotherapy (induction with 7 + 3) was admitted to oncology with relapsed AML confirmed by bone marrow biopsy, complicated by neutropenic fever and VRE bacteremia. After acute neurological changes with image confirmation of mixed- density bilateral SDHs secondary to thrombocytopenia, the patient was admitted to the neurosurgery unit and underwent bilateral burr hole craniotomies for subdural evacuation with the placement of the left and right subdural drains. Culture of the subdural specimen confirmed VRE seeding of the subdural space. The patient received the first dose of daptomycin into the bilateral subdural spaces 2 days after evacuation and was noted to have acute improvement on neurological examination, followed by a second administration to the left subdural space 5 days after evacuation with bilateral drains pulled thereafter. Conclusion: In this patient, the complication of relapsed AML may have contributed to the rare extension of VRE into the CNS space. Screening for patients at risk of AML with CNS involvement and addressing coagulopathy and risk of infection may help mitigate morbidity. Bilateral administration of subdural daptomycin bolus into the subdural space was tolerated and possibly contributed to the patient's neurological improvement during an extended hospital course.",['Copyright: (c) 2019 Surgical Neurology International.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Acute myeloid leukemia with central nervous system involvement', 'Daptomycin', 'Subdural administration', 'Subdural hematoma']",PMC6763666,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We met a case of aleukemic MCL presenting with anemia and ascites for 2 years, referred for BM evaluation, suspicious of leukemia. Our findings included BM involvement by diffused aggregates of oval- and spindle-shaped atypical mast cells, lacking mature mast cells and other hematopoietic cells. The mast cells were absent in peripheral blood smear. Further assessments showed positive reaction of mast cells metachromatic granules with Tryptase, Giemsa and Toluidine blue stains, the expression of CD117/KIT and CD45 by immunohistochemistery, and elevated level of serum Tryptase. Radiologic investigations revealed generalized lymphadenopathy, and massive hepatosplenomegaly, followed by the cervical lymphadenectomy, and liver wedge biopsy. Suspicious peritoneal lesions were identified and underwent excisional biopsy. Microscopic evaluations showed lymph nodes and liver involvement by cancer cells and the same features in peritoneal seeding. Multiple organs damage progressed in few months and the patient died despite surgery and chemotherapy. In conclusion, we report an extremely rare case of aleukemic MCL with multiple organs damage such as liver, peritoneum, spleen, gastrointestinal tract and BM, presenting by ascites.

It has been shown that the digestive process of caseins leads to the release of bioactive peptides that are involved in the regulation of blood pressure and the inhibition or activation of the immune response by serving as agonists or antagonists of opioid receptors, thus controlling the expression of genes that exert epigenetic control. Later, they bind to opioid receptor, block nuclear factor kappa-beta, increase the redox potential, and reduce oxidative stress and the pro-inflammatory agents that favour an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory environment. Therefore, the bioactive peptides of casein could be compounds with antileukaemia potential.

Epub 2019 Oct 3.,"Outcomes of patients with persistent high-risk leukemia or myelodysplasia prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation are dismal. We therefore conducted a phase I trial evaluating the use of CD45-targeted radiotherapy preceding hematopoietic cell transplantation with the goal of improving outcomes for this high-risk scenario. Fifteen patients, median age 62 (range 37-76) years, were treated: ten with advanced acute myeloid leukemia, five with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. All patients had evidence of disease prior to treatment including nine with marrow blast counts ranging from 7-84% and six with minimal residual disease. Patients received escalating doses of yttrium-90-labeled anti-CD45 antibody followed by fludarabine and 2 Gy total body irradiation prior to human leukocyte antigen-matched, related or unrelated hematopoietic cell transplantation. Although a maximum dose of 30 Gy was delivered to the liver, no dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Therefore, the maximum-tolerated dose could not be estimated. Treatment led to complete remission in 13 patients (87%). All patients engrafted by day 28. Six patients relapsed, median of 59 (range 6-351) days, after transplantation. The 1-year estimate of relapse was 41%. Eight patients (53%) are surviving with median follow up of 1.8 (range 0.9-5.9) years. Estimated overall survival at one and two years was 66% and 46%, respectively, with progression-free survival estimated to be 46% at each time point. In conclusion, the combination of (90)Y-DOTA-BC8 with an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation regimen was feasible and tolerable. This approach appears promising in this high-risk leukemia/myelodysplasia patient population with active disease.

Epub 2019 Oct 3.,"This follow-up study of a randomized, prospective trial included 192 patients with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia receiving antithymoglobulin and cyclosporine, with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). We aimed to evaluate the long-term effect of G-CSF on overall survival, event-free survival, probability of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), clinical paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, relapse, avascular osteonecrosis and chronic kidney disease. The median follow-up was 11.7 years (95% CI, 10.9-12.5). The overall survival rate at 15 years was 57+/-12% in the group given G-CSF and 63+/-12% in the group not given G-CSF (P=0.92); the corresponding event-free survival rates were 24+/-10% and 23+/-10%, respectively (P=0.36). In total, 9 patients developed MDS or AML, 10 only a clonal cytogenetic abnormality, 7 a solid cancer, 18 clinical paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, 8 osteonecrosis, and 12 chronic kidney disease, without any difference between patients treated with or without G-CSF. The cumulative incidence of MDS, AML or isolated cytogenetic abnormality at 15 years was 8.5+/-3% for the G-CSF group and 8.2+/-3% for the non-G-CSF group (P=0.90). The cumulative incidence of any late event including myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia, isolated cytogenetic abnormalities, solid cancer, clinical paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, aseptic osteonecrosis, chronic kidney disease and relapse was 50+/-12% for the G-CSF group and 49+/-12% for the non-G-CSF group (P=0.65). Our results demonstrate that it is unlikely that G-CSF has an impact on the outcome of severe aplastic anemia; nevertheless, very late events are common and eventually affect the prognosis of these patients, irrespectively of their age at the time of immunosuppressive therapy (NCT01163942).",['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,PMC7193468,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01163942'],,['Haematologica. 2020 May;105(5):1170-1171.

Epub 2019 Oct 3.,"Advances in our understanding of mechanisms of leukemogenesis and driver mutations in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) lead to a more precise and informative sub-classification, mainly of B-cell ALL. In parallel, in recent years, novel agents have been approved for the therapy of B-cell ALL, and many others are in active clinical research. Among the newly recognized disease subtypes, Philadelphia-chromosome-like ALL is the most heterogeneous and thus, diagnostically challenging. Given that this subtype of B-cell ALL is associated with a poorer prognosis, improvement of available therapeutic approaches and protocols is a burning issue. Herein, we summarize, in a clinically relevant manner, up-to-date information regarding diagnostic strategies developed for the identification of patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-like ALL. Common therapeutic dilemmas, presented as several case scenarios, are also discussed. It is currently acceptable that patients with B-cell ALL, treated with an aim of cure, irrespective of their age, be evaluated for a Philadelphia-chromosome-like signature as early as possible. Following Philadelphia-chromosome-like recognition, a higher risk of resistance or relapse must be realized and treatment should be modified based on the patient's specific genetic driver and clinical features. However, while active targeted therapeutic options are limited, there is much more to do than just prescribe a matched inhibitor to the identified mutated driver genes. In this review, we present a comprehensive evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of Philadelphia-chromosome-like ALL at different time-points during the disease course.",['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,PMC6821607,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 3.,"We present a laboratory-based prognostic calculator (designated CRO score) to risk stratify treatment-free survival in early stage (Rai 0) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) developed using a training-validation model in a series of 1,879 cases from Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. By means of regression analysis, we identified five prognostic variables with weighting as follows: deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene status, 2 points; deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11, trisomy of chromosome 12, and white blood cell count >32.0x10(3)/microliter, 1 point. Low-, intermediate- and high-risk categories were established by recursive partitioning in a training cohort of 478 cases, and then validated in four independent cohorts of 144 / 395 / 540 / 322 cases, as well as in the composite validation cohort. Concordance indices were 0.75 in the training cohort and ranged from 0.63 to 0.74 in the four validation cohorts (0.69 in the composite validation cohort). These findings advocate potential application of our novel prognostic calculator to better stratify early-stage CLL, and aid case selection in risk-adapted treatment for early disease. Furthermore, they support immunocytogenetic analysis in Rai 0 CLL being performed at the time of diagnosis to aid prognosis and treatment, particularly in today's chemofree era.",['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],['K12 CA090628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC7271568,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify regulators of primitive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, we performed a high-content cytokine screen using primary CD34(+) CD38(low) chronic phase CML cells. Out of the 313 unique human cytokines evaluated, 11 were found to expand cell numbers >/=2-fold in a 7-day culture. Focusing on novel positive regulators of primitive CML cells, the myostatin antagonist myostatin propeptide gave the largest increase in cell expansion and was chosen for further studies. Herein, we demonstrate that myostatin propeptide expands primitive CML and normal BM cells, as shown by increased colony-forming capacity. For primary CML samples, retention of CD34-expression was also seen after culture. Furthermore, we show expression of MSTN by CML mesenchymal stromal cells, and that myostatin propeptide has a direct and instant effect on CML cells, independent of myostatin, by demonstrating binding of myostatin propeptide to the cell surface and increased phosphorylation of STAT5 and SMAD2/3. In summary, we identify myostatin propeptide as a novel positive regulator of primitive CML cells and corresponding normal hematopoietic cells.",['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],['R01 CA172447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC7395258,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 3.,"Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) have inferior survival from time of treatment in clinical studies. We assessed real-world outcomes based on mutational status and treatment regimen in a nationwide population-based cohort, comprising all 4,135 patients from the Danish chronic lymphocytic leukemia registry diagnosed between 2008 and 2017. In total, 850 patients with known mutational status received treatment: 42% of patients received intensive chemoimmunotherapy consisting of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide plus rituximab, or bendamustine plus rituximab; 27% received chlorambucil in combination with anti-CD20 antibodies or as monotherapy, and 31% received other, less common treatments. No difference in overall survival from time of first treatment according to mutational status was observed, while treatment-free survival from start of first treatment was inferior for patients with unmutated IGHV. The median treatment-free survival was 2.5 years for patients treated with chlorambucil plus anti-CD20, and 1 year for those who received chlorambucil monotherapy. The 3-year treatment-free survival rates for patients treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide plus rituximab, and bendamustine plus rituximab were 90% and 91% for those with mutated IGHV, and 76% and 53% for those with unmutated IGHV, respectively, and the 3-year overall survival rates were similar for the two regimens (86-88%). Thus, it appears that, in the real-world setting, patients progressing after intensive chemoimmunotherapy as first-line therapy can be rescued by subsequent treatment, without jeopardizing their long overall survival. Intensive chemoimmunotherapy remains a legitimate option alongside targeted agents, and part of a personalized treatment landscape in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, while improved supportive care and treatment options are warranted for unfit patients.",['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,PMC7271602,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MKL1 is associated with hematologic malignancies and immunodeficiency, but its role in B cells is unexplored. Here we examined B cells from monozygotic triplets with an intronic deletion in MKL1, two of whom had been previously treated for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). To investigate MKL1 and B-cell responses in the pathogenesis of HL, we generated Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from the triplets and two controls. While cells from the patients with treated HL had a phenotype close to that of the healthy controls, cells from the undiagnosed triplet had increased MKL1 mRNA, increased MKL1 protein, and elevated expression of MKL1-dependent genes. This profile was associated with elevated actin content, increased cell spreading, decreased expression of CD11a integrin molecules, and delayed aggregation. Moreover, cells from the undiagnosed triplet proliferated faster, displayed a higher proportion of cells with hyperploidy, and formed large tumors in vivo This phenotype was reversible by inhibiting MKL1 activity. Interestingly, cells from the triplet treated for HL in 1985 contained two subpopulations: one with high expression of CD11a that behaved like control cells and the other with low expression of CD11a that formed large tumors in vivo similar to cells from the undiagnosed triplet. This implies that pre-malignant cells had re-emerged a long time after treatment. Together, these data suggest that dysregulated MKL1 activity participates in B-cell transformation and the pathogenesis of HL.",['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,PMC7193474,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 3.,"In some settings, cancer cells responding to treatment undergo an immunogenic form of cell death that is associated with the abundant emission of danger signals in the form of damage-associated molecular patterns. Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that danger signals play a crucial role in the (re-)activation of antitumor immune responses in vivo, thus having a major impact on patient prognosis. We have previously demonstrated that the presence of calreticulin on the surface of malignant blasts is a positive prognostic biomarker for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Calreticulin exposure not only correlated with enhanced T-cell-dependent antitumor immunity in this setting but also affected the number of circulating natural killer (NK) cells upon restoration of normal hematopoiesis. Here, we report that calreticulin exposure on malignant blasts is associated with enhanced NK cell cytotoxic and secretory functions, both in AML patients and in vivo in mice. The ability of calreticulin to stimulate NK-cells relies on CD11c(+)CD14(high) cells that, upon exposure to CRT, express higher levels of IL-15Ralpha, maturation markers (CD86 and HLA-DR) and CCR7. CRT exposure on malignant blasts also correlates with the upregulation of genes coding for type I interferon. This suggests that CD11c(+)CD14(high) cells have increased capacity to migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, where can efficiently deliver stimulatory signals (IL-15Ralpha/IL-15) to NK cells. These findings delineate a multipronged, clinically relevant mechanism whereby surface-exposed calreticulin favors NK-cell activation in AML patients.",['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,PMC7327638,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we tagged all the endogenous Tet family alleles using CRISPR/Cas9, and characterised TET protein expression in distinct pluripotent cell culture conditions. Whereas TET1 is abundantly expressed in both naive and primed pluripotent cells, TET2 expression is restricted to the naive state. Moreover, TET2 is expressed heterogeneously in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured in serum/leukemia inhibitory factor, with expression correlating with naive pluripotency markers. FACS-sorting of ESCs carrying a Tet2 (Flag-IRES-EGFP) reporter demonstrated that TET2-negative cells have lost the ability to form undifferentiated ESC colonies.

To model these leukemias, we applied clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene editing to induce MLL chromosomal rearrangements in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells purified from umbilical cord blood. Electroporation of ribonucleoprotein complexes containing chemically modified synthetic single guide RNAs and purified Cas9 protein induced translocations between chromosomes 9 and 11 [t(9;11)] at an efficiency >1%. Transplantation of gene-edited cells into immune-compromised mice rapidly induced acute leukemias of different lineages and often with multiclonal origins dictated by the duration of in vitro culture prior to transplantation. Breakpoint junction sequences served as biomarkers to monitor clonal selection and progression in culture and in vivo. High-dimensional cell surface and intracellular protein analysis by mass cytometry (CyTOF) revealed that gene-edited leukemias recapitulated disease-specific protein expression observed in human patients and showed that MLL-rearranged (MLLr) mixed phenotype acute leukemias (MPALs) were more similar to acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) than to acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). Therefore, highly efficient generation of MLL chromosomal translocations in primary human blood stem cells using CRISPR/Cas9 reliably models human acute MLLr leukemia and provides an experimental platform for basic and translational studies of leukemia biology and therapeutics.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['R01 CA116606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001085/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6784514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 30.,"BACKGROUND: Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) has become a gold-standard chemoimmunotherapy regimen for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. However, the question remains of how to treat treatment-naive patients with IGHV-unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We therefore aimed to develop and validate a gene expression signature to identify which of these patients are likely to achieve durable remissions with FCR chemoimmunotherapy. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study in two cohorts of treatment-naive patients (aged >/=18 years) with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The discovery and training cohort consisted of peripheral blood samples collected from patients treated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA), who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, had received at least three cycles of FCR chemoimmunotherapy, and had been treated between Oct 10, 2000, and Oct 26, 2006 (ie, the MDACC cohort). We did transcriptional profiling on samples obtained from the MDACC cohort to identify genes associated with time to progression. We did univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses and used significant genes to cluster IGHV-unmutated samples into two groups (intermediate prognosis and unfavourable prognosis). After using cross-validation to assess robustness, we applied the Lasso method to standardise the gene expression values to find a minimum gene signature. We validated this signature in an external cohort of treatment-naive patients with IGHV-unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia enrolled on the CLL8 trial of the German Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia Study Group who were treated between July 21, 2003, and April 4, 2006 (ie, the CLL8 cohort). FINDINGS: The MDACC cohort consisted of 101 patients and the CLL8 cohort consisted of 109 patients. Using the MDACC cohort, we identified and developed a 17-gene expression signature that distinguished IGHV-unmutated patients who were likely to achieve a long-term remission following front-line FCR chemoimmunotherapy from those who might benefit from alternative front-line regimens (hazard ratio 3.83, 95% CI 1.94-7.59; p<0.0001). We validated this gene signature in the CLL8 cohort; patients with an unfavourable prognosis versus those with an intermediate prognosis had a cause-specific hazard ratio of 1.90 (95% CI 1.18-3.06; p=0.008). Median time to progression was 39 months (IQR 22-69) for those with an unfavourable prognosis compared with 59 months (28-84) for those with an intermediate prognosis. INTERPRETATION: We have developed a robust, reproducible 17-gene signature that identifies a subset of treatment-naive patients with IGHV-unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who might substantially benefit from treatment with FCR chemoimmunotherapy. We recommend testing the value of this gene signature in a prospective study that compares FCR treatment with newer alternative therapies as part of a randomised clinical trial.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through a search of electronic medical records from 2005 to 2017, we identified 21 patients with pathologically proven lung involvement by leukemia. Concurrent CT findings were analyzed by 2 chest radiologists in consensus for ground glass or consolidative opacities, septal thickening, bronchovascular bundle thickening, pulmonary nodules, pulmonary masses, and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. RESULTS: There were 13 cases of lymphoid leukemias and 8 of myeloid leukemias. Nodules and masses were the most common imaging feature (n=13, 62%). Bronchovascular bundle thickening and hilar lymphadenopathy were exclusively seen in lymphoid leukemias (P=0.01 and P=0.006). Centrilobular nodules were also exclusively seen in 3 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: Lung infiltration by leukemia presents most commonly with nodules or masses, but interstitial abnormalities such as bronchovascular bundle thickening were seen as well. Radiologists should consider leukemic infiltration in the differential diagnosis for nodules, including centrilobular nodules, in these patients.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Sep 30.,"Currently, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance became a major obstacle to its clinical use for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It's urgent to develop a novel strategy for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of 5-FU. Herein, we found that H1 (a derivative of Tetrandrine) exerted a potent anti-MDR effect on growth of 5-FU resistant HCC cells (Bel7402/5FU). The resistant fold (RF) of 5-FU is over 160-fold, while the RF of H1 is only 4.8-fold in Bel7402/5-FU cells. Further studies demonstrated that blockage of STAT3/MCL-1 signaling and induction of PUMA is responsible to anti-MDR activity of H1. Moreover, combination of H1 and 5-FU (Ratio=1:2) could synergistically induce apoptosis of Bel7402/5-FU cells. Co-treatment of H1 enhances the suppression of p-STAT3 and MCL-1, and significantly increases PUMA expression. Finally, the combination of H1 and 5-FU results in an increase of cleaved PARP. Taken together, H1 effectively improve the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU against Bel7402/5-FU cells via blocking STAT3/MCL-1 pathway and inducing PUMA.

Epub 2019 Sep 30.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is one of the most efficient curative treatment for acute leukemia. But it is also a heavy process with an important risk of complications, particularly infection and graft versus host disease. Increasing data in literature show that an alteration of the intestinal microbiota of allogeneic stem cell recipients is associated with these complications. Indeed, treatments used during conditioning regimen lead to an impaired microbiota, which cannot fulfill its protective functions anymore. To limit this microbiota impairment, we could restore a healthy microbiota by a fecal microbiota transplantation, which has already shown its efficiency in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. The aim of this review is to describe the intestinal microbiota, the link between microbiota and complications of allogeneic stem cells transplantation, and the recent published data on fecal microbiota transplantation in this field.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Societe Francaise du Cancer.

CircRNA plays important roles in several cell signaling pathways that are associated with cancer biogenesis, including acting as miRNA sponges, transcriptional regulators, protein adaptors and protein translators. The role of circRNA in hematological malignancy has been revealed recently. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of circRNA in hematological malignancy. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted through Pubmed to summarize the published evidence on the circRNAs in hematological malignancies. English literature sources since 1976 were searched, using the terms circRNA, hematological malignancy. Results: CircRNAs can regulate the gene expression of hematological malignancies mainly through adsorbing several miRNAs. Some circRNAs are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in hematological malignancies, such as acute myloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Conclusion: CircRNAs play an important biological function and have great diagnostic and prognostic value in hematological malignancies.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CLL', 'CML', 'Circular RNA', 'biomarker', 'function', 'hematological malignancy', 'therapeutic target']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to their key roles in nucleic acid synthesis and in DNA methylation, inhibiting the folate pathway is still one of the most efficient approaches for the treatment of several tumors. Methotrexate and pemetrexed are the most prescribed antifolates and are mainly used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, and lung cancers. Normal levels of folates in the blood are maintained not only by proper dietary intake and intestinal absorption, but also by an efficient renal reabsorption that seems to be primarily mediated by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol- (GPI) anchored protein folate receptor alpha (FRalpha), which is highly expressed at the brush-border membrane of proximal tubule cells. Folate deficiency due to malnutrition, impaired intestinal absorption or increased urinary elimination is associated with severe hematological and neurological deficits. This review describes the role of the kidneys in folate homeostasis, the molecular basis of folate handling by the kidneys, and the use of high dose folic acid as a model of acute kidney injury.

Multiple epigenetic regulators are known to be deregulated in several hematologic neoplasms, by somatic mutation, amplification, or deletion, allowing the identification of specific epigenetic signatures, but at the same time providing new therapeutic opportunities. While these vulnerabilities have been traditionally addressed by hypomethylating agents or histone deacetylase inhibitors, pharmacological targeting of bromodomain-containing proteins has recently emerged as a promising approach in a number of lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. Indeed, preclinical and clinical studies highlight the relevance of targeting the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family as an efficient strategy of target transcription irrespective of the presence of epigenetic mutations. Here we will summarize the main advances achieved in the last decade regarding the preclinical and clinical evaluation of BET bromodomain inhibitors in hematologic cancers, either as monotherapies or in combinations with standard and/or experimental agents.

Interestingly, when an FDA-approved drug library was tested for agents that block peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) phosphorylation at Ser245 to evaluate possibilities of antidiabetic drug repositioning, imatinib was determined as a PPARgamma antagonist ligand. However, it is not well understood how imatinib binds to PPARgamma or would improve insulin sensitivity without classical agonism. Here, we report the crystal structure of the PPARgamma R288A mutant in complex with imatinib. Imatinib bound to Arm2 and Arm3 regions in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of PPARgamma, of which the Arm3 region is closely related to the inhibition of PPARgamma phosphorylation at Ser245. The binding of imatinib in LBD induced a stable conformation of helix H2' and the Omega loop compared with the ligand-free state. In contrast, imatinib does not interact with Tyr473 on PPARgamma helix H12, which is important for the classical agonism associated with side effects.

Here, we report the synthesis and testing of novel bis-sulfone compound-based hybrid scaffold of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors for the development of novel molecules toward the therapy of Alzheimer's disease. The novel synthesized bis-sulfone compounds demonstrated Ki values between 11.4 +/- 3.4 and 70.7 +/- 23.2 nM on human carbonic anhydrase I isozyme (hCA I), 28.7 +/- 6.6 to 77.6 +/- 5.6 nM on human carbonic anhydrase II isozyme (hCA II), 18.7 +/- 2.61 to 95.4 +/- 25.52 nM on AChE, and 9.5 +/- 2.1 to 95.5 +/- 1.2 nM on BChE enzymes. The results showed that novel bis-sulfone derivatives can have promising drug potential for glaucoma, leukemia, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease, which are associated with the high enzymatic activity of hCA I, hCA II, AChE, and BChE enzymes.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Ataturk Universitesi', 'FDK-2016-1541/Akdeniz Universitesi']",['NOTNLM'],"['acetylcholinesterase', 'bis-sulfide', 'bis-sulfone', 'butyrylcholinesterase', 'carbonic anhydrase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that RPL22 is either deleted or mutated in 36% of CRC and provide new insights into its mechanism of action. Indeed, Rpl22 inactivation causes the induction of its highly homologous paralog, RPL22L1, which serves as a driver of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in CRC cells. Moreover, RPL22L1 protein is highly expressed in patient CRC samples and correlates with poor survival. Interestingly, the association of high RPL22L1 expression with poor prognosis appears to be linked to resistance to 5-Fluorouracil, which is a core component of most CRC therapeutic regimens. Indeed, in an avatar trial, we found that human CRC samples that were unresponsive to 5-Fluorouracil in patient-derived xenografts exhibited elevated expression levels of RPL22L1. This link between RPL22L1 induction and 5-Fluorouracil resistance appears to be causal, because ectopic expression or knockdown of RPL22L1 in cell lines increases and decreases 5-Fluorouracil resistance, respectively, and this is associated with changes in expression of the DNA-repair genes, MGMT and MLH1. In summary, our data suggest that RPL22L1 might be a prognostic marker in CRC and predict 5-FU responsiveness.",,"['P30 CA006927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI110985/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA216825/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6776433,['The authors have declared no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is closely regulated by pro- and antiapoptotic signals. Dysregulation of this homeostasis is implicated in tumorigenesis and acquired resistance to treatments. The emerging importance of Mcl-1 protein in chemotherapeutic resistance makes it a high priority therapeutic target. Targeting PPIs associated with Mcl-1 presents many challenges for the design of inhibitors. This review focuses on the characterization of the Mcl-1 hot-spots which are related to four hydrophobic pockets P1-P4 and one major electrostatic interaction. Analysis of structural data highlights the high importance of the P2/P3 pockets for the binding of nonpeptide ligands. In order to guide medicinal chemists into making more selective and potent Mcl-1 inhibitors, the Mcl-1 protein is compared to other antiapoptotic proteins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 3.,"BACKGROUND: Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (OME) has antileukemic effects against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) carrying an internal tandem duplication of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD). A phase 2 clinical trial was conducted to evaluate a combination treatment of sorafenib and omacetaxine mepesuccinate (SOME). METHODS: Relapsed or refractory (R/R) or newly diagnosed patients were treated with sorafenib (200-400 mg twice daily) and OME (2 mg daily) for 7 (first course) or 5 days (second course onward) every 21 days until disease progression or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The primary endpoint was composite complete remission, which was defined as complete remission (CR) plus complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). Secondary endpoints were leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Thirty-nine R/R patients and 5 newly diagnosed patients were recruited. Among the R/R patients, 28 achieved CR or CRi. Two patients showed partial remission, and 9 patients did not respond. Among the 5 newly diagnosed patients, 4 achieved CR, and 1 achieved CRi. The median LFS and OS were 5.6 and 10.9 months, respectively. Prior Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor exposure (P = .007), 2 or more inductions (P = .001), and coexisting IDH2 (P = .008) and RUNX1 mutations (P = .003) were associated with lower CR/CRi rates. HSCT consolidation and deep molecular responses (defined as an FLT3-ITD variant allelic frequency [VAF] </= 0.1% or a nucleophosmin 1 [NPM1] mutant VAF </= 0.01%) were associated with better OS and LFS. Prior FLT3 inhibitor exposure and 2 or more inductions were associated with inferior LFS.

Diagnosis depends upon identification of specific tumor markers including CD4, CD56 and CD123. Historically, the median survival has been less than 2 years in most reported series. While for many years, conventional chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation was the standard of care, recently tagraxofusp, a cytotoxin directed against CD123, received United States Food and Drug Administration approval specifically for patients with BPDCN. In this review, we will discuss the markers used for diagnosis of BPDCN and focus on the new targeted treatments available. Specifically in BPDCN, tagraxofusp was highly effective with a safety profile found to be acceptable overall, with the noted occurrence of capillary leak syndrome. Future directions in therapy approaches for patients with BPDCN will include the development of other CD123-targeted agents, agents targeting beyond CD123 and investigation of rational combination approaches of CD123-directed therapy with other therapies.","['(c) The Author(s), 2019.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BPDCN', 'CAR T-cells', 'stem cell transplantation', 'tagraxofusp', 'venetoclax']",PMC6759709,"['Conflict of interest statement: ME declares no conflict.

Epub 2019 Aug 22.,"Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are responsible for therapeutic failure and relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. As a result of the interplay between LSCs and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), cancer cells may escape from chemotherapy and immune surveillance, thereby promoting leukemia progress and relapse. The present study identified that the crosstalk between LSCs and BM-MSCs may contribute to changes of immune phenotypes and expression of hematopoietic factors in BM-MSCs. Furthermore, Illumina Genome Analyzer/Hiseq 2000 identified 7 differentially expressed genes between BM-MSCs(LSC) and BM-MSCs. The Illumina sequencing results were further validated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Following LSC simulation, 2 genes were significantly upregulated, whereas the remaining 2 genes were significantly downregulated in MSCs. The most remarkable changes were identified in the expression levels of lumican (LUM) gene. These results were confirmed by western blot analysis. In addition, decreased LUM expression led to decreased apoptosis, and promoted chemoresistance to VP-16 in Nalm-6 cells. These results suggest that downregulation of LUM expression in BM-MSCs contribute to the anti-apoptotic properties and resistance to chemotherapy in LSCs.","['Copyright (c) 2019, Spandidos Publications.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Illumina sequencing', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells', 'leukemia stem cell', 'lumican']",PMC6757291,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: T helper (Th) 1, Th2, regulatory T (Treg), and CD8(+)T cell levels were detected in patients with CML (n = 9) before and after dasatinib treatment. The corresponding response level at the time of a blood test was evaluated. RESULTS: After dasatinib treatment, six patients achieved a better response level, while three did not show improved response levels. Among the total nine patients, there were no significant differences in Th1, Th2, and Treg cell levels, whereas CD8(+)T cell levels were significantly increased after dasatinib treatment compared with before treatment. When we analyzed the six patients who obtained a better response level, Th1 and CD8(+)T cell levels were significantly increased after dasatinib treatment, but Th2 and Treg cell levels did not change. The other three patients who did not have improved response levels showed decreased Th1 cell levels and increased Treg cell levels after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib may increase Th1 and CD8(+)T cell levels, and decrease Treg cell levels in patients with CML.

Epub 2019 Dec 3.,"Cell and gene therapies are finally becoming viable patient treatment options, with both T cell- and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based therapies being approved to market in Europe. However, these therapies, which involve the use of viral vector to modify the target cells, are expensive and there is an urgent need to reduce manufacturing costs. One major cost factor is the viral vector production itself, therefore improving the gene modification efficiency could significantly reduce the amount of vector required per patient. This study describes the use of a transduction enhancing peptide, Vectofusin-1((R)), to improve the transduction efficiency of primary target cells using lentiviral and gammaretroviral vectors (LV and RV) pseudotyped with a variety of envelope proteins. Using Vectofusin-1 in combination with LV pseudotyped with viral glycoproteins derived from baboon endogenous retrovirus, feline endogenous virus (RD114), and measles virus (MV), a strongly improved transduction of HSCs, B cells and T cells, even when cultivated under low stimulation conditions, could be observed. The formation of Vectofusin-1 complexes with MV-LV retargeted to CD20 did not alter the selectivity in mixed cell culture populations, emphasizing the precision of this targeting technology. Functional, ErbB2-specific chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells could be generated using a gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV)-pseudotyped RV. Using a variety of viral vectors and target cells, Vectofusin-1 performed in a comparable manner to the traditionally used surface-bound recombinant fibronectin. As Vectofusin-1 is a soluble peptide, it was possible to easily transfer the T cell transduction method to an automated closed manufacturing platform, where proof of concept studies demonstrated efficient genetic modification of T cells with GALV-RV and RD114-RV and the subsequent expansion of mainly central memory T cells to a clinically relevant dose.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD34', '*CliniMACS Prodigy', '*automated manufacturing', '*immunotherapy', '*pseudotyping', '*transduction']",PMC6919281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 22.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is highly expressed in tumor-associated endothelial cells, where it modulates tumor-promoting angiogenesis, and it is also found on the surface of tumor cells. Currently, there are no Ab therapeutics targeting VEGFR2 approved for the treatment of prostate cancer or leukemia. Therefore, development of novel efficacious anti-VEGFR2 Abs will benefit cancer patients. We used the Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology human Ab library and affinity maturation to develop a fully human Ab, anti-VEGFR2-AF, which shows excellent VEGFR2 binding activity. Anti-VEGFR2-AF bound Ig-like domain 3 of VEGFR2 extracellular region to disrupt the interaction between VEGF-A and VEGFR2, neutralizing downstream signaling of the receptor. Moreover, anti-VEGFR2-AF inhibited capillary structure formation and exerted Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro. We found that VEGFR2 is expressed in PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line and associated with malignancy and metastasis of human prostate cancer. In a PC-3 xenograft mouse model, treatment with anti-VEGFR2-AF repressed tumor growth and angiogenesis as effectively and safely as US FDA-approved anti-VEGFR2 therapeutic, ramucirumab. We also report for the first time that addition of anti-VEGFR2 Ab can enhance the efficacy of docetaxel in the treatment of a prostate cancer mouse model. In HL-60 human leukemia-xenografted mice, anti-VEGFR2-AF showed better efficacy than ramucirumab with prolonged survival and reduced metastasis of leukemia cells to ovaries and lymph nodes. Our findings suggest that anti-VEGFR2-AF has strong potential as a cancer therapy that could directly target VEGFR2-expressing tumor cells in addition to its anti-angiogenic action.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Sep 27.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment is the standard of care for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Even in the imatinib era, the presence of 'clonal chromosomal abnormalities' in the Philadelphia chromosome (CCA/Ph+) at diagnosis reportedly increased the risk of disease progression and predicted shorter survival. However, it remains unclear whether CCA/Ph+ is a poor prognostic marker in the era of newgeneration TKIs. The data of patients with CML in the chronic phase (CP) that were extracted from the CML Cooperative Study Group database were retrospectively analyzed. Of the 328 eligible patients, 33 (10.1%) had CCA/Ph+, including 9 major route and 24 minor route aberrations. The characteristics of patients with and without CCA/Ph+ were similar; however, the proportion of blasts was higher among patients with CCA/Ph+. Notably, the survival rate of patients with CCA/Ph+ was not inferior to that of patients without CCA/Ph+, and there were no differences in responses to TKIs. All 9 patients with major route CCA/Ph+ attained a major molecular response (MMR) with no disease progression, and 8 ultimately achieved a deep molecular response. In particular, the median interval between TKI initiation and achievement of MMR was shorter in patients initially treated with a secondgeneration TKI than in those treated with imatinib (5 vs. 10 months). The present retrospective study, thus, revealed favorable treatment outcomes in CMLCP patients with CCA/Ph+ treated with secondgeneration TKIs. The data indicated that administering secondgeneration TKIs as firstline treatments is preferable in CMLCP patients with CCA/Ph+.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 24.,"Cancer has recently been identified as the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Several conventional treatments and cytotoxic immunotherapies have been developed and made available to the market. Considering the complex behavior of tumors and the involvement of numerous genetic and cellular factors involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis, there is a need to develop a promising immunotherapy that targets tumors at both the cellular and genetic levels. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a novel therapeutic T cell engineering practice, in which T cells derived from patient blood are engineered in vitro to express artificial receptors targeted to a specific tumor antigen. These directly identify the tumor antigen without the involvement of the major histocompatibility complex. The use of this therapy in the last few years has been successful, with a reduction in remission rates of up to 80% for hematologic cancer, particularly for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and nonHodgkin lymphomas, such as large B cell lymphoma. Recently, antiCD19 CAR therapy, or UCART19, has been shown to be efficacious in treating relapsed/refractory hematologic cancer. Several other cell surface tumor antigens, such as CD20 and CD22, found in the majority of leukemias and lymphomas are considered potential targets by pharmaceutical companies and research organizations, and trials have been ongoing in this direction. Although this therapeutic regimen is currently confined to treating hematologic cancer, the increasing involvement of several auxiliary techniques, such as bispecific CAR, TanCAR, inhibitoryCAR, combined antigens, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats geneediting tool and nanoparticle delivery, may substantially improve its overall anticancer effects. CAR therapy has the potential to offer a rapid and safer treatment regime to treat nonsolid and solid tumors. The present review presents an insight into the advantages and the advances of CAR immunotherapy and presents the emerging discrepancy of CAR therapy over usual forms of therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 2.,"Transcription and pre-mRNA splicing are key steps in the control of gene expression and mutations in genes regulating each of these processes are common in leukaemia(1,2). Despite the frequent overlap of mutations affecting epigenetic regulation and splicing in leukaemia, how these processes influence one another to promote leukaemogenesis is not understood and, to our knowledge, there is no functional evidence that mutations in RNA splicing factors initiate leukaemia. Here, through analyses of transcriptomes from 982 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, we identified frequent overlap of mutations in IDH2 and SRSF2 that together promote leukaemogenesis through coordinated effects on the epigenome and RNA splicing. Whereas mutations in either IDH2 or SRSF2 imparted distinct splicing changes, co-expression of mutant IDH2 altered the splicing effects of mutant SRSF2 and resulted in more profound splicing changes than either mutation alone. Consistent with this, co-expression of mutant IDH2 and SRSF2 resulted in lethal myelodysplasia with proliferative features in vivo and enhanced self-renewal in a manner not observed with either mutation alone. IDH2 and SRSF2 double-mutant cells exhibited aberrant splicing and reduced expression of INTS3, a member of the integrator complex(3), concordant with increased stalling of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Aberrant INTS3 splicing contributed to leukaemogenesis in concert with mutant IDH2 and was dependent on mutant SRSF2 binding to cis elements in INTS3 mRNA and increased DNA methylation of INTS3. These data identify a pathogenic crosstalk between altered epigenetic state and splicing in a subset of leukaemias, provide functional evidence that mutations in splicing factors drive myeloid malignancy development, and identify spliceosomal changes as a mediator of IDH2-mutant leukaemogenesis.",,"['R01 HL128239/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA013106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233332/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 CA218896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6858560,,['NIHMS1538530'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 2.,"AML SCT-BFM 2007 was the first hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) trial in Germany to comply with the European Clinical Trials Directive, and aimed to standardize pediatric HCT for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) across centers in Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic. Children with high-risk features and a good early response achieving a complete first remission (CR-1) and those in CR-2 after a first relapse were stratified to receive HCT from a matched donor after myeloablative conditioning consisting of busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan. Four-year EFS and OS were 61 and 70%. Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 22%. TRM was 15% and correlated with age reaching 9% (SE 3%) in children younger than 12 years and 31% (SE 9%) in older children and adolescents. Children with poorly responding primary disease or relapse were allocated to receive early HCT after a cytoreductive regimen with fludarabine, amsacrine, and cytarabine, followed by reduced intensity conditioning and prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusions. Four-year EFS and OS were 49 and 53%. CIR was 38% and TRM 11%. For patients with primary poor response disease, early use of RIC HCT followed by prophylactic DLI can induce long-term remissions in more than 50% (EFS 46% (SE 9%)).",,,,,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2019 Nov 25;:.

aggressive T cell malignancy associated with human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. The HTLV-1 viral oncogene HBZ has been implicated in ATL tumorigenesis and bone loss. In this study, we evaluated the role of HBZ on ATL-associated bone destruction using HTLV-1 infection and disease progression mouse models. Humanized mice infected with HTLV-1 developed lymphoproliferative disease and continuous, progressive osteolytic bone lesions. HTLV-1 lacking HBZ displayed only modest delays to lymphoproliferative disease but significantly decreased disease-associated bone loss compared with HTLV-1-infected mice. Gene expression array of acute ATL patient samples demonstrated increased expression of RANKL, a critical regulator of osteoclasts. We found that HBZ regulated RANKL in a c-Fos-dependent manner. Treatment of HTLV-1-infected humanized mice with denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against human RANKL, alleviated bone loss. Using patient-derived xenografts from primary human ATL cells to induce lymphoproliferative disease, we also observed profound tumor-induced bone destruction and increased c-Fos and RANKL gene expression. Together, these data show the critical role of HBZ in driving ATL-associated bone loss through RANKL and identify denosumab as a potential treatment to prevent bone complications in ATL patients.",,"['T32 CA113275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR027552/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR070030/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA154737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AR060719/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AR057235/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 CA097250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA097250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone Biology', '*Bone disease', '*Oncogenes', '*Oncology']",PMC6795409,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the role of host and donor B7-H4 in regulating acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Allogeneic donor T cells infused into B7-H4-/- versus WT recipients markedly accelerated GVHD-induced lethality. Chimera studies pointed toward B7-H4 expression on host hematopoietic cells as more critical than parenchymal cells in controlling GVHD. Rapid mortality in B7-H4-/- recipients was associated with increased donor T cell expansion, gut T cell homing and loss of intestinal epithelial integrity, increased T effector function (proliferation, proinflammatory cytokines, cytolytic molecules), and reduced apoptosis. Higher metabolic demands of rapidly proliferating donor T cells in B7-H4-/- versus WT recipients required multiple metabolic pathways, increased extracellular acidification rates (ECARs) and oxygen consumption rates (OCRs), and increased expression of fuel substrate transporters. During GVHD, B7-H4 expression was upregulated on allogeneic WT donor T cells. B7-H4-/- donor T cells given to WT recipients increased GVHD mortality and had function and biological properties similar to WT T cells from allogeneic B7-H4-/- recipients. Graft-versus-leukemia responses were intact regardless as to whether B7-H4-/- mice were used as hosts or donors.

Epub 2019 Oct 2.,"PURPOSE: Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), has improved the outcomes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but primary resistance or relapse are issues of increasing significance. While the predominant mechanism of action of BTKi is the B-cell receptor (BCR) blockade, many off-target effects are unknown. We investigated potential interactions between BCR pathway and NOTCH1 activity in ibrutinib-treated CLL to identify new mechanisms of therapy resistance and markers to monitor disease response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: NOTCH activations was evaluated either in vitro and ex vivo in CLL samples after ibrutinib treatment by Western blotting. Confocal proximity ligation assay (PLA) experiments and analyses of down-targets of NOTCH1 by qRT-PCR were used to investigate the cross-talk between BTK and NOTCH1. RESULTS: In vitro ibrutinib treatment of CLL significantly reduced activated NOTCH1/2 and induced dephosphorylation of eIF4E, a NOTCH target in CLL. BCR stimulation increased the expression of activated NOTCH1 that accumulated in the nucleus leading to HES1, DTX1, and c-MYC transcription. Results of in situ PLA experiments revealed the presence of NOTCH1-ICD/BTK complexes, whose number was reduced after ibrutinib treatment. In ibrutinib-treated CLL patients, leukemic cells showed NOTCH1 activity downregulation that deepened over time. The NOTCH1 signaling was restored at relapse and remained activated in ibrutinib-resistant CLL cells. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a strong clinical activity of ibrutinib in a real-life context. The ibrutinib clinical efficacy was associated with NOTCH1 activity downregulation that deepened over time. Our data point to NOTCH1 as a new molecular partner in BCR signaling with potential to further improve CLL-targeted treatments.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-6 can mediate effects via various pathways, including classical, trans, and cluster signaling. Given the recent availability of agents that differentially inhibit these discrete signaling cascades, understanding the source and signaling and cellular targets of this cytokine is paramount to inform the design of clinical studies. Here we demonstrate that IL-6 secretion from recipient dendritic cells (DCs) initiates the systemic dysregulation of this cytokine. Inhibition of DC-driven classical signaling after targeted IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) deletion in T cells eliminated pathogenic donor Th17/Th22 cell differentiation and resulted in long-term survival. After engraftment, donor DCs assume the same role, maintaining classical IL-6 signaling-dependent GVHD responses. Surprisingly, cluster signaling was not active after transplantation, whereas inhibition of trans signaling with soluble gp130Fc promoted severe, chronic cutaneous GVHD. The latter was a result of exaggerated polyfunctional Th22-cell expansion that was reversed by IL-22 deletion or IL-6R inhibition. Importantly, inhibition of IL-6 classical signaling did not impair the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Together, these data highlight IL-6 classical signaling and downstream Th17/Th22 differentiation as important therapeutic targets after alloSCT.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to use weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of gene coexpression networks to identify candidate prognostic biomarker genes in patients with AML and to investigate the expression of these genes in the human U937 cell line in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS RNA-seq data were retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and included bone marrow samples and survival data of patients with AML (N=151), patients who did not relapse after treatment (N=119), and patients with relapse (N=40). Differentially expressed genes were identified, WGCNA was used to detect functional modules, and survival analysis was performed. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay investigated the proliferation of U937 cells transfected with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), shCRIP1, shHIST1H1C, and shHIST1H1E. RNA-seq analysis identified gene expression following CRIP1 knockdown. RESULTS Eighty-two genes were associated with both relapse and prognosis in patients with AML. There were two prognosis-related gene modules in the coexpression network. In the coexpression network, the histone cluster 1 H1 family member gene, HIST1H1C had the maximum relapse fold change, HIST1H1E had the lowest survival p-value, and the cysteine-rich intestinal protein 1 (CRIP1) gene had the most edge numbers and was significantly associated with poor prognosis (P=0.0165786). RNA-seq data showed that there was a significant difference in gene expression after CRIP1 knockdown in U937 cells. CONCLUSIONS WGCNA of gene coexpression networks identified CRIP1 as a potential prognostic biomarker gene in patients with AML.",,,,,PMC6790098,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present meta-analysis aimed to better elucidate these relationships.Three electronic databases were searched systematically to identify reports on the prognostic role of SF in MDS and AML patients, and those investigating the impact of ICT on prognosis of MDS patients. The hazard ratios (HRs) and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were extracted from the identified studies using Cox proportional hazard regression model for overall survival (OS) and progression of MDS to AML.Twenty reports including 1066 AML patients and 4054 MDS patients were included in present study. The overall pooled HRs for OS of AML and MDS patients with elevated SF prior to transplantation was 1.73 (1.40-2.14), subgroup analyses stratified by the cut-off value of SF >/=1400/1000 ng/mL showed that the pooled HRs were 1.45 (0.98-2.15) and 1.65 (1.30-2.10), respectively. The pooled HRs for ICT in MDS patients was 0.30 (0.23-0.40). For ICT, the pooled HRs for the progression of MDS to AML was 0.84 (0.61-1.61).SF has a negative impact on the OS of AML and MDS patients when it is higher than 1000 ng/mL.

Epub 2019 Oct 2.,"Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) is a powerful and versatile tool to accurately analyze cell subsets, notably to explore normal and pathological hematopoiesis. Yet, mostly supervised subjective strategies are used to identify cell subsets in this complex tissue. In the past few years, the implementation of mass cytometry and the big data generated have led to a blossoming of new software solutions. Their application to classical MFC in hematology is however still seldom reported. Here, we show how one of these new tools, the FlowSOM R solution, can be applied, together with the Kaluza(R) software, to a new delineation of hematopoietic subsets in normal human bone marrow (BM). We thus combined the unsupervised discrimination of cell subsets provided by FlowSOM and their expert-driven node-by-node assignment to known or new hematopoietic subsets. We also show how this new tool could modify the MFC exploration of hematological malignancies both at diagnosis (Dg) and follow-up (FU). This can be achieved by direct comparison of merged listmodes of reference normal BM, Dg, and FU samples of a representative acute myeloblastic case tested with the same immunophenotyping panel.

Epub 2019 Oct 2.,"Antibody reagents are the key components of multiparametric flow cytometry analysis. Their quality performance is an absolute requirement for reproducible flow cytometry experiments. While there is an enormous body of antibody reagents available, there is still a lack of consensus about which criteria should be evaluated to select antibody reagents with the proper performance, how to validate antibody reagents for flow cytometry, and how to interpret the validation results. The achievements of cytometry moved the field to a higher number of measured parameters, large data sets, and computational data analysis approaches. These advancements pose an increased demand for antibody reagent performance quality. This review summarizes the codevelopment of cytometry, antibody development, and validation strategies. It discusses the diverse issues of the specificity, cross-reactivity, epitope, titration, and reproducibility features of antibody reagents, and this review discusses the validation principles and methods that are currently available and those that are emerging. We argue that significant efforts should be invested by antibody users, developers, manufacturers, and publishers to increase the quality and reproducibility of published studies. More validation data should be presented by all stakeholders; however, the data should be presented in sufficient experimental detail to foster reproducibility, and community effort shall lead to the public availability of large data sets that can serve as a benchmark for antibody performance.

Methods Between 2009 and 2017, 192 patients were identified on the National Neoplastic Meningitis Registry and had undergone Ommaya reservoir placement for intrathecal chemotherapy. A retrospective chart review was performed to collect the preoperative and postoperative platelet levels, whether or not the patient received any transfusion of platelets, neurological exams, and whether a postoperative head CT was obtained. Using generally accepted recommendations, a platelet level less than 100,000/muL was considered clinically significant and used as our threshold for thrombocytopenia. Results Seven patients (3.6%) were identified as thrombocytopenic in our patient population with platelet counts ranging from 54,000 to 99,000/muL. Primary diagnoses for the seven patients included leukemia, prostate cancer, primary brain cancer (four patients), and lung cancer (non-small-cell lung carcinoma). One patient received platelet transfusions preoperatively. Three patients had a routine head CT obtained postoperatively with no abnormal findings noted. There were no changes in the neurological exam noted in all of the patients included in this study. No clinically significant hemorrhages were identified in our patients. Conclusions From our single institutional experience, we found that thrombocytopenia is fairly uncommon, found in only 3.6% of our patients undergoing placement of Ommaya reservoirs. We did not encounter any increased risks of postoperative hemorrhage in studied thrombocytopenic patients.","['Copyright (c) 2019, Major et al.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['hemorrhage', 'ommaya', 'stereotactic', 'thrombocytopenia']",PMC6764613,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study aimed to develop a neural network model by using a genetic algorithm (GA) for the prediction of mortality in patients with ARDS. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of two multicenter randomized controlled trials conducted in forty-four hospitals that are members of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, founded to create an acute respiratory distress syndrome Clinical Trials Network. Model training and validation were performed using the SAILS and OMEGA studies, respectively. A GA was employed to screen variables in order to predict 90-day mortality, and a neural network model was trained for the prediction. This machine learning model was compared to the logistic regression model and APACHE III score in the validation cohort. Results: A total number of 1,071 ARDS patients were included for analysis. The GA search identified seven important variables, which were age, AIDS, leukemia, metastatic tumor, hepatic failure, lowest albumin, and FiO2. A representative neural network model was constructed using the forward selection procedure. The area under the curve (AUC) of the neural network model evaluated with the validation cohort was 0.821 (95% CI [0.753-0.888]), which was greater than the APACHE III score (0.665; 95% CI [0.590-0.739]; p = 0.002 by Delong's test) and logistic regression model, albeit not statistically significant (0.743; 95% CI [0.669-0.817], p = 0.130 by Delong's test). Conclusions: The study developed a neural network model using a GA, which outperformed conventional scoring systems for the prediction of mortality in ARDS patients.",['(c)2019 Zhang.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute respiratory distress syndrome', 'Genetic algorithm', 'Genomic algorithms', 'Mortality', 'Neural networks', 'Prediction']",PMC6752189,['The author declares there are no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recurrent mutations in BRCC3 have been reported in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) but not in de novo AML. In one of our recent studies, we found BRCC3 mutations selectively in 9/191 (4.7%) cases with t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) AML but not in 160 cases of inv(16)(p13.1q22) AML. Clinically, AML patients with BRCC3 mutations had an excellent outcome with an event-free survival of 100%. Inactivation of BRCC3 by CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in improved proliferation in t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) positive AML cell lines and together with expression of AML1-ETO induced unlimited self-renewal in mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. Mutations in BRCC3 abrogated its deubiquitinating activity on IFNAR1 resulting in an impaired interferon response and led to diminished inflammasome activity. In addition, BRCC3 inactivation increased release of several cytokines including G-CSF which enhanced proliferation of AML cell lines with t(8;21)(q22;q22.1). Cell lines and primary mouse cells with inactivation of BRCC3 had a higher sensitivity to doxorubicin due to an impaired DNA damage response providing a possible explanation for the favorable outcome of BRCC3 mutated AML patients.",,,,,PMC7214237,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 1.,"To date, only one subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) can be effectively treated by differentiation therapy utilizing all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Non-APL AMLs are resistant to ATRA. Here we demonstrate that the acetyltransferase GCN5 contributes to ATRA resistance in non-APL AML via aberrant acetylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) residues maintaining the expression of stemness and leukemia associated genes. We show that inhibition of GCN5 unlocks an ATRA-driven therapeutic response. This response is potentiated by coinhibition of the lysine demethylase LSD1, leading to differentiation in most non-APL AML. Induction of differentiation was not correlated to a specific AML subtype, cytogenetic, or mutational status. Our study shows a previously uncharacterized role of GCN5 in maintaining the immature state of leukemic blasts and identifies GCN5 as a therapeutic target in AML. The high efficacy of the combined epigenetic treatment with GCN5 and LSD1 inhibitors may enable the use of ATRA for differentiation therapy of non-APL AML. Furthermore, it supports a strategy of combined targeting of epigenetic factors to improve treatment, a concept potentially applicable for a broad range of malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2020 Jan 16;:.

The role of ATR kinase in deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) activation in response to DNA damage was assessed. The presence of DNA lesions was assessed by measurement phosphorylation of H2AX and by using the alkaline comet assay with proteinase K post-treatment following assessment of the cell cycle. Apoptotic events such as alterations in intracellular calcium concentration, caspase-3/7 activity and increased sub-G1 cell population were measured. CLA derivatives were highly effective against leukemic cells, showing high cytotoxicity, causing DNA fragmentation, and inducing DNA-protein cross-links in leukemic cells. CLA-FMOR showed the highest efficacy. CLA derivatives increased the levels of intracellular calcium ions, caspase-3/7 and the percentage of sub-G1 apoptotic cells and blocked cells in the S phase of the cell cycle to a greater extent than free CLA. The selective ATR inhibitor VE-821 significantly suppressed the increase in dCK activity and decreased basal dCK activity. The present results suggested that ATR kinase controls dCK activity in response to synthetic CLA derivatives.",,,,,PMC6773697,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical responses are limited, and clinical effectiveness is yet to be achieved. Limitations, among others, being the LAAs themselves, the indirect approach to HLA-I epitope identification by reverse immunology, and the use of single or few LAAs and HLA-I epitopes, which limits the spectrum of inducible tumor-specific T cells. Use of a direct approach to identify naturally processed and presented HLA-I epitopes from LAAs, and higher numbers of antigens for T cell-mediated immunotherapy for leukemia may enhance clinical responses and broaden clinical effectiveness. In a prior study we used immunoaffinity purification of HLA-I peptide complexes from the differentiated myeloid tumor cell lines MUTZ3 and THP1 coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). From this we identified in the current study seven new HLA-I epitopes and the corresponding LAAs for myeloid leukemia. In comparison, the myeloid HLA-I epitopes reported here were generally stronger HLA-binders that induce stronger T cell responses than those previously published, and their source LAAs had higher immunogenicity, higher expression levels in myeloid tumors cells compared to normal hemopoietin and other major normal tissues, and more protein interaction partners, and they are targeted by CD8 T cells in CML patients. This study analyses and compares the LAAs and HLA-I epitopes based on various immunotherapeutic targets selection criteria, and highlights new targets for T cell-mediated immunotherapy for leukemia.",,,,,PMC6773711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While dual-color, dual-fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) probes can detect TCF3/PBX1 fusions, further characterization of atypical TCF3 FISH patterns as indicated by additional or diminished TCF3 signals is currently limited. Herein we describe the use of a next-generation sequencing assay, mate-pair sequencing (MPseq), to characterize typical and cryptic TCF3/PBX1 fusions and to identify TCF3 translocation partners based on results obtained from our laboratory-developed TCF3/PBX1 D-FISH probe set. MPseq was performed on 21 cases of pediatric B-ALL/LBL with either TCF3/PBX1 fusion, or no TCF3/PBX1 fusion but with additional or diminished TCF3 signals obtained by our PBX1/TCF3 D-FISH probe set. In addition, MPseq was performed on one pediatric B-ALL/LBL case with an apparently normal karyotype and abnormal TCF3 break-apart probe results. Of 22 specimens successfully evaluated by MPseq, 13 cases (59%) demonstrated TCF3/PBX1 fusion, including three cases with previously undescribed insertional rearrangements. The remaining nine cases (41%) harbored various TCF3 partners, including six cases with TCF3/ZNF384, and one case each with TCF3/HLF, TCF3/FLI1 and TCF3/TEF. Our results illustrate the power of MPseq to characterize TCF3 rearrangements with increased precision and accuracy over traditional cytogenetic methodologies.",,,,,PMC6773761,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transition between stem and differentiation states in nonneoplastic cells requires metabolic plasticity, and this plasticity is increasingly recognized to play a central role in cancer biology. The insights from hematopoietic and neural stem cell differentiation pathways were used to identify cancer stem cells in leukemia and gliomas. Similarly, defining metabolic heterogeneity and fuel-switching signals in nonneoplastic stem cells may also give important insights into the corresponding molecular mechanisms controlling metabolic plasticity in cancer.

METHODS: Adults diagnosed with and prescribed oral oncolytics for chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, or multiple myeloma between 2013 and 2016 and with continuous eligibility six months before and after oral oncolytic initiation were identified from the Truven Health MarketScan databases. Among those identified, patients with pre-existing diabetes, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia with >/=1 fill for oral comorbid therapies were selected. Adherence to oral oncolytics and comorbid therapies was measured using the proportion of days covered metric. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests assessed changes in adherence for comorbid therapies after initiation of an oral oncolytic. Unadjusted difference-in-difference models assessed the impact of adherence to oral oncolytics on changes in adherence to comorbid therapies. RESULTS: Significant reductions in adherence after oncolytic initiation were observed across the comorbid therapies and were highest for patients taking lipid-lower agents (10.7-15.6%). Unadjusted difference-in-difference models revealed consistent and significantly lower reductions in adherence for those taking antihypertensives (chronic myeloid leukemia: p = 0.03; chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma: p = 0.007; multiple myeloma: p = 0.09) and adherent to oral oncolytics. CONCLUSION: Initiation of oral oncolytics may negatively impact adherence to oral therapies for chronic comorbid conditions, necessitating the need for medication management strategies to help patients adhere to their entire medication regimen.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic comorbid conditions', 'hematological cancers', 'medication adherence', 'oral oncolytics', 'retrospective analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome its resistance and adverse effects, new inhibitors of ABL kinase are needed. Our previous study showed that the benzyl ester of gypsogenin (1c), a pentacyclic triterpene, has anti-ABL kinase and a subsequent anti-CML activity. To optimize its activities, benzyl esters of carefully selected triterpenes (PT1-PT6), from different classes comprising oleanane, ursane and lupane, and new substituted benzyl esters of gypsogenin (GP1-GP5) were synthesized. All of the synthesized compounds were purified and charachterized by different spectroscopic methods. Cytotoxicity of the parent triterpenes and the synthesized compounds against CML cell line K562 was examined; revealing three promising compounds PT5, GP2 and GP5 (IC50 5.46, 4.78 and 3.19 muM, respectively). These compounds were shown to inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) downstream signaling, and induce apoptosis in K562 cells. Among them, PT5 was identified to have in vitro activity (IC50 = 1.44 muM) against ABL1 kinase, about sixfold of 1c, which was justified by molecular docking. The in vitro activities of GP2 and GP5 are less than PT5, hence they were supposed to possess other more mechanisms of cytotoxicity. In general, our design and derivatizations resulted in enhancing the activity against ABL1 kinase and CML cells.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABL kinase', 'apoptosis', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'gypsogenin', 'leukemia', 'pentacyclic triterpenes']",PMC6804044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 28.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of highly aggressive malignancies with a 5-year overall survival of less than 40%. Cell overgrowth with defective apoptosis is a hallmark of AML, but little is known about how it occurs. Here, we show that aberrant activation of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1) encoded by POLR2A gene is critically involved in this hallmark. We retrospectively analyzed the expression profiles of POLR2A and RPB1 in a panel of AML cell lines, primary AML patients and peripheral blood samples. Meanwhile, correlation analysis was used to explore the correlation between the expression of RPB1 with tumor burden and overall survival time in untreated AML samples. RNA-Seq approach was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes between RPB1 silencing AML cells with control cells after knocking out RPB1. Furthermore, orthotopic AML models were established with RPB1 silencing and control cells to investigate the effects of RPB1 protein level on leukemia cell growth. In most AML patients, RPB1 was aberrantly activated and closely associated with poor prognosis, but not in normal hematopoietic cells. Global transcriptomic analysis revealed that POLR2A knockout strongly impaired growth of AML cells by selectively depleting a substantial set of AML-related oncogenic and anti-apoptosis genes such as MYC, RUNX2, MEIS1, CDC25A and BCL-2. Silencing RPB1 by genetic technology led to a potent regression of human refractory AML in mouse models. These findings reveal that dysregulated RPB1 is a central oncogenic hub that drives overgrowth by hijacking an array of oncogenic and anti-apoptosis factors. Targeting RPB1 is a potential therapeutic for treating AML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The expression of Nur77 and HOXA10 has been shown to be reduced in the endometrium of patients with recurrent implantation failure. In this study, we found that Nur77 was directly bound to the HOXA10 promoter and promoted HOXA10 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner in Ishikawa cells. Furthermore, the promoting effect of Nur77 on embryo adhesion was significantly blocked when endogenous HOXA10 expression was knocked down in Ishikawa cells. Moreover, the Nur77 agonist 6-MP was also confirmed to promote embryo adhesion. This study is the first to show that Nur77 promotes embryo adhesion by transcriptionally regulating HOXA10 expression. Nur77 and 6-MP may provide a basis to develop a new treatment for patients who suffer from embryo adhesion dysfunction.Abbreviations: HB-EGF: heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor; HOXA10: homeobox A10; NGFI-B: nerve growth factor-induced gene B; RIF: recurrent implantation failure; RPL: recurrent pregnancy loss; 6-MP: 6-mercaptopurine; IGFBP-1: insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1; LIF: leukemia inhibitory factor; IL-1beta: Interleukin - 1beta; CRISPR/Cas9: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; AF-1: activation function-1 domain; HIF-1alpha: hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha; CREB: cAMP response element binding.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['6-MP', 'HOXA10', 'Nur77', 'embryo adhesion', 'embryo implantation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk factors for mortality after BSI and the contributions of BSI pathogens to mortality remain incompletely understood. We evaluated first BSI among adult neutropenic patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies in the setting of (a) an early disease stage of autologous (auto-HSCT) or allogeneic (allo-HSCT) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or (b) for acute leukemia. Risk factors for intensive care admission and all-cause mortality were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression 7 and 30 days after onset of the first BSI in the first neutropenic episode. Between 2002 and 2015, 9080 patients met the study inclusion criteria, and 1424 (16%) developed BSIs, most of them during the first week of neutropenia. Mortality during neutropenia within 7 days and 30 days after BSI onset was 2.5% and 5.1%, respectively, and differed considerably between BSI pathogens. Both 7-day and 30-day mortalities were highest for Pseudomonas aeruginosa BSI (16.7% and 26.7%, respectively) and lowest for BSI due to coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CoNS) and Streptococcus spp. BSI pathogens were independently associated with 7-day mortality included P aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., and enterococci. Only gram-negative BSI and candidemia were associated with admission to intensive care within 7 days after BSI onset.

Epub 2019 Oct 1.,"PURPOSE: Treatment outcomes for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved steadily, but a significant proportion of patients still experience relapse due to drug resistance, which is partly explained by inherited and/or somatic genetic alternations. Recently, we and others have identified genetic variants in the ARID5B gene associated with susceptibility to ALL and also with relapse. In this study, we sought to characterize the molecular pathway by which ARID5B affects antileukemic drug response in patients with ALL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed association of ARID5B expression in primary human ALL blasts with molecular subtypes and treatment outcome. Subsequent mechanistic studies were performed in ALL cell lines by manipulating ARID5B expression isogenically, in which we evaluated drug sensitivity, metabolism, and molecular signaling events. RESULTS: ARID5B expression varied substantially by ALL subtype, with the highest level being observed in hyperdiploid ALL. Lower ARID5B expression at diagnosis was associated with the risk of ALL relapse, and further reduction was noted at ALL relapse. In isogenic ALL cell models in vitro, ARID5B knockdown led to resistance specific to antimetabolite drugs (i.e., 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate), without significantly affecting sensitivity to other antileukemic agents. ARID5B downregulation significantly inhibited ALL cell proliferation and caused partial cell-cycle arrest.

Epub 2019 Oct 1.,"Decitabine is a DNA-hypomethylating agent that has been widely applied for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients who are elderly or unfit for intensive therapy. Although effective, the complete response rate to decitabine is only around 30% and the overall survival remains poor. Emerging data support that regulation of DNA methylation is critical to control immune cell development, differentiation and activation. We hypothesize that defining how decitabine influences the immune responses in AML will facilitate the development of novel immune-based leukaemia therapeutics. Here, we performed phenotypic and functional immune analysis on clinical samples from AML patients receiving decitabine treatment and demonstrated a significant impact of decitabine on the immune system. T-cell expression of inhibitory molecules was upregulated and the ability of CD8 T cells to produce cytokines was decreased upon decitabine treatment. Importantly, in an unbiased comprehensive analysis, we identified a unique immune signature containing a cluster of key immune markers that clearly separate patients who achieved complete remission after decitabine from those who failed to do so. Therefore, this immune signature has a strong predictive value for clinical response. Collectively, our study suggests that immune-based analyses may predict clinical response to decitabine and provide a therapeutic strategy to improve the treatment of AML.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Exercise assessments (EAs) are not a routine component of follow-up care. Methods: We incorporated a quantitative EA tool into the clinic triage during follow-up visits for survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The nursing staff was surveyed on the use of the EA tool to gauge understanding and level of comfort with addressing patient questions. Results: Over 27 months, the percentage of off-therapy acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with documented EA increased from 0% to 80%. We noted degradation in EA completions in the last 6 months of the project, which we attributed to project nursing staff transition and failure to maintain education. Interventions that improved the percentage of completed EA included the incorporation the assessment tool into the electronic medical record and weekly reminders of scheduled eligible patients. A nurse incentive plan did not impact project success. Survey results revealed that the nursing staff were comfortable with the EA and did not view the new process as hurting patient flow. Conclusion: Implementation of an EA tool into routine clinic follow-up was successful. We met the project goal of assessing greater than 50% of the follow-up patients. This work will serve as the foundation for the next phase of the project, which will be to provide education on the importance of exercise and earlier intervention when a sedentary lifestyle is identified.","['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

It is strongly dependent on epigenetic regulation for disease onset, maintenance and in response to treatment. Epigenetic regulation refers to the multiple chemical modifications of DNA or DNA-associated proteins that alter chromatin structure and DNA accessibility in a heritable manner, without changing DNA sequence. Unlike sequence-specific transcription factors, epigenetic regulators do not necessarily bind DNA at consensus sequences, but still achieve reproducible target binding in a manner that is cell and maturation-type specific. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic regulators rely, amongst other factors, on their interaction with untranslated RNA molecules for guidance to particular targets on DNA. Non (protein)-coding RNAs are the most abundant transcriptional products of the coding genome, and comprise several different classes of molecules with unique lengths, conformations and targets. Amongst these, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are species of 200 bp to >100 K bp in length, that recognize, and bind unique and largely uncharacterized DNA conformations. Some have been shown to bind epigenetic regulators, and thus constitute attractive candidates to mediate epigenetic target specificity. Herein, we postulate that lncRNAs are central players in the unique epigenetic programming of AML and review recent evidence in support of this view. We discuss the value of lncRNAs as putative diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets in myeloid leukemias and indicate novel directions in this exciting research field.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Wurm and Pina.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chromatin regulation', 'epigenetic therapies', 'long non-coding RNA', 'personalized medicine']",PMC6749032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this retrospective study conducted on ALL patient samples, the purpose was to estimate the copy number alterations (CNAs) in ALL by digitalMLPA (dMLPA), validation of the dMLPA data by conventional MLPA and RT-PCR, and correlation of CNAs with Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) status. The ALL patient samples (n = 151; B-ALL, n = 124 cases and T-ALL, n = 27 cases) were assessed for CNAs by dMLPA for detection of sub-microscopic CNAs and ploidy status. This assay allowed detection of ploidy changes and CNAs by multiplexing of karyotyping probes and probes covering 54 key gene targets implicated in ALL. Using the dMLPA assay, CNAs were detected in ~89% (n = 131) of the cases with 66% of the cases harboring >/=3 CNAs. Deletions in CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, and PAX5 genes were detectable in a quarter of these cases. Heterozygous and homozygous gene deletions, and duplications were observed in genes involved in cell cycle control, tumor suppression, lineage differentiation, lymphoid signaling, and transcriptional regulators with implications in treatment response and survival outcome. Distinct CNAs profiles were evident in B-ALL and T-ALL cases. Additionally, the dMLPA assay could reliably identify ploidy status and copy number-based gene fusions (SIL-TAL1, NUP214-ABL, EBF1-PDGFRB). Cases of B-ALL with no detectable recurrent genetic abnormalities could potentially be risk stratified based on the CNA profile. In addition to the commonly used gene deletions for risk assessment (IKZF1, EBF1, CDKN2A/B), we identified a broader spectrum of gene alterations (gains of- RUNX1, LEF1, NR3C2, PAR1, PHF6; deletions of- NF1, SUZ12, MTAP) that significantly correlated with the status of MRD clearance. The CNAs detected by dMLPA were validated by conventional MLPA and showed high concordance (r = 0.99). Our results demonstrated dMLPA to be a robust and reliable alternative for rapid detection of key CNAs in newly diagnosed ALL patients. Integration of ploidy status and CNAs detected by dMLPA with cytogenetic and clinical risk factors holds great potential in further refinement of patient risk stratification and response to treatment in ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Thakral, Kaur, Gupta, Benard-Slagter, Savola, Kumar, Anand,', 'Rani, Verma, Joshi, Kumar, Sharma, Bakhshi, Seth and Singh.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'CNAs', 'MLPA', 'MRD', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'copy number alterations', 'dMLPA', 'digital multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification']",PMC6753626,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of this study indicated that increased mutation rates in DNMT3A and FLT3-ITD may be associated with increased WBC and myeloid progenitor cell counts, an inferior chemotherapy efficacy and prognosis, a lower CR rate, and higher 1-year RR and mortality rate.","['Copyright (c) 2019, Spandidos Publications.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methyltransferase 3alpha', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'fms related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication', 'mutation rate', 'prognosis']",PMC6755468,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Aug 23.,"Introduction: This study was designed to investigate the roles of STAT3 and SMYD3 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the regulatory relationship between STAT3 and SMYD3 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Material and methods: The expression of STAT3 and SMYD3 was determined by RT-qPCR and western blot in chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples and cells (MEC1, CLL). Small interfering RNA was used to knock down the mRNA level of STAT3 and the pcDNA3.1-SMYD3 plasmid was used to construct a SMYD3 overexpression model. An MTT assay was performed to evaluate cell proliferation. A transwell assay was used to detect cell invasion ability. Afterwards, a luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment (ChIP assay) were applied to confirm the correlation between STAT3 and SMYD3. Results: STAT3 was highly expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia mononuclear cells and cancerous cell lines. STAT3 knockdown dramatically inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of SMYD3 in MEC1 and CLL cell lines. The luciferase reporter assay combined with the ChIP assay revealed that STAT3 bound to the promoter region of STAT3 and contributed to the transcription of SMYD3. Knockdown of STAT3 positively correlated with inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion abilities, while overexpression of SMYD3 negatively correlated with inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion. Conclusions: STAT3 may promote chronic lymphocytic leukemia progression through elevating SMYD3 expression. Targeting STAT3 and SMYD3 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",['Copyright: (c) 2018 Termedia & Banach.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['SMYD3', 'STAT3', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",PMC6764298,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is virtually impossible to consider this as a primary endpoint in clinical trials owing to the prolonged disease course. Therefore, development of surrogate markers that help predict the effectiveness of new interventions is essential. Currently, several candidate surrogate markers have been identified for HAM/TSP. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) is involved in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP and was shown to correlate with disease progression. However, it remains unclear whether changes in CSF CXCL10 levels are observed in response to treatment and whether these correlate with prognosis. Here we investigated several markers, including CSF CXCL10, in this respect. Data pertaining to patient characteristics and results of motor function evaluation and CSF examination of 13 HAM/TSP patients who received steroid treatment were retrospectively analyzed. Osame motor disability scores (OMDS), 10 m walking time, and CSF levels of CXCL10, neopterin, total protein, cell counts, and anti-HTLV-1 antibody titer were compared before and after steroid therapy. Levels of all CSF markers, with the exception of cell count, were significantly decreased after treatment. Nine of the 13 patients (69.2%) showed improvement in OMDS and were considered responders. Pre-treatment CSF levels of CXCL10 and anti-HTLV-1 antibody titer in responders were higher than those in non-responders (p = 0.020 and p = 0.045, respectively). Patients who continued low-dose oral prednisolone maintenance therapy after methylprednisolone pulse therapy showed sustained improvement in OMDS and CSF CXCL10 and neopterin levels lasting for 2 years. In contrast, OMDS and the CSF marker levels in patients who discontinued treatment returned to pre-treatment levels. This rebound phenomenon was also observed in patients who discontinued oral prednisolone therapy independently of pulse therapy. Our findings suggest that CSF CXCL10 may serve as a therapy-response and therapy-predictive marker for HAM/TSP. In addition, since decrease in CSF CXCL10 level was associated with good functional prognosis, CSF CXCL10 is a potential surrogate marker for treatment of HAM/TSP.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Tamaki, Sato, Tsugawa, Fujioka, Yagishita, Araya, Yamauchi,', 'Coler-Reilly, Nagasaka, Hasegawa, Yamano and Tsuboi.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CXCL10', 'HAM/TSP', 'HTLV-1', 'biomarker', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'neopterin']",PMC6749079,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many cases, a final diagnosis is not achieved due to different levels of awareness for the diagnosis of CDAs and lack of use of advanced diagnostic procedures. Researchers have identified five major types of CDA: types I, II, III, IV, and X-linked dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia (XLDAT). Proper management in CDA is still unsatisfactory, as the different subtypes of CDA have different genetic causes and different but overlapping patterns of signs and symptoms. For this reason, we developed a new telemedicine tool that will help doctors to achieve a faster diagnostic for this disease. Using open access code, we have created a responsive webpage named CoDysAn (Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia) that includes practical information for CDA awareness and a step-by-step diagnostic tool based on a CDA algorithm.

However, few reports have described L-OHP therapy in hemodialysis patients, and the efficacy and safety remain uncertain in this population. Here, we report three cases of hemodialysis patients with colorectal cancer who received a modified FOLFOX-6 (mFOLFOX-6, or FOLFOX plus folinic acid) plus BV regimen every 3 weeks. One patient, a 65-year-old man with chronic renal failure consequent to diabetic nephropathy, underwent hemodialysis 3 times/week. He exhibited a partial response after 7 cycles of mFOLFOX-6 plus BV, with the major adverse events of Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy and Grade 2 thrombocytopenia. He died of perforation-related septic shock. A 71-year-old man previously treated with bosutinib for chronic myelocytic leukemia received 9 cycles of mFOLFOX-6 plus BV and achieved stable disease. Chemotherapy was administered every 4 weeks, and the 5-fluorouracil dose was reduced after he developed Grade 4 neutropenia. A 71-year-old woman with chronic renal failure consequent to diabetic nephropathy underwent hemodialysis 3 times a week. She received 3 cycles of mFOLFOX-6 plus BV, but exhibited disease progression and developed Grade 4 neutropenia, which necessitated a reduced 5-fluorouracil dose. After completing FOLFOX therapy, she began second-line irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (FOLFIRI) plus BV therapy. In two cases, bone marrow suppression increased the difficulty of L-OHP dose escalation. We conclude that mFOLFOX-6 plus BV, with appropriate dose reduction, is acceptable for patients with chronic renal failure. Further data are needed to determine the adequate chemotherapy dose.","['Copyright (c) 2019 by S.

Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) have been shown to participate in the proliferation of cancer cells and progression of various cancers. However, the role of ADAR1 in AML has not been investigated. Patients and methods: We compared the expression levels of ADAR1 between samples obtained from different AML patients and controls using quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. We also investigated the functional role and possible mechanisms via silencing the expression of ADAR1 in vitro and in vivo. Results: We found that the mRNA and protein levels of ADAR1 were significantly higher in AML patients. The mRNA expression of ADAR1 was positively correlated with the ratio of leukemic cells. Additionally, silencing of ADAR1 expression significantly suppressed the proliferation of AML cells and induced G0/1 arrest. For the analysis of the mechanism, the quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting results revealed that ADAR1 knockdown resulted in the decreased expression of Wingless-Int (Wnt) effectors including beta-catenin, c-Myc, transcription factor 4, and cyclin D2. In the nude mouse model, inhibition of ADAR1 expression reduced the tumorigenic potential and decreased the expression o]f Wnt effectors.

Epub 2019 Sep 30.,"Indolent T lymphoblastic proliferations have been reported rarely in extramedullary and extrathymic tissues. Recent work has identified these indolent T lymphoblast populations to be mostly CD4+/CD8+ (characterized by immunohistochemistry), with only limited immunophenotypic evaluation of these populations by flow cytometry (FC). We retrospectively reviewed our institutional FC archives and identified 12 samples from 10 patients with incidental T lymphoblastic populations. Samples were characterized with respect to expression of T-cell antigens, CD45, TdT, CD1a, and T/NK antigens, and light scatter properties. Overall, the proportion of T lymphoblasts was small (range 0.01-8.8% of white cells; mean, 1.7%). Histologic correlation showed scattered immature T lymphoblasts in samples without overt distortion of underlying architecture. T lymphoblasts were identified most frequently in association with Castleman disease (four) or tissues with Castleman features (four), marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (one), or tissue with reactive/atypical changes (three cases). Although three cases were composed predominantly of CD4+/CD8+ T cells, the majority of cases in our cohort (eight) included a major subset of CD4-/CD8- T lymphoblasts by FC (one case CD8+/CD4-), which has not been described previously. There was no evidence of subsequent progression to T lymphoblastic leukemia. Incidental, indolent T lymphoblastic proliferations may be detected by clinical FC. In contrast to reports, we find that these proliferations in clinical samples may contain not only CD4+/CD8+ immature T cells but also CD4-/CD8- immature T cells, expanding the immunophenotypic spectrum of this entity.",['(c) 2019 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*Castleman disease', '*flow cytometry', '*hematopathology', '*immature T cells', '*indolent immature T-cell proliferation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 21.,"Minimal residual disease (MRD) tracking, by next generation sequencing of immunoglobulin sequences, is moving towards clinical implementation in multiple myeloma. However, there is only sparse information available to address whether clonal sequences remain stable for tracking over time, and to what extent light chain sequences are sufficiently unique for tracking. Here, we analyzed immunoglobulin repertoires from 905 plasma cell myeloma and healthy control samples, focusing on the third complementarity determining region (CDR3). Clonal heavy and/or light chain expression was identified in all patients at baseline, with one or more subclones related to the main clone in 3.2%. In 45 patients with 101 sequential samples, the dominant clonal CDR3 sequences remained identical over time, despite differential clonal evolution by whole exome sequencing in 49% of patients. The low frequency of subclonal CDR3 variants, and absence of evolution over time in active multiple myeloma, indicates that tumor cells at this stage are not under selective pressure to undergo antibody affinity maturation. Next, we establish somatic hypermutation and non-templated insertions as the most important determinants of light chain clonal uniqueness, identifying a potentially trackable sequence in the majority of patients. Taken together, we show that dominant clonal sequences identified at baseline are reliable biomarkers for long-term tracking of the malignant clone, including both IGH and the majority of light chain clones.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation/International']",,,PMC7449571,,['NIHMS1614219'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its remarkable clinical effects, this therapy has side effects that cannot be underestimated. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is one of the most clinically important and potentially life-threatening toxicities. This syndrome is a systemic immune storm that involves the mass cytokines releasing by activated immune cells. This phenomenon causes multisystem damages and sometimes even death. In this study, we reported the management of a patient with recurrent and refractory multiple myeloma and three patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia who suffered CRS during CAR-T treatment. The early application of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, according to toxicity grading and clinical manifestation is recommended especially for patients who suffer continuous hyperpyrexia, hypotensive shock, acute respiratory failure, and whose CRS toxicities deteriorated rapidly.

Epub 2019 Oct 1.,"Oncogene addiction postulates that the survival and growth of certain tumor cells is dependent upon the activity of one oncogene, despite their multiple genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. This phenomenon provides a foundation for molecular targeted therapy and a rationale for oncogene-based stratification. We have previously reported that the Promyelocytic Leukemia protein (PML) is upregulated in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and it regulates cancer-initiating cell function, thus suggesting that this protein can be therapeutically targeted in combination with PML-based stratification. However, the effects of PML perturbation on the bulk of tumor cells remained poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that TNBC cells are addicted to the expression of this nuclear protein. PML inhibition led to a remarkable growth arrest combined with features of senescence in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the growth arrest and senescence were associated to a decrease in MYC and PIM1 kinase levels, with the subsequent accumulation of CDKN1B (p27), a trigger of senescence. In line with this notion, we found that PML is associated to the promoter regions of MYC and PIM1, consistent with their direct correlation in breast cancer specimens. Altogether, our results provide a feasible explanation for the functional similarities of MYC, PIM1, and PML in TNBC and encourage further study of PML targeting strategies for the treatment of this breast cancer subtype.",,"['336343/ERC_/European Research Council/International', '683136/ERC_/European Research Council/International']",,,PMC7104349,,['EMS83797'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis induces cell death through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is considered an irreversible step in apoptosis. Activation of MOMP to levels that fail to reach the apoptotic threshold may paradoxically promote cancer-a phenomenon called ""Minority MOMP."" We asked whether reflux-induced esophageal carcinogenesis occurred via minority MOMP and whether compensatory resistance mechanisms prevented cell death during this process. We exposed preneoplastic, hTERT-immortalized Barrett's cell, CP-C and CP-A, to the oncogenic bile acid, deoxycholic acid (DCA), for 1 year. Induction of minority MOMP was tested via comet assay, CyQuant, annexin V, JC-1, cytochrome C subcellular localization, caspase 3 activation, and immunoblots. We used bcl-2 homology domain-3 (BH3) profiling to test the mitochondrial apoptotic threshold. One-year exposure of Barrett's cells to DCA induced a malignant phenotype noted by clone and tumor formation. DCA promoted minority MOMP noted by minimal release of cytochrome C and limited caspase 3 activation, which resulted in DNA damage without apoptosis. Upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein, Mcl-1, ROS generation, and NF-kappaB activation occurred in conjunction with minority MOMP. Inhibition of ROS blocked minority MOMP and Mcl-1 upregulation. Knockdown of Mcl-1 shifted minority MOMP to complete MOMP as noted by dynamic BH3 profiling and increased apoptosis. Minority MOMP contributes to DCA induced carcinogenesis in preneoplastic BE. Mcl-1 provided a balance within the mitochondria that induced resistance complete MOMP and cell death.

Epub 2019 Sep 30.,"Bone marrow aspirate (BMA) differential cell counts (DCCs) are critical for the classification of hematologic disorders. While manual counts are considered the gold standard, they are labor intensive, time consuming, and subject to bias. A reliable automated counter has yet to be developed, largely due to the inherent complexity of bone marrow specimens. Digital pathology imaging coupled with machine learning algorithms represents a highly promising emerging technology for this purpose. Yet, training datasets for BMA cellular constituents, critical for building and validating machine learning algorithms, are lacking. Herein, we report our experience creating and employing such datasets to develop a machine learning algorithm to detect and classify BMA cells. Utilizing a web-based system that we developed for annotating and managing digital pathology images, over 10,000 cells from scanned whole slide images of BMA smears were manually annotated, including all classes that comprise the standard clinical DCC. We implemented a two-stage, detection and classification approach that allows design flexibility and improved classification accuracy. In a sixfold cross-validation, our algorithms achieved high overall accuracy in detection (0.959 +/- 0.008 precision-recall AUC) and classification (0.982 +/- 0.03 ROC AUC) using nonneoplastic samples. Testing on a small set of acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma samples demonstrated similar detection and classification performance. In summary, our algorithms showed promising early results and represent an important initial step in the effort to devise a reliable, objective method to automate DCCs. With further development to include formal clinical validation, such a system has the potential to assist in disease diagnosis and prognosis, and significantly impact clinical practice.",,"['U01 CA220401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA194362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6920560,,['NIHMS1539236'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because geranylgeranylated Rab proteins regulate Notch processing, we hypothesized that inhibition of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS) would impair Notch processing and reduce viability of T-ALL cells that express Notch. Here, we show that GGDPS inhibition reduces Notch1 expression and impairs the proliferation of T-ALL cells. GGDPS inhibition also reduces Rab7 membrane association and depletes Notch1 mRNA. GGDPS inhibition increases phosphorylation of histone H2A.X, and inhibitors of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM) mitigate GGDPS inhibitor-induced apoptosis. GGDPS inhibition also influences c-abl activity downstream of caspases, and inhibitors of these enzymes prevent GGDPS inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Surprisingly, induction of apoptosis by GGDPS inhibition is reduced by co-treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitors. While inhibitors of gamma-secretase deplete one specific form of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), they also increase Notch1 mRNA expression and increase alternate forms of Notch1 protein expression in cells treated with a GGDPS inhibitor. Furthermore, inhibitors of gamma-secretase and ATM increase Notch1 mRNA stability independent of GGDPS inhibition. These results provide a model by which T-ALL cells use Notch1 to avoid DNA-damage-induced apoptosis, and can be overcome by inhibition of GGDPS through effects on Notch1 expression and its subsequent response.",,,,,PMC6768865,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 30.,"Regulating B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling after antigenic stimulation is essential to properly control immune responses. Currently known mechanisms of inhibiting BCR signaling are via co-receptor stimulation and downstream immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) phosphorylation. Herein we demonstrate that BCR stimulation induces rapid and reversible palmitoylation of the SCF-FBXO10 ubiquitin E3 ligase. This results in FBXO10 relocation to the cell membrane, where it targets the human germinal center-associated lymphoma (HGAL) protein for ubiquitylation and degradation, leading to decreases in both BCR-induced calcium influx and phosphorylation of proximal BCR effectors. Importantly, FBXO10 recognition and degradation of HGAL is phosphorylation independent and instead relies on a single evolutionarily conserved HGAL amino acid residue (H91) and FBXO10 relocalization to the cytoplasmic membrane. Together our findings demonstrate the first evidence of negative BCR signaling regulation from direct BCR stimulation and define the temporospatial functions of the FBXO10-HGAL axis. FBXO10 is infrequently mutated in DLBCL but some of these mutations deregulate BCR signaling. These observations may have important implications on lymphomagenesis and other immune processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differences in risk for SPMs among CLL survivors from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (1973-2015) were compared to risk of individual malignancies expected in the general population. In ~270,000 person-year follow-up, 6487 new SPMs were diagnosed with a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.2 (95% CI:1.17-1.23). The higher risk was for both solid (SIR 1.15; 95% CI:1.12-1.18) and hematological malignancies (SIR 1.61; 95% CI:1.5-1.73). The highest risk for SPMs was noted between 2 and 5 months after CLL diagnosis (SIR 1.57; 95% CI:1.41-1.74) and for CLL patients between 50- and 79-years-old. There was a significant increase in SPMs in years 2003-2015 (SIR 1.36; 95% CI:1.3-1.42) as compared to 1973-1982 (SIR 1.19; 95% CI:1.12-1.26). The risk of SPMs was higher in CLL patients who had received prior chemotherapy (SIR 1.38 95% CI:1.31-1.44) as compared to those untreated/treatment status unknown (SIR 1.16, 95% CI:1.13-1.19, p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the hazard of developing SPMs was higher among men, post-chemotherapy, recent years of diagnosis, advanced age, and non-Whites. Active survivorship plans and long-term surveillance for SPMs is crucial for improved outcomes of patients with a history of CLL.",,['U54 GM104942/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC6768881,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have identified the molecular events that lead to stromal cells mediated therapy-resistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our work demonstrates that stromal cells downregulate miR-23a-5p levels in leukemic cells to protect them from the chemotherapy induced apoptosis. Downregulation of miR-23a-5p in leukemic cells leads to upregulation of protective autophagy by targeting TLR2 expression. Further, autophagy inhibitors when used as adjuvants along with conventional drugs can improve drug sensitivity in vitro as well in vivo in a mouse model of leukemia. Our work also demonstrates that this mechanism of bone marrow stromal cell mediated regulation of miR-23a-5p levels and subsequent molecular events are relevant predominantly in myeloid leukemia. Our results illustrate the critical and dynamic role of the bone marrow microenvironment in modulating miRNA expression in leukemic cells which could contribute significantly to drug resistance and subsequent relapse, possibly through persistence of minimal residual disease in this environment.",,"['IA/S/15/1/501842/DBT-Wellcome Trust India Alliance/India', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,PMC6769009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 30.,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-15 play pivotal roles in T cell activation, apoptosis, and survival, and are implicated in leukemias and autoimmune diseases. Their heterotrimeric receptors share their beta- and gammac-chains, but have distinct alpha-chains. Anti-IL-2Ralpha (daclizumab) therapy targeting cell surface-expressed receptor subunits to inhibit T cell proliferation has only brought limited success in adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and in multiple sclerosis. We asked whether IL-2R subunits could already preassemble and signal efficiently in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. A combination of daclizumab and anti-IL-2 efficiently blocked IL-2-induced proliferation of IL-2-dependent wild-type (WT) ATL cells but not cells transfected with IL-2, suggesting that in IL-2-producing cells signaling may already take place before receptors reach the cell surface. In the Golgi fraction isolated from IL-2-producing ATL cells, we detected by Western blot phosphorylated Jak1, Jak3, and a phosphotyrosine signal attributed to the gammac-chain, which occurred at much lower levels in the Golgi of WT ATL cells. We expressed EGFP- and mCherry-tagged receptor chains in HeLa cells to study their assembly along the secretory pathway. Confocal microscopy, Forster resonance energy transfer, and imaging fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy analysis revealed partial colocalization and molecular association of IL-2 (and IL-15) receptor chains in the ER/Golgi, which became more complete in the plasma membrane, further confirming our hypothesis. Our results define a paradigm of intracellular autocrine signaling and may explain resistance to antagonistic antibody therapies targeting receptors at the cell surface.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Forster resonance energy transfer', '*IL-2/15 receptor preassembly', '*adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma', '*antiproliferative antibody therapy', '*autocrine signaling']",PMC6800387,['The authors declare no competing interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a multicenter phase 2 prospective 24-week study in 18 patients with ITP secondary to LPDs to assess the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag. Responsive patients entered an extension study for up to 5 years. For inclusion, patients should not require cytotoxic treatment and should have a platelet count <30 x 109/L or have symptoms of bleeding. Eltrombopag was initiated at 50 mg/day, with a maximum of 150 mg/day. The primary end point was platelet response after 4 weeks. Median age was 70 years (range, 43-83 years), and 14 patients had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 2 had classic Hodgkin lymphoma, and 2 had Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. All patients had received previous ITP treatments. Response rate at week 4 was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58%-97%), with 50% of patients having a complete response (CR) (95% CI, 43%-57%); respective results at week 24 were 59% (95% CI, 36%-82%) with 30% reaching a CR (95% CI, 8%-52%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of programmed-death 1 (PD1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) was determined by flow cytometry on peripheral alphabeta(+) and gammadelta(+) T-cells from patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=9) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=12), and from healthy volunteers (n=7). The expression of programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1), B7-1, B7-2, human leukocyte antigen-ABC (HLA-ABC), and herpesvirus-entry mediator (HVEM) ligands was determined on leukemia blasts. RESULTS: PD1 expression on alphabeta(+) and gammadelta(+) T-cells was significantly higher in patients with ALL than in those with AML (p=0.0019 and 0.0239, respectively). CTLA-4 expression was moderately higher on alphabeta(+) and gammadelta(+) T-cells in ALL (p=0.077 and 0.077, respectively), whereas HLA-ABC expression was significantly higher in AML blast cells (p=0.0182). The expression of CTLA-4 on gammadelta(+) T-cells and the B7-2 ligand on blasts was higher in patients with high-risk ALL (p=0.02 and 0.02, respectively). In AML, PD1 expression on alphabeta(+) T-cells was higher in the intermediate-risk group (p=0.05), whereas HVEM expression was significantly higher in the low-risk group (p=0.02). Expression of CTLA-4 on gammadelta+ T-cells and PD-L1 on blasts were both associated with poor relapse-free survival outcomes in ALL (p=0.049). CONCLUSION: The higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules, in particular, CTLA-4 and PD-L1 are associated with a poorer prognosis in ALL, suggesting that selective use of the immune checkpoint blockade might improve the clinical outcomes in patients with ALL.","['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Immune checkpoint receptor', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'childhood acute leukemia', 'ligand', 'prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disseminated fusariosis developing during the course of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a critical condition, and there have been few reports of successful treatment of cases complicated with fusariosis before HSCT. Here, we present a case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the development of fungal endophthalmitis during chemotherapy. Vitrectomy was performed and Fusarium solani infection was confirmed by vitreal culture. The infection was also disseminated to the lung, triceps, and spleen. The splenic lesions disappeared with the administration of antifungal agents, and residual lesions in the lung and triceps were surgically resected. After two courses of consolidation chemotherapy, the patient received cord blood transplantation (CBT) twice because of graft failure in the first transplantation. Antifungal agents were administered continuously during chemotherapy and transplantation. Although Fusarium sinusitis developed after neutrophil engraftment, it was well controlled by surgical resection. Thereafter, the patient has been well without recurrence of fusariosis for more than 2 years since transplantation. A combination of continuous administration of antifungal agents and vigorous surgical intervention may be important for management of disseminated fusariosis in the setting of HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association', 'for Infectious Diseases.

Epub 2019 Aug 1.,"Renal function declines with aging and is pathologically characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Renal senescence is induced not only by aging but also by various stimuli, including ischemia reperfusion injury. Recently, the accumulation of p16(INK4a)-positive cells in the kidney has been considered a molecular feature of renal senescence, with the p16(INK4a) gene reportedly regulated by mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1)/WD-40 repeat protein 5 (WDR5)-mediated histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Here, we determined whether inhibition of MLL1/WDR5 activity attenuates renal senescence, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice with ischemia reperfusion injury and in cultured rat renal fibroblasts. MM-102 or OICR-9429, both MLL1/WDR5 protein-protein interaction inhibitors, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) for MLL1 or WDR5 suppressed the expression of p16(INK4a) in mice with ischemia reperfusion injury, accompanied by downregulation of H3K4me3 expression. MM-102 attenuated renal fibrosis and inflammation in the kidney of mice with ischemia reperfusion injury. Moreover, in vitro study showed that transforming growth factor-beta1 induced the expression of MLL1, WDR5, H3K4me3, and p16(INK4a). Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation identified the p16(INK4a) promoter at an H3K4me3 site in renal fibroblasts. Thus, our findings show that H3K4me3 inhibition ameliorates ischemia reperfusion-induced renal senescence along with fibrosis and inflammation.","['Copyright (c) 2019 International Society of Nephrology.

Nevertheless, LSC are responsible for managing all the hierarchy of the bulk of leukemic blast populations. This mini-review provides brief information on the distinctive features of LSC and blast cells in cytologically recognized types of AML. The study of different phenotypes of LSC and blast cells in AML with the aid of up-to-date flow cytometric techniques is important both for the deep insight into the mechanisms of leukemogenesis and development of novel strategies of target therapy. The urgent need for extending the diagnostic panel of monoclonal antibodies used for diagnosing AML is beyond doubt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to analyze the role of postoperative treatment for BC in the development of subsequent HM. Using the French National Health Data System, we examined the HM risks in patients diagnosed with an incident primary breast cancer between 2007 and 2015, who underwent surgery as first-line treatment for BC. Main outcomes were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), multiple myeloma (MM), Hodgkin's lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL/NHL), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphocytic lymphoma (ALL/LL). Analyses were censored at HM occurrence, death, loss to follow up, or December 2017. The risk of each type of HM was compared according to the initial postoperative treatment of breast cancer. Of a total of 324,056 BC survivors, 15.5% underwent surgery only, 46.7% received radiotherapy after surgery, 4.3% received chemotherapy after surgery, and 33.5% received all three modalities. Overall, 2236 cases of hematologic malignancies occurred. Compared to the surgery alone group, AML was significantly increased after surgery plus radiation (aHR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1), surgery plus chemotherapy (aHR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.6) and all modalities (aHR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.3-4.7). MDS was significantly increased after surgery plus chemotherapy (aHR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5) or after all modalities (aHR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8). HL/NHL were significantly increased only in the radiotherapy and surgery group (aHR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6). A nonsignificant increase of ALL/LL (aHR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.6-3.5) was noted after chemotherapy and with all three modalities (aHR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.7-2.8).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: THP-1 cells were treated with noncytotoxic concentrations of MSE combined with 1 microg/mL of P. gingivalis LPS. The mRNA levels of MMP-1, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 were evaluated via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The secreted proteins in the culture media were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The degradation of inhibitor of kappa B-alpha (IkappaBalpha) protein was tracked by Western blotting. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Comparisons in experiments were analyzed with analysis of variance followed by Tukey honestly significant difference comparison test. RESULTS: Twenty and 40 microg/mL of MSE significantly downregulated MMP-1 and MMP-9 genes and protein expression but upregulated the gene expression of TIMP-1 (p < 0.05). P. gingivalis LPS induced degradation of IkappaBalpha, while addition of MSE (20 and 40 microg/mL) increased IkappaBalpha cytosolic levels.

Rats were randomized to control and L-carnitine supplemented (LCAR) groups. Control group received distilled water for 7 months by intragastric gavage and the LCAR group was given 50mg/kg/day L-carnitine via intragastric intubation for the same period. L-carnitine concentrations and caspase-3 activity were measured by fluorometric methods while cleaved caspase-3 was determined by Western blot analysis. Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) were quantified by enzyme immunoassay and Western blot analysis. Oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were analyzed by colorimetric assay. Tissue L-carnitine concentrations were significantly increased in the LCAR group compared to controls. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 levels were significantly increased while pro-apoptotic Bax was significantly decreased in LCAR group rats compared to controls. Tissue caspase-3 was significantly alleviated in the LCAR group compared to controls. L-carnitine supplementation increased TAC and decreased ROS/RNS generation in the kidney, liver, stomach and testis tissues compared to controls. Obtained data suggests that L-carnitine supplementation can potentially be used to lessen both oxidative and apoptotic progression in peripheral organs.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 Sep 30.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may hold crucial triggers of the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies, while the studies evaluating the expression pattern of lncRNA in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are few. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the implication of lncRNA expression pattern in AML development and progression. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from four AML patients and four controls were subjected to lncRNA sequencing. Then, bone marrow samples from 110 AML patients and 40 controls were proposed to real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) validation for 10 candidate lncRNAs. Clinical data and survival profiles were recorded in AML patients. Furthermore, lncRNA RP4-576H24.2 expression in AML cell lines and its effect on AML cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected. RESULTS: LncRNA expression pattern by sequencing clearly distinguished AML patients from controls, and 630 upregulated and 621 downregulated lncRNAs were identified in AML patients compared to controls, which were mainly enriched in AML oncogene-related biological process and pathways (such as neutrophil degranulation, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and hematopoietic cell lineage). RT-qPCR validation observed that six lncRNAs correlated with AML risk, one lncRNA associated with risk stratification, and three lncRNAs correlated with survivals, among which lncRNA RP4-576H24.2 was the only one correlated with AML susceptibility, risk stratification, and survivals. Further in vitro experiments showed that lncRNA RP4-576H24.2 was upregulated in AML cell lines compared to normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs), and promoted proliferation while inhibited apoptosis in HL-60 and KG-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA expression pattern is closely involved in the development and progression of AML, and several specific lncRNAs exhibit potential to be biomarkers for AML risk and prognosis. Besides, lncRNA RP4-576H24.2 might be a potential oncogene in AML pathogenesis.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Subcellular origin and biological function as well as prognostic impact are currently unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether vacuolization correlates with clinically relevant AML features. MATERIALS & METHODS: Bone marrow smears of patients diagnosed with AML at the University Hospital Frankfurt between January 2011 and August 2013 were analyzed for blast vacuolization and correlated with clinically relevant AML features. Patients undergoing standard induction chemotherapy were further analyzed for molecular and cytogenetic features as well as treatment response and survival. RESULTS: 14 of 100 patients diagnosed with AML receiving standard induction chemotherapy had evidence of blast vacuolization. Positivity for vacuolization correlated with a CD15 positive immunophenotype and with a higher incidence of high-risk AML according to the European LeukemiaNet risk stratification. AML patients with blast vacuolization had a poor blast clearance after standard induction chemotherapy and poor survival. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that vacuolization can easily be determined in myeloid leukemia blasts and may be a useful biomarker to predict AML risk groups as well as early treatment response rates and survival.",,,,,PMC6768541,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the ability of CMV-based vectors to mediate protection by other immune mechanisms, we evaluated a mouse CMV (MCMV)-based vector encoding Friend virus (FV) envelope (Env), which lacks any known CD8+ T cell epitopes, for its protective efficacy in the FV mouse model. When we immunized highly FV-susceptible mice with the Env-encoding MCMV vector (MCMV.env), we could detect high frequencies of Env-specific CD4+ T cells after a single immunization. While the control of an early FV challenge infection was highly variable, an FV infection applied later after immunization was tightly controlled by almost all immunized mice. Protection of mice correlated with their ability to mount a robust anamnestic neutralizing antibody response upon FV infection, but Env-specific CD4+ T cells also produced appreciable levels of interferon gamma. Depletion and transfer experiments underlined the important role of antibodies for control of FV infection but also showed that while no Env-specific CD8+ T cells were induced by the MCMV.env vaccine, the presence of CD8+ T cells at the time of FV challenge was required. The immunity induced by MCMV.env immunization was long-lasting, but was restricted to MCMV naive animals. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel mode of action of a CMV-based vaccine for anti-retrovirus immunization that confers strong protection from retrovirus challenge, which is conferred by CD4+ T cells and antibodies.",,,,,PMC6786657,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of this study were to present the cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) levels of survivors detailed overview sedentary activities portrait. METHODS: A total of 247 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors were included in our study. Survivors underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test on ergocycle and completed physical activity and sedentary questionnaires to assess their leisure physical and sedentary activities and total daily energy expenditure. RESULTS: Up to 67% of survivors (84% below 18 y and 60% 18 y of age or above) did not fulfill the physical activity guidelines. Their CRF was reduced by almost 16% in regard to their predicted maximum oxygen consumption (VO2peak). Almost three quarters of the survivors (70% below 18 y and 76% 18 y of age or above) spent >2 hours/day in leisure sedentary activities. Adult survivors who received high doses of anthracyclines and those who received radiation therapy had decreased odds to spend >/=2 hours/day in sedentary activities. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that survivors, especially children, were not active enough and had a reduced CRF. This study highlights the importance of promoting physical activity in survivors, especially because they are exposed to an increased risk of chronic health problems, which could be mitigated by physical activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, IHC is an accessible and relatively inexpensive test and one that can be performed quite quickly. This is in sharp contrast to genomic or mutational testing methodologies that are routinely ""send out"" tests as they require specialized equipment and reagents as well as individuals with expertise in the performance of the tests and analysis of the results, resulting in a prolonged turn-round-time and enhanced associated costs. However, many open questions remain in a rapidly changing therapeutic and scientific landscape with most obvious one being what exactly is the utility of ""good old fashioned"" IHC in the age of targeted therapy? For molecular applications, is a negative immunohistochemical result enough as a stand-alone diagnostic or predictive product? Is a positive immunohistochemical result perhaps more suitable for a role in screening for molecular alterations rather than a definitive testing modality? This review is an attempt to answer those very questions. We elucidate the broad range of entities in which IHC is currently used as a molecular surrogate and underscore pearls and pitfalls associated with each. Special attention is given to entities for which targeted therapies are currently available and to entities in which molecular data is of clinical utility as a prognosticator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Aug 6.,"Life threatening diseases like adult T-cell leukemia, neurodegenerative diseases, and demyelinating diseases such as HTLV-1 based myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), hypocalcaemia, and bone lesions are caused by a group of human retrovirus known as Human T-cell Lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Out of the four different types of HTLVs, HTLV-1 is most prominent in scourging over 20 million people around the world and still not much effort has been made in understanding the epidemiology and controlling the prevalence of this virus. This condition further worsens when most of the infected cases remain asymptomatic throughout their lifetime due to the limited diagnostic methods; that are most of the times unavailable for timely detection of infected individuals. Moreover, at present, there is no licensed vaccination for HTLV-1 infection. Therefore, there is a need to develop the faster and efficient diagnostic method for the detection of HTLV-1. Influenced from the outcomes of the machine learning techniques in the field of bio-informatics, this is the first study in which 64 hybrid machine learning techniques have been proposed for the prediction of different type of HTLVs (HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3). The hybrid techniques are built by permutation and combination of four classification methods, four feature weighting, and four feature selection techniques. The proposed hybrid models when evaluated on the basis of various model evaluation parameters are found to be capable of efficiently predicting the type of HTLVs. The best hybrid model has been identified by having accuracy, an AUROC value, and F1 score of 99.85 percent, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. This kind of the system can assist the current diagnostic system for the detection of HTLV-1 as after the molecular diagnostics of HTLV by various screening tests like enzyme-linked immunoassay or particle agglutination assays there is always a need of confirmatory tests like western blotting, immuno-fluorescence assay, or radio-immuno-precipitation assay for distinguishing HTLV-1 from HTLV-2. These confirmatory tests are indeed very complex analytical techniques involving various steps. The proposed hybrid techniques can be used to support and verify the results of confirmatory test from the protein mixture. Furthermore, better insights about the virus can be obtained by exploring the physicochemical properties of the protein sequences of HTLVs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 29.,"BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections commonly occur in acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy. In these patients with acute leukemia, posaconazole prophylaxis is recommended; however, voriconazole may be a less costly alternative. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of voriconazole prophylaxis in acute leukemia patients. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of inpatients at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre between 2005 and 2017 was completed. Hospitalized adult acute leukemia patients who received voriconazole prophylaxis (cases) were compared to patients who received fluconazole or no prophylaxis during chemotherapy (controls). Statistical analyses comparing baseline characteristics, safety, and efficacy outcomes between the study cohorts were completed. A posaconazole literature-based weighted mean risk was compared to the voriconazole risk of invasive fungal infection identified in this study. RESULTS: Of 490 acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, 83 controls and 92 cases were eligible. Case patients received an average of 24.4 +/- 10.8 days of voriconazole prophylaxis. The incidence of proven or probable invasive fungal infections with voriconazole was 3.3% (3/92) versus 7.2% (6/83) in the control cohort (p > 0.05) and was comparable to the literature reported weighted incidence of invasive fungal infection with posaconazole (2.4 +/- 2.1%; 95% CI 1.3%-3.4%; p > 0.05). Voriconazole was well tolerated by patients (91%; 84/91; seven discontinued due to asymptomatic elevated liver function tests). CONCLUSIONS: Voriconazole prophylaxis was found to be safe, effective, and comparable to literature-based efficacy data for risk of invasive fungal infection with posaconazole antifungal prophylaxis in patients with acute leukemia undergoing chemotherapy and could represent a significant cost advantage.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Voriconazole', 'antifungal prophylaxis', 'chemotherapy', 'leukemia', 'posaconazole']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 30.,"Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor. Slowly dividing and therapy-resistant glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) reside in protective peri-arteriolar niches and are held responsible for glioblastoma recurrence. Recently, we showed similarities between GSC niches and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niches in bone marrow. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells hijack HSC niches and are transformed into therapy-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Current clinical trials are focussed on removal of LSCs out of HSC niches to differentiate and to become sensitized to chemotherapy. In the present study, we elaborated further on these similarities by immunohistochemical analyses of 17 biomarkers in paraffin sections of human glioblastoma and human bone marrow. We found all 17 biomarkers to be expressed both in hypoxic peri-arteriolar HSC niches in bone marrow and hypoxic peri-arteriolar GSC niches in glioblastoma. Our findings implicate that GSC niches are being formed in glioblastoma as a copy of HSC niches in bone marrow. These similarities between HSC niches and GSC niches provide a theoretic basis for the development of novel strategies to force GSCs out of their niches, in a similar manner as in AML, to induce GSC differentiation and proliferation to render them more sensitive to anti-glioblastoma therapies.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*bone marrow', '*glioblastoma', '*glioblastoma stem cells', '*hematopoietic progenitor cells', '*hematopoietic stem cells', '*immunohistochemistry', '*niches']",PMC6931169,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 14.,"Introduction: Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) is an anti-apoptotic member of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family of proteins that regulates apoptosis. Elevated levels of MCL-1 contribute to tumorigenesis and resistance, not only to conventional chemotherapies but also to targeted therapies, including the BCL-2 selective inhibitor venetoclax. Accordingly, researchers in both the pharmaceutical industry and academia have been actively seeking MCL-1 inhibitors in the quest for new anti-cancer drugs. Areas covered: This review covers the patent literature on the discovery and development of small-molecule inhibitors of MCL-1 since 2017. Expert opinion: Pharmacologic inhibition of MCL-1's oncogenic activity has certainly come of age with the discovery of numerous inhibitors spanning a variety of chemotypes that selectively inhibit MCL-1 in the picomolar range and with on-target cell activity. Furthermore, seminal research by Servier has demonstrated for the first time that MCL-1 inhibition is tolerable in animal models of cancer, paving the way for the six Phase 1 clinical trials that are currently underway for hematological malignancies, among other cancers. After more than a decade of research, the hurdles and obstacles are mostly behind us, and uncovering the therapeutic impact of disrupting the protein-protein interactions of MCL-1 in humans is imminent.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'MCL-1 inhibitors', 'cancer', 'protein-protein interactions']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Junduqing extractive was prepared. CCK-8 assay found that IC50 of Junduqing extractive in HNE-1 cells was 2.99 mg/ml, so its concentration of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mg/ml was selected to perform the following experiments. HNE-1, HNE-2 and HONE1 cells were then divided into four groups: (1) Control (no treatment); (2) 1.0 mg/ml (1.0 mg/ml Junduqing); (3) 2.0 mg/ml (2.0 mg/ml Junduqing) and (4) 3.0 mg/ml (3.0 mg/ml Junduqing). Cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were examined by CCK-8 assay, annexin V-FITC/PI staining, scratch wound assay and transwell assay, respectively. Compared with the control group, the viability, migration rates and invasive capacity of HNE-1, HNE-2 and HONE1 cells with Junduqing treatments decreased significantly. Higher concentration of Junduqing extractive caused lower viability, smaller migration rates and weaker invasive capacity. Compared with the control group, the apoptosis of HNE-1, HNE-2 and HONE1 cells after treatment with 2.0 and 3.0 mg/ml of Junduqing extractive increased remarkably. Levels of Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 were examined by western blotting. Compared with the control group, the expression of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 and the expression of Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 in HNE-1, HNE-2 and HONE1 cells were significantly down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively, after treatment with Junduqing extractive.

Genetic variations in FLT3 are associated with auto-phosphorylation of kinase domain that leads to increased proliferation of blast cells. Paired box family of transcription factor (PAX5) plays a critical role in commitment and differentiation of B-cells. Variations in PAX5 are associated with the risk of B-ALL. We aimed to analyze the association of FLT3 and PAX5 polymorphisms with B cell leukemia in Pakistani cohort. METHODS: We collected 155 B-ALL subject and 155 control blood samples. For analysis, genotyping was done by tetra ARMS-PCR. SPSS was used to check the association of demographic factors of SNPs present in the population with the risk of B-ALL. RESULTS: Risk allele frequency A at locus 13q12.2 (rs35958982, FLT3) was conspicuous and showed positive association (OR = 2.30, CI [1.20-4.50], P = 0.005) but genotype frequency (OR = 3.67, CI [0.75-18.10], P = 0.088) failed to show any association with the disease. At locus 9p13.2 (rs3780135, PAX5), the risk allele frequency was significantly higher in B-ALL subjects than ancestral allele frequency (OR = 2.17, CI [1.37-3.43], P = 0.000). Genotype frequency analysis of rs3780135 polymorphism exhibited the protective effect (OR = 0.55, CI [0.72-1.83], P = 0.029). At locus 13q12.2 (rs12430881, FLT3), the minor allele frequency G (OR = 1.15, CI [1.37-3.43], P = 0.043) and genotype frequency (OR = 2.52, P = 0.006) reached significance as showed p < 0.05. CONCLUSION: In the present study, a strong risk of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was associated with rs35958982 and rs12430881 polymorphisms. However, rs3780135 polymorphism showed the protective effect. Additionally, other demographic factors like family history, smoking and consanguinity were also found to be important in risk assessment.

Methods: In this study, we elucidated the role of EZH1 and EZH2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry and correlated them to clinical outcome in 41 MCL patients. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were applied to confirm the level of EZH1 and EZH2 in well-characterized MCL cell lines which were compared to those of naive B cells. Then we manipulated the expression of EZH1 and EZH2 in MCL cells using CRISPR/Cas9 system to directly investigate their functional roles in MCL. We also evaluated the effect of two small molecule selective inhibitors, EPZ005687 and UNC1999, on MCL cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in vitro. Finally, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to further gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms. Results: We found that EZH2 protein is overexpressed in approximately half of this cohort of MCL cases. More importantly, the overexpression of EZH2 is associated with poor OS in the patients. Nevertheless, simple EZH2 depletion in vitro has little impact on the viability of MCL cells, predominantly because of the consequent up-regulation of EZH1. Consistently, UNC1999, a dual EZH1/2 inhibitor, unlike the EZH2 selective inhibitor EPZ005687, exerts a potent inhibitory effect on MCL cells. Furthermore, we discover CDKN1C and TP53INP1 as the two important cell cycle regulators, the expression of which are repressed by EZH1/2 mediated epigenetic regulation and are restored by EZH1/2 dual inhibition. Conclusions: Our study suggests that EZH2 participates in the pathogenesis of MCL which may serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis prediction. The dual inhibition of EZH1/2 is a promising therapeutic strategy for MCL.",['Copyright 2019 Cancer Biology & Medicine.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['CRISPR/Cas9', 'EZH1', 'EZH2', 'Mantle cell lymphoma']",PMC6743615,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunohistochemical profile of PBL is that of terminally differentiated B lymphocytes. CD138, CD38, and MUM1 are usually immunopositive. However, pan B-cell markers such as CD20 and PAX-5 are usually negative. MYC rearrangement is the most commonly encountered genetic alteration, with immunoglobulin (IG), especially immunoglobulin heavy (IGH) chain, being the most frequent partner. We report a case of PBL in a 48-year-old human immunodeficiency virus- (HIV-) positive male who was admitted to the hospital with signs and symptoms suspicious for tumor lysis syndrome. Bone marrow examination revealed hypercellular marrow with trilineage hypoplasia and sheets of intermediate to large neoplastic cells with basophilic vacuolated cytoplasm comprising the majority of cellular elements of the bone marrow. The neoplastic cells were negative for conventional B-cell, T-cell, plasma cell, and myeloid markers, while flow cytometric analysis revealed an abnormal CD45-dim population that was partially weakly positive for CD71 and CD79b. The diagnosis was initially thought to be a high-grade primitive hematopoietic neoplasm, possibly an acute undifferentiated leukemia. BOB-1, however, was immunopositive in the neoplastic cells, confirming its B-cell origin. MYC was positive by immunohistochemistry and break-apart FISH, as were CD45, MUM-1, and EMA immunostains. There was immunoglobulin kappa (IGK) light chain gene rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Additionally, Epstein-Barr virus- (EBV-) encoded small RNAs (EBER) were positive by in situ hybridization (ISH). The tumor proliferation index by Ki-67 immunostaining approached 95%. Although the tumor cells were negative for CD38 and CD138, the diagnosis of PBL was still rendered. We recommend using a broad spectrum of B-cell markers, including BOB-1 and OCT-2, in such challenging cases of B-cell lymphomas with no expression of conventional B-cell markers. We also emphasize that the negative CD38 and CD138 should not exclude PBL from the differential diagnosis.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Majd Al Shaarani et al.'],,,,PMC6745100,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular heterogeneities of pediatric B-ALL play important roles as determinants of the therapy response. Therefore, many of these molecular abnormalities have an established prognostic value in the disease.

Exacerbation of thrombocytopenia is one of the prevalent complications after HMA treatment. Eltrombopag (EP), an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist, can efficiently stimulate megakaryopoiesis and elevate platelet counts in MDS/AML patients. However, the significance of combining EP with HMAs in patients with high-risk MDS/AML has not been determined. Purpose: To explore the impacts and mechanisms of EP and/or DAC on leukemia cell growth and to explore whether EP exhibits antileukemic effects in the context of DAC treatment in human myeloid leukemia cell lines. Methods: In our study, we assessed the anti-leukemic effect of EP in the context of DAC treatment by measuring cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell-cycle distribution, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Results: Our results showed that the combination of EP and DAC had a more obvious antiproliferative effect than that of DAC as a single agent. EP mainly induced S or G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and DAC arrested the cell cycle in the S or G2/M phase. The combination of EP and DAC had a synergistic effect on cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, single-agent treatment with EP or DAC induced a change in intracellular ROS levels, and the combination of EP and DAC had a synergistic effect on ROS levels, exacerbating leukemia cell death. Conclusion: Our study provides in vitro evidence of the synergistic antileukemic effect and potential mechanisms of the combination of DAC and EP on myeloid leukemia cells.",['(c) 2019 Shi et al.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['ROS', 'decitabine', 'eltrombopag', 'myeloid leukemia', 'reactive oxygen species']",PMC6735651,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Seventy-one CML patients with BCR-ABL(+) in bone marrow cells were selected for this study. Molecular response evaluations were done every three months according to the recommendations of European LeukemiaNet (ELN). Patients were defined as remission failure if BCR-ABL transcripts >10% after 6 months (T6), >1% after 12 months (T12), and >0.1% after 18 (T18) months of treatment. The logistic regression was used to determine the optimal cut-off point of each marker and test the association of marker level with remission failure. Results: The median NRBC, white blood cells, blast cells, basophils, and platelets were declined parallel with the decreases of BCR-ABL transcripts in bone marrow cells after 6 months of treatment (P<0.001).

In 2018, the FDA approved combination glasdegib (GLAS) plus LDAC based on Phase II results demonstrating improved overall survival (OS) versus LDAC alone in previously untreated AML. However, no randomized clinical trials have directly compared GLAS + LDAC with other AML treatments. Objective: Using both indirect treatment comparison (ITC) and simulated treatment comparison (STC), which adjusts for baseline differences between trials, the comparative effectiveness of GLAS + LDAC was compared with hypomethylating agent azacitidine (AZA) or decitabine (DEC). Methods: A systematic literature review identified published trials of AZA or DEC versus LDAC among older AML patients ineligible for high-intensity chemotherapy. In addition to standard and covariate-adjusted ITC, STC was performed following guidance from the NICE Decision Support Unit (DSU). Using individual patient data from the Phase II GLAS + LDAC study, population-specific OS hazard ratios (HR) for GLAS + LDAC versus AZA or DEC were compared. Furthermore, covariate-adjusted ITC (Cox multivariate models) and STC were repeated using GLAS + LDAC versus LDAC data propensity-weighted for within-trial mean cytogenetic risk. As this initial step was not specified in the DSU, results from this second method were compared to the first STC following DSU guidance only. Results: Standard ITC and STC both demonstrated significantly improved OS for GLAS + LDAC versus either AZA or DEC. Adjusting for key covariates, STC stepwise exponential models demonstrated GLAS + LDAC superiority to both AZA (HR=0.424; 95% CI: 0.228, 0.789) and DEC (HR=0.505; 95% CI: 0.269, 0.949). These significant results held using full or step-wise approaches, following DSU guidance only or the weighted STC approach.

Leukemia is a type of hematopoietic cancer that results from the malignant transformation of white blood cells. Chitosan-coated AuNPs (CH-AuNPs) are cell death inductors in HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells without affecting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Considering the selectivity and versatile cytotoxicity of CH-AuNPs, we evaluated whether their selectivity is due to the cell lineage or the characteristics of the cancer cells, by assessing its cytotoxicity in leukemic cells. Moreover, we further examined the cell death mechanism and assessed the implication of nuclear damage, autophagosome formation, and the cell death mechanism induced in leukemic cells. Materials and methods: We synthesized CH-AuNPs by chemical methods and analyzed their cell death capacity in a T-acute lymphocytic leukemia cell line (CEM), in a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (K562), and in healthy cells from the same lineage (PBMC and bone marrow, BM, cells). Then, we assessed ROS generation and mitochondrial and nuclear damage. Finally, we evaluated whether cell death occurred by autophagy, apoptosis, or necroptosis, and the role of ROS in this mechanism. Results: We found that CH-AuNPs did not affect PBMC and BM cells, whereas they are cytotoxic in a dose-dependent manner in leukemic cells. ROS production leads to mitochondrial and nuclear damage, and cell death. We found that CH-AuNPs induce apoptosis in CEM and necroptosis in K562, both undergoing autophagy as a pro-survival mechanism. Conclusion: CH-AuNPs are selective cell death inductors in hematologic cancer cells, without affecting their healthy counterparts. Cell death induced by CH-AuNPs is independent of the cancer cell type; however, its mechanism is different depending on the type of leukemic cells.",['(c) 2019 Martinez-Torres et al.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['AuNPs', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'leukemia', 'necroptosis', 'nuclear alterations']",PMC6734554,"['Dr Ana Carolina Martinez-Torres reports grants from CONACYT, during the conduct', 'of the study.

The median age of the patients (eight male, five female) was 65 years (range, 48-83). The time from onset of symptoms to referral to our center was relatively short (median, 2 months; range, 1-9 months). Upon referral, all patients were suspected to have lymphoma, five were examined for soluble IL-2 receptor and two were examined for anti-HTLV-1 antibody. In ten of the 13 (77%), the patient themselves or their relatives were born in Kyushu. The birth places of the remaining three patients were unknown. Three patients (23%) had family histories of lymphoma. They all exhibited aggressive ATL (five acute, eight lymphoma type); however, the disease status was generally stable, with relatively stable performance status and low scores for prognostic indices. After combination chemotherapy, eight (62%) achieved remission. However, long-term remission was achieved in only one patient with localized lymphoma-type ATL and one young patient after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In conclusion, at a center in a metropolitan and HTLV-1 non-endemic area in Japan, patients with ATL were relatively young and mainly presented with aggressive subtypes. At initial referral to our center, all 13 patients were suspected of having lymphoma but only two of having ATL.

Epub 2019 Jun 17.,"OBJECTIVE: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a systemic vasculitis, affecting medium- and large-sized vessels. Temporal artery biopsies (TABs) are currently the benchmark for diagnosing suspected cases of GCA. Often, the temporal artery is ""skeletonized,"" and surrounding soft tissue is discarded at the time of biopsy. The purpose of this study was to identify cases in which diagnoses were made through examination of periadventitial soft tissue in nonskeletonized TABs. DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series and literature review. PARTICIPANTS: Six patients were recruited on a case-by-case basis. INCLUSION CRITERIA: bilateral TABs for suspected GCA and periadventitial findings leading to appropriate diagnosis. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: none. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed to collect patient demographics and clinical information in 2 academic institutions in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcome measure was identification of histopathological diagnoses made through examination of periadventitial soft tissue in TABs performed for suspected GCA. RESULTS: Two patients were diagnosed with GCA, one of which had a concurrent diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Four patients were diagnosed with small vessel vasculitis, 3 of which were antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-related vasculitides. All patients had evidence of a disease limited to the periadventitial tissue of the TAB. The results are limited by the study's size. CONCLUSIONS: This case series demonstrates that other serious conditions may declare themselves with symptoms similar to that of GCA. We recommend that surgeons perform a nonskeletonized TAB in all cases of suspected GCA and that pathologists adequately examine the periadventitial tissue in these biopsies to ensure appropriate diagnosis.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Canadian Ophthalmological Society.

Epub 2019 Sep 29.,"The oncogenic ability of the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 gene, TCL1, has captured the attention in the field of prolymphocytic T-cell and B-cell chronic leukemias for more than two decades. However, the finding that TCL1 is also expressed in totipotent cells of the mouse preimplantation embryos and that it is among the 10 genes, including the transcription factors Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Tbx3, and Esrrb, that are required for maintaining the mitotic self-renewal state of embryonic stem cells, raises a great interest. In this review, we highlight newly acquired evidence pinpointing TCL1 as a crucial regulator of metabolic pathways that dictate somatic cell reprogramming toward pluripotency. In our opinion, this feature provides a relevant hint for reframing the role that this factor plays at early stages of mammalian embryo development and in tumorigenesis. Hence, the TCL1-dependent enhancement of serine/threonine AKT/PKB kinase activity favoring cell proliferation appears to be associated to the promotion of glucose transport and activation of glycolytic pathways. This is also consistent with the TCL1 ability to suppress mitochondrial biogenesis and oxygen consumption, downplaying the contribution of oxidative phosphorylation to energy metabolism. It thus appears that TCL1 masters the direction of energy metabolism toward the glycolytic pathway to meet a critical metabolic requirement that goes beyond the mere ATP production. For instance, the synthesis of glycolytic intermediates that are required for DNA synthesis likely represents the most pressing cellular need for both cleavage-stage embryos and rapidly proliferating tumor cells.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Embryonic totipotent/pluripotent stem cells', 'cell proliferation/differentiation', 'energy metabolism shift']",PMC6816351,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this family belong proteins, such as zeta-crystallin, expressed ubiquitously, and endowed with enzyme activity. zeta-crystallin is a moonlighting protein endowed with two main different functions: (1) mRNA binding with stabilizing activity; (2) NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase. zeta-crystallin has been clearly demonstrated to stabilize mRNAs encoding proteins involved in renal glutamine catabolism during metabolic acidosis resulting in ammoniagenesis and bicarbonate ion production that concur to compensate such condition. zeta-crystallin binds also mRNAs encoding for antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 in leukemia cells.

Epub 2019 Sep 26.,"The Predicted Indirectly Recognizable HLA Epitopes (PIRCHE) score quantifies the number of PIRCHEs in patient-donor pairs and represents an in silico measure of indirect alloreactivity. This biologic process is defined as T cell recognition of epitopes derived from mismatched, allogeneic HLA peptides that are subsequently presented by shared HLA molecules. Its association with clinical outcome has not been examined in haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT) with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy). We hypothesized that the PIRCHE score (PS) would correlate with indirect alloreactivity and predict graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) risk and the incidence of relapse after haplo-HCT with PTCy. We retrospectively analyzed 148 patients who underwent peripheral blood stem cell T cell-replete haplo-HCT with PTCy at a single center between 2009 and 2016. For each patient-donor pair, the PS was calculated using the PIRCHE online matching tool. PSs were categorized by class and vector. The median class I graft-versus-host (GVH) PS was 11 (range, 0 to 56), and the median class I host-versus-graft (HVG) PS was 10 (range, 0 to 51). Class I GVH PS was associated with increased risk of grade II-IV acute GVHD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03 per PS unit increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.05; P= .008) but not of chronic GVHD or relapse. Our data show that use of the PS is a novel strategy for predicting clinical outcome in haplo-HCT; further studies using registry data and prospective cohorts are warranted to validate these findings.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, we evaluated 25 early risk factors for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) mortality to improve mortality prognostication. We merged the Virtual Pediatric Systems and Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research databases and analyzed 936 critically ill patients </=21 years of age who had undergone allogeneic HCT and subsequently required PICU admission between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2014. Of 1532 PICU admissions, the overall PICU mortality rate was 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.6% to 19.4%) but was significantly higher for patients requiring mechanical ventilation (44.0%), renal replacement therapy (56.1%), or extracorporeal life support (77.8%). Mortality estimates increased significantly the longer that patients remained in the PICU. Of 25 HCT- and PICU-specific characteristics available at or near the time of PICU admission, moderate/severe pre-HCT renal injury, pre-HCT recipient cytomegalovirus seropositivity, <100-day interval between HCT and PICU admission, HCT for underlying acute myeloid leukemia, and greater admission organ dysfunction as approximated by the Pediatric Risk of Mortality 3 score were each independently associated with PICU mortality. A multivariable model using these components identified that patients in the top quartile of risk had 3 times greater mortality than other patients (35.1% versus 11.5%, P < .001, classification accuracy 75.2%; 95% CI, 73.0% to 77.4%). These data improve our working knowledge of the factors influencing the progression of critical illness in pediatric allogeneic HCT patients.

Epub 2019 Aug 29.,"INTRODUCTION: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) improve the survival rate of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, elderly patients often experience adverse events and require dose adjustments, leading to dose interruptions or treatment discontinuation. We therefore investigated TKI dosing patterns and subsequent outcomes in elderly CML patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the National Health Information Database, we identified patients with CML aged >/= 70 years who were prescribed TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or radotinib) during 2007-2013. Data on age, sex, prescribed medication, and date of death were extracted. RESULTS: Among the 378 patients, the median age was 75 (range, 70-92) years; the median follow-up period was 53 (range, 1-133) months. Imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and radotinib were prescribed to 324 (85.7%), 110 (29.1%), 93 (24.6%), and 15 (4.0%) patients, respectively. In 42 patients (12.2%), the initial dose was lower than the recommended dose for chronic-phase CML. At last follow-up, 249 patients (65.9%) were receiving a reduced dose. The mean +/- standard deviation dose densities of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and radotinib were 207 +/- 121.6, 29 +/- 26.7, 235 +/- 197, and 123 +/- 95.4 mg/day, respectively. The estimated 5-year overall survival probability was 61.0%. Initial TKI dose or dose reduction within first year did not affect the overall survival (P = .0571 and .1826, respectively). CONCLUSION: Dose reduction was observed in 65.9% of the patients at their last visit; except for imatinib, TKI dose densities were < 50% of the recommended dose for the chronic phase. Therefore, the recommended TKI doses might be too high for elderly patients with CML.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 12-year-old female with trisomy 21, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diabetes, with fever and neutropenia who developed rhinocerebral mucormicosis. After treatment with amphotericin B lipid complex and extensive surgery, disease progressed and posaconazole was added as salvage treatment with full remission of the infection. Four years after diagnosis the patient continues without relapse of mucormycosis or leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the use of posaconazole as either monotherapy or combined therapy. Although it is still debated, it can be considered an option for salvage treatment in children with non-responding mucormycosis, despite lack of standard dosage in pediatric patients.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Asociacion Espanola de Micologia.

There have been successful examples of targeted therapy improving the outcome of some childhood cancers, such as the addition of an ABL class tyrosine kinase inhibitor to conventional chemotherapy substantially improving the cure rate for patients with BCR-ABL1 positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although there are other mutations serving as putative targets in various childhood leukemias and solid tumors, effective targeted therapy has yet to be established for them in prospective clinical trials. There are also uncertainties about which ""targeted therapy"" to use when patients have multiple targetable genomic lesions in their cancer cells, given the paucity of data upon which to develop evidence-based guidelines for selecting and integrating targeted agents for individual patients. There are also multiple examples of inherited germline variants for which evidence-based guidelines have been developed by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium to guide the selection and dosing of medications in children with cancer. Clinical pharmacology is poised to play a critical role in both the discovery and development of new targeted anticancer agents and their evidence-based translation into better treatment for children with cancer.

Epub 2019 Sep 25.,"The optimal intensity of conditioning regimen may be dependent on not only age and comorbidities but also disease characteristics and risk of relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We, therefore, analyzed the transplant outcomes of 840 adult patients with cytogenetically poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1) who received first allogeneic HCT with either myeloablative conditioning (MAC; n=652) or reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC; n=188) between 2006 and 2017. The median age at HCT was 50.5 years (range: 16 to 77 years). The multivariate analysis showed that patients receiving MAC had a significantly higher overall survival and lower leukemia-related mortality than those receiving RIC (P=.011 and P=.025, respectively). In the subgroup analysis, these results applied to patients aged 16 to 59 years, with HCT-comorbidity index scores >/=3, and with cytogenetic remission. Among MAC regimens, there was a trend for worse survival and nonrelapse mortality with the busulfan/fludarabine-based regimen compared with the total body irradiation (TBI) >/=8 Gy-based regimen (P=.082 and P=.062, respectively), whereas the busulfan/cyclophosphamide-based regimen and the fludarabine/melphalan-based regimen had similar outcomes with the TBI-based regimen. These data suggest that MAC is preferable to RIC for patients with cytogenetically poor-risk AML undergoing allogeneic HCT in CR1.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the presence and prevalence of FFV among domestic cats by molecular techniques. PCR was used to amplify the gag-pol gene overlap in order to detect the presence of FFV. The gene encoding bet, an important accessory gene, was also characterized. Molecular characteristics were analyzed and phylogenetic trees were constructed. We determined the positivity rate as 10% in all samples (20/200) based on the gag-pol test. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Turkish FFV sequences form a separate cluster among other isolates in the constructed maximum likelihood (ML) tree. bet-based products were obtained for two samples (1%; 2/200) that were also positive for gag-pol. These bet gene sequences confirm the presence of a separate cluster for the Turkish FFV isolates. The results suggest that FFV is prevalent and widespread in Turkish domestic cats. Additionally, these new FFV sequences represent the first FFV sequences from Turkey to be submitted to GenBank.

Patients with low bone marrow blast counts (< 30%) experience improved survival with azacitidine, but the benefits are significantly lower in patients with > 30% blasts in the bone marrow. As such, there is uncertainty around the economic benefit of azacitidine in patients with higher blast counts. OBJECTIVE: We present a cost-utility analysis of azacitidine in patients with AML with > 30% blasts to determine the economic value of azacitidine in this patient population from the perspective of a third-party payer. METHODS: A Markov model was developed with a time horizon of 25 months divided into 22 cycles of 35 days each. The cost utility of azacitidine was compared with that of conventional care regimens (which include best supportive care, low-dose cytarabine and induction chemotherapy). A Canadian public healthcare system perspective was selected. RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) for azacitidine compared with conventional care regimens was $Can160,438, year 2018 values. The estimated ICER was insensitive to a longer time horizon but sensitive to the cost of azacitidine and to assumptions relating to survival in both treatment regimens, although the ICER always remained greater than Can$80,000 in all scenarios. CONCLUSION: Azacitidine is unlikely to be cost effective given that the estimated ICER exceeds the willingness to pay commonly used in the Canadian healthcare system.",,,,,PMC7248154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation using sequential conditioning (""FLAMSA""-like) has shown promising results in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, but little is known about its efficacy in RR-ALL. We identified 115 patients (19-66 years) with relapsed (74%) or primary-refractory (26%) ALL allografted from matched related (31%), matched unrelated (58%), or haploidentical donor (11%). Median follow-up was 37 (13-111) months. At day 100, cumulative incidences of grade II-IV/III-IV acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) were 30% and 17%, respectively. Two-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 25% with 11% extensive cases. Two-year relapse incidence (RI) was 45%, non-relapse mortality was 41%. Two-year leukemia free survival (LFS) was 14%, overall survival (OS) 17%, and GVHD relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 14%. In multivariable analysis, Karnofsky score <90 negatively affected RI, LFS, OS, and GRFS. Conditioning with chemotherapy alone, compared with total body irradiation (TBI) negatively affected RI (HR = 3.3; p = 0.008), LFS (HR = 1.94; p = 0.03), and OS (HR = 2.0; p = 0.03). These patients still face extremely poor outcomes, highlighting the importance of incorporating novel therapies (e.g., BITE antibodies, inotuzumab, CAR-T cells). Nevertheless, patients with RR-T-cell ALL remain with an unmet treatment need, for which TBI-based sequential conditioning could be one of few available options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One-hundred and seven patients received pre-emptive RTX for EBV reactivation (RTX group) and 112 did not (control group). The median onset time of EBV reactivation was 49 days (range, 14-561), including five patients who developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (EBV-PTLD). RTX and control groups were pair-matched to assess the impact of RTX on all endpoints. In RTX patients, CD19 + B cells were significantly decreased until 1-year post-transplant, so were immunoglobulin levels. Twenty-one patients (17%) developed RTX-related neutropenia. There was, in the RTX group, a trend towards a lower cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD (P = 0.059). Overall survival, progression-free survival, non-relapse mortality, relapse incidence, and incidence of overall infections at 2 years following allo-SCT were comparable in the two groups.

Epub 2019 Sep 24.,"In the past decade, rapid advances in therapeutic target discovery in hematologic malignancies have led to many clinical studies demonstrating efficacy of novel agents. Between 2014 and 2018, Food and Drug Administration approvals of new drugs and agents have increased, with greater than 2 dozen novel agents. Rapidly identifying the risk profiles of these cancer therapeutics that may present with acute toxicities and understanding the timing, sequence, duration, and treatment of disease processes are the most important challenges faced by practitioners in emergency medicine, even in nononcologic centers. The emergency medicine literature lags behind rapid advances in oncology, and guidelines for rapid recognition and management of these emerging entities are not familiar. In this Review Article, we discuss the most recent and clinically relevant developments in the arena of hematologic malignancies, further expanding on drug toxicities and their clinical presentations and offering suggestions for management. Specifically, we discuss immune-related adverse events after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (including myocarditis and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy, cytokine release syndrome, chimeric antigen receptor-T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome, differentiation syndrome, sinusoid occlusion syndrome, QT-interval prolongation, and tumor lysis syndrome. Rapid advances in hematology and oncology will bring many new challenges for emergency health care providers in the near future; thus, the urgency to raise awareness among this community.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American College of Emergency Physicians.

Epub 2019 Sep 25.,"We investigated the effect of the modulation of Na/H exchanger 1 (NHE1) on apoptosis, differentiation, and chemoresistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells to evaluate the possibility of NHE1 modulation as a novel therapeutic strategy for AML. The pHi of leukemia cell lines except KG1a was higher than that of normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNCs). Notably, in K562, cytarabine (AraC)-resistant OCI-AML2, and primary leukemia cells, pHi was significantly higher than that of normal BM MNCs. Western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR confirmed that the increased NHE1 expression was responsible for the higher pHi. Specifically, compared to CD34(+)CD38(+) leukemia cells, the mean fluorescence intensity of NHE1 was significantly higher in CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemic stem cells. The out of range in pHi by treatment with an NHE inhibitor, the amiloride analogue 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride (HMA), or an NHE activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), resulted in dose- and time-dependent inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation. PMA induced CD14(+) differentiation of leukemia cells, whereas HMA induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. HMA could induce apoptosis of leukemia cells even in AraC-resistant cells and showed an additive effect on apoptosis in AraC-sensitive cells. Our result revealed that AML cells prefer more alkalic intracellular moiety than normal BM MNCs following increased NHE1 expression and that NHE1 modulation can induce apoptosis and differentiation of AML cells. These findings imply that NHE1 is a potential target in cytotoxic or differentiation-induction treatment for AML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

B5 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of DLA-DR-expressing canine B cell lymphoma/CLBL1 and CLB70 leukemia lines, but not the GL-1 line not expressing DLA-DR. The cytotoxicity of B5-MTX to sensitive cells was further potentiated by a payload of MTX, but without any substantial off-target effects. The infusion of B5 and B5-MTX in a murine model of disseminated, advanced canine lymphoma, mediated >80% and >90% improvement in survival, respectively, and was well tolerated by the animals. Interestingly, the concentrations of soluble DLA-DR (sDLA-DR) antigens present in the blood serum of tumor-bearing mice were found proportional to the tumor burden.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are active against leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. Clinical data suggest further testing of such epigenetic drugs and to identify mechanisms and markers for their efficacy. Primary and permanent AML cells were screened for viability, replication stress/DNA damage, and regrowth capacities after single exposures to the clinically used pan-HDACi panobinostat (LBH589), the class I HDACi entinostat/romidepsin (MS-275/FK228), the HDAC3 inhibitor RGFP966, the HDAC6 inhibitor marbostat-100, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin, and the replication stress inducer hydroxyurea (HU). Immunoblotting was used to test if HDACi modulate the leukemia-associated transcription factors beta-catenin, Wilms tumor (WT1), and myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC). RNAi was used to delineate how these factors interact. We show that LBH589, MS-275, FK228, RGFP966, and HU induce apoptosis, replication stress/DNA damage, and apoptotic fragmentation of beta-catenin. Indomethacin destabilizes beta-catenin and potentiates anti-proliferative effects of HDACi. HDACi attenuate WT1 and MYC caspase-dependently and -independently. Genetic experiments reveal a cross-regulation between MYC and WT1 and a regulation of beta-catenin by WT1.

Hotspot mutation at Arg(132) in IDH1 that alters the function of IDH1 by further converting the alpha-ketoglutarate(alpha-KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) have been identified in a variety of cancers. Because the IDH1 mutations occur in a significant portion of gliomas and glioblastomas, it is important that IDH1 inhibitors have to be brain penetrant to treat IDH1-mutant brain tumors. Here we report the efforts to design and synthesize a novel serial of mutant IDH1 inhibitors with improved activity and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration.

The associations, characteristics, and temporal relationship of PG with hematologic malignancies are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review of PG associated with hematologic malignancies using data from case reports, case series, and retrospective studies. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science from each database's inception to December 12, 2018. Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-nine publications met the inclusion criteria (340 cases). Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was the most commonly reported hematologic malignancy associated with PG, followed by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and acute myeloid leukemia. The mean age of patients was 56.5 years, with males being more common. There was a predominance of the ulcerative PG subtype and multifocal distributions across all hematologic malignancies. The majority of MDS cases preceded PG, which was reversed for MGUS. LIMITATIONS: The data were limited by reporting bias because PG subtypes rely on the rendered diagnosis reported. In addition, the classification for hematologic malignancies has evolved since 1978. CONCLUSION: Patients with PG should be evaluated for hematologic malignancies, with MDS being the most common.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Previous studies suggest that T-cell malignancies are usually accompanied by highly activated PI3K/AKT signaling which confers the ability of cancer cells to proliferate and survive. Here, we found that GL-V9, a newly synthesized flavonoid compound, had a potent to inhibit the activation of AKT1 and induce the cell apoptosis in T-cell malignancies including cell lines and primary lymphoblastic leukemia. Results showed that GL-V9-induced degradation of AKT1 blocked PI3K/AKT1 signaling and the degradation of AKT1 could be reversed by NH4Cl, an inhibitor of lysosomal function. Inhibiting AKT1 promoted dephosphorylation of FOXO3A and its nuclear translocation. We further demonstrated that GL-V9-induced apoptosis effects were dependent on the binding of FOXO3A to the BIM promoter, resulting in the production of BH3-only protein BIM. Moreover, GL-V9 showed a more persistent and stronger apoptosis induction effects than pharmacologic PI3K inhibitor. The in vivo studies also verified that GL-V9 possessed the anti-tumor effects by reducing the leukemic burden in T-ALL-bearing BALB/c nude mice. In conclusion, our study provides a new insight into the mechanism of GL-V9-induced apoptosis, suggesting the potency of GL-V9 to be a promising agent against T-cell malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Sep 24.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intratumor heterogeneity and divergent clonal lineages within and among primary and recurrent hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) produce challenges to patient management. We investigated genetic and epigenetic variations within liver tumors, among hepatic lesions, and between primary and relapsing tumors. METHODS: Tumor and matched nontumor liver specimens were collected from 113 patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for primary or recurrent HCC at 2 hospitals in Hong Kong. We performed whole-genome, whole-exome, or targeted capture sequencing analyses of 356 HCC specimens collected from multiple tumor regions and matched initial and recurrent tumors. We performed parallel DNA methylation profiling analyses of 95 specimens. Genomes and epigenomes of nontumor tissues that contained areas of cirrhosis or fibrosis were analyzed. We developed liver cancer cell lines that endogenously expressed a mutant form of TP53 (R249S) or overexpressed mutant forms of STAT3 (D170Y, K348E, and Y640F) or JAK1 (S703I and L910P) and tested the abilities of pharmacologic agents to reduce activity. Cells were analyzed by immunoblotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We determined the monoclonal origins of individual tumors using a single sample collection approach that captured more than 90% of mutations that are detected in all regions of tumors. Phylogenetic and phylo-epigenetic analyses revealed interactions and codependence between the genomic and epigenomic features of HCCs. Methylation analysis revealed a field effect in cirrhotic liver tissues that predisposes them to tumor development. Comparisons of genetic features revealed that 52% of recurrent HCCs derive from the clonal lineage of the initial tumor. The clonal origin if recurrent HCCs allowed construction of a temporal map of genetic alterations that associated with tumor recurrence. Activation of JAK signaling to STAT was a characteristic of HCC progression via mutations that associate with response to drug sensitivity. The combination of a mutation that increases the function of TP53 and the 17p chromosome deletion might provide liver cancer cells with a replicative advantage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of TP53 with the R249S substitution revealed its interaction with genes that encode chromatin regulators (MLL1 and MLL2). We validated MLL1 and MLL2 as direct targets of TP53(R249S) and affirmed their association in the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. The MLL-complex antagonists MI-2-2 (inhibitor of protein interaction) and OICR-9492 (inhibitor of activity) specifically inhibited proliferation of HCC cells that express TP53(R249S) at nanomolar concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: We performed a systematic evaluation of intra- and intertumor genetic heterogeneity in HCC samples and identified genetic and epigenetic changes that associate with tumor progression and recurrence. We identified chromatin regulators that are upregulated by mutant TP53 in HCC cells and inhibitors that reduce proliferation of these cells. DNA methylation patterns in cirrhotic or fibrotic liver tissues might be used to identify those at risk of HCC development.",['Copyright (c) 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It has also been shown that the Warburg Effect occurs in innate immune cells upon infection. Innate immune cells play critical roles in the tumour microenvironment but the Warburg Effect is not fully understood in monocytes. Furthermore, it is important to understand the impact of infections on key players in the tumour microenvironment because inflammatory conditions often precede carcinogenesis and mutated oncogenes induce inflammation. We investigated the metabolic programme in the acute monocytic leukaemia cell line, THP-1 in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide, mimicking bacterial infections. We found that stimulation of THP-1 cells by LPS induces a subset of pro-inflammatory chemokines and enhances the Warburg Effect. Surprisingly, perturbation of the Warburg Effect in these cells does not lead to cell death in contrast to what was observed in non-myeloid cancer cell lines in a previous study. These findings indicate that the Warburg Effect and inflammation are activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and may have a profound influence on the microenvironment.",,,,,PMC6764657,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 27.,"Radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia (rAML) in C3H mice is commonly developed through inactivation of PU.1 transcription factor encoded in Sfpi1 on chromosome 2. PU.1 inactivation involves two steps: hemizygous deletion of the Sfpi1 gene (DSG) and point mutation of the allele Sfpi1 gene (PMASG). In this study, we investigated the dose-rate dependence of the frequency of both DSG and PMASG in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of C3H mice that received a total of 3 Gy gamma-ray exposure at dose rates of 20 mGy/day, 200 mGy/day or 1,000 mGy/min. All mice were followed for 250 days from start of irradiation. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of the Sfpi1 gene site indicated that frequency of HSCs with DSG was proportional to dose rate. In cell surface profiles, PU.1-inactivated HSCs by both DSG and PMASG were still positive for PU.1, but negative for GM-CSF receptor-alpha (GMCSFRalpha), which is transcriptionally regulated by PU.1. Immunofluorescent staining analysis of both PU.1 and GM-CSFRalpha also showed dose-rate-dependent levels of PU.1-inactivated HSCs. This study provides evidence that both DSG and PMASG are dose-rate dependent; these experimental data offer new insights into the dose-rate effects in HSCs that can lead to radiation-induced leukemogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched from inception to July 2018. A random effect model was used to estimate the overall mean TFR rate, subgroup differences, and regression coefficients with continuous variables. Overall, 12 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) stopping studies comprising 1699 chronic myeloid leukemia patients were included in this analysis. The overall mean TFR rate at 24 months after entering TFR phase was 55% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.58]. Trials with molecular criteria of MR4.5 or better for stopping TKI reported higher TFR rates than those of MR4.0 (57.2% vs. 50.5%). Trials with eligible criteria for at least 24 months of deep molecular response (DMR) duration demonstrated higher TFR rates than those for 18 or 12 months (60.2% vs. 49.9%). Our results suggest that TKI stopping trials with sufficient duration of DMR and molecular criteria of MR4.5 or better may account for approximately 60% of the TFR rate at 24 months after stopping TKI.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Meta-analysis', 'Study-level factor', 'Treatment-free remission']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting as nephromegaly in a child: A rare case report. Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 97-101. Acute leukemia is the commonest pediatric malignancy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) constituting about 75% of all leukemias. ALL commonly presents as fever, bleeding, bone pains, anemia, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. The liver, spleen or lymph nodes are the most common sites of extramedullary involvement in ALL, with renal involvement being relatively uncommon. The usual differential diagnosis of acquired massive bilateral nephromegaly in children includes pyelonephritis, obstructive uropathy, infections such as HIV nephropathy, mucormycosis, glycogen storage diseases, myelofibrosis with extramedullary hematopoiesis, kidney tumors and rarely hematological malignancies like ALL. Here we report a 2 years old child who presented with abdominal distention, low grade fever and constipation. Clinical examination revealed massive bilateral nephromegaly. Preliminary investigations showed severe anemia and slightly elevated WBC counts with presence of reactive changes in lymphocytes along with few atypical cells (9%). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed bilaterally enlarged kidneys which was later confirmed by CT abdomen. He was eventually diagnosed with CALLA positive B cell ALL for which treatment was started in accordance with the International network for cancer treatment and research (INCTR) protocol 02 04. At present, he is on maintenance phase and responding well to the treatment with regression of kidney size to normal on follow up ultrasonogram. Thus, leukemia should be considered in a child presenting with bilateral nephromegaly after exclusion of above mentioned differential diagnosis. Bone marrow aspiration must be done before doing a more invasive investigation like renal biopsy.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'kidney', 'nephromegaly']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Mechanisms of resistance have been identified that target all described mechanisms of mAb activity including altered antigen expression or binding, impaired complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), altered intracellular signaling effects, and inhibition of direct induction of cell death. Numerous approaches to circumvent identified mechanisms of resistance continue to be investigated, but a thorough understanding of which resistance mechanisms are most clinically relevant is still elusive. In recent years, a deeper understanding of the tumor microenvironment and targeting the apoptotic pathway has led to promising breakthroughs. Resistance may be driven by unique patient-, disease-, and antibody-related factors. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance to mAbs will guide the development of strategies to overcome resistance and re-sensitize cancer cells to these biological agents.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ADCC', '*Anti-CD20', '*Apoptosis', '*CMC', '*Rituximab']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the situation regarding this type of care in Japan is unclear. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey at 155 institutions treating childhood leukemia in Japan. The questionnaire asked about the supportive care provided by each institution to acute leukemia patients with DIC and asparaginase-induced hemostatic alterations. Ninety-eight institutions responded. The most common diagnostic criteria for DIC were those established by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. Regardless of the etiology underlying DIC, recombinant human thrombomodulin and synthetic protease inhibitors were used as anticoagulation therapy by around 70% and 40% of institutions, respectively. Additionally, 92%, 93%, and 73% of institutions measured plasma antithrombin, fibrinogen, and D-dimer/fibrin degradation products, respectively, more than twice per week during induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Survey responses indicate that 95% and 24% of the institutions used antithrombin replacement and fresh-frozen plasma, respectively. Supportive care for DIC and/or asparaginase-induced hemostatic alterations at Japanese pediatric centers was intensive and differs markedly from protocols in other countries. The efficacy of supportive care should be evaluated prospectively in the setting of pediatric leukemia.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Asparaginase-induced thrombosis', 'Children', 'Disseminated intravascular coagulation', 'Leukemia', 'Supportive care']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jan 16.,"In the latest World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) exists as a separate entity under the category of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative (MDS/MPN) overlap syndromes. Outcomes remain uniformly poor with a median overall survival of ~2 years and an inherent risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (15-20% over 5 years). Due to unique biologic characteristics such as overlapping features of myelodysplasia and myeloproliferation, and clinical diversity despite relative genomic homogeneity, CMML represents a unique model to study chronic myeloid tumor biology. Recent advances have focused on understanding the role of putative genomic abnormalities, in particular, clonal evolution of pathogenic alterations in genes regulating the epigenome (TET2), chromatin architecture (ASXL1), spliceosome complex (SRSF2, SF3B1) and cell signaling (NRAS, KRAS, CBL, JAK2). Disease prognostication has evolved from purely clinical prognostic models to those incorporating pathogenic gene variations. Therapeutic options in this disease remain dismal with only two agents approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, namely 5-azacitidine and decitabine. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the sole curative option in this disease; however is associated with substantial treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Future areas of research include opportunities to further improve disease prognostication by employing novel technologies such as machine learning, incorporation of methylation and cytokine signatures, in addition to gene mutations; insights into clonal origins of this disease, and novel therapeutic strategies.",,"['KL2 TR000136/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR002379/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6763205,"['Conflict of interest: Authors declare no relevant conflicts of interest in', 'relation to the manuscript.']",['NIHMS1006534'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 26.,"AIMS: This is a nation-wide survey of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients at six large hematology centers in the Czech Republic. The aim was to identify specific populations, social, and health characteristics of CLL subgroups divided according to the immunogenetic features of their B cell receptors (BCRs) and clonality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Questionnaires directed to specific health, social, and environmental conditions were collected in a cohort of 573 CLL patients. For these patients, immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements were also analyzed in order to gain information about their clonality, IGHV mutational status, and the presence of stereotyped BCRs. Data extracted from the questionnaires were analyzed statistically in the context of immunogenetic features of the cohort. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the data collected in the survey between patients with mutated and patients with unmutated IGHV. However, patients with oligoclonal CLL reported health conditions such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, herpes simplex, tumors, and also, separately, CLL in 1(st) degree relatives, more often than their monoclonal counterparts. In patients with stereotyped BCRs, we found more frequent alcohol consumption and gastric infections in subset #1 cases and frequent cholecystectomies and familial CLL in subset #2 cases. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate CLL immunogenetic features and clonality in the context of epidemiological data. We reported statistically significant associations suggesting the influence of certain health and social conditions on a number of clonal populations expanding in CLL and also on characteristic BCR features, especially stereotypy.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell receptor', 'biological risk factor', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'clonality', 'patient history', 'questionnaire']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eighty-seven adult patients with various hematologic diseases, who were scheduled to receive autologous or allogeneic HSCT, were enrolled. The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale were applied prospectively at hospital admission (D-14), on the day of transplantation (D day), and at 7 (D7) and 14 days (D14) after transplantation. RESULTS: The severity of both anxiety and depressive symptoms increased over time, with a peak at D7, and then showed a downturn at D14. Physical distresses also started with mild intensity at base line, which were continuously aggravated until D7, and then a partial recovery afterwards. Approximately, 52% of the participants had significantly high anxiety or depression before the start of HSCT. The occurrence of aggravation of pain, nausea, shortness of breath, and lack of appetite was associated with the development of anxiety during isolation period.

Epub 2019 Sep 26.,"Inv(11)(p15q23), found in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, leads to expression of a fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal of nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) and the majority of the lysine methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A). To explore the transforming potential of this fusion we established inducible iNUP98-KMT2A transgenic mice. After a median latency of 80 weeks, over 90% of these mice developed signs of disease, with anemia and reduced bone marrow cellularity, increased white blood cell numbers, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and multilineage dysplasia. Additionally, induction of iNUP98-KMT2A led to elevated lineage marker-negative Sca-1(+) c-Kit(+) cell numbers in the bone marrow, which outcompeted wildtype cells in repopulation assays. Six iNUP98-KMT2A mice developed transplantable acute myeloid leukemia with leukemic blasts infiltrating multiple organs. Notably, as reported for patients, iNUP98-KMT2A leukemic blasts did not express increased levels of the HoxA-B-C gene cluster, and in contrast to KMT2A-AF9 leukemic cells, the cells were resistant to pharmacological targeting of menin and BET family proteins by MI-2-2 or JQ1, respectively. Expression of iNUP98-KMT2A in mouse embryonic fibroblasts led to an accumulation of cells in G1 phase, and abrogated replicative senescence. In bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors, iNUP98-KMT2A expression similarly resulted in increased cell numbers in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, with aberrant gene expression of Sirt1, Tert, Rbl2, Twist1, Vim, and Prkcd, mimicking that seen in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In summary, we demonstrate that iNUP98-KMT2A has in vivo transforming activity and interferes with cell cycle progression rather than primarily blocking differentiation.",['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,PMC7327646,,,,,['Haematologica. 2020 Jul;105(7):1757-1760.

Epub 2019 Sep 26.,"Daily intravenous arsenic trioxide administered with all-trans retinoid acid, the standard-of-care for acute promyelocytic leukemia, is costly and challenging to administer. ORH-2014 is a novel, oral arsenic trioxide formulation, consisting of micron-size drug particles with rapid dissolution and high bioavailability. We conducted a multicenter phase 1 dose-escalating study in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Twelve patients received ORH-2014 at 5 mg (n=3), 10 mg (n=6), or 15 mg (n=3) orally once a day (fasted state). Objectives were to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ORH-2014 to support a dose recommendation for future trials. The median age of the patients was 77 years (range: 45-81) and they had received a median of two (range: 1-5) prior therapies. There were no dose limiting toxicities and no drug-related severe adverse events, except one grade III QT prolongation occurring beyond the dose limiting toxicity assessment period and resolving after treatment interruption. ORH-2014 steady-state plasma concentration was reached on day 15. ORH-2014, 15 mg Cmax was comparable to the calculated approved dose of intravenous arsenic trioxide (mean [% coefficient of variation]: 114 [21%] vs 124 [60%] ng/mL) and area under the curve from 0 to 24 hours was 2,140 (36%) versus 1,302 (30%) h*ng/mL. These results indicate that ORH-2014 at 15 mg is safe, bioavailable, and provides the required arsenic exposure compared to intravenous arsenic trioxide at the approved dose (0.15 mg/kg); this ORH-2014 dose is recommended for future trials.

Epub 2019 Sep 26.,"Cytogenetic risk stratification at diagnosis has long been one of the most useful tools to assess prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To examine the prognostic impact of cytogenetic abnormalities on outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, we studied 1731 adults with Philadelphia-negative ALL in complete remission who underwent myeloablative or reduced intensity/non-myeloablative conditioning transplant from unrelated or matched sibling donors reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. A total of 632 patients had abnormal conventional metaphase cytogenetics. The leukemia-free survival and overall survival rates at 5 years after transplantation in patients with abnormal cytogenetics were 40% and 42%, respectively, which were similar to those in patients with a normal karyotype. Of the previously established cytogenetic risk classifications, modified Medical Research Council-Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score was the only independent prognosticator of leukemia-free survival (P=0.03). In the multivariable analysis, monosomy 7 predicted post-transplant relapse [hazard ratio (HR)=2.11; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.04-4.27] and treatment failure (HR=1.97; 95% CI: 1.20-3.24). Complex karyotype was prognostic for relapse (HR=1.69; 95% CI: 1.06-2.69), whereas t(8;14) predicted treatment failure (HR=2.85; 95% CI: 1.35-6.02) and overall mortality (HR=3.03; 95% CI: 1.44-6.41). This large study suggested a novel transplant-specific cytogenetic scheme with adverse [monosomy 7, complex karyotype, del(7q), t(8;14), t(11;19), del(11q), tetraploidy/near triploidy], intermediate (normal karyotype and all other abnormalities), and favorable (high hyperdiploidy) risks to prognosticate leukemia-free survival (P=0.02). Although some previously established high-risk Philadelphia-negative cytogenetic abnormalities in ALL can be overcome by transplantation, monosomy 7, complex karyotype, and t(8;14) continue to pose significant risks and yield inferior outcomes.",['Copyright(c) 2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['R21 HL140314/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL128568/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 HL138660/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC7193485,,,,,['Haematologica. 2020 May;105(5):1177-1179.

Epub 2019 Sep 26.,"PURPOSE: Current protocols for CD19 chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells (CD19.CAR-T cells) require recipients to tolerate preinfusion cytoreductive chemotherapy, and the presence of sufficient target antigen on normal or malignant B cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated whether additional stimulation of CD19.CAR-T cells through their native receptors can substitute for cytoreductive chemotherapy, inducing expansion and functional persistence of CD19.CAR-T even in patients in remission of B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. We infused a low dose of CD19.CAR-modified virus-specific T cells (CD19.CAR-VST) without prior cytoreductive chemotherapy into 8 patients after allogeneic stem cell transplant. RESULTS: Absent virus reactivation, we saw no CD19.CAR-VST expansion. In contrast, in patients with viral reactivation, up to 30,000-fold expansion of CD19.CAR-VSTs was observed, with depletion of CD19(+) B cells. Five patients remain in remission at 42-60+ months. CONCLUSIONS: Dual T-cell receptor and CAR stimulation can thus potentiate effector cell expansion and CAR-target cell killing, even when infusing low numbers of effector cells without cytoreduction.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['P01 CA094237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL092332/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC7062259,,['NIHMS1540563'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The safety of the next-generation compounds umbralisib, a PI3K-delta inhibitor, plus ublituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (combination referred to as U2), was evaluated in patients with chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in this phase 1/1b study. Phase 1 dose escalation was performed with a 3 + 3 design to establish the maximum tolerated dose. In this portion, ublituximab was given intravenously (NHL, 900 mg; CLL, 600 or 900 mg) for 12 cycles. Umbralisib was given orally once daily at 800 or 1200 mg (initial formulation) or 400 to 1200 mg (micronized formulation) in the phase 1 dose escalation portion, and at 800 to 1200 mg in the phase 1b portion until progression, toxicity, or study removal. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached in either the CLL or NHL cohort, and only 1 dose-limiting toxicity was observed. U2 had low instances of grade 3 or higher diarrhea (8%), pneumonia (8%), or hepatic toxicity (4%). Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 13% of patients, and umbralisib dose reductions occurred in 15% of patients. The overall response rate for all patients was 46% with 17% complete responses. The median duration of response was 20 months (95% confidence interval, 11.3-not reached). U2 was well tolerated, and no new safety signals were observed over single-agent umbralisib. Preliminary efficacy with this combination is promising and warrants further investigation.

Epub 2019 Sep 19.,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are common myeloid malignancies showing frequent progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential cellular process carried out by the spliceosome. Mutations in splicing factor genes (including SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 and ZRSR2) occur in over half of MDS patients and result in aberrant pre-mRNA splicing of many target genes, implicating aberrant spliceosome function in MDS disease pathogenesis. Recent functional studies have illuminated the impact on hematopoiesis of some aberrantly spliced target genes associated with splicing factor mutations. Emerging data show that the commonly mutated splicing factors have convergent effects on aberrant splicing of mRNAs that promote NF-kappaB signaling and on R-loop elevation leading to DNA damage, providing novel insights into MDS disease pathophysiology. It is recognized that the survival of splicing factor mutant cells is dependent on the presence of the wildtype allele, providing a rationale for the use of spliceosome inhibitors in splicing factor mutant MDS. Pre-clinical studies involving E7107 and H3B-8800 have shown the potential of these spliceosome inhibitors for the treatment of splicing factor mutant MDS and AML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 Sep 26.,"In the present work, a fluorescent gold nanoclusters (GNCs)/superparamagnetic (Fe3O4/GNCs) nanoprobe was prepared via a facile approach for the selective detection and imaging of human leukemica cancer cells (HL-60). (gamma-Mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPS) was used as a stabilizer to prepare functionalized GNCs. The prepared GNCs@MPS was then self-assembly decorated on the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles followed by poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PGD) addition at room temperature to form Fe3O4/GNCs nanoprobe. Surface functionalization of the Fe3O4/GNCs with the thiol-modified KH1C12 aptamer was done through thiol-en click reaction between PGD and the thiol group of the aptamer. An extensive characterization of the Fe3O4/GNCs revealed strong red fluorescence (lambda em = 627 nm), T 2-based contrast agent for MRI and excellent colloidal and photo stability in buffer medium. So, the aptamer-functionalized Fe3O4/GNCs nanoprobe (Fe3O4/GNCs/Aptamer) is capable to uptake and dual-image HL-60 cancer cells from a mixture. Furthermore, the MRI signal intensity of the pictures decreased linearly with an increase in the concentrations of the nanoprobe. It is also enable to detect cancer cells from a range of concentrations 10 up to 200 cells muL(-1). The fluorescent/magnetic characteristics of the nanoprobe are of great significance for MRI-based and fluorescence imaging and collection of HL-60 cancer cells which implies potential help for the development of early diagnosis of highly malignant human leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 137 breast cancer tissue and 137 adjacent normal tissue which served as controls were analyzed for mutation by automated DNA sequencing, methylation through methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and its corresponding expression at mRNA and protein level using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry respectively in Indian breast cancer patients. All the molecular findings were statistically correlated with clinopathological parameters of the patients to identify its association. LIFR mRNA expression was found to be 2.534+/-3.52 fold downregulated with subsequent absence of protein in 67.15% cases (92/137). The absence of LIFR protein coincided with 80.95% (85/105) methylated cases thereby showing a very strong correlation among the LIFR promoter methylation and LIFR protein expression (p=0.0001). We also observed G2968C nucleotide change in 6/137 cases of exon 20 of LIFR gene resulting in Glu990Gln mutation. Correlation of LIFR promoter methylation with geographic location and age at menopause and LIFR mutation with age at menarche, age at first live birth, molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and lymph node status remained significant even after bonferroni correction (p </= 0.0027). All these data suggests the relevance of these associations in relation to Indian breast cancer patients. The loss of LIFR protein was frequently found in Indian breast cancer patients, and aberrant promoter methylation showed a significant correlation with its downregulation.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2019 Sep 17.,"Presence of RS is closely associated with SF3B1 mutation in de novo MDS. RS is also present in a subset of therapy-related MDS (t-MDS), but data is not available in t-MDS with RS (t-MDS-RS). Using NGS gene panel, we assessed t-MDS-RS (n=38) and compared the result with d-MDS-RS (n=174). Commonly mutated genes were TP53 (56.5%), TET2 (39.1%), SF3B1 (35.7%), ASXL1 (30.4%), DNMT3A (17.4%), RUNX1 (17.4%) and SRSF2 (14.3%). Compared with d-MDS-RS, TP53 mutation was more common but SF3B1 mutation was less common in t-MDS-RS (p<0.05). In t-MDS-RS, Mutations in 4 genes (SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2) involving the RNA splicing were found in about 50% of patients compared to 90% in d-MDS-RS. Overall survival was by far worse in t-MDS-RS compared to d-MDS-RS (median overall survival: 10.9 months and 111.9 months in t-MDS-RS and d-MDS-RS, respectively, p<0.05). Progression to acute myeloid leukemia was more common in t-MDS-RS (18.4% vs. 7.4% in t-MDS-RS and d-MDS-RS, respectively, p<0.05). Unlike de novo MDS, t-MDS-RS did not have different outcome compared to t-MDS without RS (median OS: 10.9 months vs. 14.3 months, respectively, p=0.2341). Our data demonstrate that presence of RS is not associated with superior outcome in t-MDS. Mutation profiles suggest RS in t-MDS might be a secondary event in at least 50% of the cases or not related to mutations in RNA splicing machinery unlike d-MDS where mutations in RNA splicing machinery occur early and as associated with ineffective erythropoiesis.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 Sep 6.,"Acute myeloid leukemia with biallelic mutation of CEBPA (CEBPA-dm AML) is a distinct good prognosis entity recognized by WHO 2016 classification. However, testing for CEBPA mutation is challenging, due to the intrinsic characteristics of the mutation itself. Indeed, molecular analysis cannot be performed with NGS technique and requires Sanger sequencing. The association of recurrent mutations or translocations with specific immunophenotypic patterns has been already reported in other AML subtypes. The aim of this study was the development of a specific cytofluorimetric score (CEBPA-dm score), in order to distinguish patients who are unlikely to harbor the mutation. To this end, the correlation of CEBPA-dm score with the presence of the mutation was analyzed in 50 consecutive AML patients with normal karyotype and without NPM1 mutation (that is mutually exclusive with CEBPA mutation). One point each was assigned for expression of HLA DR, CD7, CD13, CD15, CD33, CD34 and one point for lack of expression of CD14. OS was not influenced by sex, age and CEBPA-dm score. Multivariate OS analysis showed that CEBPA-dm (p<0.02) and FLT3-ITD (p<0.01) were the strongest independent predictors of OS. With a high negative predictive value (100%), CEBPA-dm score < 6 was able to identify patients who are unlikely to have the mutation. Therefore, the application of this simple score might optimize the use of expensive and time-consuming diagnostic and prognostic assessment in the baseline work up of AML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2019 Sep 23.,"Relapse after stem cell transplantation for Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains a significant challenge. In this systematic review, we compare survival outcomes of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) nilotinib and dasatinib with first-generation TKI imatinib when these agents are used after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in Ph+ ALL. In addition, we review the literature on TKI use to prevent relapse in patients who proceed to allo-HSCT beyond first complete response (>CR1). We performed database searches (inception to January 2018) using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. After exclusions, 17 articles were included in this analysis. Imatinib was used post-transplant either prophylactically or preemptively in 12 studies, 7 prospective studies and 5 retrospective studies. Overall survival (OS) for most prospective studies at 1.5 to 3 and 5 years ranged between 62% to 92% and 74.5% to 86.7%. Disease-free survival at 1.5 to 5 years was 60.4% to 92%. Additionally, imatinib failed to show survival benefit in patients who were >CR1 at the time of allo-HSCT. The cumulative OS for most retrospective studies using imatinib at 1 to 2 and 3 to 5 years was 42% to 100% and 33% to 40% respectively. Event-free survival at 1 to 2 and 3 to 5 years was 33.3% to 67% and 20% to 31% respectively. Dasatinib was used as maintenance treatment in 3 retrospective studies (n=34). The OS for patients with Ph+ ALL using dasatinib as maintenance regimen after allo-HSCT at 1.4 to 3 years was 87% to 100% and disease-free survival at 1.4 to 3 years was 89% to 100%. Ninety-three percent of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) positive status after allo-HSCT became MRD negative. Three prospective studies used nilotinib. In 2 studies where investigators studied patients with advanced chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ ALL, the cumulative OS and event-free survival at 7.5 months to 2 years were 69% to 84% and 56% to 84%, respectively. In the third study (n=5) in patients with Ph+ ALL, nilotinib use resulted in OS at 5 years of 60%. Our review showed that use of TKIs (all generations) after allo-HSCT for patients in CR1 improved OS when given as a prophylactic or preemptive regimen. Limited data suggest that second-generation TKIs (ie, dasatinib) have a better OS, especially in patients with MRD-positive status. Imatinib did not improve OS in patients who were >CR1 at the time of allo-HSCT; for this population, no data were available with newer generation TKIs. The evaluation of survival benefit with newer generation TKIs and their efficacy in patients in >CR1 needs further study in large randomized clinical trials.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

KS1 is characterized by intellectual disability, postnatal growth retardation, and distinct craniofacial dysmorphisms. A mouse model (Kmt2d+/betaGeo) exhibits features of the human disorder and has provided insight into other phenotypes; however, the mechanistic basis of skeletal abnormalities and growth retardation remains elusive. Using high-resolution micro-CT, we show that Kmt2d+/betaGeo mice have shortened long bones and ventral bowing of skulls. In vivo expansion of growth plates within skulls and long bones suggests disrupted endochondral ossification as a common disease mechanism. Stable chondrocyte cell lines harboring inactivating mutations in Kmt2d exhibit precocious differentiation, further supporting this mechanism. A known inducer of chondrogenesis, SOX9, and its targets show markedly increased expression in Kmt2d-/- chondrocytes. By transcriptome profiling, we identify Shox2 as a putative KMT2D target. We propose that decreased KMT2D-mediated H3K4me3 at Shox2 releases Sox9 inhibition and thereby leads to enhanced chondrogenesis, providing a potentially novel and plausible explanation for precocious chondrocyte differentiation.

Epub 2019 Sep 16.,"The dismal prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is mainly due to its rapidly acquired resistance to all conventional treatments. Despite drug-specific mechanisms of resistance, none explains how these cells resist the stress induced by any kind of anticancer treatment. Activation of stress-response pathways relies on the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of involved proteins. Among all PTMs, those mediated by the ubiquitin family of proteins play a central role. Our aim was to identify alterations of ubiquitination, neddylation, and sumoylation associated with the multiresistant phenotype and demonstrate their implications in the survival of PDAC cells undergoing treatment. This approach pointed at an alteration of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein sumoylation associated with both gemcitabine and oxaliplatin resistance. We could show that this alteration of PML sumoylation is part of a general mechanism of drug resistance, which in addition involves the abnormal activation of NF-kappaB and cAMP response element binding pathways. Importantly, using patient-derived tumors and cell lines, we identified a correlation between the levels of PML expression and sumoylation and the sensitivity of tumors to anticancer treatments.-Swayden, M., Alzeeb, G., Masoud, R., Berthois, Y., Audebert, S., Camoin, L., Hannouche, L., Vachon, H., Gayet, O., Bigonnet, M., Roques, J., Silvy, F., Carrier, A., Dusetti, N., Iovanna, J.

Growth delay, seizures, and autism spectrum disorder have also been reported in some affected individuals. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of BCL11A-ID is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in BCL11A identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is primarily supportive and dictated by symptoms. Standard antiepileptic medication for seizure disorder; standard treatment for abnormal vision and/or strabismus, sleep disturbance, scoliosis, joint laxity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), constipation, and developmental issues. Surveillance: Assessment of growth parameters, feeding difficulties, GERD, constipation, scoliosis, developmental progress, and behavior at each visit. Monitor seizures as clinically indicated. Assessment of vision and eye alignment as needed. GENETIC COUNSELING: BCL11A-ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, most affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo BCL11A pathogenic variant. Once the BCL11A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

The expense of targeted therapies, however, may result in high out-of-pocket costs for initiating therapy that could be a barrier to starting treatment. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between TKI out-of-pocket costs, initiation, and health care utilization and costs among patients who initiated TKI within 12 months after initial CML diagnosis. METHODS: Individuals aged 18-64 years with an initial diagnosis of CML were identified in the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database between April 11, 2011, and December 31, 2014. The association between cost sharing and TKI initiation was evaluated using a multivariable logistic regression model applied to patients receiving therapy within a month of diagnosis and within 1-12 months after diagnosis. Health care utilization was compared using negative binomial regression models. Health care cost differences between the 2 patient groups were estimated using generalized linear models. All models were controlled for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 477 patients, with 397 (83.2%) patients initiating TKI within the first month of CML diagnosis and 80 (16.8%) after the first month. Out-of-pocket costs for the initial 30-day supply of TKI medications were not found to be a significant predictor of TKI initiation time. Patients initiating therapy within a month were less likely to have all-cause hospitalizations (IRR = 0.35; P = 0.02) or CML-specific hospitalizations (IRR = 0.27; P < 0.01). Over the 12-month follow-up period, they incurred $9,923 more in TKI pharmacy costs (P < 0.05), but patients initiating therapy after the first month of diagnosis incurred $7,582 more in medical costs, $218 more in non-TKI pharmacy costs, and $2,680 more in total health care costs (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TKI initiation within the first month of diagnosis had higher TKI pharmacy costs that were partially offset by lower medical and non-TKI pharmacy costs, resulting in lower overall total health care costs. Findings suggest that earlier TKI initiation may reduce the risks of hospitalizations, which could result in potential medical cost savings in the first 12 months of treatment.

Now it is well known as one of the telomeropathies, pathognomonically characterized by a triad of reticulate pigmentation of the skin, nail dystrophy, and mucosal leukoplakia. It is a progressive systemic disorder which usually presents with involvement of several family members. Malignancies are increasingly reported. Clinical diagnosis is simple once there is a suspicion, but nowadays genetic diagnosis is advocated. Treatment is symptomatic and organ-oriented. We hereby report an adolescent male who presented with the classical mucocutaneous triad of DC with pancytopenia for four months. Bone marrow examination later revealed evolution of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Liver function tests, imaging, and liver biopsy showed cryptogenic fibrosis with portal hypertension. Chemotherapy was started since hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was not feasible; however, he died very early due to repeated infections before completion of the treatment. AML and liver disease are increasingly reported independently in DC; however, coexistence of both complications in a single patient at first presentation has never been reported earlier.

Epub 2019 Sep 25.,"BACKGROUND: L-asparaginase (L-Asp)-associated thromboembolisms are serious complications in pediatrics patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially at >/=10.0 years old, but the pathogenesis remains to be clarified. PROCEDURE: We conducted a multicenter, prospective study of 72 patients with ALL aged 1.0 to 15.2 years treated with either a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 95-ALL oriented regimen or Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study ALL-02 protocol. We divided patients into each treatment protocol and investigated the dynamic changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis using simultaneous thrombin and plasmin generation assay. Patients' plasma samples were collected at the prephase (T0), intermittent phase (T1), and postphase of L-Asp therapy (T2), and postinduction phase (T3). Measurements of endogenous thrombin potential (T-EP) and plasmin peak height (P-Peak) were compared to normal plasma. RESULTS: None of the cases developed thromboembolisms. Median ratios of T-EP and P-Peak for the controls in the JACLS group were 1.06 and 0.87 (T0), 1.04 and 0.71 (T1), 1.02 and 0.69 (T2), and 1.20 and 0.92 (T3), respectively, while those in the BFM group were 1.06 and 1.00 (T0), 1.04 and 0.64 (T1), 1.16 and 0.58 (T2), and 1.16 and 0.85 (T3), respectively. In particular, P-Peak ratios were depressed at T1 and T2 compared to T0 in the BFM group (P < .01). Moreover, P-Peak ratios in patients >/=10.0 years old were lower at T1 in the BFM group (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that hemostatic dynamics appeared to shift to a hypercoagulable state with marked hypofibrinolysis associated with L-Asp therapy, especially in patients >/=10.0 years old following the BFM regimen.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*L-asparaginase', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*induction therapy', '*thrombin and plasmin generation assay', '*thromboembolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has mainly been achieved through multiagent chemotherapy including CNS prophylaxis and risk-adapted therapy within collaborative clinical trials. However, prognosis in children with refractory or relapsed leukemia remains poor and has not significantly improved despite great efforts. Hence, more effective and less toxic therapies are urgently needed. Our understanding of disease biology, molecular drivers, drug resistance and, thus, the possibility to identify children at high-risk for treatment failure has significantly improved in recent years. Moreover, several new drugs targeting key molecular pathways involved in leukemia development, cell growth, and proliferation have been developed and approved. These striking achievements are linked to the great hope to further improve survival in children with refractory and relapsed leukemia. This review gives an overview on current molecularly targeted therapies in children with leukemia, including kinase, and proteasome inhibitors, epigenetic and enzyme targeting, as well as apoptosis regulators among others.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['children', 'leukemia', 'molecular approaches', 'precision medicine', 'targeted therapy']",PMC6742719,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells physiologically increase in number in immune response to certain allergies, chronic inflammation, and parasitic infections. Basophils are also a significant indicator for the presence of certain malignancies such as chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms and acute myeloid leukemia. In the current manuscript we present a statistically significant correlation between persistent basophilia in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and the risk for the subsequent development of acute myeloid leukemia. We have retrospectively identified in the files of the Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center in Cluj Napoca, Romania 623 consecutive patients diagnosed with AML over a period spanning from 2008 to 2018. We afterwards identified 32 patients with AML diagnosis following a previous diagnosis of myelofibrosis (either post-PV, post-ET, or post-PMF). All the patients were diagnosed according to the WHO criteria. We subsequently established a control group consisting of 32 patients with underlying BCR-ABL-negative MPN who did not develop AML (AML-negative group). Following this, we assessed whether the AML-negative patients from our control group also had a persistent (>3 months) absolute basophilia. When comparing both groups of patients with myelofibrosis, the group with subsequent AML development and the one without AML, the follow-up did not present statistically significant differences between the two groups. In the univariate analysis, patients who progressed to AML had more frequently basophilia, longer basophilia duration, higher pre-therapy absolute, and relative basophil count and presented more frequently calreticulin (CALR) mutations. In the current study, we emphasize the need for a closer clinical monitoring for chronic MPNs with marked basophilia, with an important potential clinical impact.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['accelerated phase', 'basophilia', 'clinical prognosis', 'leukemic transformation', 'primary myelofibrosis']",PMC6742718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are for complete hematological response after 3 months of treatment, complete cytogenetic response after 6 months, and a reduction of the molecular disease of at least 3 logs after 12 months. Patients who do not reach their goal can switch to another TKI. Thus, the molecular monitoring of response is the main consideration of management of CML patients. Moreover, cases in deep and persistent molecular response can tempt the physician to interrupt treatment, and this ""dream"" is possible due to the quantitative PCR. After great international effort, today the BCR-ABL1 expression obtained in each laboratory is standardized and expressed as ""international scale."" This aim has been reached after the establishment of the EUTOS program (in Europe) and the LabNet network (in Italy), the platforms where biologists meet clinicians. In the field of quantitative PCR, the digital PCR is now a new and promising, sensitive and accurate tool. Some authors reported that digital PCR is able to better classify patients in precise ""molecular classes,"" which could lead to a better identification of those cases that will benefit from the interruption of therapy. In addition, digital PCR can be used to identify a point mutation in the ABL1 domain, mutations that are often responsible for the TKI resistance. In the field of resistance, a prominent role is played by the NGS that enables identification of any mutation in ABL1 domain, even at sub-clonal levels.

The standardized and most commonly applied methods to assess MRD in CLL are based on flow cytometry (FCM) and, to a lesser extent, real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) with allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) primers of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgH). Promising results are being obtained using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and next generation sequencing (NGS)-based approaches, with some advantages and a potential higher sensitivity compared to the standardized methodologies. Plasma cell-free DNA can also be explored as a more precise measure of residual disease from all different compartments, including the lymph nodes. From a clinical point of view, CLL MRD quantification has proven an independent prognostic marker of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after chemoimmunotherapy as well as after allogeneic transplantation. In the era of mechanism-driven drugs, the paradigms of CLL treatment are being revolutionized, challenging the use of chemoimmunotherapy even in first-line. The continuous administration of ibrutinib single agent has led to prolonged PFS and OS in relapsed/refractory and treatment naive CLL, including those with TP53 deletion/mutation or unmutated IGHV genes, though the clinical responses are rarely complete. More recently, chemo-free combinations of venetoclax+rituximab, venetoclax+obinutuzumab or ibrutinib+venetoclax have been shown capable of inducing undetectable MRD in the bone marrow, opening the way to protocols exploring a MRD-based duration of treatment, aiming at disease eradication. Thus, beside a durable disease control desirable particularly for older patients and/or for those with comorbidities, a MRD-negative complete remission is becoming a realistic prospect for CLL patients in an attempt to obtain a long-lasting eradication and possibly cure of the disease. Here we discuss the standardized and innovative technical approaches for MRD detection in CLL, the clinical impact of MRD monitoring in chemoimmunotherapy and chemo-free trials and the future clinical implications of MRD monitoring in CLL patients outside of clinical trials.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'droplet digital PCR', 'flow cytometry', 'ibrutinib', 'minimal residual disease', 'next generation sequencing', 'venetoclax']",PMC6727319,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Feb 4.,"Background: Overall survival (OS) in glioblastoma (GBM) is poor at an average of 14 to 18 months, and long-term survivors (LTS) of GBM are rare. LTS of GBM, defined as surviving >5 years postdiagnosis, represent only 2% to 10% of all GBM patients. LTS of cancer are at high risk of developing second primary neoplasms. This study looks at occurrences of second primary neoplasms in LTS of GBM. Methods: Records from adult patients newly diagnosed with GBM between January 1, 1998 and February 8, 2010, were retrospectively reviewed to identify LTS, defined as patients who survived >/=5 years. We focused on the identification of a new diagnosis of cancer occurring at least 2 years after the initial GBM diagnosis. Results: We identified 155 LTS of GBM, with a median OS of 11.0 years (95% CI: 9.0 to 13.1 years) and a median follow-up of 9.6 years (95% CI: 8.7 to 10.7 years). In this cohort of patients, 13 (8.4%) LTS of GBM developed 17 secondary cancers. Eight could potentially be attributed to previous radiation and chemotherapy (skin cancer in radiation field [n = 4], leukemia [n = 2], low-grade glioma [n = 1], and sarcoma of the scalp [n = 1]). The other 9 cases included melanoma (n = 2), prostate cancer (n = 2), bladder cancer (n = 1), endometrioid adenocarcinoma (n = 1), basal cell carcinoma (n = 1), and renal cell carcinoma (n = 1). Conclusions: Although second primary cancers are rare in GBM LTS, providers should continue close monitoring with appropriate oncologic care. Moreover, this highlights the need for survivorship care of patients with GBM.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'glioblastoma', 'long-term survivors', 'radiation therapy', 'second primary neoplasm']",PMC6753354,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the literature reports limited effort to identify the target major isoform of a single known target gene. The majority of genes generate multiple transcripts that are translated into proteins that may carry out distinct and even opposing biological functions through alternative splicing. In addition, isoform expression is dynamic and varies depending on the developmental stage and cell type. To identify target major isoforms, we integrated a breast cancer type-specific isoform coexpression network with gene perturbation signatures in the MCF7 cell line in the Connectivity Map database using the 'shortest path' drug target prioritization method. We used a leukemia cancer network and differential expression data for drugs in the HL-60 cell line to test the robustness of the detection algorithm for target major isoforms. We further analyzed the properties of target major isoforms for each multi-isoform gene using pharmacogenomic datasets, proteomic data and the principal isoforms defined by the APPRIS and STRING datasets. Then, we tested our predictions for the most promising target major protein isoforms of DNMT1, MGEA5 and P4HB4 based on expression data and topological features in the coexpression network. Interestingly, these isoforms are not annotated as principal isoforms in APPRIS. Lastly, we tested the affinity of the target major isoform of MGEA5 for streptozocin through in silico docking. Our findings will pave the way for more effective and targeted therapies via studies of drug targets at the isoform level.",,,,,PMC6761107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive studies have implicated this gene's role in maintaining and replicating normal hematopoietic stem cells, as well as its role as an oncogene when aberrantly expressed. Translocations involving the MECOM gene at 3q26.2 are well-documented and characterized in myeloid disorders, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and is associated with a poor prognosis. Recently, cases of MECOM rearrangements and activation have also been documented in lymphoid malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and persistent polyclonal binucleated B-cell lymphoma (PBBL). A review of the literature reveals four confirmed cases of MECOM cytogenetic abnormalities in lymphoid disorders, each of which could potentially implicate MECOM in the development or transformation of lymphoid disease. In two cases, a B-cell ALL (B-ALL) case and a T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma case, the MECOM aberration was the sole abnormality, suggesting that it may have an important role in the development of the disease. In the other two cases, a case of 5q- syndrome and a case of plasma cell myeloma, both acquired a MECOM aberration as the cases transformed to ALL, potentially implying that it has a role in ALL disease transformation. There were also 82 cases of PBBL with inv(3) in particular as the MECOM abnormality of interest. In the literature, there were also mentions of at least 38 other cases of MECOM aberrant activation, but these cases may or may not involve 3q26.2 rearrangement. MECOM overexpression may also develop independently of any chromosomal rearrangement, with other possible pathways involved. A query of the Mitelman Database of Chromosomal Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer revealed another 12 cases where 3q26 rearrangements were reported in lymphoid malignancies, but none of these studies performed fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) to confirm or deny the presence of a MECOM rearrangement. Recent findings also demonstrate that MECOM may also play an important role in lymphoid leukemogenesis, progression, and transformation, although it may be in a manner distinct from that in myeloid malignancies. Overall, MECOM still needs to be further characterized and investigated in the context of lymphoid malignancies as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.",['Copyright(c) by the Association of Genetic Technologists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

targeting CD19 provide promising options for treatment of B cell malignancies. However, tumor relapse from antigen loss can limit efficacy. We developed humanized, second-generation CAR T cells against another B cell-specific marker, B cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), which demonstrated cytotoxicity against human lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) lines. Adoptively transferred BAFF-R-CAR T cells eradicated 10-day preestablished tumor xenografts after a single treatment and retained efficacy against xenografts deficient in CD19 expression, including CD19-negative variants within a background of CD19-positive lymphoma cells. Four relapsed, primary ALLs with CD19 antigen loss obtained after CD19-directed therapy retained BAFF-R expression and activated BAFF-R-CAR, but not CD19-CAR, T cells. BAFF-R-CAR, but not CD19-CAR, T cells also demonstrated antitumor effects against an additional CD19 antigen loss primary patient-derived xenograft (PDX) in vivo. BAFF-R is amenable to CAR T cell therapy, and its targeting may prevent emergence of CD19 antigen loss variants.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

The early erythroid progenitor, burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), has substantial self-renewal potential and serves as a key cell type for the treatment of anemias. However, our understanding of mechanisms underlying BFU-E self-renewal is extremely limited. Here, we found that the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 4 (CHRM4), pathway regulates BFU-E self-renewal and that pharmacological inhibition of CHRM4 corrects anemias of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), aging, and hemolysis. Genetic down-regulation of CHRM4 or pharmacologic inhibition of CHRM4 using the selective antagonist PD102807 promoted BFU-E self-renewal, whereas deletion of Chrm4 increased erythroid cell production under stress conditions in vivo. Moreover, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists corrected anemias in mouse models of MDS, aging, and hemolysis in vivo, extending the survival of mice with MDS relative to that of controls. The effects of muscarinic receptor antagonism on promoting expansion of BFU-Es were mediated by cyclic AMP induction of the transcription factor CREB, whose targets up-regulated key regulators of BFU-E self-renewal. On the basis of these data, we propose a model of hematopoietic progenitor self-renewal through a cholinergic-mediated ""hematopoietic reflex"" and identify muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists as potential therapies for anemias associated with MDS, aging, and hemolysis.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Epub 2019 Sep 25.,"Hepatic immune system is uniquely challenged to mount a controlled effector response to pathogens while maintaining tolerance to diet and microbial Ags. We have identified a novel population of innate-like, unconventional CD8alphaalpha(+)TCRalphabeta(+) T cells in naive mice and in human peripheral blood, called CD8alphaalpha Tunc, capable of controlling effector T cell responses. They are NK1.1(+) (CD161(+) in human), express NK-inhibitory receptors, and express the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) transcription factor that distinguishes them from conventional CD8(+) T cells. These cells display a cytotoxic phenotype and use a perforin-dependent mechanism to control Ag-induced or T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. CD8alphaalpha Tunc are dependent upon IL-15/IL-2Rbeta signaling and PLZF for their development and/or survival. They are Foxp3-negative and their regulatory activity is associated with a functionally distinct Qa-1(b)-dependent population coexpressing CD11c and CD244. A polyclonal TCR repertoire, an activated/memory phenotype, and the presence of CD8alphaalpha Tunc in NKT- and in MAIT-deficient as well as in germ-free mice indicates that these cells recognize diverse self-protein Ags. Our studies reveal a distinct population of unconventional CD8(+) T cells within the natural immune repertoire capable of controlling autoimmunity and also providing a new target for therapeutic intervention.","['Copyright (c) 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",['R01 AI052227/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC6783388,,['NIHMS1538269'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2019 Dec 1.,"In 2010, sporadic cases of avian leukosis virus (ALV)-like bursal lymphoma, also known as spontaneous lymphoid leukosis (LL)-like tumors, were identified in two commercial broiler breeder flocks in the absence of exogenous ALV infection. Two individual ALV subgroup E (ALV-E) field strains, designated AF227 and AF229, were isolated from two different breeder farms. The role of these ALV-E field isolates in development of and the potential joint impact in conjunction with a Marek's disease virus (MDV) vaccine (SB-1) were further characterized in chickens of an experimental line and commercial broiler breeders. The experimental line 0.TVB*S1, commonly known as the rapid feathering-susceptible (RFS) line, of chickens lacks all endogenous ALV and is fully susceptible to all subgroups of ALV, including ALV-E. Spontaneous LL-like tumors occurred following infection with AF227, AF229, and a reference ALV-E strain, RAV60, in RFS chickens. Vaccination with serotype 2 MDV, SB-1, in addition to AF227 or AF229 inoculation, significantly enhanced the spontaneous LL-like tumor incidence in the RFS chickens. The spontaneous LL-like tumor incidence jumped from 14% by AF227 alone to 42 to 43% by AF227 in combination with SB-1 in the RFS chickens under controlled conditions. RNA-sequencing analysis of the LL-like lymphomas and nonmalignant bursa tissues of the RFS line of birds identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes that are reportedly involved in key biological processes and pathways, including signaling and signal transduction pathways. The data from this study suggested that both ALV-E and MDV-2 play an important role in enhancement of the spontaneous LL-like tumors in susceptible chickens. The underlying mechanism may be complex and involved in many chicken genes and pathways, including signal transduction pathways and immune system processes, in addition to reported viral genes.IMPORTANCE Lymphoid leukosis (LL)-like lymphoma is a low-incidence yet costly and poorly understood disease of domestic chickens. The observed unique characteristics of LL-like lymphomas are that the incidence of the disease is chicken line dependent; pathologically, it appeared to mimic avian leukosis but is free of exogenous ALV infection; inoculation of the nonpathogenic ALV-E or MDV-2 (SB-1) boosts the incidence of the disease; and inoculation of both the nonpathogenic ALV-E and SB-1 escalates it to much higher levels. This study was designed to test the impact of two new ALV-E isolates, recently derived from commercial broiler breeder flocks, in combination with the nonpathogenic SB-1 on LL-like lymphoma incidences in both an experimental egg layer line of chickens and a commercial broiler breeder line of chickens under a controlled condition. Data from this study provided an additional piece of experimental evidence on the potency of nonpathogenic ALV-E, MDV-2, and ALV-E plus MDV-2 in boosting the incidence of LL-like lymphomas in susceptible chickens. This study also generated the first piece of genomic evidence that suggests host transcriptomic variation plays an important role in modulating LL-like lymphoma formation.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Mays et al.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*differentially expressed genes', '*endogenous retrovirus', '*genetic resistance', ""*serotype 2 Marek's disease virus"", '*signaling pathways', '*spontaneous tumors']",PMC6854487,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2019 Nov.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the risk factors, clinical course, and treatment of patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) diagnosed and followed over a 25-year epoch at 2 academic hospitals. METHODS: Patients with a definite diagnosis of PML were identified by positive CSF PCR for JC virus or histopathology between January 1, 1994, and January 1, 2019. Demographic and PML-specific variables were recorded on symptomatic presentation and at follow-up, including risk factors, clinical outcome, neuroimaging findings, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at last follow-up. RESULTS: There were 91 patients with confirmed PML. HIV infection was the most common risk factor, identified in 49% (n = 45). Other frequent risk factors included lymphoma, leukemia, or myelodysplasia, identified in 31% of patients (n = 28); exposure to chemotherapeutic medications (30%, n = 27); and exposure to monoclonal antibody therapies (19%, n = 17). Thirty percent of the cohort was alive at the time of censoring, with a median mRS of 2 points, indicating slight disability at last follow-up. Median survival following PML diagnosis in HIV-infected patients was longer than in HIV-uninfected patients (1,992 vs 101 days, p = 0.024). Forty patients survived more than 1 year after PML symptom onset, of whom 24 were HIV infected (60%). Thirteen patients survived more than 10 years after PML symptom onset, all HIV infected, of the 59 patients diagnosed before June 1, 2009, and eligible for 10-year survivor status (22%). CONCLUSIONS: We add to the limited literature on PML by reporting its epidemiology in a large observational cohort. These parameters may be useful for future clinical trials that measure survival and clinical outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s).

We assessed both reduction of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels (TLs) and achievement of MRD negativity (MRD-) for impact on prognosis. Achievement of MR2.5 (>2.5 log reduction) after treatment cycle 1 and achievement of MR3.0 after treatment cycle 2 were significantly associated with a reduced risk of relapse (P = .034 and P = .028, respectively). After completion of therapy, achievement of MRD- in both BM and PB was an independent, favorable prognostic factor in cumulative incidence of relapse (4-year cumulative incidence relapse: BM, 17% vs 36%, P = .021; PB, 23% vs 55%, P = .001) and overall survival (4-year overall survival rate BM, 93% vs 70%, P = .007; PB, 87% vs 47%, P < .0001). Finally, during follow-up, serial qRT-PCR analyses allowed prediction of relapse in 77% of patients exceeding a cutoff value of 150 RUNX1-RUNX1T1 TLs in BM, and in 84% of patients exceeding a value of 50 RUNX1-RUNX1T1 TLs in PB. The KIT mutation was a significant factor predicting a lower CR rate and inferior outcome, but its prognostic impact was outweighed by RUNX1-RUNX1T1 TLs during treatment.

To date in Indonesia, it has not been obtained data on the incidence of hyperglycemia in children with ALL in the induction phase and how the role of combinations of L-asparaginase and different type of steroid used. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of hyperglycemia in children ALL induction phase, knowing the difference between prednisone and dexamethasone (in combination with L-asparaginase) in causing hyperglycemia in children with ALL and determine the relationship of other factors related to hyperglycaemia. Methods: This was a prospective analytic study with a pre- and post-test design, conducted in three hospitals (Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Dharmais Cancer Hospital, and Gatot Soebroto Hospital). Patient's blood glucose levels (BGL) were checked at the 3rd (pretest), 4th, 5th and 6th week of protocol (post-test). Result: Of the 57 patients, 5.2% had hyperglycemia. The patients' age ranged from 1.4 years old to 15.8 years old (6.7 years old). There was no relationship between age, central nervous system (CNS) infiltration, leukocytosis, Down syndrome, nutritional status, family history of diabetes, infections and ALL stratification with hyperglycemia (p>0.05). Dexamethasone has more chance of obtaining higher mean rate of change in BGL compared to prednisone. (p < 0.05; RR 10.68; CI 95% 1.52-74.73). Conclusion: The incidence of hyperglycemia in this study is 5.2%.

This epigenetic modification is usually grouped in regions denominated CpG islands, which frequently co-localize with gene promoters, silencing the transcription of those genes. Recent genome-wide DNA methylation studies have challenged this paradigm, demonstrating that DNA methylation of regulatory regions outside promoters is able to influence cell-type specific gene expression programs under physiologic or pathologic conditions. Coupling genome-wide DNA methylation assays with histone mark annotation has allowed for the identification of specific epigenomic changes that affect enhancer regulatory regions, revealing an additional layer of complexity to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. In this review, we summarize the novel evidence for the molecular and biological regulation of DNA methylation in enhancer regions and the dynamism of these changes contributing to the fine-tuning of gene expression. We also analyze the contribution of enhancer DNA methylation on the expression of relevant genes in acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. The characterization of the aberrant enhancer DNA methylation provides not only a novel pathogenic mechanism for different tumors but also highlights novel potential therapeutic targets for myeloid derived neoplasms.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Enhancer regions', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'myeloid neoplasms', 'myeloproliferative neoplasms']",PMC6827153,,,,,,,,['Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jul 13;12(7):.

The goal of the current study was to conduct a pilot randomized trial of the first cognitive behavioral intervention developed for fatigue due to targeted therapy. METHODS: Patients with CML treated with a TKI who were reporting moderate to severe fatigue were recruited and randomized 2:1 to cognitive behavioral therapy for targeted therapy-related fatigue (CBT-TTF) delivered via FaceTime for the iPad or to a waitlist control (WLC) group. The outcomes were acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy for fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue; primary outcome) and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General; secondary outcome). Participants were assessed before randomization and after treatment (ie, approximately 18 weeks later). RESULTS: A total of 44 patients (mean age, 55 years; 48% female) were assigned to CBT-TTF (n = 29) or WLC (n = 15). The study participation rate was 59%. Among the patients assigned to CBT-TTF, 79% completed the intervention. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that patients assigned to CBT-TTF demonstrated greater improvements in fatigue (d = 1.06; P < .001) and overall quality of life (d = 1.15; P = .005) than those assigned to WLC. More patients randomized to CBT-TTF than WLC demonstrated clinically significant improvements in fatigue (85% vs 29%) and quality of life (88% vs 54%; P values </= .016). CONCLUSIONS: CBT-TTF displays preliminary efficacy in improving fatigue and quality of life among fatigued patients with CML treated with TKIs.

ALV could be detected quantitatively using the ratio of fluorescence signals of the test and control lines (T/C). The assay threshold was determined as a T/C value of 0.0606. The fitting curve equation was established between 1 and 2,048 ng/mL P27 protein with an r2 value of 0.9998. The assay showed no cross reactivity with Newcastle disease virus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Marek's disease virus, infectious bursal disease, Reoviridae virus, or avian influenza virus. The repeatability was satisfactory with an overall average CV of 8.65%. The Kappa coefficient between a commercial ELISA kit was 0.7031 using clinical chicken meconium samples. Thus, a simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific fluorescent microsphere immunochromatographic test strip was developed based on specific anti-capsid protein p27 monoclonal antibodies.",['(c) 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['T/C value', 'avian leukosis virus', 'fitting curve equation', 'fluorescent microsphere immunochromatographic test strip']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen compounds had high cytotoxicity on the T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM and 6 of them were active in multiple cell lines of various histogenic origin and not toxic in fibroblasts. Compound 11a had IC50 of 0.64 muM in CCRF-CEM cells, 0.60 muM in K-562 cells, and 0.37 muM in PC-3 cells; compound 12a had IC50 of 0.64 muM in CCRF-CEM cells and 0.71 muM in SW620 cells; compound 17b had IC50 of 0.86 muM in HCT116 cells and 0.92 muM in PC-3 cells. Compounds 11b and 12b were slightly less active than the previously mentioned derivatives; however, their solubility was significantly better, and therefore they were selected for the in vivo evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile in mice. In both compounds, the maximum concentration in plasma was achieved very rapidly-the highest level in plasma was found 1 h after administration (22.2, respectively, 6.4 muM). For compound 12b, the resorption was followed with fast elimination, and 12 h after administration, the compound was not detected in plasma. In contrast, compound 11b was eliminated more slowly; it was still present in plasma after 12 h, but its concentration dropped below the detection limit after 24 h. The elimination half-time determined for compound 11b was 2.4 h and for compound 12b just about 1.4 h. These values are reasonable for further drug development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 25.,"BACKGROUND: Dasatinib, a potent Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) in the frontline and salvage settings. Notable side effects include pleural effusions and myelosuppression. Dasatinib at 50 mg daily has previously been reported to be active and better tolerated than the approved 100-mg daily dose. The aim of this study was to update the long-term follow-up results of dasatinib at 50 mg daily as frontline therapy for CML-CP. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP received dasatinib at 50 mg daily. Eligibility and response criteria were standards used in previous protocols. RESULTS: After a minimum follow-up of 12 months, 81 patients were evaluable. Two patients came off the study in less than 3 months. The rates of BCR-ABL1 transcript levels (International Standard) at </=10% and </=1% at 3 months were 96% and 77%, respectively. The cumulative rates for a complete cytogenetic response by 6 and 12 months were 77% and 95%, respectively. The cumulative rates for a major molecular response, a molecular response with a 4.0-log reduction, and a molecular response with a 4.5-log reduction by 12 months were 81%, 55%, and 49%, respectively. Twenty-one patients (25%) had treatment interruptions for a median of 13 days (range, 4-64 days). Five patients (6%) developed pleural effusions; 4 of these patients (80%) required a dose reduction. Two patients (2%) failed to achieve any cytogenetic or molecular response and were taken off the study. At a median follow-up of 24 months, none of the patients had disease transformation to an accelerated or blastic phase. The 2-year event-free and overall survival rates were 100%. CONCLUSIONS: These updated results continue to support 50 mg of dasatinib daily as an effective and safe dose for early CML-CP.",['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*complete cytogenetic response', '*dasatinib', '*major molecular response']",PMC8529949,,['NIHMS1615545'],['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02689440'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies found increased rates of lymphoma and leukemia in BCG-vaccinated populations. Objective: To determine whether BCG vaccination was associated with cancer rates in a secondary analysis of a BCG vaccine trial. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective review (60-year follow-up) of a clinical trial in which participants were assigned to the vaccine group by systematic stratification by school district, age, and sex, then randomized by alternation. The original study was conducted at 9 sites in 5 US states between December 1935 and December 1998. Participants were 2963 American Indian and Alaska Native schoolchildren younger than 20 years with no evidence of previous tuberculosis infection. Statistical analysis was conducted between August 2018 and July 2019. Interventions: Single intradermal injection of either BCG vaccine or saline placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was diagnosis of cancer after BCG vaccination. Data on participant interval health and risk factors, including smoking, tuberculosis infection, isoniazid use, and other basic demographic information, were also collected. Results: A total of 2963 participants, including 1540 in the BCG vaccine group and 1423 in the placebo group, remained after exclusions. Vaccination occurred at a median (interquartile range) age of 8 (5-11) years; 805 participants (52%) in the BCG group and 710 (50%) in the placebo group were female. At the time of follow-up, 97 participants (7%) in the placebo group and 106 participants (7%) in the BCG vaccine group could not be located; total mortality was 633 participants (44%) in the placebo group and 632 participants (41%) in the BCG group. The overall rate of cancer diagnosis was not significantly different in BCG vaccine vs placebo recipients (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66-1.02), including for lymphoma and leukemia. The rate of lung cancer was significantly lower in BCG vs placebo recipients (18.2 vs 45.4 cases per 100000 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.74; P = .005), controlling for sex, region, alcohol overuse, smoking, and tuberculosis. Conclusions and Relevance: Childhood BCG vaccination was associated with a lower risk of lung cancer development in American Indian and Alaska Native populations. This finding has potentially important health implications given the high mortality rate associated with lung cancer and the availability of low-cost BCG vaccines.",,,,,PMC6763973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that early mouse embryos inherit active Akt from oocytes and that the intracellular localization of this enzyme at the two-cell stage depends on the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 oncogenic protein, Tcl1. We have now investigated whether Akt isoforms, namely Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3, exert a specific role in blastomere proliferation during preimplantation embryo development. We show that, in contrast to other Akt family members, Akt2 enters male and female pronuclei of mouse preimplantation embryos at the late one-cell stage and thereafter maintains a nuclear localization during later embryo cleavage stages. Depleting one-cell embryos of single Akt family members by microinjecting Akt isoform-specific antibodies into wild-type zygotes, we observed that: (a) Akt2 is necessary for normal embryo progression through cleavage stages; and (b) the specific nuclear targeting of Akt2 in two-cell embryos depends on Tcl1. Our results indicate that preimplantation mouse embryos have a peculiar regulation of blastomere proliferation based on the activity of the Akt/PKB family member Akt2, which is mediated by the oncogenic protein Tcl1. Both Akt2 and Tcl1 are essential for early blastomere proliferation and embryo development.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Akt/PKB isoforms', '*Akt2', '*Tcl1', '*mouse preimplantation embryos']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ongoing research efforts are focused on employing CAR-T cells as a therapy for other cancers, and enhancing their efficacy and safety by optimizing their design. Here we summarize modifications in the intracellular domain of the CAR that gave rise to first-, second-, third- and next-generation CAR-T cells, together with the impact that these different designs have on CAR-T cell biology and function. Further, we describe how the structure of the antigen-sensing ectodomain can be enhanced, leading to superior CAR-T cell signaling and/or function. Finally we discuss how tissue-specific factors may impact the clinical efficacy of CAR-T cells for bone and the central nervous system, as examples of specific indications that may require further CAR signaling optimization to perform in such inhospitable microenvironments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main products used in clinical treatment are L-asparaginase enzymes derived from Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi. However, a very active area of research is the identification and characterisation of potential new L-asparaginase therapeutics, from existing or novel prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources, including mutations to improve function. In this review, we discuss the critical factors necessary to adequately characterise novel L-asparaginase therapeutic products, including enzyme kinetic parameters, glutaminase activity, and toxicity. One critical consideration is to ensure that the substrate affinity of novel enzymes, as measured by the Michaelis constant KM, is sufficiently low to enable efficient reaction rates in human clinical use. The activity of L-asparaginases towards glutamine as a substrate is discussed and reviewed in detail, as there is much debate in the scientific literature about the importance of this feature for therapeutic enzymes. The recent research in the area is reviewed, including identification of new sources of the enzyme, modulating glutaminase activity, and improving the thermal stability and immunogenic response. New research in the area may benefit from these considerations, to enable the next generation of therapeutic product design. Critical to future work in this area is a complete characterisation of novel enzymes with respect to performance for both L-asparagine and L-glutamine as substrates.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Erwinia chrysanthemi', 'Escherichia coli', 'L-asparaginase', 'Leukaemia', 'Therapeutic enzyme']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SALL4 is expressed constitutively in human leukemia cell lines and primary AML cells. BMI-1 is expressed highly in purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and its expression declines with differentiation. OBJECTIVE: To study the expression levels of SALL4 and BMI-1 and their clinical significance in patients with AML. METHODS: The study was performed with 60 patients newly diagnosed with AML and 50 control individuals. SALL4 and BMI-1 expression detection were performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The expression of SALL4 and BMI-1 was significantly higher in cases of AML and showed a strong association with failure to achieve complete remission (CR) or with relapse (P = .02, P = .03, respectively). In multivariate analysis, these genes were the most powerful independent predictors of poor prognosis (P = .01 for SALL4, P = .02 for BMI-1). CONCLUSION: SALL4 and BMI-1 are significant prognostic factors in AML and could be strong targets for novel types of therapy.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology 2019.

The selective advantage of increased proliferation, improved survival, and reduced differentiation on leukemia progression is immediately obvious. Recent large-scale sequencing efforts have uncovered numerous novel AML-associated mutations. Interestingly, a substantial fraction of the most frequently mutated genes encode general regulators of transcription and chromatin state. Understanding the selective advantage conferred by these mutations remains a major challenge. A striking example are mutations in genes of the cohesin complex, a major regulator of three-dimensional genome organization. Several landmark studies have shown that cohesin mutations perturb the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). Emerging data now begin to uncover the molecular mechanisms that underpin this phenotype. Among these mechanisms is a role for cohesin in the control of inflammatory responses in HSPCs and myeloid cells. Inflammatory signals limit HSPC self-renewal and drive HSPC differentiation. Consistent with this, cohesin mutations promote resistance to inflammatory signals, and may provide a selective advantage for AML progression. In this review, we discuss recent progress in understanding cohesin mutations in AML, and speculate whether vulnerabilities associated with these mutations could be exploited therapeutically.",,"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_U120027516/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'cohesin', 'hematopoiesis', 'inflammation', 'interferon', 'leukemia']",PMC6746210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biological and pathogenic importance of Hh signaling emphasizes the need to control its action tightly, both physiologically and therapeutically. Evidence of crosstalk between Hh and other signaling pathways is reported in many tumor types. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge about the communication between Hh and major signaling pathways, such as Notch, Wnt, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), which play critical roles in both embryonic and adult life. When these pathways are unbalanced, impaired crosstalk contributes to disease development. It is reported that more than one of these pathways are active in different type of tumors, at the same time. Therefore, starting from a plethora of stimuli that activate multiple signaling pathways, we describe the signals that preferentially converge on the Hh signaling cascade that influence its activity. Moreover, we highlight several connection points between Hh and Notch, Wnt, or TGF-beta pathways, showing a reciprocal synergism that contributes to tumorigenesis, supporting a more malignant behavior by tumor cells, such as in leukemia and brain tumors. Understanding the importance of these molecular interlinking networks will provide a rational basis for combined anticancer drug development.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hedgehog', 'Notch', 'TGF-beta', 'Wnt', 'signaling pathway', 'tumorigenesis']",PMC6736567,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study Design: This is a single-center retrospective observational study, including all patients who underwent elective fertility preservation before oncological treatment between January 2001 and March 2019 at our Institute. Results: Of a total of 568 women who received fertility counseling, 244 (42.9%) underwent 252 oocyte retrieval cycles after controlled ovarian stimulation for cryopreservation. The majority of patients were diagnosed with breast cancer (59.9%), followed by women affected by Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (27.4%). A minority comprised patients diagnosed with other malignancies that affected soft tissues (2.8%), ovary borderline type (2.4%), digestive system (1.6%), leukemia (1.6%), uterine cervix (1.2%). The remaining 3.1% were affected by other cancer types. The mean age of the cohort was 31.3 +/- 6.4 years and the mean oocyte retrieval was 13.5+/- 8.4. Of 11 women who returned to attempt a pregnancy, three performed two thawed cycles. We obtained four pregnancies from 24 embryo transfers (Pregnancy Rate 36.4% for couple): two miscarriages and two live births. Overall, 95.7% of oocytes are still in storage. Conclusions: A close collaboration between Cancer and Fertility Center in a tertiary care hospital is essential to provide a good health service in oncological patients. Offering fertility preservation is no longer considered optional and must be included in every therapeutic program for women who receive an oncological diagnosis in their reproductive age. Oocyte cryopreservation appears to be a good opportunity for fertility preservation. Our results, although they are obtained in a small sample, are encouraging, even if only 4.5% of patients returned to use their gametes.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'fertility preservation', 'oocyte', 'pregnancy outcome', 'vitrification']",PMC6733913,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, through reconstitution of cells lacking all eight pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, we demonstrate that all BH3-only proteins primarily target the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins BCL-xL/MCL-1, whose simultaneous suppression enables membrane-mediated spontaneous activation of BAX/BAK. BH3-only proteins' apoptotic activities correlate with affinities for BCL-xL/MCL-1 instead of abilities to directly activate BAX/BAK. Further, BID and BIM do not distinguish BAX from BAK or accelerate BAX/BAK activation following inactivation of BCL-xL/MCL-1. Remarkably, death ligand-induced apoptosis in cells lacking BH3-only proteins and MCL-1 is fully restored by BID mutants capable of neutralizing BCL-xL, but not direct activation of BAX/BAK.

Between 2008 and 2017, we collected data from 236 patients (median age 31 years; range 16-64; 90% HCT-CI 0-1) who underwent unmanipulated ASCT in first complete remission and subsequent remissions in 15 Argentinian centers. Donors were HLA-matched (n = 175; 74%) and Haplo (n = 61; 26%). Two-year overall survival (OS) was 55% (95% CI 47-63) for the HLA-matched group and 49% (95% CI 34-62) for the Haplo group (p = 0.351). For OS, crude HR, adjusted HR for covariates (HR 1.24; 95% CI 0.77-1.99; p = 0.363) and HR including a propensity score in the model (HR 1.22; 95% CI 0.71-2.08; p = 0.414) showed no impact of donor category on the OS. No difference was found in terms of nonrelapse mortality, relapse, leukemia-free survival, and grade 3-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); 2-year incidence of chronic GVHD was higher in HLA-matched vs Haplo group (p = 0.028). Patients with ALL who underwent ASCT were young subjects with low HCT-CI. In this setting, a Haplo donor represents an alternative widely available in the absence of an HLA-matched donor.

These fusions have also been identified in more common cancers, such as lung and colorectal carcinomas, albeit at low frequencies. Patients harboring these fusions demonstrate significant clinical response to inhibitors such as entrectinib and larotrectinib. Although current trials have focused entirely on solid tumors, there is evidence supporting the use of these drugs for patients with leukemia. To assess the broader applicability for Trk inhibitors in hematological malignancies, this review describes the current state of knowledge about alterations in the NTRK family in these disorders. We present these findings in relation to the discovery and therapeutic targeting of BCR-ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia. The advent of deep sequencing technologies has shown that NTRK fusions and somatic mutations are present in a variety of hematologic malignancies. Efficacy of Trk inhibitors has been demonstrated in NTRK-fusion positive human leukemia cell lines and patient-derived xenograft studies, highlighting the potential clinical utility of these inhibitors for a subset of leukemia patients.",,['F30 CA239335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC7410820,,['NIHMS1613766'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the introduction of highly efficient AR signalling inhibitors, approximately 20% of mCRPC patients develop disease with AR independent resistance mechanisms. In this study, we generated two anti-androgen and castration resistant prostate cancer cell models that do not rely on AR activity for growth despite robust AR expression (AR indifferent). They are thus resistant against all modern AR signalling inhibitors. Both cell lines display cross-resistance against the chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel due to MCL1 upregulation but remain sensitive to the PARP inhibitor olaparib and the pan-BCL inhibitor obatoclax. RNA-seq analysis of the anti-androgen resistant cell lines identified hyper-activation of the E2F cell-cycle master regulator as driver of AR indifferent growth, which was caused by deregulation of cyclin D/E, E2F1, RB1, and increased Myc activity. Importantly, mCRPC tissue samples with low AR activity displayed the same alterations and increased E2F activity. In conclusion, we describe two cellular models that faithfully mimic the acquisition of a treatment induced AR independent phenotype that is cross-resistant against chemotherapy and driven by E2F hyper-activation.",,,,,PMC6760229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated whether or not the genomic variants 500 base pairs flanking the nine transplantation-related SNPs were related to the risk of post-HSCT relapse for patients with leukemia (n = 141). The genomic DNAs collected from 85 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 56 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and their respective HLA-matched donors were subject to SNPs analysis, conferred by the mode of mismatch between donor-recipient pair or by recipient or donor genotype analysis. Seven SNPs were revealed to associate with the risk of relapse post-HSCT. For patients with AML, the increased risk of post-HSCT relapse was associated with the donor SNP of rs111394117 in the intron of NOTCH4 gene, and the recipient SNPs of rs213210 in the ring finger protein 1 (RING1) gene promoter, and rs17220087 and rs17213693 in the intron of HLA-DOB gene.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We investigated how epigenetic regulatory mechanisms participate in cellular senescence induced by PM with a diameter <2.5 (PM2.5) in human keratinocytes and mouse skin tissues. PM2.5-treated cells exhibited characteristics of cellular senescence. PM2.5 induced a decrease in DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) expression and an increase in DNA demethylase (ten-eleven translocation; TET) expression, leading to hypomethylation of the p16(INK4A) promoter region. In addition, PM2.5 led to a decrease in polycomb EZH2 histone methyltransferase expression, whereas the expression of the epigenetic transcriptional activator MLL1 increased. Furthermore, binding of DNMT1, DNMT3B, and EZH2 to the promoter region of p16(INK4A) decreased in PM2.5-treated keratinocytes, whereas TET1 and MLL1 binding increased, leading to decreased histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27Me3) and increased H3K4Me3 in the promoter of p16(INK4A). PM2.5-induced senescence involved aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS scavenging dampened PM2.5-induced cellular senescence through regulation of DNA and histone methylation. Altogether, our work shows that skin senescence induced by environmental PM2.5 occurs through ROS-dependent the epigenetic modification of senescence-associated gene expression. Our findings provide information for the design of preventive and therapeutic strategies against skin senescence, particularly in light of the increasing problem of PM2.5 exposure due to air pollution.",,['2017R1A4A1014512/National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)/International'],,,PMC6802667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has revolutionised CML therapy and patient outcome, with high survival rates. However, this now means an ever-increasing number of patients are living with the disease on life-long tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, with most patients anticipated to have near normal life expectancy. Unfortunately, in a significant number of patients, TKIs are not curative. This low-level disease persistence suggests that despite a molecularly targeted therapeutic approach, there are BCR-ABL1-independent mechanisms exploited to sustain the survival of a small cell population of leukaemic stem cells (LSCs). In CML, LSCs display many features akin to haemopoietic stem cells, namely quiescence, self-renewal and the ability to produce mature progeny, this all occurs through intrinsic and extrinsic signals within the specialised microenvironment of the bone marrow (BM) niche. One important avenue of investigation in CML is how the disease highjacks the BM, thereby remodelling this microenvironment to create a niche, which enables LSC persistence and resistance to TKI treatment. In this review, we explore how changes in growth factor levels, in particular, the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, impact on cell behaviour, extracellular matrix deposition and bone remodelling in CML. We also discuss the challenges in targeting LSCs and the potential of dual targeting using combination therapies against BMP receptors and BCR-ABL1.","['(c) 2019 The Author(s).

Epub 2019 Sep 21.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of cytokine enrichment of culture medium on embryological and clinical outcomes after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial. SETTING: In vitro fertilization centers. PATIENT(S): This trial included 443 ICSI cycles randomized into two groups. INTERVENTION(S): This study evaluated the influence of integration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor into culture media on human embryo development after ICSI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Ongoing pregnancy rate per a randomized participant. RESULT(S): Cytokine enrichment of culture medium showed improvement in ongoing pregnancy rate compared with no cytokines (106/224 [47%] vs. 78/219 [36%]; absolute rate difference [ARD] = 12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-21). This integration of cytokines also showed better rates of live birth (101/224 [45%] vs. 71/219 [33%]; ARD = 13; 95% CI, 4-21) and cumulative live birth (132/224 [60%] vs. 97/219 [44%]; ARD = 12; 95% CI, 4-20) and lower rate of pregnancy loss (27/124 [22%] vs. 37/103 [36%]; ARD = -14; 95% CI, -26 to -2) than conventional medium. Embryos developed in the cytokine-supplemented medium showed better blastocyst formation, quality, cryopreservation, and use than control medium. CONCLUSION(S): Integration of cytokines into human embryo culture media showed improvement in embryological and clinical outcomes after ICSI. However, the long-term effect of cytokine enrichment of a medium is still unclear and warrants further studies with longitudinal follow-up.

Methods: A total of 80 pediatric AML patients were enrolled in this study, and bone marrow specimens were collected at initial diagnosis and relapse. NUP98-NSD1 was screened by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and PCR. Other laboratory test results and clinical outcomes were further analyzed for the NUP98-NSD1 positive cases. Results: A total of eight patients (10.0%) were positive for NUP98-NSD1, which were all fusions of NUP98 exon12 and NSD1 exon 6. There were two M2, three M4, and three M5 cases according to the French-American-British classification. Seven patients had karyotype results at the time of initial diagnosis, and none of them had complicated karyotype abnormalities. Among these patients, two cases had normal karyotype, three cases had trisomy 8, one case had trisomy 6, and two cases had anomalies involving 9q13 or 9q21. Additional karyotypic abnormalities and clonal evolutions were observed during disease progression or relapse, five cases had 9q13 or 9q32 abnormalities. Five cases (62.5%) were positive with FLT3-ITD mutation. Patients were treated with DAE/NAE/HAE/IA chemotherapy. Three cases did not achieve remission after several courses of chemotherapy, and five cases achieved remission but relapsed in 1 to 19 months. Five cases underwent salvage allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Among whom, four died in 40 days to 4 months after transplantation, and one survived 8.5 months till the last follow-up. Conclusions: NUP98-NSD1 is a recurrent genetic abnormality with significant clinical prognostic significance, and this group of disease has unique clinical and genetic characteristics.

FLT3 inhibition in the setting of minimal residual disease and a new immune system via allogeneic transplantation offers a promise of improved survival for these patients. We performed a prospective study of patients with FLT3-ITD AML undergoing allogeneic transplant that was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and outcome of sorafenib administered peritransplant. Sorafenib dosing was individualized, starting at 200 mg twice a day (BID), and titrated based on tolerability or toxicities until a tolerable dose was identified. Forty-four patients, with a median age of 52 years, undergoing allogeneic transplant were started on sorafenib in the peritransplant period (21 pretransplant). The median duration of post-transplant follow-up was 27.6 months (range, 5.2 to 60.4). Overall survival was 76% at both 24 and 36 months. Event-free survival at 24 and 36 months was 74% and 64%, respectively. Ten patients died in the post-transplant period, with 6 deaths due to relapsed leukemia and 4 from transplant-associated toxicity. Tolerable doses ranged from 200 mg every other day to 400 mg BID with similar exposure. Correlative studies evaluating FLT3 inhibition via a plasma inhibitory activity assay showed consistent inhibition of FLT3 at all tolerability-determined dosing levels. Sorafenib is well tolerated in the peritransplant setting irrespective of the conditioning intensity or the donor source. Our findings indicate that sorafenib dosing can be individualized in the post-transplantation setting according to patient tolerability. This approach results in effective in vivo FLT3 inhibition and yields encouraging survival results.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Epub 2020 Feb 14.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Bile acids (BAs) are important regulators of metabolism and energy balance, but excess BAs cause cholestatic liver injury. The histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia-4 (MLL4) is a transcriptional coactivator of the BA-sensing nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and epigenetically up-regulates FXR targets important for the regulation of BA levels, small heterodimer partner (SHP), and bile salt export pump (BSEP). MLL4 expression is aberrantly down-regulated and BA homeostasis is disrupted in cholestatic mice, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We examined whether elevated microRNA-210 (miR-210) in cholestatic liver promotes BA-induced pathology by inhibiting MLL4 expression. miR-210 was the most highly elevated miR in hepatic SHP-down-regulated mice with elevated hepatic BA levels. MLL4 was identified as a direct target of miR-210, and overexpression of miR-210 inhibited MLL4 and, subsequently, BSEP and SHP expression, resulting in defective BA metabolism and hepatotoxicity with inflammation. miR-210 levels were elevated in cholestatic mouse models, and in vivo silencing of miR-210 ameliorated BA-induced liver pathology and decreased hydrophobic BA levels in an MLL4-dependent manner. In gene expression studies, SHP inhibited miR-210 expression by repressing a transcriptional activator, Kruppel-like factor-4 (KLF4). In patients with primary biliary cholangitis/cirrhosis (PBC), hepatic levels of miR-210 and KLF4 were highly elevated, whereas nuclear levels of SHP and MLL4 were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic miR-210 is physiologically regulated by SHP but elevated in cholestatic mice and patients with PBC, promoting BA-induced liver injury in part by targeting MLL4. The miR-210-MLL4 axis is a potential target for the treatment of BA-associated hepatobiliary disease.",['(c) 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.'],"['16SDG27570006/AHA/American Heart Association-American Stroke Association/United', 'States', 'R56 DK062777/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK62777/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN276201200017C/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK117965/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK062777/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK95842/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK095842/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC7089843,,['NIHMS1051596'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Nov 1.,"A risk mitigation strategy was implemented to determine if a higher prophylactic voriconazole dosage in patients with CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer neutropenic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) reduces the incidence of subtherapeutic trough concentrations. Patients with AML (n = 263) were preemptively genotyped for CYP2C19*2, *3, and *17 alleles as part of a single-center prospective, interventional, quality improvement study. CYP2C19 rapid metabolizers (CYP2C19*1/*17) were recommended to receive interventional voriconazole 300 mg twice daily, ultrarapid metabolizers (CYP2C19*17/*17) were recommended to avoid voriconazole, and all others received the standard prophylactic dosage of 200 mg twice daily. In this real-world setting, 202 patients (76.8%) were prescribed prophylactic voriconazole, and of these patients 176 (87.1%) received CYP2C19-guided prophylactic dosing. Voriconazole trough concentrations were obtained for 41 of the 58 (70.7%) CYP2C19 rapid metabolizers prescribed prophylactic voriconazole. Interventional voriconazole resulted in higher plasma trough concentrations (median 2.7 mug/mL) compared with the standard prophylactic dosage (median 0.6 mug/mL; P = 0.001). Subtherapeutic concentrations were avoided in 83.8% of CYP2C19 rapid metabolizers receiving interventional dosage compared to 46.2% receiving standard dosage (P = 0.02). CYP2C19 genotyping to preemptively guide prophylactic voriconazole dosing is feasible and may be a potential strategy for reducing the risk of subtherapeutic trough concentrations that potentiate breakthrough fungal infections.","['(c) 2019 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (c) 2019 American', 'Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.']",['P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC7018540,,['NIHMS1051680'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The simulated congenital infection with GX14DJ3-18 in Three-Yellow chickens exhibited a significant negative effect on the development of immune organs (P < 0.05). Also, lower antibody responses were found to vaccinations with the commercial vaccines of Newcastle disease virus and with subtypes H5 and H9 of avian influenza virus (P < 0.05). The incidence of tumor or tumor-like lesions in the challenged birds was 14.28% (5/35), while none were observed in the un-challenged control group (0/35). These results suggested that GX14DJ3-18 is a novel recombinant ALV that can induce pathogenicity in the commercial Three-Yellow chickens.

We evaluate the role of leukemia microvesicles on the leukemia stem cells (LSCs)-specific genes expression in healthy hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs). Methods: HL-60 and NB-4 cell lines were selected for microvesicles isolation by ultracentrifugation. Healthy HSPCs were obtained by magnetic association cell sorting (MACS) and CD-34 micro-beads from umbilical cord blood samples and then, were treated with 20 and 40 mug/ml leukemia microvesicles for 10 days, respectively. LY86, LRG1 and PDE9A genes expression as LSC specific genes were analyzed by QRT-PCR. Surface CD-34 antigen as stemness marker was measured by flow cytometry technique. Results: Healthy HSPCs showed a significant increase in LSC specific genes expression after treatment with both 20 and 40 mug/ml leukemia microvesicles at day 10. All studied groups showed more than 70% surface CD-34 antigen at the last day of experiment which proved HSPCs stemness. Conclusion: Our results suggest that healthy HSPCs can be transformed genetically by leukemia microvesicles to over express LSC specific genes.

Epub 2019 Sep 23.,"PURPOSE: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly aggressive form of leukemia, which results in poor survival outcomes. Currently, diagnosis and prognosis are based on invasive single-point bone marrow biopsies (iliac crest). There is currently no AML-specific noninvasive imaging method to detect disease, including in extramedullary organs, representing an unmet clinical need. About 85% to 90% of human myeloid leukemia cells express CD33 cell surface receptors, highlighting CD33 as an ideal candidate for AML immunoPET. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated whether [(64)Cu]Cu-DOTA-anti-CD33 murine mAb can be used for immunoPET imaging of AML in a preclinical model. MicroCT was adjusted to detect spatial/anatomical details of PET activity. For translational purposes, a humanized anti-CD33 antibody was produced; we confirmed its ability to detect disease and its distribution. We reconfirmed/validated CD33 antibody-specific targeting with an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and radioimmunotherapy (RIT). RESULTS: [(64)Cu]Cu-DOTA-anti-CD33-based PET-CT imaging detected CD33(+) AML in mice with high sensitivity (95.65%) and specificity (100%). The CD33(+) PET activity was significantly higher in specific skeletal niches [femur (P < 0.00001), tibia (P = 0.0001), humerus (P = 0.0014), and lumber spine (P < 0.00001)] in AML-bearing mice (over nonleukemic control mice). Interestingly, the hybrid PET-CT imaging showed high disease activity in the epiphysis/metaphysis of the femur, indicating regional spatial heterogeneity. Anti-CD33 therapy using newly developed humanized anti-CD33 mAb as an ADC (P = 0.02) and [(225)Ac]Ac-anti-CD33-RIT (P < 0.00001) significantly reduced disease burden over that of respective controls.

Several genetic and epigenetic events have been implicated in this transformation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that primarily function as endogenous translational repressors of protein-coding genes. The involvement of miRNAs in the regulation of cancer progression is well-established, namely by down-regulating the expression of key oncogenes or tumor suppressors and thereby preventing or promoting tumorigenesis, respectively. Similar to other cancers, several miRNA genes have been identified and implicated in the context of T-ALL.

Epub 2019 Sep 20.,"The extraordinary and unexpected success of cellular immunotherapy using genetically engineered T-cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting CD19, in the treatment of refractory or relapsing B-hematological malignancies, has provided a real therapeutic hope. Indeed, remission rates reach more than 80 % in patients at a stage, without any other possibilities of treatment, notably in the child's acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These results, initially resulting from academic research, led to Food and Drug accreditation for market access of two innovative autologous therapy drugs, Kimryah(R) and Yescarta(R). Based on the impressive clinical results, mainly so far in hematological malignancies (LAL, MM, LBDGC, etc.), the development of several types of cells expressing a CAR receptor suggests a wide range of future applications, particularly in the field of solid tumors. However, while the development of CAR-T cells now appears to be in the hands of private pharmaceuticals companies, the logistical constraints, the cryopreservation and the very high cost of these personalized medicines may ultimately limit their use. The development of academic productions by CAR-T cells could bypass some of these disadvantages. The strong innovation capacity of healthcare institutions associated with research units allows them to identify the ideal tumor target and efficient performing cells. Thus, authorized production platforms could allow for shorter administration times and reasonable production costs for national health systems. The aim of this workshop is to identify the requirements for the academic production of CAR-T cells, while respecting the research standards useful to establish proof of concept, but also at the preclinical development stage, leading in fine to the manufacture, through an authorized pharmaceutical establishment, of the innovative therapy drug, and in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The ultimate goal is to make these innovative and high-performance medicines available to as many patients as possible.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Societe Francaise du Cancer.

Previous mRNA microarray profiling studies of IgAN revealed inconsistent data. We sought to identify the aberrantly expressed genes and biological pathways by integrating IgAN gene expression datasets in blood cells and performing systematically experimental validation. We also explored the relationship between target genes and galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) in IgAN. METHODS: We retrieved Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets of IgAN. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were used for functional analysis. Deep sequencing on RNA isolated from B cells was used for microarray validation. The relationship between target mRNA expressions and Gd-IgA1 levels in serum were also studied. RESULTS: Three studies with microarray expression profiling datasets met our inclusion criteria. We identified 655 dyregulated genes, including 319 up-regulated and 336 down-regulated genes in three GEO datasets with a total of 35 patients of IgAN and 19 healthy controls. Based on biological process in GO term, these dyregulated genes are mainly related to pentose-phosphate shunt, non-oxidative branch, post-embryonic camera-type eye development and leukocyte activation. KEGG pathway analysis of microarray data revealed that these aberrantly expressed genes were enriched in human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection, proteoglycans in cancer, intestinal immune network for IgA production and autophagy. We further performed deep sequencing on mRNAs isolated from B cells of an independent set of five patients with IgAN and three healthy persons with the same clinical and demographic characteristics. Seventy-seven genes overlapped with 655 differentially regulated genes mentioned above, including 43 up-regulated and thirty-four down-regulated genes. We next investigated whether these genes expression correlated with Gd-IgA1 levels in IgAN patients. Pearson correlation analyses showed PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) was the most powerful gene negatively correlated with Gd-IgA1 levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that dyregulated genes in patients with IgAN were enriched in intestinal immune network for IgA production and autophagy process, and PTEN in B cells might be involved in the mechanism of Gd-IgA1 production.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Differential gene expression', '*Galactose-deficient IgA1', '*IgA nephropathy', '*RNA-deep sequencing', '*mRNA microarray']",PMC6757375,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mammalian cells, three active DNMTs have been identified: DNMT1 acts as a maintenance methyltransferase to replicate preexisting methylation patterns, whereas DNMT3A and DNMT3B primarily act as de novo methyltransferases that are responsible for establishing DNA methylation patterns by adding a methyl group to cytosine bases. The expression of DNMT3B is widespread in a variety of hematological cells and it is altered in each type of leukemia, which is associated with its pathogenesis, progression, treatment, and prognosis. Here, we review current information on DNMT3B in leukemia, including its expression, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, mutations, regulation, function, and clinical value for anti-leukemic therapy and prognosis.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*DNA methyltransferase 3B', '*leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, CD123 is expressed at both the level of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and more differentiated leukemic blasts, which makes CD123 an attractive therapeutic target. Various agents have been developed as drugs able to target CD123 on malignant leukemic cells and on the normal counterpart. Tagraxofusp (SL401, Stemline Therapeutics), a recombinant protein composed of a truncated diphtheria toxin payload fused to IL-3, was approved for use in patients with BPDCN in December of 2018 and showed some clinical activity in AML. Different monoclonal antibodies directed against CD123 are under evaluation as antileukemic drugs, showing promising results either for the treatment of AML minimal residual disease or of relapsing/refractory AML or BPDCN. Finally, recent studies are exploring T cell expressing CD123 chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cells (CAR T) as a new immunotherapy for the treatment of refractory/relapsing AML and BPDCN. In December of 2018, MB-102 CD123 CAR T developed by Mustang Bio Inc. received the Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of BPDCN. In conclusion, these recent studies strongly support CD123 as an important therapeutic target for the treatment of BPDCN, while a possible in the treatment of AML and other hematological malignancies will have to be evaluated by in the ongoing clinical studies.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'biomarker', 'interleukin-3', 'interleukin-3 receptor', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cells', 'therapy']",PMC6769702,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other studies show that penetration of CTXs into cells elicits mitochondrial fragmentation or lysosome disruption, leading to cell death. Considering the role of AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in mitochondrial biogenesis and lysosomal biogenesis, we aimed to investigate whether the AMPK-mediated pathway modulated Naja atra (Taiwan cobra) CTX3 cytotoxicity in U937 human leukemia cells. Our results showed that CTX3 induced autophagy and apoptosis in U937 cells, whereas autophagic inhibitors suppressed CTX3-induced apoptosis. CTX3 treatment elicited Ca(2+)-dependent degradation of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit (PP2Acalpha) and phosphorylation of AMPKalpha. Overexpression of PP2Acalpha mitigated the CTX3-induced AMPKalpha phosphorylation. CTX3-induced autophagy was via AMPK-mediated suppression of the Akt/mTOR pathway. Removal of Ca(2+) or suppression of AMPKalpha phosphorylation inhibited the CTX3-induced cell death. CTX3 was unable to induce autophagy and apoptosis in U937 cells expressing constitutively active Akt. Met-modified CTX3 retained its membrane-perturbing activity, however, it did not induce AMPK activation and death of U937 cells. These results conclusively indicate that CTX3 induces autophagy and apoptosis in U937 cells via the Ca(2+)/PP2A/AMPK axis, and suggest that the membrane-perturbing activity of CTX3 is not crucial for the cell death signaling pathway induction.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AMPK', '*Ca2+', '*PP2A', '*apoptosis', '*autophagy', '*cardiotoxin']",PMC6784133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification and characterization of oncogenes crucial to the survival and growth of leukemia cells will provide potential targets for the exploitation of novel therapies. Herein, we report that the elevated expression of SH3 domain-binding protein 5 (SH3BP5) significantly correlates with poor outcomes of AML patients. To test whether SH3BP5 contributes to the growth and survival of AML cells, we use the shRNA-encoding lentivirus system to achieve the knockdown of SH3BP5 expression in human AML cell lines U937, THP-1, Kasumi-1, and MV4-11. Functionally, the knockdown of SH3BP5 expression markedly inhibits the cell viability and induced apoptosis of these leukemia cells. Mechanistically, western blot analysis indicates that the knockdown of SH3BP5 expression decreases the phosphorylation of JNK and BAD. Moreover, the JNK agonist anisomycin rescues the growth inhibition phenotype of SH3BP5 deficiency in THP-1 cells. Moreover, the expression of SH3BP5 positively correlates with CD25 and CD123 levels. Finally, our study highlights the crucial role of SH3BP5 in promoting the survival of AML cells, and its suppression may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating human AML.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Apoptosis', '*JNK', '*Prognosis', '*SH3BP5']",PMC6770748,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nanocapsules with spherical morphology were obtained in phosphate buffer at pH7.4. These CHC-SDS nanocapsules showed no toxicity toward Jurkat cells (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and were used to encapsulate a new pyrazoline (H3TM04) with antileukemia activity. The samples were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Laser Doppler Micro-Electrophoresis. The encapsulation efficiency was higher than 96% (293.6mugmL(-)(1)) and the H3TM04-loaded nanocapsules (CHC-SDS-H) had a negative surface charge (-29.8+/-0.7mV) and hydrodynamic radius of around 84nm. For the first time, CHC-SDS-H were formed and the antitumoral cancer activity was proved. The in vitro assays showed the controlled release of H3TM04 from the CHC-SDS-H nanocapsules in phosphate buffer pH7.4. The H3TM04 release data were described by the power law model, indicating that H3TM04 delivery occurred via an erosion mechanism. The cytotoxicity assays with Jurkat and K-562 cells (acute myeloid leukemia) demonstrated that the CHC-SDS-H nanocapsule decreases the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50).

Stathmin has been identified as a downstream target of PRL-3 in colorectal cancer. However, the correlation between PRL-3 and stathmin in myeloid leukemia is unclear. In this study, we revealed the positive correlation between PRL-3 and stathmin in myeloid leukemia. Knockdown of the PRL-3 gene by shRNA reduced the expression of downstream stathmin, suppressed cell proliferation, induced G2/M arrest and cell apoptosis, and inhibited migration and invasion in myeloid leukemia cells. Moreover, our study was the first to provide evidence that silencing PRL-3 increased the phosphorylation level in Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, and Ser63 of stathmin, and in turn inhibited the STAT3 and STAT5 signaling in myeloid leukemia cells. This evidence points to a promoted role for PRL-3 in the progression of myeloid leukemia, and PRL-3 could be a possible new treatment target.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*PRL-3', '*STATs signaling', '*myeloid leukemia', '*serine phosphorylation', '*stathmin']",PMC6781976,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 9.,"Schisanlactone E (SE) is a bioactive ingredient extracted from the stem of Kadsura heteroclita (Roxb) Craib. SE has various pharmacological activity such as anti-tumor and anti-leukemia effects. However, its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion have rarely been examined. In this study, new quali-quantitative analytical methods were developed for metabolic and pharmacokinetic studies of SE in rats. A UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed to determine SE in rat plasma, urine, and feces. Samples were precipitated with methanol and analyzed in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The established method was validated and applied to the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and excretion analysis of SE after oral (6mg/kg) or intravenous (2mg/kg) administration. The absolute oral bioavailability of SE was approximately 79.3%. After oral administration, SE was mainly excreted via feces with a rate of 41.7% for 48h. SE could not be detected in urine. Furthermore, a UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS method was developed for the metabolite screening of SE in rat plasma, urine, and feces. Metabolites were extracted by solid phase extraction and analyzed with full MS/dd-MS(2) scan mode. As a result, 15 metabolites including 11 phase I and 4 phase II metabolites were identified by a three-step analytical strategy. The carboxyl group, the five membered ring, and the six membered alpha,beta-unsaturated lactone ring of SE could be predicted as the main metabolic sites. This study provides comprehensive insights into the pharmacokinetic and metabolic profiles of SE, and would be valuable for future development and utilization of SE and Kadsura heteroclita.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a prospective phase 2 study to assess the efficacy and safety of single-unit myeloablative CBT in adult leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Because the day 180 survival of UDT was approximately 80%, we determined the alternative hypothesis of expected day 180 survival with a successful engraftment rate of 80% and set the null hypothesis of threshold rate at 65%. Sixty-two patients (median age, 37 years) were registered, including 28 with acute myelogenous leukemia, 25 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 9 with myelodysplastic syndrome. Of 61 eligible patients, 52 were successfully engrafted and survived at day 180 (85%; 95% confidence interval, 74% to 93%). Single-unit CBT was judged to be effective because the null hypothesis was rejected (P < .001). Furthermore, neutrophil engraftment was observed in 57 patients (92%); the incidences of grade II-IV acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were 30% and 32%, respectively; and the cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality and relapse at 2 years were 18% and 13%, respectively. The present study showed favorable survival outcomes with single-unit CBT. Therefore, this method may be considered if a well-HLA-matched UDT cannot be obtained.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Sep 23.,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying mucosal eosinophilia in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) remain poorly clarified. The nervous system and neuropeptides play an important role in the regulation of immune response. Herein we explore the expression and function of hemokinin-1 (HK-1), a newly identified tachykinin, along with its receptor neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) in CRSwNP. METHODS: HK-1, NK1R, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 24 (CCL24) expression in nasal tissues (53 eosinophilic CRSwNP, 32 non-eosinophilic CRSwNP, and 33 controls) was investigated by quantitative reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence staining. THP-1, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, and eosinophilic polyp tissues were stimulated with HK-1. Cells, tissues, and culture supernatants were subsequently collected for detection of the production of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by quantitative RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunoassay. RESULTS: HK-1 and NK1R mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic nasal polyps compared with control tissues, with eosinophilic polyps demonstrating a higher upregulation compared with that of non-eosinophilic polyps. Eosinophils constituted the major source of HK-1, whereas macrophages were the predominant cell type exhibiting NK1R in eosinophilic polyps. HK-1 induced CCL24 production from macrophages differentiated from THP-1 cells; this was abolished by an NK1R antagonist. HK-1 also induced CCL24 production from ex vivo-cultured eosinophilic nasal polyps. CCL24 was expressed by macrophages in eosinophilic but not non-eosinophilic polyps. The expression level of HK-1 correlated with CCL24 expression and tissue eosinophilia in eosinophilic nasal polyps. CONCLUSION: Eosinophil-derived HK-1 induces CCL24 production from macrophages and therefore exaggerates eosinophilic inflammation in CRSwNP.","['(c) 2019 ARS-AAOA, LLC.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*immunity', '*mucous membrane', '*neurokinin 1 receptors', '*neuropeptide', '*tachykinins']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 12.,"Primary refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and early recurrence of leukemic cells are among the most difficult hurdles to overcome in the treatment of AML. Moreover, uncertainties surrounding the molecular mechanism underlying refractory AML pose a challenge when it comes to developing novel therapeutic drugs. However, accumulating evidence suggests a contribution of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling to the development of refractory AML. To assess PTEN/AKT signaling in AML, two types of AML cell lines were evaluated, namely control HL60 cells and KG1alpha cells, a refractory AML cell line that is resistant to idarubicin and cytarabine (AraC) treatment. Changes in the expression level of glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylationrelated genes and proteins were evaluated by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses, respectively. The mitochondrial oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates were measured using an XF24 analyzer. CCK8 assay and Annexin V/PI staining were used to analyze cell viability and cellular apoptosis, respectively. The PTEN protein was found to be depleted, whereas AKT phosphorylation levels were elevated in KG1alpha cells compared with HL60 cells. These changes were associated with increased expression of glucose transporter 1 and hexokinase 2, and increased lactate production. AKT inhibition decreased the proliferation of KG1alpha cells and decreased extracellular acidification without affecting HL60 cells. Notably, AKT inhibition increased the susceptibility of KG1alpha cells to chemotherapy with idarubicin and AraC. Taken together, the findings of the present study indicate that activation of AKT by PTEN deficiency sustains the refractory AML status through enhancement of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, effects that may be rescued by inhibiting AKT activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 12.,"The present study aimed to explore the mechanisms through which microRNA (miR)20a may be involved in the differentiation of THP1 human acute monocytic leukemia cells into osteoclasts. THP1 cells were differentiated into macrophages (osteoclast precursors) and subsequently into osteoclast cells. The expression levels of miR20a in THP1 cells were significantly reduced in a timedependent manner during phorbol12myristate13acetate (PMA), macrophage colonystimulating factor (MCSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factorkappaB ligand RANKLinduced osteoclastogenesis. Following transfection with a miR20a mimics, the levels of miR20a in PMAtreated THP1 cells increased more than 40fold as compared with expression in the control cells. In addition, the overexpression of miR20a inhibited proliferation, initiated S phase cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis of PMAtreated THP1 cells. Additionally, miR20a mimics treatment notably decreased the levels of tartrateresistant acid phosphatase, nuclear factor of activated Tcells, cytoplasmic 1 and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) during THP1 cell further differentiation progress. In summary, miR20a may negatively regulate the proliferation and osteoclastogenesis of THP1 cells during its osteoclast differentiation progress by downregulating PPARgamma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After having reexamined their source data, the authors were able to confirm that the data correctly shown for the 'Untreated cells' experiment had inadvertently been included in the Figure as the data for the 'DMSO' experiment. Additionally, in Fig. 2b, the authors noticed that the percentage of untreated cells with active caspase3 was missing (the label for the 'No antibody' experiment).

Epub 2019 Aug 21.,"Kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside (KOR) has multiple potency involved in anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial actions. However, the potential roles of KOR and the analogues isolated from the leaves of Cyclocarya paliurus in anti-erythroleukemia remain unclear. In the present study, KOR and the two analogues (Kaempferol-3-O-(4''-O-acetyl-a-L-rhamnopyranoside) (KLR) and (kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-(4''-E-p-coumaroyl) rhamnoside) (KCR) were isolated from leaves of Cyclocarya paliurus. Cell viability assay showed that KCR exerted an excellent anti-erythroleukemia activity. We observed that KCR not only significantly increased the percentage of G2 phase and apoptotic cells compared with control group, but also induced megakaryocytic differentiation in HEL and K562 cells by flow cytometry, indicating that KCR might inhibit cell proliferation through inducing differentiation-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Mechanism investigation revealed that KCR treatment obviously increased phosphorylation levels of PKCdelta and ERK1/2 as well as GATA1 expression. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that KCR induces megakaryocytic differentiation and suppresses leukemogenesis at least partly through activation of PKCdelta/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in erythroleukemia cells. KCR may also serve as a promising natural compound for human erythroleukemia treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

We sought to identify risk factors and rate of VTE in hospitalized patients with HM using National Inpatient Sample (NIS) for the years 2011 to 2015. We used ICD-9 codes to identify patients with HM as the primary diagnosis and VTE as a secondary diagnosis for hospitalization. The rate of VTE was highest in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (6.6%) followed by acute lymphocytic leukemia (6.1%) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (6.0%). The highest risk of VTE occurred among patients with HM receiving chemotherapy (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.567-1.809) followed by infection such as pneumonia (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.201-1.436) and sepsis (OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.524-1.621). Chemotherapy had the highest risk of developing VTE during hospitalization followed by sepsis and pneumonia. The identification of patients with HM most at risk for VTE could be used to design and test prophylactic strategy.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Venous thromboembolism', '*chemotherapy', '*hematologic malignancy', '*leukemia lymphoma', '*multiple myeloma', '*sepsis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we determined the structure of human RBBP5 and demonstrated its role in the assembly and regulation of the MLL1 complex. We identified an internal interaction between the WD40 propeller and the C-terminal distal region in RBBP5, which assisted the maintenance of the compact conformation of the MLL1 complex. We also discovered a vertebrate-specific motif in the C-terminal distal region of RBBP5 that contributed to nucleosome recognition and methylation of nucleosomes by the MLL1 complex.

Particularly in oncology, therapeutic concepts involving antibodies often rely on the so-called effector functions, such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), which are programed in the antibody Fc region. However, Fc-mediated effector mechanisms often seem to be insufficient in properly activating the immune system to act against tumor cells. Furthermore, long term treatments can lead to resistance against the applied drug, which is monospecific by nature. There is promise in using specific antibodies to overcome such issues due to their capability of recruiting and activating T-cells directly at the tumor site, for instance. During the last decade, two of these entities, which are referred to as Blinatumomab and Catumaxomab, have been approved to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant ascites. In addition, Emicizumab, which is a bispecific antibody targeting clotting factors IXa and X, was recently granted market approval by the FDA in 2017 for the treatment of hemophilia A. However, the generation of these next generation therapeutics is challenging and requires tremendous engineering efforts as two distinct paratopes need to be combined from two different heavy and light chains.

MicroRNAs are known as oncogenes and tumor suppressors in CLL which may also serve as markers of onset and progression of the disease. The most prevalent form of leukemia diagnosed in adults in the western world, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, accounts for one-third of all leukemias. CLL is characterized by the presence of B Cell Malignant Clones in secondary lymphoid tissues, peripheral blood and bone marrow. The precise etiology of CLL is remained to be known, however, a number of Chromosomal Abnormalities such as deletions of 13q14.3, 11q and 17p and trisomy 12 have been detected. In this review, we offer our prospect on how miRNAs are involved in the CLL pathogenesis and disease progression.

Epub 2019 Sep 22.,"Mammal megakaryocytes (MK) undergo polyploidization during their differentiation. This process leads to a marked increase in the MK size and of their cytoplasm. Contrary to division by classical mitosis, ploidization allows an economical manner to produce platelets as they arise from the fragmentation of the MK cytoplasm. The platelet production in vivo correlates to the entire MK cytoplasm mass that depends both upon the number of MKs and their size. Polyploidization occurs by several rounds of DNA replication with at the end of each round an aborted mitosis at late phase of cytokinesis. As there is also a defect in karyokinesis, MKs are giant cells with a single polylobulated nucleus with a 2(x)N ploidy. However, polyploidization per se does not increase platelet production because it requires a parallel development of MK organelles such as mitochondria, granules and the demarcation membrane system. MK polyploidization is regulated by extrinsic factors, more particularly by thrombopoietin (TPO), which during a platelet stress increases first polyploidization before enhancing the MK number and by transcription factors such as RUNX1, GATA1, and FLI1 that regulate MK differentiation explaining why polyploidization and cytoplasmic maturation are intermingled. MK polyploidization is ontogenically regulated and is markedly altered in malignant myeloid disorders such as acute megakaryoblastic leukemia and myeloproliferative disorders as well as in hereditary thrombocytopenia, more particularly those involving transcription factors or signaling pathways. In addition, MKs arising from progenitors in vitro have a much lower ploidy in vitro than in vivo leading to a low yield of platelet production in vitro. Thus, it is tempting to find approaches to increase MK polyploidization in vitro. However, these approaches require molecules that are able to simultaneously increase MK polyploidization and to induce terminal differentiation. Here, we will focus on the regulation by extrinsic and intrinsic factors of MK polyploidization during development and pathological conditions.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Endomitosis', 'megakaryocyte', 'polyploidization']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we report a woman in her 70s, diagnosed with CLL/SLL in 2000, untreated, who subsequently presented 12 years later with de novo CML, BCR-ABL1+. Her IGHV mutated CLL/SLL based on the initial sample in our laboratory showed homozygous and heterozygous 13q14.3 deletions, whereas her CML, at presentation, showed a 46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[7]/46,XX[18] karyotype with a p190 BCR-ABL1 transcript. The tumor burden of each clone varied with treatment, including when treated with dasatinib, used to target both clones. In addition, the cytogenetic abnormalities evolved over time and treatments and included acquisition of an extra chromosome 8 in the CML clone and a novel K1992T ATM missense mutation (47% allele frequency) in the CLL/SLL clone. The patient's last bone marrow biopsy, 5 years after her CML diagnosis and 17 years after the CLL/SLL diagnosis, showed residual CML with extensive involvement by CLL/SLL (80%). Cytogenetic studies showed a 46,XX karyotype, while FISH identified 13q14.3 deletion and the BCR-ABL1 translocation in the CLL/SLL and CML clones, respectively. To date, this is the fourth case of concurrent CML, BCR-ABL1+ arising in untreated CLL/SLL. Here we show dynamic variation in the size of the 2 clonal processes reflecting the variable responsiveness to specific therapies.

In this study, we demonstrated that GLN induces cytotoxicity through G0/G1 phase arrest followed by apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Fortunately, this natural compound did not show significant cytotoxic effects on normal cells. This study demonstrated that GLN was capable to extend chemotherapeutic sensitivity in ALL cells by reducing VCR concentration without constraining its effectiveness. Therefore, it might act as a promising anticancer agent for the treatment of leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The growth factors glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), GDNF family receptor alpha-1 (GFRalpha1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were investigated. The SSCs were seeded on SIM mouse embryo-derived thioguanine- and ouabain-resistant (STO) feeder layers. Cultivation of the cells were subjected to a factorial design of the growth factors GDNF + bFGF, GDNF + bFGF + GFRalpha1, LIF + bFGF and LIF + bFGF + GFRalpha1. The SSCs could propagate for 25 passages in the medium adding GDNF + bFGF + GFRalpha1, 22 passages in the medium adding GDNF + bFGF, 6 passages in the medium adding LIF + bFGF, or LIF + bFGF + GFRalpha1. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the highest mRNA expression levels of NANOG, POU5F, DDX4, GFRalpha1 and UCHL1 were detected in the group adding GDNF + bFGF + GFRalpha1. The SSCs from the group adding GDNF + bFGF + GFRalpha1 also showed UCHL1-, DBA- and CDH1-positive staining. Moreover, Stra8 and Scp3 expression, and haploid peak were detected after induction of the SSCs from the group adding GDNF + bFGF + GFRalpha1.

One-pot cyclocondensation of alkenes (1a-i) with chlorosulfonyl isocyanate generates beta-lactams. beta-Amino acid derivatives (2a-i) from beta-lactams were synthesized. Then, these highly reactive compounds were opened with MeOH to produce the corresponding sulfamate derivatives in good yields. The inhibitory effects of the novel sulfamate derivatives were tested on human carbonic anhydrase I and II isoenzymes (hCA I and hCA II), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and alpha-glycosidase (alpha-Gly). Novel sulfamate derivatives showed Ki values in the range of 23.81-42.97 nM against hCA I, 8.95-52.23 nM against hCA II, 8.10-45.51 nM against AChE, 23.16-81.84 nM against BChE, and 14.02-48.68 nM against alpha-Gly. As a result, the novel sulfamate derivatives had potent inhibitory effects against both isoenzymes. Overall, due to the inhibitory effects of the novel sulfamate derivatives on the tested metabolic enzymes, they are promising drug candidates for the treatment of diseases like glaucoma, epilepsy, leukemia, Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are associated with high enzymatic activity of the indicated metabolic enzymes.",['(c) 2019 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft.'],['113Z700/Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu'],['NOTNLM'],"['acetylcholinesterase', 'carbonic anhydrase', 'enzyme inhibition', 'alpha-glycosidase', 'beta-amino acid']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this assumption ignores the possibility of death, which subjects in the cure group may experience. In the present study, such misspecification is investigated with the addition of a death hazard model to the cure group. We propose a joint model using a frailty effect, which reflects the association between a recurrent event and death. For the estimation, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was developed and PROC NLMIXED in SAS was incorporated under a piecewise constant baseline.

In crystalline materials with structural water, the primary focus is often to relate hydrogen bonding motifs to functional properties such as solubility, which is highly relevant in pharmaceutical applications. Nevertheless, understanding the full electrostatic landscape is necessary for a complete structure-function picture. Herein, a combination of tools including (1)H magic angle spinning NMR and X-ray crystallography are employed to evaluate the local landscape of water in crystalline hydrates. Two hydrates of an anti-leukemia drug mercaptopurine, which exhibit dramatically different dehydration temperatures (by 90 degrees C) and a three-fold difference in the in vivo bioavailability, are compared. The results identify an electrosteric caging mechanism for a kinetically trapped water in the hemihydrate form, which is responsible for the dramatic differences in properties.",,"['R01 GM084018/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM106180/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['1H Chemical Shift Anisotropy', 'Hydrates', 'Magic Angle Spinning', 'Mercaptopurine', 'NMR']",PMC6754108,['Conflict of Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],['NIHMS1000866'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past few years, understanding of the pathophysiology of skin changes in the geriatric age group has improved and has paved the way for better therapeutic options. There are only a few studies conducted in India about the geriatric dermatoses. This article reviews the various physiological and pathological changes of aging, dwelling on the role of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the pathogenesis of aging skin thus better understanding of this emerging branch in dermatology leading to enhance resource management for elderly population. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional observational study carried out on 500 consecutive patients aged 60 years and above in Department of Dermatology of a Tertiary care hospital of Northern India after meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: Out of 500 patients studied with male to female ratio of 1.4, wrinkles followed by cherry angiomas were the most common physiological cutaneous manifestations, and infective dermatoses followed by allergic contact dermatitis were the most common pathological conditions seen. Few rare cases were also seen during the study such as cutis marmorata, delusion of parasitosis, and sweet syndrome in case of acute myeloid leukemia. Conclusion: Geriatric dermatology is an emerging branch in dermatology, and an update on this, will go a long way to effectively manage these patients. A thorough knowledge of the epidemiology as well as gender distribution of dermatological diseases in geriatric population in the tertiary care hospital will help in assessing health status and health care needs related to skin for better allocation of resources, distribution of material and manpower, and help health care providers in better decision-making resulting in higher clientele satisfaction.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cutaneous malignancy', 'extrinsic aging', 'geriatric dermatoses', 'infections', 'intrinsic aging']",PMC6743396,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate endometrial receptivity by measuring HOXA-10, HOXA-11, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) gene expressions in women with PCOS. Settings and Design: A tertiary referral center. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on reproductive age women with abnormal uterine bleeding without sonographically proven anatomical reason. Endometrial sampling procedures were done in proliferative phase using low-pressure endometrial suction device to exclude endometrial pathology. HOXA-10, HOXA-11, and LIF gene expressions were measured from endometrial sampling material. Blood sample was taken to measure serum estradiol level on the day of endometrial sampling. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the variables. Results: A total of 53 patients were included in this study. Study group consisted of 33 patients with PCOS. Gene expressions of HOXA-10, HOXA-11, and LIF were significantly lower in patients with PCOS (P < 0.05). Conclusions: This study results showed that in patients with PCOS have decreased gene expression of HOXA-10, HOXA-11, and LIF which might contribute PCOS-related infertility.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['HOXA-10', 'HOXA-11', 'Leukemia inhibitory factor', 'infertility', 'polycystic ovary syndrome']",PMC6743234,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, therapy options are limited for patients with leukemic clones bearing multiple BCR-ABL1 mutations. Asciminib, an allosteric inhibitor targeting the myristoyl-binding pocket of BCR-ABL1, is active against most single mutants but ineffective against all tested compound mutants. We demonstrate that combining asciminib with ATP site TKIs enhances target inhibition and suppression of resistant outgrowth in Ph(+) clinical isolates and cell lines. Inclusion of asciminib restores ponatinib's effectiveness against currently untreatable compound mutants at clinically achievable concentrations. Our findings support combining asciminib with ponatinib as a treatment strategy for this molecularly defined group of patients.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We show that venetoclax resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is associated with complex clonal shifts. To identify determinants of resistance, we conducted parallel genome-scale screens of the BCL-2-driven OCI-Ly1 lymphoma cell line after venetoclax exposure along with integrated expression profiling and functional characterization of drug-resistant and engineered cell lines. We identified regulators of lymphoid transcription and cellular energy metabolism as drivers of venetoclax resistance in addition to the known involvement by BCL-2 family members, which were confirmed in patient samples.

Epub 2019 Sep 19.,"Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG, thymoglobulin), a polyclonal antibody, is used to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft failure in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Recent in vitro studies suggest that ATG also has anti-leukemic activity. Whether acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is more sensitive to ATG is not known. We used primary cells from 12 B-ALL and 38 AML patients and measured ATG-induced complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and complement-independent cytotoxicity (CIC) at clinically relevant ATG concentrations (10 and 50 mg/L). At 50 mg/L, ALL blasts were killed to a greater degree than AML blasts by CDC (median 96% vs 50% dead cells, P=0.001) as well as CIC (median 23% vs 11% apoptotic cells, P=0.049). At 10 mg/L, the difference was significant for CDC but not CIC. In conclusion, the anti-leukemic activity of ATG, particularly CDC, is more potent for ALL than AML in vitro. If this applies in vivo, ATG-based GVHD prophylaxis may be particularly advantageous for ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2019 International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy. Published by', 'Elsevier Inc.

RESULTS: Between 1562 myeloablative conditioning and 2693 nonmyeloablative conditioning groups, the overall survival was not statistically different. However, in the myeloablative conditioning group, the overall survival of the total body irradiation-based regimen was better than that of chemotherapy-alone regimen (P = .005). In subgroup analysis, the superiority of the total body irradiation-based regimen was especially prominent in acute leukemia (P = .012 for acute myeloid leukemia; P = .005 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and for younger patients (< 50 years old vs. >/= 50 years old, P = .015).

Here, we show feasible correction of compromised functional phenotypes in hematopoietic cells from multiple FA complementation groups, including FA-A, FA-C, FA-D1, and FA-D2. NHEJ-mediated repair of targeted CRISPR-Cas9-induced DNA breaks generated compensatory insertions and deletions that restore the coding frame of the mutated gene. NHEJ-mediated editing efficacy was initially verified in FA lymphoblastic cell lines and then in primary FA patient-derived CD34(+) cells, which showed marked proliferative advantage and phenotypic correction both in vitro and after transplantation. Importantly, and in contrast to homologous directed repair, NHEJ efficiently targeted primitive human HSCs, indicating that NHEJ editing approaches may constitute a sound alternative for editing self-renewing human HSCs and consequently for treatment of FA and other monogenic diseases affecting the hematopoietic system.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2019 Sep 15.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer, characterized by an uncontrolled expansion and accumulation of T-cell progenitors. During leukemic progression, immature T cells grow abnormally and occupy the bone marrow compartment, thereby interfering with the production of normal blood cells. Pediatric T-ALL is curable with intensive chemotherapy, but there are significant, long-term side effects and ~20% of patients suffer relapse for which there are limited treatment options. Adult T-ALL in contrast is largely incurable and refractory/relapsed disease is common despite multi-agent chemotherapy (5-year overall survival of ~40%), and thus new therapeutic targets are needed. We have reported previously on the role of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling in T-ALL, and shown that it exerts potent phenotypes in both leukemia stem cell and bulk tumor cell populations. Modulators of IGF signaling may thus prove useful in improving outcomes in patients with T-ALL. In this review, we summarize the most recent findings relating to IGF signaling in T-ALL and outline therapeutic options using clinically relevant IGF signaling modulators.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The drug is approved in numerous countries, including those of the EU and in the USA, for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory (RR) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); the specific indication(s) for venetoclax may vary between individual countries. Venetoclax monotherapy or combination therapy with rituximab was an effective treatment, provided durable responses, and had a manageable safety profile in pivotal clinical trials in adults with RR CLL, including in patients with adverse prognostic factors. In combination with 6 cycles of rituximab, venetoclax (fixed 24 months' treatment) was more effective than bendamustine plus rituximab (6 cycles) in prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) and inducing undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM), with these benefits sustained during 36 months' follow-up. Hence, with its novel mechanism of action and convenient oral once-daily regimen, venetoclax monotherapy or fixed 24-month combination therapy with rituximab represents an important option for treating RR CLL, including in patients with del(17p) or TP53 mutation and those failing a B cell receptor (BCR) inhibitor and/or chemotherapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Sep 7.,"In this paper, based on Plastoquinone (PQ) analogs possessing substituted aniline containing alkoxy group(s), new 2,3-dimethyl-5-amino-1,4-benzoquinones (PQ1-15) were designed and synthesized in either two steps or one-pot reaction. Specifically, the substituted amino moiety containing mono or poly alkoxy group(s) with various positions and groups were mainly explored to understand the structure-activity relationships for the cytotoxic activity against three human cancer cell lines (K562, Jurkat, and MT-2) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). PQ2 was found to be most effective anticancer compound on K562 and Jurkat cell lines with IC50 values of 6.40+/-1.73muM and 7.72+/-1.49muM, respectively. Interestingly, the compound was non-cytotoxic to normal PBMC and also MT-2 cancer cells. PQ2 which showed significant selectivity in MTT assay was chosen for apoptotic/necrotic evaluation and results exhibited that it induced apoptosis in K562 cell line after 6h of treatment. PQ2 showed anti-Abelson kinase 1 (Abl1) activity with different inhibitory profile than Imatinib in the panel of eight kinases. The binding mode of PQ2 into Abl ATP binding pocket was predicted in silico showing the formation of some key interactions. In addition, PQ2 induced Bcr-Abl1 mediated ERK pathway in human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. Furthermore, DNA-cleaving capability of PQ2 was clearly enhanced by iron (II) complex system. Afterward, a further in silico ADMET prediction revealed that PQ2 possesses desirable drug-like properties and favorable safety profile. These results indicated that PQ2 has multiple mechanism of action and two of them are anti-Bcr-Abl1 and DNA-cleaving activity. This study suggests that Plastoquinone analogs could be potential candidates for multi-target anticancer therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we propose a novel nanoparticle-based immunotherapeutic agent against ALL, consisting of antiCD19 antibody-conjugated, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-biocompatibilized, and Nile Blue (NB) Raman reporter-tagged gold nanoparticles of urchin-like shape (GNUs), that have a plasmonic response in the Near Infrared (NIR) spectral range. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of particle-incubated CD19-positive (CD19(+)) CCRF-SB cells show that the antiCD19-PEG-NB-GNU nanocomplex is able to recognize the CD19 B-cell-specific antigen, which is a prerequisite for targeted therapy. The therapeutic effect of the particles is confirmed by cell counting, combined with cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry and MTS assay, which additionally offer insights into their mechanisms of action. Specifically, antiCD19-PEG-NB-GNUs proved superior cytotoxic effect against CCRF-SB cells when compared with the free antibody, by reducing the overall viability below 18% after 7 days treatment at a particle-bound antibody concentration of 0.17ng/mul. Moreover, by combining their remarkable plasmonic properties with the possibility of Raman tagging, the proposed nanoparticles can also serve as spectroscopic imaging agents inside living cells, which validates their theranostic potential in the field of hematological oncology.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2019 Oct 11.,"BACKGROUND: Novel foods may provide new protein sources for a growing world population but entail risks of unexpected food-allergic reactions. No guidance on allergenicity assessment of novel foods exists, while for genetically modified (GM) crops it includes comparison of sequence identity with known allergens, digestibility tests and IgE serum screening. OBJECTIVE: As a proof of concept, to evaluate non-/allergenic tropomyosins (TMs) regarding their potential as new calibrator proteins in functional biological in vitro assays for the semi-quantitative allergy risk assessment of novel TM-containing animal foods with mealworm TM as an example. METHODS: Purified TMs (shrimp, Penaeus monodon; chicken Gallus gallus; E coli overexpression) were compared by protein sequencing, circular dichroism analysis and in vitro digestion. IgE binding was quantified using shrimp-allergic patients' sera (ELISA). Biological activities were investigated (skin testing; titrated basophil activation tests, BAT), compared to titrated biological mediator release using humanized rat basophil leukaemia (RBL) cells. RESULTS: Shrimp and chicken TMs showed high sequence homology, both alpha-helical structures and thermal stability. Shrimp TM was stable during in vitro gastric digestion, chicken TM degraded quickly. Both TMs bound specific IgE from shrimp-allergic patients (significantly higher for shrimp TM), whereas skin reactivity was mostly positive with only shrimp TM. BAT and RBL cell assays were positive with shrimp and chicken TM, although at up to 100- to 1000-times lower allergen concentrations for shrimp than chicken TM. In RBL cell assays using both TM as calibrators, an activation of effector cells by mealworm TM similar to that by shrimp TM confirmed the already reported high allergenic potency of mealworm TM as a novel protein source. CONCLUSIONS & CLINICAL RELEVANCE: According to current GM crops' allergenicity assessment, non-allergenic chicken TM could falsely be considered an allergen on a weight-of-evidence approach. However, calibrating allergenic potency in functional BAT and RBL cell assays with clinically validated TMs allowed for semi-quantitative discrimination of novel food protein's allergenicity. With TM calibration as a proof of concept, similar systems of homologous protein might be developed to scale on an axis of allergenicity.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

In this study, the regulation of PLZF on Kit, Stra8, Sohlh2, and Dmrt1 (SPCs differentiation related genes) was investigated. We found some PLZF potential binding sites existed in the promoters of Kit, Stra8, Sohlh2, and Dmrt1. Additionally, the expressions of KIT, STRA8, SOHLH2, and DMRT1 were upregulated when PLZF was knockdown in SPCs. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed PLZF directly bound to the promoters of Kit, Stra8, Sohlh2, and Dmrt1. Besides, dual luciferase assay verified PLZF repressed those gene expressions. Collectively, our finding indicate that PLZF binds to the promoter regions of Kit, Stra8, Sohlh2, and Dmrt1 to regulate SPCs differentiation, which facilitate us to further understand the regulatory mechanism of PLZF in SPCs fates.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ChIP-qPCR', '*STRA8', '*binding motif', '*promoter', '*transcription suppressor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there is limited data whether these results could be translated to post transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy). The prospective extension cohort of NCT02294552 trial enrolled 79 adult patients with acute leukemia in CR. Twenty-six received matched-related bone marrow (BM) grafts with single-agent PTCy and 53 received unrelated peripheral blood stem cell graft (PBSC) with PTCy, tacrolimus, and MMF. The grafts were studied by the flow cytometry, and plasma samples were analyzed by ELISA. In the cluster and major component analysis, we determined that transplantation from donors with high content of CD3, NKT, and CD16-CD56 + subpopulations in the PBSC grafts was associated with poor immunological recovery and compromised event-free survival (50% vs. 80%, HR 2.93, p = 0.015) both due to increased relapse incidence and non-relapse mortality. The significant independent predictor of moderate and severe chronic GVHD was the high prevalence of and iNKT, Vbeta11, and double-positive cells in the PBSC grafts from young donors (HR 2.75, p = 0.0483). No patterns could be identified for BM grafts and for plasma biomarkers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Aug 26.,"BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receive intensive induction chemotherapy for obtaining a complete remission (CR). Despite consolidation chemotherapy and advances in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, most of these patients finally relapse and die from AML. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of duration of remission achievement on survival of patients with newly diagnosed AML who achieve CR after induction chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with AML who received first induction chemotherapy between 2001 and 2018. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival for patients who had early remission after induction chemotherapy and patients who had delayed remission after induction chemotherapy were 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.87) and 35% (95% CI, 0.31-0.39), respectively (P < .001). The 5-year disease-free survival for patients who had early remission after induction chemotherapy and patients who had delayed remission after induction chemotherapy were 81% (95% CI, 0.75-0.87) and 28% (95% CI, 0.21-0.35), respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, time to entering CR is a predictor factor of overall survival and disease-free survival for patients with newly diagnosed AML who achieve CR after first induction chemotherapy. Patients achieving CR only after a lengthy time (eg, more than 29 days) should be considered to have high relapse rate and should undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Tumors leading mutations in the gene encoding for v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) serine-threonine kinase are reliant on the MAPK signaling pathway for their growth and survival. Indeed, the constitutive activation of MAPK pathway results in continuous stimulation of cell proliferation, enhancement of the apoptotic threshold and induction of a migratory and metastatic phenotype. In a clinical perspective, this scenario opens to the possibility of targeting BRAF pathway for therapy. Thyroid carcinomas (TCs) bearing BRAF mutations represent approximately 29-83% of human thyroid malignancies and, differently from melanomas, are less sensitive to BRAF inhibitors and develop primary or acquired resistance due to mutational events or activation of alternative signaling pathways able to reactivate ERK signaling. In this review, we provide an overview on the current knowledge concerning the mechanisms leading to resistance to BRAF inhibitors in human thyroid carcinomas and discuss the potential therapeutic strategies, including combinations of BRAF inhibitors with other targeted agents, which might be employed to overcome drug resistance and potentiate the activity of single agent BRAF inhibitors.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['BRAF inhibitors', 'BRAF mutation', 'mechanism of resistance', 'thyroid cancer']",PMC6770736,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
