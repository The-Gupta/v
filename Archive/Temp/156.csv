HTLV-1 encoded Tax1 oncoprotein activates the transcription of genes involved in cell growth and anti-apoptosis through the NF-kappaB pathway, and is thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ATL. While Tax1 expression is usually lost or minimal in ATL cells, these cells still show high constitutive NF-kappaB activity, indicating that genetic or epigenetic changes in ATL cells induce activation independent of Tax1. The aim of this study was to identify the molecules responsible for the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in ATL cells using a retroviral functional cloning strategy. RESULTS: Using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression and blasticidin-resistance as selection markers, several retroviral cDNA clones exhibiting constitutive NF-kappaB activity in Rat-1 cells, including full-length CD30, were obtained from an ATL cell line. Exogenous stable expression of CD30 in Rat-1 cells constitutively activated NF-kappaB. Elevated expression of CD30 was identified in all ATL lines examined, and primary ATL cells from a small number of patients (8 out of 66 cases). CONCLUSION: Elevated CD30 expression is considered one of the causes of constitutive NF-kappaB activation in ATL cells, and may be involved in ATL development.","['Higuchi, Masaya', 'Matsuda, Takehiro', 'Mori, Naoki', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Horie, Ryouichi', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Oie, Masayasu', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Higuchi M', 'Matsuda T', 'Mori N', 'Yamada Y', 'Horie R', 'Watanabe T', 'Takahashi M', 'Oie M', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata 951-8510, Japan. mhiguchi@med.niigata-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Ki-1 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Up-Regulation']",2005/05/07 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2005/05/07 09:00'],"['2005/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-2-29 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-2-29 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2005 May 6;2:29. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-2-29.,20050506,PMC1274245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore tried to find predictors of the latter outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of charts and a prospective follow-up study were done, of haemato-oncological patients, admitted to our ICU in a 7-year period with a follow-up until 2 yr thereafter. Clinical parameters during the first four consecutive days were taken to calculate the simplified acute physiology (SAPS II) and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, of proven predictive value in general ICU populations. RESULTS: From a total of 58 patients (n = 47 with acute myelogenous leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma), admitted into ICU mostly because of respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, shock or combinations, 36 patients had died during their stay in the ICU. Of ICU survivors (n = 22), 20 patients died during follow-up so that the 1-year survival rate was only 12%. The SAPS II and particularly the SOFA scores were of high predictive value for ICU and long-term mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with life-threatening complications of haematological malignancy admitted to ICU ran a high risk for death in the ICU and on the long-term, and the risk can be well predicted by SOFA. The latter may help us to decide on intensive care in individual cases, in order to avoid potentially futile care for patients with a SOFA score of 15 or higher.","['Cornet, Alexander D', 'Issa, Aart I', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Strack van Schijndel, Rob J M', 'Groeneveld, A B Johan']","['Cornet AD', 'Issa AI', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Strack van Schijndel RJ', 'Groeneveld AB']","['Department of Intensive Care, Institute for Cardiovascular Research, Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Critical Care', 'Female', '*Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure/etiology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",2005/05/07 09:00,2005/06/17 09:00,['2005/05/07 09:00'],"['2005/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH 418 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00418.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Jun;74(6):511-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00418.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ninety-five patients (59 male, 36 female, median age 52 yr) with hyperleukocytic leukaemia [leukocytes above 50 x 10(9)/L, 48 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 31 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), 13 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), three chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML)] were grouped according to the presence or absence and severity of neurologic, pulmonary and other symptoms into four categories (no, possible, probable and highly probable leukostasis syndrome). Age, white blood count (WBC), haemoglobin, blast count and total of blasts plus promyelocytes of these groups were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Patients with myeloid leukaemia (AML M1/M2, CML) which scored as highly probable leukostasis showed significantly higher WBC (P = 0.011), lower haemoglobin (P = 0.004), higher peripheral blast counts (P = 0.004) and higher total of peripheral blasts plus promyelocytes (P < 0.001) compared with the lower probability groups. In leukaemia involving the monocytic lineage (AML M4/M5, CMML) no significant differences were found in any of these factors between patients with highly probable leukostasis and the other patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a four-stage clinical grading scale is a valuable tool for analysing hyperleukocytic patient populations and evaluate the effectiveness of therapy more precisely. We further demonstrate that the mechanisms of leukostasis are different in myeloid leukaemia as compared with leukaemia with involvement of the monocytic lineage.","['Novotny, J R', 'Muller-Beissenhirtz, H', 'Herget-Rosenthal, S', 'Kribben, A', 'Duhrsen, U']","['Novotny JR', 'Muller-Beissenhirtz H', 'Herget-Rosenthal S', 'Kribben A', 'Duhrsen U']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany. juergen.novotny@medizin.uni-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/blood/*pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/complications/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/etiology/*pathology']",2005/05/07 09:00,2005/06/17 09:00,['2005/05/07 09:00'],"['2005/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH421 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00421.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Jun;74(6):501-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00421.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ku80 is a putative tumor suppressor gene that might play an important role in drug resistance. Our aim was to determine the role of Ku80 in lymphoid malignancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays were performed and the expression levels of Ku80 were measured in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n = 9) and malignant cells from 25 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (14 children, 11 adults), and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (n = 6). The Ku80 transcripts were sequencing for the possibility of mutation. RESULTS: No mutation or Ku80 variant at the RNA level was seen in any patient samples or in the Raji or CCRF-CEM cell lines. In Ku80 expression, 8.8-, 1.9-, and 6.2-fold mean increases were seen in adult, pediatric ALL, and chronic lymphoid malignancies compared with the control. The Ku80 was significantly higher in adult than in pediatric ALL (P = 0.02). The amount of Ku80 expression in ALL was moderately correlated with peripheral white blood cell counts, but not with Ki67 labeling index. High Ku80 expressers (higher than the mean of all patients with ALL) tended to respond poorly to therapy: Only 22% of high Ku80 expressers achieved durable complete remission compared to 62% of low expressers.

RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that, in spite of differences in outcome, patients clustered irrespective of age, first by T-cell or B-precursor immunophenotype, and second by cytogenetic changes within the B-precursor group. The expression pattern analysis allowed the reclassification of some samples into the proper cytogenetic group. We also showed that separate clustering of samples with the BCR/ABL translocation could be explained by different breakpoint regions in the BCR. No significant difference in gene expression was observed between samples with and without CDKN2A deletion within the B-precursor group. Analysis of different age groups revealed a similarity in expression profiles when infants with the MLL translocation and adults over 40 yr of age were compared irrespective of karyotype. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the difference in clinical outcome, the gene expression pattern in children and adults with ALL is very similar and is primarily dependent on immunophenotype and cytogenetic aberrations. However, when age groups are compared, the expression patterns of infants and adults over 40 show a remarkable similarity.","['Kuchinskaya, E', 'Heyman, M', 'Grander, D', 'Linderholm, M', 'Soderhall, S', 'Zaritskey, A', 'Nordgren, A', 'Porwit-Macdonald, A', 'Zueva, E', 'Pawitan, Y', 'Corcoran, M', 'Nordenskjold, M', 'Blennow, E']","['Kuchinskaya E', 'Heyman M', 'Grander D', 'Linderholm M', 'Soderhall S', 'Zaritskey A', 'Nordgren A', 'Porwit-Macdonald A', 'Zueva E', 'Pawitan Y', 'Corcoran M', 'Nordenskjold M', 'Blennow E']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2005/05/07 09:00,2005/06/17 09:00,['2005/05/07 09:00'],"['2005/05/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH433 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00433.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Jun;74(6):466-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00433.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the three cell strains, following laxa B treatment, we observed an increase of a polyploid cell subpopulation that could result from the alteration of topoisomerase-II activity. On the contrary, the simultaneous treatment by laxa A and laxa B led to a decrease of that subpopulation with increasing laxa A doses. However, the effect of laxa A was less pronounced in the CEM-VM1 cells, which present a low intrinsic topoisomerase-II activity. For CEM-VLB cells, the higher doses needed can be attributed to their MDR resistance. Though we observed a synergistic effect between laxa B and laxa A (the latter is inactive by itself), these results indicate a different mode of action for laxa B and laxa A + laxa B.

METHODS: MTT method was used to detect the resistant factor of resistant cell line and the reversing fold after addition of brassinolide. The intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123, a fluorescent dye transported by P-glycoprotein was detected by flow cytometry, the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II was assessed by Sulliven method to find the effect of brassinolide on resistance. The protein expression of p53 was measured using Western blotting in the sensitive cells and resistant cells to explore the effect of brassinolide. RESULTS: The resistant factors of CCRF-VCR cells on adriamycin, VP-16 and VCR are respectively as 153.1, 55.9 and 8123.1 folds comparing to the sensitive cell line CCRF-CEM. After treatment of brassinolide under the concentration of 0.001 - 10.0 microg x mL(-1), the resistance of CCRF-VCR was reversed partly with the reversing folds respectively as 4.4 - 11.6. The intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 was significantly reduced in the resistant cells. After treatment of brassinolide, the accumulation increased, the level of fluorescent dye was situated between resistant cells and sensitive cells. No alteration of the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II was found among three groups. The level of protein expression of p53 in resistant cells was higher than that of sensitive cells. After brassinolide treatment, the expression of p53 in CCRF-VCR cells restored to the level of sensitive cells.

A review of seven previously reported cases of septic arthritis due to A. hydrophila and the present case suggests that the infection commonly affected the knee and the meta-/intercarpal-phalangeal joint and was frequently rapidly progressive following trauma in fresh water and or associated with leukaemia. Second and third generation cephalosporins, gentamicin, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin and appropriate orthopaedic management should be promptly instituted. After chemical treatment and chlorination, fresh water becomes free of coliforms, but A. hydrophila persists more compared with the other strains of aeromonas, namely A. sobria and A. caviae. Seawater injuries, unlike freshwater injuries, are not usually associated with aeromonas infections. Further workup on the mechanisms of A. hydrophila resistance to chlorination could probably yield useful information in achieving new procedures of preventing and controlling such infections in public and private fresh water recreational facilities.","['Elwitigala, J P', 'Higgs, D S', 'Namnyak, S', 'White, J W', 'Yaneza, A']","['Elwitigala JP', 'Higgs DS', 'Namnyak S', 'White JW', 'Yaneza A']","['Barking, Havering and Redbridge Hospitals NHS Trust, Department of Medical Microbiology, Essex, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int J Clin Pract Suppl,International journal of clinical practice.

METHODS: We report our experience with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy in five children presenting with brain abscesses between 1995 and 2002 at the Department of Neurosurgery, Graz. Mean age was 14.8 (range 11-17 years). All abscesses were located supratentorially. One child had a single abscess and one had multilocated abscesses. Two other patients presented with both subdural empyema and brain abscess, one of them showing an epidural empyema as well. In another child, the brain abscess was associated with meningoencephalitis and subdural empyema. In all of them the underlying condition was spread of infection from the paranasal sinuses, except for one, who was immunocompromised due to cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute lymphocytic leukaemia. RESULTS: One single brain abscess and one of the multiple abscesses were drained. All subdural/epidural empyemas were treated surgically. Antibiotics were administered intravenously for 13 to 22 days (mean 22 days). All patients underwent HBO therapy; the number of treatments ranged from 26 to 45 ""dives"" (mean 30). Treatments were given once daily at 2.2 atmosphere absolutes for 60 min at 12 m. During the hospital stay all improved their clinical condition, with continued regression of abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the following weeks, other interventions were performed to treat the origin of the infections. At 6 months follow-up they were all in good clinical condition, either symptom free or with minor residual symptoms. MRI at this time showed no evidence of disease in three, a residual dural enhancement in one and a residual shrunken collection in the child with multilocated abscesses. No recurrence was observed during a mean follow-up of 21 months (range from 7 to 72 months). CONCLUSION: HBO therapy in children with brain abscesses seems to be safe and effective, even when they are associated with subdural or epidural empyemas. It provides a helpful adjuvant tool in the usual multimodal treatment of cerebral infections and may reduce the intravenous course of antibiotics and, consequently, the duration of hospitalization. Multidisciplinary management is recommended to optimize care for these critically ill children.","['Kurschel, Senta', 'Mohia, Amir', 'Weigl, Verena', 'Eder, Hans Georg']","['Kurschel S', 'Mohia A', 'Weigl V', 'Eder HG']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University, Auenbruggerplatz 29, 8036 Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Abscess/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hyperbaric Oxygenation/*methods', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Male', 'Neurosurgical Procedures/methods', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/05/06 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2005/05/06 09:00'],"['2004/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00381-005-1147-z [doi]'],ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 2006 Jan;22(1):38-42. doi: 10.1007/s00381-005-1147-z.

METHODS: XTT assays, [3H]azidopine binding to P-glycoprotein (Pgp), cellular accumulation and efflux of labeled drugs were carried out in vitro. Drug combinations using combination index, dose-reduction index, and isobologram were performed in vitro and enhancement of efficacy in drug combinations against human colon carcinoma HCT-116 xenografts were conducted with nude mice. RESULTS: N3 at sub-IC50 cytotoxic concentration (10 microM) was capable of enhancing vinblastine (VBL) cytotoxicity toward human leukemic CCRF-CEM cells about 50,000-fold as measured by the decrease of IC50 of VBL. For CCRF-CEM/VBL1000 (1,500-fold resistant to VBL and overexpressing Pgp), N3 and N5 enhanced VBL cytotoxicity as much as 6.2 million-fold and 210,000-fold, respectively. Moreover, N3 and N5 collaterally made CCRF-CEM/VBL1000 cells 4,000-fold and 130-fold, respectively, more susceptible to VBL than the parent CCRF-CEM cells. In human mammary carcinoma cells MX-1/paclitaxel which were 170-fold resistant to taxol and 38-fold resistant to VBL, N3 was capable of enhancing VBL effect as much as 6,000-fold. Combination therapy on murine P388/doxorubicin (DX) leukemia with DX+N3 or taxol+N3 achieved greater efficacy than the therapy with each drug alone. Impressively, nude mice, bearing human colon carcinoma HCT-116 cells, treated with a suboptimal dosage of taxol in combination with N3, N5 or N6 led to shrinkage of established tumor and achieved total tumor remission, while taxol alone had no tumor disappearance in this xenograft model. Furthermore, the enhancement of antitumor effect by ningalins, at least in parts, are due to inhibiting Pgp which was supported by the observation that the ningalins compete for [3H]azidopine binding to Pgp, increase the cellular accumulation of VBL or taxol, and inhibit drug efflux from the tumor cells. CONCLUSION: The profound enhancement of antitumor cytotoxicity of vinblastine and taxol in vitro by ningalins may have multiple mechanisms including the MDR-reversing effects. The mechanisms for collateral sensitivity by ningalins against sensitive (parent) cells are not yet clear. The marked enhancement of therapeutic effect of taxol by ningalins against xenograft tumors in nude mice suggests potential applications of therapeutic use of ningalins.","['Chou, Ting-Chao', 'Guan, Yongbiao', 'Soenen, Danielle R', 'Danishefsky, Samuel J', 'Boger, Dale L']","['Chou TC', 'Guan Y', 'Soenen DR', 'Danishefsky SJ', 'Boger DL']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA. chout@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Factors/*pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",2005/05/06 09:00,2005/09/09 09:00,['2005/05/06 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-005-1019-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2005 Oct;56(4):379-90. doi: 10.1007/s00280-005-1019-y.

Distribution of peripheral blood T lymphocytes and cell cycle progression.,260-6,"In transplanted mice, the P388 tumor grew better in castrated than in non castrated (NC) mice. The proportion of CD8+ in the blood was more numerous in NC mice. The T cell subsets (CD4+ and CD8+) were also high in the mice with small tumor tissue (<10 mg). The correlation observed between the tumor weight and T cell subset in PBL and in the mice with small tumors could confirm the important intervention of CD4+ and CD8+ cells to inhibit growth of tumor. Depo-testosterone (DT) injection reduced strongly weight and tumor growth in mice. On top of that, DT administration induced a significant increase in the percentage of blood CD8+ cells in grafted mice. The effect of DT was studied on the cell cycle progression, in tumor tissue of P388 tumor bearing BDF1 mice and in P388 murine leukemia cell line in culture. The cell cycle analysis in tumor tissue showed that DT decreased both the cells in S phase and the proliferating leukemic cells, with accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase. The testosterone can inhibit the proliferation of leukemic cells with a pharmacological dose (10(-7) M). This growth inhibition, dose and time dependent, was associated with cell cycle arrest; P388 cells accumulates in G0/G1 phase. We also observed a correlation between tumor weight and the percentage of cells in G0/G1 and the relative number of cells in proliferative state (S + G2/M). To conclude, our experiments reported that testosterone prevents the growth of tumor: indirectly by modulation of subsets T cells distribution and directly by the alteration of the cell cycle.","['Aboudkhil, S', 'Henry, L', 'Zaid, A', 'Bureau, J P']","['Aboudkhil S', 'Henry L', 'Zaid A', 'Bureau JP']","['Departement of Biology, UFR Environment and Health, Faculty of Science and Technique University Hassan II, Mohammedia, Maroc. souadaboudkhil@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', 'M0XW1UBI14 (testosterone 17 beta-cypionate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Castration', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Seminal Vesicles/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects', 'Testosterone/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects']",2005/05/06 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/05/06 09:00'],"['2005/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2005;52(3):260-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently oridonin has been reported to have anti- tumor effects in a large variety of malignant diseases. In this study, we investigated the apoptotic inducing effect of oridonin in leukemia K562 cells and its mechanism. Cell growth inhibition was measured using a microculture tetrazolium assay, apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry and electron microscopy as well as by DNA fragmentation analysis. Telomerase activity was measured by TRAP-enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay, and the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins was detected by western blot analysis. The results showed that oridonin could inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis on leukemia K562 cells remarkably. Telomerase activity as well as Bcl-2 expression was down- regulated, while Bax expression was up-regulated concurrently, when apoptosis ocurred. We therefore conclude that oridonin demonstrated anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects on K562 cells in vitro, and that changes in bcl-2 and bax protein levels as well as telomerase activity may play an important role in its mechanism of action.","['Liu, J J', 'Huang, R W', 'Lin, D J', 'Wu, X Y', 'Peng, J', 'Pan, X L', 'Song, Y Q', 'Lin, Q', 'Hou, M', 'Wang, D N', 'Chen, F', 'Zhang, M H']","['Liu JJ', 'Huang RW', 'Lin DJ', 'Wu XY', 'Peng J', 'Pan XL', 'Song YQ', 'Lin Q', 'Hou M', 'Wang DN', 'Chen F', 'Zhang MH']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, 510630 Guangzhou, Guangdong, P.R.

As the proportion of leukemic blast cells is critical for exact cytochemical analysis, study was restricted to the evaluation of 48 adult and pediatric patients with newly diagnosed AMLs with 80% or more blasts in analyzed samples. The cytochemical investigation of myeloperoxidase (MPO), Sudan black B (SBB), chloroacetate esterase (CAE), alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase (ANBE), alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) and acid phosphatase (AP) in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow was performed. The immunophenotype was examined for the maturation dependent myeloid antigens CD13, CD33, CD11b, CD14, CD15, CD65, CD36, cytoplasmic MPO, non-lineage associated CD34 and HLA-DR antigens, lymphoid- associated antigens CD7, CD4, CD38 as well as natural killer cell associated marker CD56. Flow cytometry by double marker staining and visualization of pathologic cells in dot plots reflected immunophenotypic aberrancy and degree of cell maturation. The patients were classified into AML subtypes M0- M2, M3, M4 and M5 according to the main morphological, cytochemical and immunophenotypical features. The variable combinations of MPO, SBB, CAE and ANBE were identified in relation to immunophenotype. The cytochemical profile of blasts was in concordance with immunophenotype, particularly in more differentiated AML subtypes, M3, M4 and M5. The findings of myeloid antigens expression and cytochemical features in poorly differentiated AML subtypes showed no practical relevance of cytochemical analysis. Notwithstanding that the cytochemical analysis of AML subtypes not sufficiently identifies the distinct aberrancies in heterogeneous leukemic blast cell populations, evaluation of the cytochemical profile in connection with immunophenotyping may help to classify the AML patients to relevant subtypes with more accuracy.","['Klobusicka, M', 'Kusenda, J', 'Babusikova, O']","['Klobusicka M', 'Kusenda J', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, 83391 Bratislava, Slovak Republic. exonklo@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '9YDL1Q990E (Sudan Black B)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (naphthylbutyrate esterase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Azo Compounds', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/analysis', 'Child', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*enzymology/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/*enzymology/immunology', 'Male', 'Naphthalenes', 'Peroxidase/analysis']",2005/05/06 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/05/06 09:00'],"['2005/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2005;52(3):211-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, people with mental illness are stigmatized more severely than those with physical health conditions; those who abuse alcohol are viewed more harshly than those with mental illness. Second, stereotypes of mental illness related to responsibility and dangerousness lead to negative emotional reactions and discriminatory behaviors. Third, familiarity with people with mental illness tends to diminish stigma. This study attempted to validate these findings with a large and diverse sample of adolescents. METHODS: A total of 303 adolescents completed a revised version of the Attribution Questionnaire (rAQ) that presented four vignettes, each describing a different type of peer: a peer with mental illness, with mental illness caused by a brain tumor, with alcohol abuse problems, and with leukemia. The rAQ comprises seven Likert scale items of agreement that research participants rated for each vignette. Items included pity, danger, fear, responsibility, anger, help, and avoidance. Participants also completed a revised Level of Contact Report to assess their familiarity with mental illness. RESULTS: As with adults, adolescents stigmatized peers who abuse alcohol most severely, followed by those with mental illness. Peers with leukemia were treated more benignly than the other groups. Having a brain tumor mediated the stigmatizing effect of mental illness. Adolescents who agreed that persons with mental illness are responsible for their illness and are dangerous demonstrated more discrimination toward these persons. However, this finding was not supported for alcohol abuse. Familiarity yielded an unexpected effect among adolescents; those who reported more familiarity with mental illness were more likely to endorse stigma of mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents tended to discriminate among conditions, viewing substance abuse more harshly than the other disorders. Blame and dangerousness were important variables leading to discrimination, and contact with persons with mental illness led to more discrimination.","['Corrigan, Patrick W', 'Lurie, Barbara Demming', 'Goldman, Howard H', 'Slopen, Natalie', 'Medasani, Krishna', 'Phelan, Sean']","['Corrigan PW', 'Lurie BD', 'Goldman HH', 'Slopen N', 'Medasani K', 'Phelan S']","['Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, 1033 University Place, Evanston, IL 60201, USA. p-corrigan2@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",United States,Psychiatr Serv,"Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)",9502838,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alcoholism/*psychology', 'California', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology', 'Psychology, Adolescent', '*Stereotyping', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2005/05/06 09:00,2005/08/05 09:00,['2005/05/06 09:00'],"['2005/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['56/5/544 [pii]', '10.1176/appi.ps.56.5.544 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychiatr Serv. 2005 May;56(5):544-50. doi: 10.1176/appi.ps.56.5.544.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Embryonic stem (ES) cells have unlimited developmental potential and can be manipulated at the molecular genetic level by a variety of methods. The aim of this study was to determine if ES cells could respond to developmental signals within the mouse embryonic day 12 to embryonic day 13 (E12 to E13) kidney microenvironment and incorporate into kidney structures. ROSA26 ES cells were shown to express beta-galactosidase ubiquitously when cultured in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor to suppress differentiation. When these cells were microinjected into E12 to E13 metanephroi and then placed in transwell organ culture, ES cell-derived, beta-galactosidase-positive cells were identified in epithelial structures resembling tubules. On rare occasions, individual ES cells were observed in structures resembling glomerular tufts. Electron microscopy showed that the ES cell-derived tubules were surrounded by basement membrane and had apical microvilli and junctional complexes. Marker analysis revealed that a subset of these epithelial tubules bound Lotus tetragonolobus and expressed alpha(1) Na(+)/K(+) ATPase. ES cells were infected before injection with a cytomegalovirus promoter-green fluorescence protein (GFP) adenovirus and GFP expression was found as early as 18 h, persisting for up to 48 h in cultured kidneys. This ES cell technology may achieve the objective of obtaining a versatile cell culture system in which molecular interventions can be used in vitro and consequences of these perturbations on the normal kidney development program in vivo can be studied.","['Steenhard, Brooke M', 'Isom, Kathryn S', 'Cazcarro, Patricia', 'Dunmore, Judy H', 'Godwin, Alan R', 'St John, Patricia L', 'Abrahamson, Dale R']","['Steenhard BM', 'Isom KS', 'Cazcarro P', 'Dunmore JH', 'Godwin AR', 'St John PL', 'Abrahamson DR']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Kansas Medical Center, MS #3038, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Am Soc Nephrol,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,9013836,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Development/physiology', 'Kidney/*embryology', 'Mice', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Organogenesis/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2005/05/06 09:00,2005/10/22 09:00,['2005/05/06 09:00'],"['2005/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['ASN.2004070584 [pii]', '10.1681/ASN.2004070584 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Soc Nephrol. 2005 Jun;16(6):1623-31. doi: 10.1681/ASN.2004070584.

Immunohistochemically, the blasts from all three patients had an immature marker profile with a T-blast population (cCD3+, CD4-, CD7+, CD8-, CD99+, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase +) and a hematopoietic progenitor cell marker (CD34). In two patients, the blasts also expressed myeloid lineage specificity (naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase activity and myeloperoxidase positivity). However, it was difficult to distinguish between blast proliferation in CML and non-Hodgkin lymphoma from these immunohistopathological findings alone. Subsequently, bcr gene rearrangement and bcr/abl mRNA expression were detected by Southern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the lymph nodes.

To investigate the significance of the class II antigen of HTLV-I infected cells, the progressiveness of HTLV-I-infected long-term cultured T-cell lines was evaluated, and then their antigen-presenting capacity was examined using a superantigen, staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB). Among the cell lines derived from peripheral blood, HPB-ATL-T (ATL-T), HPB-ATL-2 (ATL-2) and HPB-ATL-O were more progressed than Tax exclusively expressing HPB-CTL-I (CTL-I), because the former deleted p16 gene (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) and strongly transcribed survivin (reverse transcriptase-PCR). Notably, interferon gamma-independent loss of class II expression of ATL-T and ATL-2 was found. In antigen-presenting experiments, however, both cell lines induced SEB-dependent significant T-cell proliferation estimated by [(3)H] thymidine uptake. No class II-re-expressed ATL-2 cells were observed in the SEB-presenting cultures by indirect immunofluorescence, and only minimum inhibition of SEB-dependent T-cell response by anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR monoclonal antibody was observed. These findings suggest that both ATL-T and ATL-2 very effectively present SEB to T cells less dependently on class II molecules. These less immunogenic leukemic cells of aggressive ATL may contribute to disease aggression.","['Nagasaki, Makoto', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Morikawa, Shigeru', 'Harada, Takayuki', 'Nabika, Toru', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu']","['Nagasaki M', 'Zhang J', 'Morikawa S', 'Harada T', 'Nabika T', 'Tanaka Y']","['Clinical Laboratory, Hamada Medical Center, Shimane, Japan. mnagasaki@hamamda2.hosp.gp.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Superantigens)', '0 (Survivin)', '39424-53-8 (enterotoxin B, staphylococcal)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Bacterial/immunology/physiology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Enterotoxins/immunology/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'HTLV-I Antigens/immunology/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Superantigens/immunology/*physiology', 'Survivin', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/virology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2005/05/06 09:00,2005/08/23 09:00,['2005/05/06 09:00'],"['2005/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['PIN1823 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1827.2005.01823.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2005 May;55(5):264-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.2005.01823.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of a study design based on the record-linkage between hospital discharge records and INPS social security records (National Institute for Social Security), in order to investigate the association between past employment in an economic sector and occurrence of diseases with a low fraction attributable to occupation and a high frequency in the population, where it is too costly to perform retrospective interviews to gather data from each recruited subject. METHODS: A case-control study design was used in which hospital discharge records from 1995 in the Piedmont Region represented the source of subjects enrolled. Four series of cases were identified: males aged 40-75 years, with first hospital admission for leukaemia, lung or bladder cancer; and women aged 18-39 years, admitted for miscarriage. The controls were a random sample of patients admitted in the same year and matched by sex and age. The exposure variable was the prevalent economic sector in the occupational history of the subjects enrolled, as inferred from INPS social security records. RESULTS: No economic sector examined showed a significant excess of incidence of bladder cancer or leukaemia. There was a significant excess of lung cancer in subjects with longest employment in the building industry, in metal working, and in the ""foundries, heat pressing, forging, and rolling mills"" sector. A significant excess of miscarriages was present only in women working in commerce. DISCUSSION: The results demonstrated overall a low consistency compared with those obtained via other surveillance systems of occupational morbidity and mortality, as well as by means of analytical studies. The results appear more plausible for the sectors characterized by a low number of job tasks, or by a more homogenous exposure to risk factors among workers in different jobs. Among the limitations of this study the lack of a complete occupational history, the absence of information on potential confounders like smoking and alcohol consumption, and the probable non-differential misclassification of the longest held job need to be stressed","[""d'Errico, A"", 'Mamo, C', 'Costa, G', 'Filippi, M', 'Crosignani, P']","[""d'Errico A"", 'Mamo C', 'Costa G', 'Filippi M', 'Crosignani P']","['Servizio regionale di Epidemiologia, ASL 5, Grugliasco (TO). angelo.derrico@epi.piemonte.it']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,,IM,"['Abortion, Spontaneous/*epidemiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hospital Records', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Medical Record Linkage', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Patient Discharge', 'Pensions', 'Population Surveillance', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*epidemiology']",2005/05/06 09:00,2006/01/31 09:00,['2005/05/06 09:00'],"['2005/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Lav. 2005;96 Suppl:s147-60.,,,,,Il linkage tra le storie professionali di fonte INPS e i dati dei ricoveri ospedalieri per lo studio delle cause lavorative di alcuni tumori e degli aborti spontanei.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible use of INPS (National Institute of Social Security) records for the purpose of surveillance of occupational mortality, in terms of feasibility of setting up a system and of validity of the results obtained. METHODS: Death records of 218,510 subjects aged 18-74, deceased in the 12 months following the 1991 census, were obtained from ISTAT (Central Statistics Institute). These were combined through record-linkage with the INPS social security archives, which contain the employment records by economic sector going back to 1974, in order to assign these deaths the sector in which they had worked the longest. Mortality by specific causes was evaluated by industry by means of a proportional mortality analysis stratified by sex and occupational status, and adjusted for age, education, marital status, geographical area of birth, drawing a disability pension, employment status at the time of death and work instability. RESULTS: Record-linkage allowed attribution of the longest held job to 70% of the deaths recorded. Results are presented and discussed only on mortality in men due to asbestosis and silicosis, and causes of death with a substantial proportion attributable to occupation: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); cancers of the bladder, nasal cavity, larynx, lung and pleura; leukaemia and lymphoma; accidental causes. Among the economic sectors with a significant excess mortality, the following are well documented in the literature: mortality due to COPD in the coal and peat-bog sectors; due to leukaemia among farmers; due to sino-nasal tumours in wood-working and furniture production; due to cancer of the larynx, lung, and pleura in occupations where there was probable exposure to asbestos (fishing and maritime transport, non-metal mining, building industry, and naval, train and aircraft construction); due to silicosis in industries with potential exposure to crystalline silica; due to accidental causes in the building industry and farming. Other mortality excesses and deficits, especially those due to bladder and lympho-haemopoietic cancers, appear to be only partly consistent with those described by other authors. DISCUSSION: The feasibility of developing a surveillance system of occupational mortality based on the INPS source was found to be good, and, at least among males, for 75% of the deceased subjects historical information existed concerning the economic sectors registered in the INPS records. The results obtained would appear to indicate that the system is capable of highlighting risk excesses due to widespread exposure in the industries examined, regarding diseases for which there is a strong association with exposure. On the other hand, due to the inherent limits of the study's design (lack of a complete work history and of precise information on the jobs held) its use is not recommended in the surveillance of diseases with a low proportion attributable to a risk factor, or with wide exposure variability in a given sector among the various jobs.","[""d'Errico, A"", 'Filippi, M', 'Demaria, M', 'Picanza, Grazia', 'Crialesi, Roberta', 'Costa, G', 'Campo, G', 'Passerini, M']","[""d'Errico A"", 'Filippi M', 'Demaria M', 'Picanza G', 'Crialesi R', 'Costa G', 'Campo G', 'Passerini M']","['Servizio regionale di Epidemiologia, ASL 5, Grugliasco (TO). angelo.derrico@epi.piemonte.it']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', '*Medical Record Linkage', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Population Surveillance']",2005/05/06 09:00,2006/01/31 09:00,['2005/05/06 09:00'],"['2005/05/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Lav. 2005;96 Suppl:s52-65.,,,,,Mortalita per settore produttivo in Italia nel 1992 secondo le storie lavorative INPS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typhilitis may produce a similar constellation of clinical findings causing further diagnostic confusion. This review compares the relative frequency of these two conditions in children with hematologic malignancy with a focus on the clinical presentation, distinguishing features, surgical management, and outcome for patients with appendicitis. METHODS: This institutional review board-approved retrospective study evaluated 464 pediatric patients treated for hematologic malignancy at our institution from 1997 to 2003. From this cohort, we identified all children with a diagnosis of appendicitis or typhilitis. Data include demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory studies, and computed tomography (CT) scan findings. Groups were compared using the Fisher exact test. Significance was defined as P < .05. RESULTS: Eight (1.7%) of 464 children were diagnosed with typhilitis and 7 (1.5%) with appendicitis. There were no demographic differences between patients with appendicitis and typhilitis. Distinguishing clinical features in children with typhilitis included presence of fever and diarrhea. Clinical presentation in children with appendicitis was atypical in 5 of 7 cases yielding an incorrect preoperative diagnosis in all 5. Radiographic evaluation by CT scan accurately defined typhilitis, but not appendicitis. An operation was performed on all 7 children with appendicitis with no operative morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Appendicitis and typhilitis occur with similar frequency in children with leukemia and lymphoma. Typhilitis is accurately diagnosed with clinical findings of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and typical CT scan findings. Appendicitis tends to present with atypical findings, but can be successfully managed with standard surgical care.","['Hobson, Michael J', 'Carney, David E', 'Molik, Kimberly A', 'Vik, Terry', 'Scherer, L R Tres 3rd', 'Rouse, Thomas M', 'West, Karen W', 'Grosfeld, Jay L', 'Billmire, Deborah F']","['Hobson MJ', 'Carney DE', 'Molik KA', 'Vik T', 'Scherer LR 3rd', 'Rouse TM', 'West KW', 'Grosfeld JL', 'Billmire DF']","['Section of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine and the J.W.

In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanisms of anti-proliferative effects by aqueous extract of C. militaris (AECM) in human leukemia U937 cells. It was found that AECM could inhibit cell growth of U937 cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with morphological change and apoptotic cell death such as formation of apoptotic bodies and DNA fragmentation. We observed the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression and proteolytic activation of caspase-3 in AECM-treated U937 cells. However, AECM did not affect the pro-apoptotic Bax expression and activity of caspase-9. Furthermore, Western blotting and RT-PCR revealed that AECM treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E2 accumulation. Taken together, these results indicated that the anti-proliferative effects of AECM were associated with the induction of apoptotic cell death through regulation of several major growth regulatory gene products such as Bcl-2 family expression and caspase protease activity, and AECM may have therapeutic potential in human leukemia treatment.","['Park, Cheol', 'Hong, Sang Hoon', 'Lee, Jae-Yun', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Choi, Byung Tae', 'Lee, Yong Tea', 'Park, Dong Il', 'Park, Yeong-Min', 'Jeong, Yong-Kee', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Park C', 'Hong SH', 'Lee JY', 'Kim GY', 'Choi BT', 'Lee YT', 'Park DI', 'Park YM', 'Jeong YK', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Oriental Medicine, Dongeui University College of Oriental Medicine, Biomedical Research Center of Oriental Medicine, Busan 614-052, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cordyceps/*chemistry', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Dinoprostone/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2005/05/05 09:00,2005/09/20 09:00,['2005/05/05 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2005 Jun;13(6):1211-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and others have reported that several epithelial cancer-related antigens are also expressed in hematological malignancies. Two patients with hematological malignancy (multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia) were vaccinated with peptides derived from epithelial cancer-related antigens to evaluate the immune responses to peptides under a personalized peptide vaccination regimen. There was no adverse event except for local skin reaction at the injection site. The peptide vaccination augmented both peptide-specific CTLs cytotoxic to hematological malignant cells in post-vaccination peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peptide-specific IgG in post-vaccination sera. A transient but obvious decrease of malignant cells was observed at the early phase of the vaccination in both cases. Vaccines consisting of peptides derived from epithelial cancer antigens safely increased anti-tumor cell activity in patients with hematological malignancies.

The rearrangement resulted in the production of BCR-FGFR1 and FGFR1-BCR chimeric transcripts after in-frame fusions of BCR exon 4 with FGFR1 exon 9 and FGFR1 exon 8 with BCR exon 5, respectively. The four previously reported patients with such translocation presented with an atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) without Philadelphia chromosome. In addition to a myeloproliferation, the patient had a B cell proliferation. The phenotypic characterization of the lymphoid cells in the bone marrow showed a continuum of maturation from blast B cells to polyclonal lymphocytes. In the blood, B cells showed a complete polyclonal maturation. The BCR-FGFR1 gene fusion was detected by dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization in both CD19- and CD19+ populations.

It has proved beneficial in treating patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). In addition, IM demonstrates activity against malignant cells expressing c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R). The activity of IM in the blastic crisis of CML and against various myeloma cell lines suggests that this drug may also target other cellular components. In the light of the important role of telomerase in malignant transformation, we evaluated the effect of IM on telomerase activity (TA) and regulation in various malignant cell lines. Imatinib mesylate caused a dose-dependent inhibition of TA (up to 90% at a concentration of 15 microM IM) in c-kit-expressing SK-N-MC (Ewing sarcoma), SK-MEL-28 (melanoma), RPMI 8226 (myeloma), MCF-7 (breast cancer) and HSC 536/N (Fanconi anaemia) cells as well as in ba/F3 (murine pro-B cells), which do not express c-kit, BCR-ABL or PDGF-R. Imatinib mesylate did not affect the activity of other DNA polymerases. Inhibition of TA was associated with 50% inhibition of proliferation. The inhibition of proliferation was associated with a decrease in the S-phase of the cell cycle and an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase. No apoptosis was observed. Inhibition of TA was caused mainly by post-translational modifications: dephosphorylation of AKT and, to a smaller extent, by early downregulation of hTERT (the catalytic subunit of the enzyme) transcription. Other steps of telomerase regulation were not affected by IM. This study demonstrates an additional cellular target of IM, not necessarily mediated via known tyrosine kinases, that causes inhibition of TA and cell proliferation.","['Uziel, O', 'Fenig, E', 'Nordenberg, J', 'Beery, E', 'Reshef, H', 'Sandbank, J', 'Birenbaum, M', 'Bakhanashvili, M', 'Yerushalmi, R', 'Luria, D', 'Lahav, M']","['Uziel O', 'Fenig E', 'Nordenberg J', 'Beery E', 'Reshef H', 'Sandbank J', 'Birenbaum M', 'Bakhanashvili M', 'Yerushalmi R', 'Luria D', 'Lahav M']","['Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Campus, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Petah-Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fanconi Anemia/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Melanoma/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Telomerase/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/05/05 09:00,2005/06/17 09:00,['2005/05/05 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['6602592 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6602592 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2005 May 23;92(10):1881-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602592.,,PMC2361771,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analysed the methylation status of the CpG island in the TIMP-2 promoter region by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in hematopoietic cell lines. TIMP-2 promoter hypermethylation in the lymphoma cell line Raji and the leukemia cell line KG1a was associated with transcriptional repression. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in TIMP-2 upregulation in both cell lines. TIMP-2 was expressed in the cell lines HL60, U266 and XG1, which carry an unmethylated promoter region. MSP analysis of primary patient samples revealed aberrant methylation of TIMP-2 in 33/90 (36.7%) cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), but not in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in nonmalignant bone marrow and lymph nodes. The frequency of TIMP-2 methylation was slightly higher in aggressive NHL subtypes compared to those with an indolent subtype (38.6 versus 33.3%). In contrast, TIMP-2 was not hypermethylated in any of the 40 cases of acute myelogenous leukemia examined. We conclude that promoter hypermethylation of TIMP-2 is a novel epigenetic event in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies and may contribute to a more aggressive NHL phenotype.","['Galm, Oliver', 'Suzuki, Hiromu', 'Akiyama, Yoshimitsu', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Brock, Malcolm V', 'Osieka, Rainhardt', 'Baylin, Stephen B', 'Herman, James G']","['Galm O', 'Suzuki H', 'Akiyama Y', 'Esteller M', 'Brock MV', 'Osieka R', 'Baylin SB', 'Herman JG']","['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, 1650 Orleans St, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/analysis/*genetics/immunology/*metabolism']",2005/05/05 09:00,2005/08/09 09:00,['2005/05/05 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208599 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208599 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Jul 14;24(30):4799-805. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208599.,,,,"['CA84986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA96888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Antibody titers for mumps, rubeola, rubella, tetanus and diphtheria toxoid, poliovirus serotypes 1, 2,and 3, Haemophilus influenzae type b, varicella, and hepatitis B were obtained from 100 children with ALL. Children with non-protective titers to these microbial antigens were re-vaccinated and re-studied after anamnestic vaccine challenge. RESULTS: The percent of children with ALL who had protective titers was markedly less than that anticipated for immunized control subjects. Longitudinally, many titers fluctuate between protective and non-protective antibody responses after re-immunization. The chemotherapy protocol used did not affect the ability of these children to express protective antibody responses. T-, B-, and NK-cell numbers and proliferative responses to mitogens were all normal. Age correlated with titer results for certain vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: Children in remission from ALL have a high prevalence of humoral immune defects that are not related to any specific chemotherapy regimen. This antibody deficiency may place children with ALL at risk for the development of these bacterial and viral diseases, even after completion of chemotherapy.

In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) some data indicate derivation of T-cells from the leukemic clone and only a few cases of T-derived blastic crisis have been reported and quite often disputed. Particularly in cases identified initially in blastic crisis it may be difficult to distinguish those from Ph1-positive T-ALL. We herein report 2 patients who presented with a clinical picture of Ph1-positive T-ALL and who raised a differential diagnosis from T-cell blastic crisis of CML. We review the literature and suggest clinical and laboratory features that can help in the diagnosis. According to our literature review, 23 cases of Ph1-positive T-ALL and 44 cases of T-cell blastic crisis of CML, including ours, were reported. Some major differences between the two entities could help in establishing a diagnosis of Ph1-positive T-cell blastic crisis of CML vs. Ph1-positive T-ALL: Male sex and younger age was more predominant in T-ALL. While in most cases of CML blastic crisis there was a history of CML there was no such history in the T-ALL cases. Medullary involvement with lymphoblastic leukemia was present in all cases of T-ALL but only in about half of the cases of CML blastic crisis.

Patients who had an HLA-identical sibling donor and no contraindication went for an allogeneic SCT (related donor, RD). After diagnosis, patients not allotransplanted received HU and IFN to keep WBC and platelet counts low. After 6 months patients with Ph-positive cells still present in the bone marrow received 1-3 courses of intensive chemotherapy. Those who became Ph-negative after IFN + HU or after 1-3 chemotherapy courses underwent autologous SCT. Some patients with poor cytogenetic response were allotransplanted with an unrelated donor (URD). IFN + HU reduced the percentage of Ph-positive metaphases in 56% of patients, and 1 patient became Ph-negative. After one or two intensive cytotherapies 86 and 88% had a Ph reduction, and 34 and 40% became Ph-negative, respectively. In patients receiving a third intensive chemotherapy 92% achieved a Ph reduction and 8% became Ph-negative. The median survival after auto-SCT (n = 46) was 7.5 years. The chance of remaining Ph-negative for up to 10 years after autologous SCT was around 20%. The overall survival for allo-SCT RD (n = 91) and URD (n = 28) was almost the same, i.e. approximately 60% at 10 years.

The fusion protein combines the transcription activating domain of MN1 and the DNA binding domain of TEL and is thought to act as a deranged transcription factor. In addition, disruption of the large first exon of the MN1 gene is thought to inactivate MN1 function in a meningioma. To further investigate the role of MN1 in cancer, we generated Mn1 knockout mice. Mn1(+/-) animals were followed for 30 months, but they had no higher incidence of tumor formation than wild-type littermates. Mn1 null mice, however, were found to die at birth or shortly thereafter as the result of a cleft palate. Investigation of newborn or embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) to E17.5 null mice revealed that the development of several bones in the skull was abnormal. The affected bones are almost exclusively formed by intramembranous ossification. They are either completely agenic at birth (alisphenoid and squamosal bones and vomer), hypoplastic, deformed (basisphenoid, pterygoid, and presphenoid), or substantially thinner (frontal, parietal, and interparietal bones). In heterozygous mice hypoplastic membranous bones and incomplete penetrance of the cleft palate were observed.

Microarray analysis performed in the presence or absence of a dominant-negative BRG1 ATPase demonstrated that approximately one-third of MyoD-induced genes were highly dependent on SWI/SNF enzymes. To understand the mechanism of activation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations analyzing the myogenin promoter. We found that H4 hyperacetylation preceded Brg1 binding in a MyoD-dependent manner but that MyoD binding occurred subsequent to H4 modification and Brg1 interaction. In the absence of functional SWI/SNF enzymes, muscle regulatory proteins did not bind to the myogenin promoter, thereby providing evidence for SWI/SNF-dependent activator binding. We observed that the homeodomain factor Pbx1, which cooperates with MyoD to stimulate myogenin expression, is constitutively bound to the myogenin promoter in a SWI/SNF-independent manner, suggesting a two-step mechanism in which MyoD initially interacts indirectly with the myogenin promoter and attracts chromatin-remodeling enzymes, which then facilitate direct binding by MyoD and other regulatory proteins.","['de la Serna, Ivana L', 'Ohkawa, Yasuyuki', 'Berkes, Charlotte A', 'Bergstrom, Donald A', 'Dacwag, Caroline S', 'Tapscott, Stephen J', 'Imbalzano, Anthony N']","['de la Serna IL', 'Ohkawa Y', 'Berkes CA', 'Bergstrom DA', 'Dacwag CS', 'Tapscott SJ', 'Imbalzano AN']","['University of Massachusetts Medical School, Department of Cell Biology, 55 Lake Avenue North, Worcester, MA 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (MYOG protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (MyoD Protein)', '0 (Myog protein, mouse)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Myogenin)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (SRSF2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Smarca4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'DNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Helicases', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Multiprotein Complexes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Muscles/cytology/metabolism', 'MyoD Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors', 'Myogenin/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2005/05/05 09:00,2005/06/15 09:00,['2005/05/05 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/10/3997 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.10.3997-4009.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 May;25(10):3997-4009. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.10.3997-4009.2005.,,PMC1087700,,"['R01 GM056244/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR045113/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM56244/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR045113/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The (8;21) chromosomal translocation, which replaces the C terminus of AML1 with the ETO protein, modifies subnuclear targeting of AML1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and results in defective myelopoiesis. We therefore addressed the relevance of AML1 subnuclear targeting and associated functions that reside in the C terminus to myeloid differentiation. A single amino acid substitution that abrogates intranuclear localization was introduced in the AML1 subnuclear targeting signal. Expression of the mutant AML1 protein blocks differentiation of myeloid progenitors to granulocytes in the presence of endogenous AML1 protein, as also occurs in the (8;21) chromosomal translocation, where only one allele of the AML1 gene is affected. The cells expressing the mutant AML1 protein continue to proliferate, maintain an immature blast-like morphology, and exhibit transformed properties that are hallmarks of leukemogenesis.

Approximately 50% to 75% of adults with AML achieve complete remission (CR) with cytarabine and an anthracycline such as daunorubicin or idarubicin or the anthracenedione mitoxantrone. However, only approximately 20% to 30% of the patients enjoy long-term disease survival. Various postremission strategies have been explored to eliminate minimal residual disease. The optimal dose, schedule, and number of cycles of postremission chemotherapy for most patients are not known. A variety of prognostic factors can predict outcome and include the karyotype of the leukemic cells and the presence of transmembrane transporter proteins, which extrude certain chemotherapy agents from the cell and confer multidrug resistance and mutations in or over expressions of specific genes such as WT1, CEBPA, BAX and the ratio of BCL2 to BAX, BAALC, EVI1, KIT, and FLT3. Most recently, insights into the molecular pathogenesis of AML have led to the development of more specific targeted agents and have ushered in an exciting new era of antileukemia therapy.

Thus, the NPM1 mutation is a frequent abnormality in AML patients without known genetic marker; the mutation may represent a new target to monitor minimal residual disease in AML and a potential candidate for alternative and targeted treatments.","['Cazzaniga, Giovanni', ""Dell'Oro, Maria Grazia"", 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Giarin, Emanuela', 'Masetti, Riccardo', 'Rossi, Vincenzo', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Martelli, Massimo F', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Falini, Brunangelo']","['Cazzaniga G', ""Dell'Oro MG"", 'Mecucci C', 'Giarin E', 'Masetti R', 'Rossi V', 'Locatelli F', 'Martelli MF', 'Basso G', 'Pession A', 'Biondi A', 'Falini B']","['Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica University of Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, 20052 Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin']",2005/05/05 09:00,2005/09/20 09:00,['2005/05/05 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53155-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-03-0899 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Aug 15;106(4):1419-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-03-0899.

SERT was readily detected in derived B cell lines with origins as diverse as B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Concentration and timecourse kinetics for the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of the amphetamine derivatives fenfluramine (an appetite suppressant) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ""Ecstasy"") revealed them as being similar to the endogenous indoleamine. A tricyclic antidepressant, clomipramine, instead mirrored the behavior of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, both being effective in the low micromolar range. A majority of neoplastic clones were sensitive to one or more of the serotonergic compounds. Dysregulated bcl-2 expression, either by t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation or its introduction as a constitutively active transgene, provided protection from proapoptotic but not antiproliferative outcomes. These data indicate a potential for SERT as a novel anti-tumor target for amphetamine analogs, while evidence is presented that the seemingly more promising antidepressants are likely impacting malignant B cells independently of the transporter itself.","['Meredith, Elizabeth J', 'Holder, Michelle J', 'Chamba, Anita', 'Challa, Anita', 'Drake-Lee, Adrian', 'Bunce, Christopher M', 'Drayson, Mark T', 'Pilkington, Geoffrey', 'Blakely, Randy D', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Barnes, Nicholas M', 'Gordon, John']","['Meredith EJ', 'Holder MJ', 'Chamba A', 'Challa A', 'Drake-Lee A', 'Bunce CM', 'Drayson MT', 'Pilkington G', 'Blakely RD', 'Dyer MJ', 'Barnes NM', 'Gordon J']","['Division of Immunity and Infection, The Medical School, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Psychotropic Drugs)', '0 (SLC6A4 protein, human)', '0 (Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins)', '01K63SUP8D (Fluoxetine)', '2DS058H2CF (Fenfluramine)', 'KE1SEN21RM (N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine)', 'NUV44L116D (Clomipramine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*chemistry/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clomipramine/pharmacology', 'Fenfluramine/pharmacology', 'Fluoxetine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*chemistry/drug therapy', 'N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/physiology', 'Psychotropic Drugs/*pharmacology', 'Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*analysis/drug effects/physiology']",2005/05/05 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2005/05/05 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['04-3477fje [pii]', '10.1096/fj.04-3477fje [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2005 Jul;19(9):1187-9. doi: 10.1096/fj.04-3477fje.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1966-December 2004) was searched using the English-language key terms 2-amino-6-methoxypurine arabinoside, 506U78, and nelarabine. Data were also obtained from published abstracts. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Clinical studies evaluating the pharmacokinetics of nelarabine, ara-G, and cellular ara-GTP and use of nelarabine, alone or in combination with other agents for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, were included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Nelarabine is the water-soluble, 6-methoxy analog of 9-beta-D-ara-G. Nelarabine is readily converted to ara-G by endogenous adenosine deaminase. The half-life of nelarabine is approximately 15 minutes compared with 2-4 hours for ara-G. The clearance of ara-G is higher in children than in adults (0.312 vs 0.213 L x h(-1) x kg(-1)). Intracellular ara-GTP elimination is slow relative to nelarabine and ara-G. In pediatric and adult patients, neurologic toxicity is dose limiting. Severe myelosuppression was not consistently observed. Major responses were seen in patients with T-cell malignancies. Patients who responded had significantly higher intracellular ara-GTP concentrations compared with those who did not respond. CONCLUSIONS: Nelarabine is an effective ara-G prodrug. Nelarabine has significant activity against malignant T-cells and appears to be an important addition to treatments of various leukemias.","['Kisor, David F']",['Kisor DF'],"['Raabe College of Pharmacy, Ohio Northern University, Ada, OH 45810-6000, USA. d-kisor@onu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)']",IM,"['Arabinonucleosides/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Fatigue/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic']",2005/05/05 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/05/05 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['aph.1E453 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1E453 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2005 Jun;39(6):1056-63. doi: 10.1345/aph.1E453.

This implies that they activate differentiation and apoptosis in a temporally defined order to allow expression of the differentiated phenotype well before death. We report that two apparently contradictory retinoid-induced programs have the capacity to define cellular life span. Anti-apoptotic factors are activated concomitantly with differentiation, while retinoids induce at the same time also pro-apoptotic signaling. We have assessed the roles of two key factors, Bcl2A1 and TRAIL, in the temporal programming of cell death and differentiation. We demonstrate that PLB985 are type II cells in which TRAIL induces apoptosis through the extrinsic and--via Bid activation--also the intrinsic death pathways. Bcl2A1, ectopically over-expressed, or endogenously induced by retinoic acid receptor agonists, protected cells from apoptosis triggered by TRAIL, whose induction required the activation of both the retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors. Bcl2A1 prevented loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-9, but not caspase-8, activation. The expression of anti-sense Bcl2A1 sensitized PLB985 cells to TRAIL. Co-culture experiments revealed protection from fraternicide if sister cells were pre-exposed to retinoic acid. Collectively, our data support a model in which retinoids orchestrate a life span-regulatory program comprising Bcl2A1 induction to temporally protect against concomitantly induced TRAIL death signaling. Termination of this life span in presence of Bcl2A1 is most likely a consequence of the Bid-independent TRAIL action. Thus, depending on the retinoic acid and retinoid X receptor activation potential of a ligand and the relative efficacies of the intrinsic and extrinsic death pathways in a given cell, a single retinoid triggers the life span of a differentiated phenotype.","['Yin, Weihong', 'Raffelsberger, Wolfgang', 'Gronemeyer, Hinrich']","['Yin W', 'Raffelsberger W', 'Gronemeyer H']","['Department of Cell Biology and Signal Transduction, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire/CNRS/INSERM/ULP, BP 10142, F-67404 Illkirch Cedex, C.

The pathogenesis of MAIDS induced cytopenias remains obscure; however, direct retroviral infection of bone marrow stroma has been implicated to play a role. To evaluate the consequential effect of viral infection, primary stromal cell cultures were transiently incubated in vitro with LP-BM5 MuLV viral supernatant. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blot hybridization revealed that defective LP-BM5 MuLV infection resulted in elevated levels of IL-4 and TGFbeta1 transcript expression in infected stromal cells. The increased expression of both IL-4 and TGFbeta1 transcripts was associated with enhanced production of corresponding proteins as determined by quantitative western blot analyses. Hematopoietic reconstitution assays revealed that the hematopoietic support function of stromal cells was significantly reduced following transient exposure to LP-BM5 MuLV. The production of nonadherent mononuclear cells and the growth of myeloid, megakaryocyte and erythroid lineages were all suppressed in infected cultures. Culture supernatant conditioned by infected stromal cells demonstrated growth-inhibitory activity for hematopoietic progenitor colony formation. This growth-inhibitory activity could be significantly abolished by addition of anti-IL-4 and/or anti-TGFbeta1 neutralizing antibodies to the culture supernatant or directly to the stromal cell cultures.

Multiple molecular events likely contribute to malignant transformation; no single genetic abnormality or event has been shown to be responsible for development of the disease. Significant advances have recently been made towards understanding the genetic and molecular basis for the etiology and clinical course of CLL. Our current understanding is only now bringing us to the point where we can use this information in management and in developing new therapies for patients with CLL. Familial clustering of CLL cases is not uncommon and implicates a genetic basis for the development of the disease in some individuals. Potential interventions in this instance could employ strategies of gene transfer or gene therapy to correct genetic defects or strategies of chemoprevention, none of which is currently under investigation. Greater potential for therapeutic intervention rests with targeting molecular aberrations and altered gene expression in leukemia cells, for example, over expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. CLL follows a variable clinical course, with some patients not needing treatment for many years and responding to therapy completely and repeatedly. Other patients have rapidly progressive disease that is refractory to currently available agents and they quickly succumb to their disease. One major recent advance has been the identification of molecular and genetic prognostic factors that can be used in early-stage patients to identify those likely to rapidly progress. This affords the opportunity to tailor management for patients based on the predictable aggressiveness of their disease. Molecular and genetic findings are increasingly influencing management decisions in CLL. Bone marrow transplantation may be considered for a patient with unfavorable prognostic features earlier than for a patient with favorable features and same clinical stage of disease. It is likely that these genetic and molecular-based factors will be targets of new treatment modalities that fundamentally change the management of this disease. In this review we detail the current understanding of the genetics and molecular biology of CLL and introduce potentials for therapeutic intervention.","['Carney, Dennis A', 'Wierda, William G']","['Carney DA', 'Wierda WG']","['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/therapy', 'MicroRNAs', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation']",2005/05/05 09:00,2006/08/22 09:00,['2005/05/05 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11864-005-0005-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2005 May;6(3):215-25. doi: 10.1007/s11864-005-0005-2.,,,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CNTF activates membrane receptors (CNTF-Rs) composed of one ligand-specific binding subunit, defined CNTFR alpha, and two signal transducing subunits, termed leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and gp130. However, it is not clear whether the effects of CNTF on GnRH release result from either a direct or an indirect action on GnRH-secreting hypothalamic neurones, or from a combination of these events. The hypothesis of a direct effect of CNTF was thus tested using the GT1-7 GnRH-secreting cell line. CNTF-R expression and CNTF-induced modulation of the Janus kinase (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway and of GnRH release were evaluated. GT1-7 cells were found to express CNTFR alpha, LIFR and gp130 genes, as shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, and the corresponding proteins, analysed by immunofluorescence and western blot. CNTFR alpha, LIFR and gp130 immunoreactive bands had an approximate size of 50, 190 and 130 kDa, respectively. Treatment of GT1-7 cells with 10(-12) M CNTF for 15-60 min resulted in a marked and transient increase of STAT3 phosphorylation via activation of JAK2. A 30-min exposure of GT1-7 cells to different CNTF concentrations increased the accumulation of GnRH into the culture medium, with a maximal effect at 10(-11) M. In conclusion, the present results provide new information about the regulation of the reproductive axis by CNTF, and suggest that it might operate at the hypothalamic level by directly influencing the activity of GnRH-secreting neurones, in addition to the possible indirect effects via interneurones proposed by previous studies.","['Dozio, E', 'Watanobe, H', 'Ruscica, M', 'Maggi, R', 'Motta, M', 'Magni, P']","['Dozio E', 'Watanobe H', 'Ruscica M', 'Maggi R', 'Motta M', 'Magni P']","['Department of Endocrinology, Centre of Excellence on Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neuroendocrinol,Journal of neuroendocrinology,8913461,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamus/cytology/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neurons/cytology/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2005/05/05 09:00,2005/07/27 09:00,['2005/05/05 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['JNE1309 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2826.2005.01309.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neuroendocrinol. 2005 May;17(5):286-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2826.2005.01309.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased c-Fes expression is associated with differentiation in normal myeloid cells and cell lines. Our hypothesis was that primary leukemia cells would show a similar pattern of increased expression in more differentiated cells. Therefore, we compared c-Fes expression in cells with an undifferentiated, blast phenotype (acute myelogenous leukemia--AML) to cells with a differentiated phenotype (chronic myelogenous leukemia--CML). Instead of differences in p93 expression levels, we found complex patterns of c-Fes immunoreactive proteins that corresponded with differentiation in normal and leukemic myeloid cells. The ""blast"" pattern consisted of c-Fes immunoreactive proteins p93, p74, and p70; the ""differentiated"" pattern showed two additional c-Fes immunoreactive proteins, p67 and p62. Using mRNA from mouse and human cell lines, we found deletion of one or more exons in the c-fes mRNA. Those deletions predicted truncation of conserved domains (CDC15/FCH and SH2) involved in protein-protein interactions. No deletions were found, however, within the kinase domain. We infer that alternative splicing generates a family of c-Fes proteins. This may be a mechanism to direct the c-Fes kinase domain to different subcellular locations and/or substrates at specific stages of myeloid cell differentiation.","['Carlson, Anne', 'Berkowitz, Jeanne McAdara', 'Browning, Damaris', 'Slamon, Dennis J', 'Gasson, Judith C', 'Yates, Karen E']","['Carlson A', 'Berkowitz JM', 'Browning D', 'Slamon DJ', 'Gasson JC', 'Yates KE']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine and Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neutrophils/enzymology/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2005/05/05 09:00,2005/05/28 09:00,['2005/05/05 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.2005.24.311 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2005 May;24(5):311-6. doi: 10.1089/dna.2005.24.311.,,,,['P01 CA32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They insure several functions including capping the end of the chromosomes, ensuring their stability and protecting them from end-to-end fusion and preventing the activation of the DNA damage checkpoints. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A flow-FISH methodology, i.e. quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) in combination with flow cytometry, has been developed in our laboratory in order to estimate telomere length in three human cancer cell lines: K-562 (chronic myelogenous leukaemia), IM-9 (multiple myeloma) and 1301 (T cell lymphoblastic leukaemia). Telomeres were visualised after hybridisation with FITC-labelled PNA (Peptide Nucleic Acid) probes. We evaluated the most critical steps of the flow-FISH protocol to ensure reproducibility. Different methodological set ups were compared. Three fixation procedures (ethanol 80%, methanol 80% and formaldehyde 4%) were tested besides different fixation times (15 min and 60 min) as well as hybridization times (2 h and overnight). For each of these protocols the following parameters were compared: forward scatter (related to the cell size), side scatter (related to the cell granularity), DNA (FL3 and FL4 fluorescence) and PNA content (FL1 fluorescence) using an EPICS XL flow cytometer. RESULTS: Regarding the fixation procedures, methanol proved to be the best, followed by ethanol and formaldehyde, with respect to the efficiency to measure the different parameters cited above. Indeed, fixation using methanol gave the optimal PNA signal compared to using ethanol and formaldehyde in two of the studied cell lines (K-562 and 1301); the difference observed was highly significant in the 1301 cell line. The duration of fixation did not show significant interference in the reproducibility of the results for the three cell lines studied. An overnight hybridization appeared to be more effective when compared to the 2-h hybridization in the case of the K-562 cell line. CONCLUSION: The most important steps of the flow-FISH technique, namely the fixative procedure, as well as the hybridization and the fixation times, were investigated. Considering the latter, suitable protocols were set up for routine and fast telomere length estimation in the cancer cell lines.","['Derradji, Hanane', 'Bekaert, Sofie', 'Van Oostveldt, Patrick', 'Baatout, Sarah']","['Derradji H', 'Bekaert S', 'Van Oostveldt P', 'Baatout S']","['Laboratory of Radiobiology, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre, SCK CEN, Mol, Belgium. hderradj@sckcen.be']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,['0 (Fixatives)'],IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fixatives', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure']",2005/05/05 09:00,2005/06/10 09:00,['2005/05/05 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 Mar-Apr;25(2A):1039-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, K562/D1-9 showed collateral sensitivity. Only HL60/AD showed small cross resistance, but 697/Bcl-2 had no resistance to As2O3. An intracellular content of glutathione (GSH) played a critical role in sensitivity to As2O3. Buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO), which reduces the GSH content, not only increased the As2O3 sensitivity but also conquered the MRP1-related cross resistance in HL60/AD.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a novel type of allergy vaccine for complex allergen sources that combines defined amounts of the major allergens in the form of single hybrid molecules. METHODS: A hybrid molecule was engineered by PCR-based mending and expression of the cDNAs coding for the 4 major grass pollen allergens and compared with its single components by circular dichroism analysis, T-cell proliferation, ELISA competition, and histamine release assays. Immune responses to the hybrid molecule were studied in BALB/c mice and rat basophil leukemia assays. RESULTS: The hybrid contained most of the B-cell epitopes of grass pollen and could be used to diagnose allergy in 98% (n = 652) of patients allergic to grass pollen. Immunization of mice and rabbits with the hybrid induced stronger and earlier IgG antibody responses than equimolar mixtures of the components, which can be explained by the induction of stronger T-cell responses by the hybrid versus the individual components. IgG antibodies induced by vaccination with the hybrid blocked immediate allergic reactions, as demonstrated by rat basophil degranulation assays in a murine model of grass pollen allergy. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate for grass pollen allergy that recombinant hybrid molecules covering the spectrum of the disease-eliciting epitopes of complex allergen sources can be engineered.","['Linhart, Birgit', 'Hartl, Arnulf', 'Jahn-Schmid, Beatrice', 'Verdino, Petra', 'Keller, Walter', 'Krauth, Maria-Theresa', 'Valent, Peter', 'Horak, Friedrich', 'Wiedermann, Ursula', 'Thalhamer, Josef', 'Ebner, Christof', 'Kraft, Dietrich', 'Valenta, Rudolf']","['Linhart B', 'Hartl A', 'Jahn-Schmid B', 'Verdino P', 'Keller W', 'Krauth MT', 'Valent P', 'Horak F', 'Wiedermann U', 'Thalhamer J', 'Ebner C', 'Kraft D', 'Valenta R']","['Cenetr of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Department of Pathophysiology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)']",IM,"['Allergens/immunology', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/blood/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/prevention & control', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Poaceae/immunology', 'Pollen/immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Vaccines, DNA/administration & dosage/*immunology']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S009167490500223X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaci.2004.12.1142 [doi]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2005 May;115(5):1010-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2004.12.1142.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Expression analysis and gain- or loss- of function studies have shown that Hox play an important role in the regulation of early stages of hematopoiesis, including the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)/early progenitors. In the area of leukemia, numerous models of murine leukemia have demonstrated a role for Hox in the pathobiology of the disease. Moreover, the identification of multiple Hox genes as partners of chromosomal translocations and the observed global deregulation of Hox genes and cofactors demonstrated by gene profiling of cells from leukemic patients, have unequivocally shown a major function for Hox genes and cofactors in a wide spectrum of human leukemia. SUMMARY: The identification of Hox genes as HSC regulators has been exploited to develop strategies to efficiently expand HSCs ex vivo, a key step to the success of therapies based on HSC transplantation and the understanding of mechanisms underlying HSC regulation. As leukemia is the result of deregulation of normal HSC development, the elucidation of the role of Hox in the pathobiology of the disease is helping to understand how HSCs self-renew and differentiate, and moreover, should facilitate the development of strategies for the management of leukemia.","['Abramovich, Carolina', 'Humphries, R Keith']","['Abramovich C', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Signal Transduction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['00062752-200505000-00003 [pii]', '10.1097/01.moh.0000160737.52349.aa [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2005 May;12(3):210-6. doi: 10.1097/01.moh.0000160737.52349.aa.,,,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amazing potency of HSCs has been exploited for over 30 years in regenerative therapies for patients with blood-related genetic disease and leukemia. As clinically important cells and also as the most widely studied cell differentiation system, they have been the focus of intense fundamental research. Indeed, HSC research has established many paradigms in the more general field of stem cells. Recently, the study of the embryonic origins of HSCs and their genetic program is beginning to provide unique insights into how these stem cells are formed, maintained, and expanded, and how they contribute to the complex adult hematopoietic system. Although many short-lived hematopoietic progenitors are present in early stage mammalian embryos, this review will focus on the events leading to emergence of the most potent cells of the hematopoietic system, HSCs and on their developmental lineage relationships. RECENT FINDINGS: Developmental and genetic studies further our understanding of the fate determination events occurring in several embryonic tissues leading to the generation of potent HSCs--those cells with the ability to long-term, high-level repopulate all hematopoietic lineages of the adult. SUMMARY: Several mammalian embryonic tissues contribute to the growth and/or generation of potent HSCs that are the source of blood cells throughout the lifespan of the individual. Insight into how mammalian HSC fate is determined has been provided through functional, phenotypic, and genetic studies at early developmental stages.","['Dzierzak, Elaine']",['Dzierzak E'],"['Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. e.dzierzak@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Mammals']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['00062752-200505000-00001 [pii]', '10.1097/01.moh.0000160736.44726.0e [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2005 May;12(3):197-202. doi: 10.1097/01.moh.0000160736.44726.0e.,,,47,['R01 DK51077/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These new inhibitors are not tripeptide glutathione-peptidomimetic molecules and display lipophylic properties suitable for crossing the plasma membrane. In the present work, we show the strong cytotoxic activity of these compounds in the following four different cell lines: K562 (human myeloid leukemia), HepG2 (human hepatic carcinoma), CCRF-CEM (human T-lymphoblastic leukemia), and GLC-4 (human small cell lung carcinoma). The LC50 values are in the micromolar/submicromolar range and are close to the IC50 values obtained with GSTP1-1, suggesting that the target of these molecules inside the cell is indeed this enzyme. The cytotoxic mechanism of 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol, the most effective GSTP1-1 inhibitor, has been carefully investigated in leukemic CCRF-CEM and K562 cell lines. Western blot and immunoprecipitation analyzes have shown that 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol promotes in both cell lines the dissociation of the GSTP1-1 in a complex with c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). This process triggers a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-independent activation of the JNK-mediated pathway that results in a typical process of apoptosis. Besides this main pathway, in K562 cells, a ROS-mediated apoptosis partially occurs (about 30%) which involves the p38MAPK signal transduction pathway. The low concentration of this new compound needed to trigger cytotoxic effects on tumor cells and the low toxicity on mice indicate that the new 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole derivatives are promising anticancer agents.","['Turella, Paola', 'Cerella, Claudia', 'Filomeni, Giuseppe', 'Bullo, Angela', 'De Maria, Francesca', 'Ghibelli, Lina', 'Ciriolo, Maria Rosa', 'Cianfriglia, Maurizio', 'Mattei, Maurizio', 'Federici, Giorgio', 'Ricci, Giorgio', 'Caccuri, Anna Maria']","['Turella P', 'Cerella C', 'Filomeni G', 'Bullo A', 'De Maria F', 'Ghibelli L', 'Ciriolo MR', 'Cianfriglia M', 'Mattei M', 'Federici G', 'Ricci G', 'Caccuri AM']","['Department of Chemical Sciences and Technologies, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Oxadiazoles)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Gstp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Oxadiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/06/16 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/9/3751 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3903 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 May 1;65(9):3751-61. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3903.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A strikingly similar instability is shown after exposure to the benzene metabolite hydroquinone. The CBA/Ca but not the C57BL/6 genotype is susceptible to the induction of instability by both ionizing radiation and hydroquinone and exposure of CBA/Ca, but not C57BL/6, mice to either agent is known to be associated with the development of AML. The results are consistent with the proposal that chromosomal instability induced by either agent may contribute to AML development by increasing the number of genetic lesions in hemopoietic cells. Genotype-dependent chromosomal instability can be induced by hydroquinone doses that are not acutely stem cell toxic and this may have important implications for current assessment of safe levels of exposure to benzene as well as for mechanistic understanding of the hemotoxic and leukemogenic effects.","['Gowans, I Duncan', 'Lorimore, Sally A', 'McIlrath, Joanne M', 'Wright, Eric G']","['Gowans ID', 'Lorimore SA', 'McIlrath JM', 'Wright EG']","['Division of Pathology and Neuroscience, University of Dundee Medical School, Dundee, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Chromosomal Instability', '*Cocarcinogenesis', 'Gamma Rays/*adverse effects', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/*etiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/06/16 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/9/3527 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4242 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 May 1;65(9):3527-30. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4242.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of NAD+ synthesis by a novel agent FK866 has been recently reported to induce apoptosis in human leukemia, hepatocarcinoma cells in vitro, and various types of tumor xenografts in vivo. In the present study, we used 1H-decoupled phosphorus (31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine the metabolic changes associated with FK866 induced tumor cell death in a mouse mammary carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Induction of apoptosis in FK866-treated tumors was confirmed by histology and cytofluorometric analysis. FK866-induced changes in mammary carcinoma tumor metabolism in vivo were investigated using 1H-decoupled 31P MRS. To discern further the changes in metabolic profiles of tumors observed in vivo, high-resolution in vitro 1H-decoupled 31P MRS studies were carried out with perchloric acid extracts of mammary carcinoma tumors excised after similar treatments. In addition, the effects of FK866 on mammary carcinoma tumor growth and radiation sensitivity were studied. RESULTS: Treatment with FK866 induced a tumor growth delay and enhanced radiation sensitivity in mammary carcinoma tumors that was associated with significant increases in the 31P MR signal in the phosphomonoester region and a decrease in NAD+ levels, pH, and bioenergetic status. The 31P MRS of perchloric acid extracts of treated tumors identified the large unresolved signal in the phosphomonoester region as the resultant of resonances originating from intermediates of tumor glycolysis and guanylate synthesis in addition to alterations in pyridine nucleotide pools and phospholipid metabolism. CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that FK866 interferes with multiple biochemical pathways that contribute to the increased cell death (apoptosis) and subsequent radiation sensitivity observed in the mammary carcinoma that could be serially monitored by 31P MRS.","['Muruganandham, Manickam', 'Alfieri, Alan A', 'Matei, Cornelia', 'Chen, Yuchun', 'Sukenick, George', 'Schemainda, Isabel', 'Hasmann, Max', 'Saltz, Leonard B', 'Koutcher, Jason A']","['Muruganandham M', 'Alfieri AA', 'Matei C', 'Chen Y', 'Sukenick G', 'Schemainda I', 'Hasmann M', 'Saltz LB', 'Koutcher JA']","['Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (N-(4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acrylamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Guanine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration/drug effects', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/*methods', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'NAD/metabolism', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase', 'Pentosyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Time Factors']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/9/3503 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1399 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 May 1;11(9):3503-13. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1399.,,,,"['1R24CA83084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA05826-038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, we investigated the cellular mechanisms of high sensitivity to the agent in neuroblastoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined 11 neuroblastoma cell lines for sensitivity to gemcitabine and other chemotherapeutic agents used clinically for neuroblastoma. The in vivo sensitivity of neuroblastoma to gemcitabine was determined in xenograft models. Furthermore, the major metabolic enzymes of gemcitabine were assessed and compared in leukemia and carcinoma cells. Apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potentials were also evaluated. RESULTS: The IC50s for gemcitabine in 11 neuroblastoma lines ranged between 3 nmol/L and 4 micromol/L. The high activity of gemcitabine against neuroblastoma was confirmed in animal models. Interestingly, enzymes in neuroblastoma cells involved in the metabolism of deoxycytidine analogue have unique characteristics among solid tumors. The median of deoxycytidine kinase activity in neuroblastoma lines was similar to that in leukemia lines, which have low IC50s for cytarabine. Cytidine deaminase (CDA) activity in neuroblastoma was hardly detectable and significantly lower than that in carcinoma. The defect of CDA activity was associated with negative expression of mRNA. Furthermore, gemcitabine-induced apoptosis was observed irrespective of the caspase-8 status of neuroblastoma cells, which indicates that apoptosis depends on the mitochondrial pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroblastoma is highly sensitive to gemcitabine. Although the cellular mechanism involved in sensitivity to gemcitabine is multifactorial, low CDA activity may contribute high sensitivity in neuroblastoma cells. These results suggest that clinical application of gemcitabine to the treatment of neuroblastoma is warranted.","['Ogawa, Masahiro', 'Hori, Hiroki', 'Ohta, Takuya', 'Onozato, Kaori', 'Miyahara, Masazumi', 'Komada, Yoshihiro']","['Ogawa M', 'Hori H', 'Ohta T', 'Onozato K', 'Miyahara M', 'Komada Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/9/3485 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1781 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 May 1;11(9):3485-93. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1781.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed the results of quantitative PCR in 280 patients with CML in chronic phase who achieved complete cytogenetic remission with imatinib (117 after IFN-alpha failure and 163 previously untreated). Median follow-up was 31 months (range, 3-52 months). RESULTS: Median BCR-ABL/ABL ratio before the start of therapy was 39.44 (range, 0.252-170.53). A major molecular response (BCR-ABL/ABL ratio <0.05%) was achieved in 174 (62%), and transcripts became undetectable (complete molecular response) in 95 (34%). By multivariate analysis, only treatment with high-dose imatinib (P = 0.02) was associated with achievement of a major molecular response. Nine of 166 (5%) patients who achieved a major molecular response lost their cytogenetic remission, compared with 25 of 68 (37%) among those who did not achieve this response (P < 0.0001). Patients achieving a major molecular response 12 months after the start of therapy had significantly better complete cytogenetic remission duration than others. A >1-log reduction in transcript levels after 3 months of therapy predicted for an improved probability of achieving a major molecular response at 24 months. Increasing levels of BCR-ABL transcripts predicted for a loss of cytogenetic remission only among patients who did not achieve a major molecular response. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving a major molecular response, particularly within the first year of therapy, is predictive of a durable cytogenetic remission and may be the future goal of therapy in CML.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'Talpaz, Moshe', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Jones, Dan', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Shan, Jenny', 'Giles, Francis', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Rios, Mary B', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Cortes J', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Jones D', 'Luthra R', 'Shan J', 'Giles F', 'Faderl S', 'Verstovsek S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Rios MB', 'Kantarjian H']","['Departments of Leukemia, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. jcortes@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations/drug effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/9/3425 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2139 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 May 1;11(9):3425-32. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2139.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mutations of the RAS genes cause an intrinsic activation of this pathway. Until now, clinical studies could not find clear association of RAS mutations with the clinical outcome after AML therapy. This could be due to alternative initiating events for activation of the RAS pathway like constitutive tyrosine kinase activation or mutations in Ras-regulating genes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In total, 191 AML patients (126 as training population and 65 as test population) were studied for Ras activity with a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay using Raf binding of activated Ras. RESULTS: AML samples showed a wide range of Ras activity values, which was in contrast to normal bone marrow donors who showed no or very limited Ras activity. Using a Ras binding score based on semiquantitative Western blotting, we defined patients with strong Ras activity and compared Ras activity with RAS mutation. Surprisingly, only a minority of RAS mutated AML samples (22.2%) showed strong Ras activity, whereas 25 patients presented strong Ras activity in the absence of RAS mutations. Clinical outcome did not show differences according to RAS mutations. In contrast, Ras activity predicted for a high response rate (P <0.05) and proved to be an independent factor for overall survival rate (P <0.05) in younger AML patients receiving high-dose 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine as induction therapy. CONCLUSION: The data highlight the role for alternative pathways of Ras activation without RAS mutations. Intrinsically activated Ras seems to increase sensitivity of the AML blast to high-dose 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine therapy.","['Illmer, Thomas', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Fredersdorf, Anke', 'Stadler, Sylvia', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Schaich, Markus']","['Illmer T', 'Thiede C', 'Fredersdorf A', 'Stadler S', 'Neubauer A', 'Ehninger G', 'Schaich M']","['Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, University Hospital of the Technical University, Dresden, Germany. ilmer@mk1.med.tu-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'ras Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/9/3217 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2232 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 May 1;11(9):3217-24. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2232.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the lack of expression of A-type lamins in lymphoma and leukemia has been reported, the mechanism was unknown. We investigated the possible role of CpG island hypermethylation in lamin A/C silencing and its prognostic relevance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The promoter CpG island methylation status of the lamin A/C gene, encoding the A-type lamins, was analyzed by bisulfite genomic sequencing and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in human cancer cell lines (n = 74; from 17 tumor types), and primary leukemias (n = 60) and lymphomas (n = 80). Lamin A/C expression was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: seven (50%) of 14 leukemia- and five (42%) of 13 lymphoma cell lines. The presence of hypermethylation was associated with the loss of gene expression while a demethylating agent restored expression. In primary malignancies, lamin A/C hypermethylation was present in 18% (nine of 50) of acute lymphoblastic leukemias and 34% (14 of 41) of nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. The presence of lamin A/C hypermethylation in nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas correlated strongly with a decrease in failure-free survival (Kaplan-Meier, P = .0001) and overall survival (Kaplan-Meier, P = .0005). CONCLUSION: Epigenetic silencing of the lamin A/C gene by CpG island promoter hypermethylation is responsible for the loss of expression of A-type lamins in leukemias and lymphomas. The finding that lamin A/C hypermethylation is associated with poor outcome in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas suggests important clinical implications.","['Agrelo, Ruben', 'Setien, Fernando', 'Espada, Jesus', 'Artiga, Maria Jesus', 'Rodriguez, Maria', 'Perez-Rosado, Alberto', 'Sanchez-Aguilera, Abel', 'Fraga, Mario F', 'Piris, Miguel Angel', 'Esteller, Manel']","['Agrelo R', 'Setien F', 'Espada J', 'Artiga MJ', 'Rodriguez M', 'Perez-Rosado A', 'Sanchez-Aguilera A', 'Fraga MF', 'Piris MA', 'Esteller M']","['Cancer Epigenetics and Lymphoma Laboratories, Molecular Pathology Program, Spanish National Cancer Centre, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Lamin Type A)', '0 (lamin C)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Lamin Type A/*genetics', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/07/08 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.11.650 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.11.650 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun 10;23(17):3940-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.11.650.

The aim was to elucidate biologic mechanisms through which these genetic markers may exert their pathogenic influence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, B-cell activation, and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in 82 CLL cases constituting prototypic genetic CLL subgroups as defined by the VH mutation status and the genomic aberrations 13q-, +12, 11q-, and 17p-. RESULTS: The VH mutation subgroups were characterized by a differential expression of the BCR associated genes ZAP70 and PI3K. Among the subgroups defined by genomic aberrations, there was a deregulation of candidate genes from the affected critical genomic regions such as CDK4 (up), ATM (down), and TP53 (down) in the groups +12, 11q-, and 17p-, respectively. Additionally, the genomic subgroups were characterized by a significant deregulation of cell cycle and apoptosis regulators: AKT (up) in 13q, E2F1 (up) in +12, MYC (up) and BCL-2 (down) in 17p-, and CCND3 (down) in 11q- as well as 17p-. The 17p- subgroup showed an additional down-regulation of BCR-associated genes such as SYK and PI3K. CONCLUSION: The characteristic gene expression patterns observed implicate a differential regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and BCR signaling in the genetic subgroups illustrating distinct pathomechanisms and are evidence for a gene dosage effect being operative in CLL. These findings link the biologic diversity and clinical heterogeneity of CLL.","['Kienle, Dirk L', 'Korz, Christian', 'Hosch, Beate', 'Benner, Axel', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Habermann, Annett', 'Krober, Alexander', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Kienle DL', 'Korz C', 'Hosch B', 'Benner A', 'Mertens D', 'Habermann A', 'Krober A', 'Jager U', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Robert-Koch-Strasse 8, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.02.568 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.02.568 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun 1;23(16):3780-92. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.568.

To shed further light on the frequency, distribution, and prognostic significance of ABL mutations, we retrospectively analyzed a homogeneous cohort of late chronic phase CML patients who showed primary cytogenetic resistance to imatinib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC) and sequencing, we screened for ABL mutations in a total of 178 bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples from 40 late chronic phase CML patients homogeneously treated with imatinib 400 mg/d, who did not reach a major cytogenetic response at 12 months. RESULTS: Mutations were found in 19 of 40 patients (48%). Mutations were already detectable by D-HPLC at a median of 3 months from the onset of therapy. The presence of a missense mutation was significantly associated with a greater likelihood of subsequent progression to accelerated phase/blast crisis (P = .0002) and shorter survival (P = .001). Patients carrying mutations falling within the P-loop seemed to have a particularly poor outcome in terms of time to progression (P = .032) and survival (P = .045).

From June 1998 to October 2002, 156 consecutive children, 105 boys and 51 girls, median age 10 years (range, 2-18), with different diagnoses underwent SCT (100 autologous and 56 allogeneic). OS and TRM were analyzed in 2 different periods (June 1989-December 1998 and January 1999-October 2002) and grouped according to the different SCT modalities. The median follow-up was 18 months (range, 1-160). Autologous TRM showed a statistically significant improvement within 1999-2002 (0%) compared with 1989-1998 (12.2%) (P < .05). There were no statistical differences for allogeneic SCT. OS was 34% in the first period and 80.4% in the second period (P < .01), the improvement being for both autologous and allogeneic SCT.

Footwear-workers are routinely exposed to complex mixtures of solvents in degreasers, cleaners, primers, and adhesives used in the production process as toluene, n-hexane, acetone, and possibly dust particles, additives in shoe materials and degradation products of materials. The recognition of the potential health-hazards of solvent-based adhesives (SBAs) has lead to the development of adhesives with no organic solvents, the water-based adhesives (WBA). We investigated footwear-workers (all males) exposed to SBA (n=29) (for 3.98+/-4.13 years), and WBA (n=16), which had spent the six months previous to the study employed in an experimental section which used only water-based adhesives, although they had previously worked in sections which used solvent-based adhesives (for 5.80+/-4.03 years); 25 healthy subjects were used as controls. The Comet assay and the micronucleus test were used as endpoints, while the traditional parameters for assessing exposure to toluene in organic mixtures by measuring the concentration of urinary hippuric acid were also assessed. Our results showed a significantly lower mean concentration of hippuric acid in the control group than found in the SBA (P<0.001) and WBA (P<0.05) groups. The Comet assay results showed that there was a significant increase in the mean damage index for the SBA (P<0.001) group in comparison to the WBA group and control (P<0.05). For the micronucleus test in binucleated lymphocytes and exfoliated buccal cell, the three groups were not statistically different. Our study demonstrated that water-based adhesives are clearly a better option for safeguarding the health of footwear-workers, even with possibility of isocyanate presence, while the positive results observed in SBA group might be explained by chloroprene presence in the adhesive.","['Heuser, Vanina Dahlstrom', 'de Andrade, Vanessa Moraes', 'da Silva, Juliana', 'Erdtmann, Bernardo']","['Heuser VD', 'de Andrade VM', 'da Silva J', 'Erdtmann B']","['Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Genetica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre-RS, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Adhesives)', '0 (Solvents)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '3FPU23BG52 (Toluene)']",IM,"['Adhesives/*poisoning', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brazil', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Comet Assay', '*DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Male', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Shoes', 'Solubility', 'Solvents/*poisoning', 'Toluene/poisoning', 'Water']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2004/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5718(05)00081-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2005.03.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2005 May 2;583(1):85-94. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2005.03.002.

Transgenic human hematopoietic cells expressing HES-1 or HLF demonstrated enhanced in vivo reconstitution ability that correlated to increased cycling frequency and inhibition of apoptosis, respectively.

METHODS: Undifferentiated ES cells were maintained on mitomycin C-inactivated fibroblasts in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). By a 5-day hanging drop culture devoid of them, ES cells were induced to form multidifferentiated structures called embryoid bodies (EBs). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry were used to analyze gene expression of gonadotrope markers in EBs at different time points during the culture. RESULTS: Homeo box gene expressed in ES cells (Hesx1), LIM homeobox protein 3 (Lhx3), paired like homeodomain factor 1 (Prop1), GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2), follicle-stimulating hormone beta (FSHbeta), and luteinizing hormone beta (LHbeta) mRNAs were detected at day 6 EBs and maintained throughout the culture to day 56. FSHbeta and LHbeta proteins were expressed in EBs from day 6 onward. Immunofluorescent labeling of FSHbeta and LHbeta showed that specific staining was restricted to the cytoplasm of some differentiated EB cells. With the prolongation of EB culture, the number of positive cells increased significantly. Both monohormonal and bihormonal cells were present, mainly in clusters within EBs and sparsely distributed among the outermost cells surrounding the EBs. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that mouse ES cells can give rise to mature gonadotrope-like cells in EBs. It also shows that EBs may serve as a novel model system to study the development and function of gonadotropes.","['Zhao, Xu', 'Teng, Ruifeng', 'Asanuma, Kazuhiko', 'Okouchi, Yasumitsu', 'Johkura, Kohei', 'Ogiwara, Naoko', 'Sasaki, Katsunori']","['Zhao X', 'Teng R', 'Asanuma K', 'Okouchi Y', 'Johkura K', 'Ogiwara N', 'Sasaki K']","['Department of Anatomy and Organ Technology, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan. zhaoxu@sch.md.shinshu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Soc Gynecol Investig,Journal of the Society for Gynecologic Investigation,9433806,"['0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone, beta Subunit)', '0 (Luteinizing Hormone, beta Subunit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Culture Techniques', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone, beta Subunit/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Luteinizing Hormone, beta Subunit/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Mice', 'Pituitary Gland/*cytology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/*physiology']",2005/05/04 09:00,2006/03/01 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1071-5576(05)00036-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jsgi.2005.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,J Soc Gynecol Investig. 2005 May;12(4):257-62. doi: 10.1016/j.jsgi.2005.01.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The A8-env gene is a primary determinant of neuropathogenicity, and the 1.5-kb ClaI-HindIII fragment containing the LTR and 5' leader from A8 are additionally required for spongiosis. After replacement of the A8 enhancer region of the neuropathogenic chimera with the enhancer region of non-neuropathogenic 57, viral titer in the brain was reduced by two orders of magnitude. However, the A8 enhancer region was not responsible for the induction of spongiosis. The region responsible for neuropathogenesis was located in the 0.3-kb KpnI-AatII fragment of A8 containing the R-U5-5' leader. The chimeric virus possessing this 0.3-kb fragment of A8 and the A8-env in the 57 background induced a high rate of spongiform neurodegeneration within 7 weeks (9/9 of infected rats).

The most promising activity to date has been demonstrated in patients with hematological malignancies, in particular acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In patients with MDS, two non-peptidomimetic agents, tipifarnib (Zarnestra, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) and lonafarnib (Sarasar, Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) have been the most extensively studied. In both phase I and phase II trials, tipifarnib has demonstrated significant efficacy with overall response rates of 30%, with complete remissions in about 15%. Dose-limiting side effects have been primarily myelosuppression, although fatigue, neurotoxicity, and occasional renal dysfunction have required dose reductions. Lonafarnib in patients with MDS has also resulted in clinical responses in approximately 30%, including significant improvements in platelet counts. Lonafarnib has been associated with primarily diarrhea and other gastrointestinal toxicity, anorexia, and nausea, which has limited its efficacy. Clinical response correlation with documentation of inhibition of farnesyltransferase and/or evidence of decreased farnesylation of downstream protein targets has not been demonstrated with either agent. In addition, the presence of an activating Ras mutation has not predicted response to therapy with FTIs in MDS and AML. Despite this, significant clinical efficacy of the FTIs in MDS, on par with that of currently available chemotherapeutic agents, has been observed, leading to further development of this new class of drugs in MDS and AML.","['Feldman, E J']",['Feldman EJ'],"['Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 525 East 68th Street, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Rep,Current hematology reports,101151358,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Quinolones)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'IOW153004F (lonafarnib)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Genes, ras', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Piperidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Prenylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/chemistry/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Quinolones/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/08/27 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Curr Hematol Rep. 2005 May;4(3):186-90.,,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: 6-month observational, prospective, multicentre study. PARTICIPANTS: 694 patients recruited from outpatient oncology clinics in 24 hospitals in five Australian states between 9 April 2001 and 31 July 2001. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] level < 120 g/L) at enrolment and over ensuing 6 months, by tumour type, disease status and cancer treatment; anaemia treatment and ""trigger"" Hb level for this treatment. RESULTS: Participants had median age 60 years, and 61% were women. Prevalence of anaemia at enrolment was 35% (199/562), with 78% of these 199 having mild anaemia (Hb, 100-119 g/L). Frequency of anaemia (either present at enrolment or developing during the study) was 57% overall (323/566), and varied with tumour type, from 49% (lymphoma/myeloma) to 85% (urogenital cancer). Patients who received radiotherapy either in combination or concomitant with chemotherapy were more likely to have anaemia (73%) than those receiving chemotherapy alone (58%) (P = 0.004). Of all chemotherapy patients not anaemic at enrolment, 23% developed anaemia by the second monthly follow-up. Independent predictors for anaemia in chemotherapy patients were low baseline Hb level (odds ratio [OR], 5.4; 95% CI, 2.7-10.9) and use of platinum chemotherapeutic agents (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.1-11.4) (P < 0.001). Anaemia was treated in 41% of patients with anaemia at enrolment--by transfusion (36%), iron (5%) and erythropoietic agents (2%). Frequency of anaemia treatment varied between tumour types, from 19% (breast cancer) to 60% (leukaemia). The mean ""trigger Hb"" for initiating transfusion was 95 g/L. CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia is prevalent among Australian patients with cancer managed in hospital oncology units. Its management varies between tumour types. Many patients do not receive treatment for their anaemia.","['Seshadri, Tara', 'Prince, H Miles', 'Bell, David R', 'Coughlin, Paul B', 'James, Philip P B', 'Richardson, Gary E', 'Chern, Boris', 'Briggs, Peter', 'Norman, John', 'Olver, Ian N', 'Karapetis, Chris', 'Stewart, John']","['Seshadri T', 'Prince HM', 'Bell DR', 'Coughlin PB', 'James PP', 'Richardson GE', 'Chern B', 'Briggs P', 'Norman J', 'Olver IN', 'Karapetis C', 'Stewart J']","['Peter MacCallum Centre, Melbourne, VIC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Med J Aust,The Medical journal of Australia,0400714,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/*epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2005/05/04 09:00,2005/07/16 09:00,['2005/05/04 09:00'],"['2004/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['ses10667_fm [pii]', '10.5694/j.1326-5377.2005.tb06784.x [doi]']",ppublish,Med J Aust. 2005 May 2;182(9):453-7. doi: 10.5694/j.1326-5377.2005.tb06784.x.,,,,,,,,,,,['Australian Cancer Anaemia Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro anti-tumor screening reveals that the results go hand in hand with the in vitro free radical scavenging effects. The antioxidant effect of these compounds depends mainly on the stabilization of the formed phenoxy free radical for which the p-hydroxy phenyl moiety is essential. o-substitution by electron-donating groups like the o-methoxy group (and to a even higher degree by the ethoxy group) increases the stability of phenoxy free radical, hence increasing both free scavenging and anti-tumor effects. Increasing the alkyl group chain on the N in the series of substituted N-alkyl piperidones as well as the extension of conjugation, increases the stabilization of phenoxy free radical and thereby the activity towards both free radical scavenging and anti-tumor effects. This may be attributed to an increased positive inductive effect and/or increased lipophilicity of the new compounds, a fact which is proven by the superior activities of compounds 17 and 18.","['Youssef, Khairia M', 'El-Sherbeny, Magda A']","['Youssef KM', 'El-Sherbeny MA']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

It has many advantages, including safety, simplicity, and few complications during the insertion process. It is suitable for patients who need long-term parenteral administration of medication or chemotherapy. However, the duration of PICC implantation is around six months, or even up to one year. As a result, it is very important to educate patients to take care of themselves throughout the implantation period in order to prevent complications. This report describes the experience of nursing a forty-four-year old male patient who suffered from acute lymphocytic leukemia and received a PICC implantation while undergoing chemotherapy treatment. As a PICC case manager, the author utilized self-efficacy theory and devoted herself to nursing care, interviews and phone calls to collect valuable information. During the process of PICC implantation, the author analyzed the characteristics of this case and assisted the patient and his primary care giver in choosing a suitable catheter and self-care techniques to achieve minimal complications during implantation. It is hoped that, by sharing in her experience, nursing staff may enhance their ability to assist patients with PICC and to help them to maintain their quality of life.","['Lee, Hsuan', 'Lee, Hsiu-Hua', 'Chen, Ching-Huey']","['Lee H', 'Lee HH', 'Chen CH']","['Department of Nursing, National Cheng Kung University Hospital.']",['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China (Republic : 1949- ),Hu Li Za Zhi,Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,0073267,,IM,"['Adult', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*nursing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*nursing']",2005/05/03 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/05/03 09:00'],"['2005/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hu Li Za Zhi. 2005 Apr;52(2):78-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the anti-tumor mechanism of denbinobin remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the anticancer activity of denbinobin in human myelogenous K562 leukemia cells. In accordance with the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, we demonstrated that denbinobin inhibited cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 1.84 microM. Cell cycle analysis illustrated that exposure of denbinobin caused a G2/M phase accumulation in a time-dependent manner. Tubulin polymerization in cells was apparently enhanced by denbinobin, implying that denbinobin might have a regulatory role in tubulin/microtubule. Furthermore, denbinobin significantly suppressed the expression of Bcr-Abl and phosphorylation of CrkL, a crucial tyrosine kinase and an adaptor protein in chronic myeloid leukemia, respectively. Denbinobin also markedly enhanced CD11b expression after a long-term treatment, suggesting that denbinobin might play a role in facilitating differentiation in K562 cells. In summary, we have demonstrated that denbinobin displays anticancer effects in K562 cells through the increase of levels of tubulin polymerization and deregulation of Bcr-Abl signaling. Our data demonstrate that denbinobin could be a potential anticancer lead compound for further development.","['Huang, Yu-Chun', 'Guh, Jih-Hwa', 'Teng, Che-Ming']","['Huang YC', 'Guh JH', 'Teng CM']","['Pharmacological Institute, No. 1, Jen-Ai Road, Sect. 1, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (denbinobin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Anthraquinones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phenanthrenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Polymers', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tubulin/*metabolism']",2005/05/03 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/05/03 09:00'],"['2004/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11373-004-8171-y [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Sci. 2005;12(1):113-21. doi: 10.1007/s11373-004-8171-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the effects of codonoposide 1c on the induction of apoptosis, and its putative action pathway in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Codonoposide 1c-treated HL-60 cells displayed several features of apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation, formation of DNA ladders by agarose gel electrophoresis, and externalization of annexin-V targeted phosphatidylserine (PS) residues. We observed that codonoposide 1c caused activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3. A broad caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk), caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk), and caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) almost completely suppressed codonoposide 1c-induced DNA fragmentation. We further found that codonoposide 1c induces mitochondrial translocation of Bid from cytosol, reduction of cytosolic Bax, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Interestingly, codonoposide 1c also triggered the mitochondrial release of Smac/DIABLO (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct inhibitor of apoptosis-binding protein with a low isoelectric point) into cytosol, and a reduction in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Taken together, our data indicate that codonoposide 1c is a potent inducer of apoptosis and facilates its activity via Bid cleavage and translocation to mitochondria, Bax reduction in cytosol, release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO into the cytosol, and subsequently caspase activation, providing a potential mechanism for the cytotoxic activity of codonoposide 1c.","['Lee, Kyung-Won', 'Jung, Hyun-Ju', 'Park, Hee-Juhn', 'Kim, Deog-Gon', 'Lee, Jin-Yong', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Lee KW', 'Jung HJ', 'Park HJ', 'Kim DG', 'Lee JY', 'Lee KT']","['College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (xylopyranose)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'A1TA934AKO (Xylose)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'L4DUW10YOF (echinocystic acid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspases/*biosynthesis', '*Codonopsis', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', '*Plant Roots', 'Xylose/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology']",2005/05/03 09:00,2005/12/31 09:00,['2005/05/03 09:00'],"['2005/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/28.854 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.28.854 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2005 May;28(5):854-9. doi: 10.1248/bpb.28.854.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MOLM-17/-18 are proliferatively responsive to the growth factors present in the culture supernatant of the 5637 cell line. The B-LCLs are constitutively growth factor-independent. MOLM-17 and B422 were established at eight months after the initial diagnosis, while MOLM-18 and B423 were derived from a sample one month later. Immunophenotyping of the first leukemia sample revealed a mixed lineage leukemia immunophenotype with positivity for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD13 and CD19; the second sample revealed solely myeloid characteristics with positivity for CD13, CD41 and CD61, whereas TdT was negative.

The ability of ZRCM5 to block tyrosine kinase activity was tested in a short 10 min exposure ELISA involving isolated bcr-abl kinase and Western blotting assays. The results showed that: (a) ZRCM5 was hydrolyzed with a half-life of 27 min in cell culture media, (b) it blocked bcr-abl autophosphorylation in promyeloblastic leukemia K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC(50)=14.01 microM) and (c) it induced dose-dependent levels of DNA strand breaks. In contrast, temozolomide (TEM), a clinical DNA damaging triazene capable of generating, like ZRCM5, a methyldiazonium species, could neither block bcr-abl tyrosine kinase activity in isolated enzyme nor in whole cell autophosphorylation assays. In cells expressing varied levels of bcr-abl, ZRCM5 was consistently more potent than TEM. The significant potency of ZRCM5 against the leukemia cells was attributed to its ability to simultaneously to block bcr-abl and related DNA repair activity while inducing significant DNA lesions in bcr-abl expressing leukemia cells. Further studies are ongoing to increase the affinity of ZRCM5 with the purpose of further enhancing its potency in bcr-abl expressing cells.","['Katsoulas, Athanasia', 'Rachid, Zakaria', 'Brahimi, Fouad', 'McNamee, James', 'Jean-Claude, Bertrand J']","['Katsoulas A', 'Rachid Z', 'Brahimi F', 'McNamee J', 'Jean-Claude BJ']","['Cancer Drug Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, McGill University Health Center/Royal Victoria Hospital, 687 Pine Ave. West, M7.19, Montreal, Que., Canada H3A 1A1.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Triazenes)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'DNA Damage', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Design', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Temozolomide', 'Time Factors', 'Triazenes/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2005/05/03 09:00,2005/07/09 09:00,['2005/05/03 09:00'],"['2004/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(04)00396-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2004.11.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Jun;29(6):693-700. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.11.012.

In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of Pycnogenol on HL-60, U937 and K562 human leukemia cell lines. We found that Pycnogenol inhibited cell proliferation dose- and time-dependently, and the IC(50)s of Pycnogenol on HL-60, U937 and K562 cells were 150, 40 and 100 microg/ml, respectively. When HL-60 cells were incubated with low concentrations of Pycnogenol (50, 100 and 125 microg/ml) for 24 h, a prominent G0/G1 arrest was observed, followed by gradual accumulation of sub-G0/G1 nuclei. At 48 h of treatment, 50-70% of HL-60 cells differentiated, as evidenced by morphological changes, NBT reduction, induction of NSE activity, and increases of cell surface expression of CD11b. However, results from Annexin V/PI staining, DAPI staining and DNA fragmentation assay indicated that Pycnogenol induced HL-60, U937 and K562 cell apoptosis at their respective IC(50)s after 24 h of treatments. Pretreatment of z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 specific inhibitor, not only decreased caspase-3 activity but also reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells induced by Pycnogenol. This indicated that caspase-3 activation was involved in Pycnogenol induced-apoptosis. In conclusion, Pycnogenol induced differentiation and apoptosis in leukemia cells. Our data suggest that Pycnogenol could serve as a potent cancer chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agent for human leukemia.","['Huang, W W', 'Yang, J S', 'Lin, C F', 'Ho, W J', 'Lee, M R']","['Huang WW', 'Yang JS', 'Lin CF', 'Ho WJ', 'Lee MR']","['Department of Biology, China Medical University, 91 Hsueh-Shih Road, Taichung 404, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '50JZ5Z98QY (pycnogenols)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Plant Extracts', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",2005/05/03 09:00,2005/07/09 09:00,['2005/05/03 09:00'],"['2004/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(04)00378-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2004.10.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Jun;29(6):685-92. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2004.10.006.

The tumor suppressor gene p15(INK4b) is important component of cell cycles, whereas E-cadherin gene is often termed a metastasis suppressor gene. We have studied the feasibility of detecting tumor-associated aberrant p15(INK4b) and E-cadherin methylation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using methylation-specific PCR. Aberrant methylation of p15(INK4b) was detected in 31 of 61 (51%) AML patients. On the other hand, E-cadherin hypermethylation was detected in 36 of 61 (56%) AML patients. We have examined the methylation pattern of these genes and the prognosis in AML patients using a log-rank test. Methylation of p15(INK4b) gene significantly correlated with prognosis (p=0.0012), and methylation of E-cadherin gene more significantly correlated with prognosis (p=0.0004). When both were methylated, there was even more significant unfavorable prognosis compared to either of the methylated genes (p<0.0001).

To investigate a putative association of GST polymorphisms with the risk of acute leukaemia, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 30 published case-control studies. To take into account the possibility of heterogeneity across the studies, a statistical test was performed. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) were assessed using both a fixed-effects and a random-effects model. The pooled OR of acute leukaemia risks associated with GSTM1 null genotype, GSTP1 Val105 allele and GSTT1 null genotype were 1.22 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.38), 1.07 (95% CI 1.00-1.13) and 1.19 (95% CI 1.00-1.41), respectively. Significantly increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia associated with GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes was observed. Their pooled ORs were 1.24 (95% CI 1.17-1.31) and 1.30 (95% CI 1.06-1.60), respectively. We also found substantial evidence of heterogeneity between the studies. Our results suggest that GSTM1 and GSTT1, but not GSTP1 polymorphisms, appear to be associated with a modest increase in the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. It is conceivable that GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes may thus play a role in leukemogenesis. A review of the 30 case-control studies indicates that greater attention should be paid to the design of future studies.","['Ye, Zheng', 'Song, Honglin']","['Ye Z', 'Song H']","['Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Strangeways Research Laboratory, Worts Causeway, Cambridge CB1 8RN, UK. zheng.ye@phpc.cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",2005/05/03 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/05/03 09:00'],"['2004/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2005/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(05)00142-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2005.01.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2005 May;41(7):980-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2005.01.014.,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients were treated with subcutaneous IFN-alpha at a dose of 5 x 10(6) units/m(2) daily. In responding patients, the therapy lasted at least 3 years. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (14 females and 9 males; median age, 41 years; age range, 20-63 years) with a median platelet count of 1350 x 10(9)/L were treated. After a median follow-up of 174 months (14.5 years), 15 of 20 evaluable patients (75%) responded, including 14 patients who achieved a complete hematologic response (CHR) (6 of them with bone marrow remission) and 1 patient who demonstrated a partial response. The median time to response was 6 months (range, 0.5-36 months), and the median response duration was 48 months (range, 5-114 months). Seven patients who achieved a CHR and were taken off therapy after they completed 3 years of maintenance therapy sustained their response for a median of 28 months. No symptoms or signs of thrombosis or hemorrhage were observed in responding patients. Eleven of 14 patients (78%) who achieved a CHR developed a recurrence, and 2 of 5 patients with recurrences who were rechallenged with IFN-alpha achieved a second response. The treatment was tolerated relatively well. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-alpha was safe and effective therapy for patients with ET, and the ability of IFN-alpha to reverse disease pathology and possibly modify the clinical course of patients with ET warrants its investigation in larger, prospective trials.","['Saba, Rashid', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Giles, Francis', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Talpaz, Moshe', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Saba R', 'Jabbour E', 'Giles F', 'Cortes J', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Freireich EJ', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kantarjian H', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Therefore, early diagnosis is instrumental. We describe a family presenting with chronic renal failure and proteinuria in which classic skin and neurological features were absent and the diagnosis of Fabry disease was difficult and not established until a second family member developed renal abnormalities. A 35-year-old man was admitted because he was overweight and had hypertension, with a serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL (115 micromol/L) and protein excretion of 870 mg/d. Because 1 brother, who died years ago at the age of 32 years of acute myeloid leukemia, also had chronic renal failure and proteinuria, the diagnosis of Fabry disease was entertained. In the index patient, acroparesthesia, hypohidrosis, pain, angiokeratomas of the skin, and cornea verticillata suggesting Fabry disease were absent. Conversely, renal biopsy showed typical globotriaosylceramide deposits, and leukocyte alpha-galactosidase (alpha-GLA) A activity was decreased. Analysis of the alpha-GLA gene showed the mutation E66K. The mutation also was found in another asymptomatic 30-year-old brother who also had chronic renal failure and proteinuria, but normal extrarenal findings.

In the nucleus, Daxx interacts and colocalizes with the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) into the PML-nuclear body. Moreover, overexpressed Daxx positively modulates FAS-ligand and TGFbeta-induced apoptosis. However, recent reports indicate that Daxx can also act as an antiapoptotic factor. As most studies on the role of Daxx in cell death have been conducted using tumour cell lines, we analysed the function of Daxx in physiological settings. We found that Daxx is induced upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and hydrogen peroxide treatment. We employed RNA interference to downregulate Daxx in primary fibroblasts. Remarkably, Daxx-depleted cells are resistant to cell death induced by both UV irradiation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, the downregulation of Daxx results in impaired MKK/c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. This is the first evidence that Daxx promotes cell death and JNK activation in physiological conditions.","['Khelifi, A F', ""D'Alcontres, M Stagno"", 'Salomoni, P']","['Khelifi AF', ""D'Alcontres MS"", 'Salomoni P']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', '*DNA Damage/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5/metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays/adverse effects']",2005/04/30 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['4401559 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cdd.4401559 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2005 Jul;12(7):724-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401559.,,,,['MC_U132670601/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apoptosis-inducing ability of these mAbs and different TRAIL preparations, in the presence or absence of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), varied markedly against primary chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells and various tumor cell lines, demonstrating an unanticipated preferential apoptotic signaling via either TRAIL-R1 or -R2. Contrary to literature reports that TRAIL-induced apoptosis occurs primarily via signaling through TRAIL-R2, CLL cells, in the presence of HDACi, undergo predominantly TRAIL-R1-mediated apoptosis. Consequently, Apo2L/TRAIL, which signals primarily through TRAIL-R2, is virtually devoid of activity against CLL cells. To maximize therapeutic benefit, it is essential to ascertain whether a primary tumor signals via TRAIL-R1/-R2, prior to initiating therapy. Thus combination of an agonistic TRAIL-R1 Ab and an HDACi, such as the anticonvulsant sodium valproate, could be of value in treating CLL.","['MacFarlane, M', 'Inoue, S', 'Kohlhaas, S L', 'Majid, A', 'Harper, N', 'Kennedy, D B J', 'Dyer, M J S', 'Cohen, G M']","['MacFarlane M', 'Inoue S', 'Kohlhaas SL', 'Majid A', 'Harper N', 'Kennedy DB', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, University of Leicester, Lancaster Road, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Depsipeptides/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2005/04/30 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['4401649 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cdd.4401649 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2005 Jul;12(7):773-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401649.,,,,,,,,,,['Cell Death Differ. 2005 Jul;12(7):693-4.

Although MLF1 expresses normally in a variety of tissues including hematopoietic stem cells and the overexpression of MLF1 correlates with malignant transformation in human cancer, little is known about how MLF1 is involved in the regulation of cell growth. Here we show that MLF1 is a negative regulator of cell cycle progression functioning upstream of the tumor suppressor p53. MLF1 induces p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in murine embryonic fibroblasts. This action requires a novel binding partner, subunit 3 of the COP9 signalosome (CSN3). A reduction in the level of CSN3 protein with small interfering RNA abrogated MLF1-induced G1 arrest and impaired the activation of p53 by genotoxic stress. Furthermore, ectopic MLF1 expression and CSN3 knockdown inversely affect the endogenous level of COP1, a ubiquitin ligase for p53. Exogenous expression of COP1 overcomes MLF1-induced growth arrest. These results indicate that MLF1 is a critical regulator of p53 and suggest its involvement in leukemogenesis through a novel CSN3-COP1 pathway.","['Yoneda-Kato, Noriko', 'Tomoda, Kiichiro', 'Umehara, Mari', 'Arata, Yukinobu', 'Kato, Jun-ya']","['Yoneda-Kato N', 'Tomoda K', 'Umehara M', 'Arata Y', 'Kato JY']","['Department of Animal Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Takayama, Ikoma, Nara, Japan. noriko-k@bs.naist.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cops3 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLF1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (COP1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (COP9 Signalosome Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COP9 Signalosome Complex', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2005/04/30 09:00,2005/06/25 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2004/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['7600656 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7600656 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2005 May 4;24(9):1739-49. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600656.

This study aimed to determine the expression of a splicing-derived variant of interleukin (IL) -10 in leukemic cells and its clinical relevance in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at first relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1997 and December 2001, bone marrow (BM) samples were collected from 98 children with first relapse of ALL at diagnosis. These patients were enrolled in the relapse trial ALL-REZ BFM (ALL-Relapse Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) 95 and 96. The detection of IL-10 isoforms in leukemic cells of BM samples were performed by conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and by immunoblotting. RESULTS: IL-10 was detected in 93.9% BM samples. In addition to expressing full-length IL-10, a new splicing-derived IL-10 variant (termed IL-10delta3) that lacked the entire exon 3 was identified in leukemic cells. The IL-10delta3 variant was found in 80.4% of BM samples. Most importantly, expression of IL-10delta3 was associated with a significantly better response to chemotherapy (P = .001) and probability of event-free survival (P = .01) at 5 years. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that splicing-derived IL-10 isoforms may modulate IL-10-mediated biologic effects and therapeutic efficacy in lymphatic disease, and expression of IL-10delta3 is a positive prognostic feature in relapsed childhood ALL.","['Wu, Shuling', 'Gessner, Reinhard', 'Taube, Tillmann', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Henze, Gunter', 'Seeger, Karl']","['Wu S', 'Gessner R', 'Taube T', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Henze G', 'Seeger K']","['Institute of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiochemistry, Charite Medical Center, Humboldt University Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany. shuling.wu@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/30 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/13/3038 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.00.885 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 May 1;23(13):3038-42. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.00.885.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Of 697 patients enrolled onto POG protocol 9201, 362 patients had sufficient data for analysis. When compared to late line placement (> day 15 of induction), early CVL placement (</= day 15 of induction) was associated with an increased risk of having a positive blood culture (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.0 to 5.0; P = .05).

NLCs expressed significantly higher levels of APRIL than monocytes and significantly higher levels of BAFF and APRIL than CLL B cells. Also, the viability of CLL B cells cultured with NLCs was significantly reduced when CLL B cells were cultured with decoy receptor of B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which can bind both BAFF and APRIL, but not with BAFF receptor:Fc (BAFF-R:Fc), which binds only to BAFF. The effect(s) of BAFF or APRIL on leukemia cell survival appeared additive and distinct from that of stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha), which in contrast to BAFF or APRIL induced leukemia cell phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 [ERK1/2]) and AKT. Conversely, BAFF and APRIL, but not SDF-1alpha, induced CLL-cell activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB1 (NF-kappaB1) and enhanced CLL-cell expression of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. However, BAFF, but not APRIL, also induced CLL-cell activation of NF-kappaB2. We conclude that BAFF and APRIL from NLCs can function in a paracrine manner to support leukemia cell survival via mechanisms that are distinct from those of SDF-1alpha, indicating that NLCs use multiple distinct pathways to support CLL-cell survival.","['Nishio, Mitsufumi', 'Endo, Tomoyuki', 'Tsukada, Nobuhiro', 'Ohata, Junko', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Reed, John C', 'Zvaifler, Nathan J', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Nishio M', 'Endo T', 'Tsukada N', 'Ohata J', 'Kitada S', 'Reed JC', 'Zvaifler NJ', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Medicine, 9500 Gilman Dr, UCSD School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093-0663, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF13C protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry/*physiology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit', '*Paracrine Communication', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis/genetics/*physiology']",2005/04/30 09:00,2005/09/22 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53221-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-03-0889 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Aug 1;106(3):1012-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-0889.

First, individuals with a GATA1 mutation that blocks the interaction between GATA-1 and its cofactor Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1) suffer from dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Second, children with Down syndrome who develop acute megakaryoblastic leukemia harbor mutations in GATA1 that lead to the exclusive expression of a shorter isoform named GATA-1s. To determine the effect of these patient-specific mutations on GATA-1 function, we first compared the gene expression profile between wild-type and GATA-1-deficient megakaryocytes. Next, we introduced either GATA-1s or a FOG-binding mutant (V205G) into GATA-1-deficient megakaryocytes and assessed the effect on differentiation and gene expression. Whereas GATA-1-deficient megakaryocytes failed to undergo terminal differentiation and proliferated excessively in vitro, GATA-1s-expressing cells displayed proplatelet formation and other features of terminal maturation, but continued to proliferate aberrantly. In contrast, megakaryocytes that expressed V205G GATA-1 exhibited reduced proliferation, but failed to undergo maturation. Examination of the expression of megakaryocyte-specific genes in the various rescued cells correlated with the observed phenotypic differences. These studies show that GATA-1 is required for both normal regulation of proliferation and terminal maturation of megakaryocytes, and further, that these functions can be uncoupled by mutations in GATA1.","['Muntean, Andrew G', 'Crispino, John D']","['Muntean AG', 'Crispino JD']","['Ben May Institute for Cancer Research, Univeristy of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zfpm1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Anemia, Dyserythropoietic, Congenital/genetics', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Down Syndrome/genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Thrombocytopenia/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology']",2005/04/30 09:00,2005/09/20 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53128-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-02-0551 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Aug 15;106(4):1223-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-02-0551.

New classes of anticancer drugs, such as the farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), show therapeutic promise, but whether cells will easily develop resistance against them is not known. Here, we grew breakpoint cluster region/Abelson murine leukemia (Bcr/Abl) P190 lymphoblasts on stroma and made them resistant to the FTI SCH66336/lonafarnib to model emerging drug resistance in a patient. These cells exhibited greatly increased (> 100-fold) expression levels of a novel ATP (adenosine triphosphate)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-homologous gene, ATP11A. We showed that overexpression of this gene provided protection against the effects of SCH66336, whereas knockdown of endogenous ATP11a using small interfering RNA (siRNA) made cells more sensitive to this drug. The lymphoblasts that were resistant to this FTI were also more resistant to FTI-276 and to GGTI-298, 2 other structurally similar inhibitors. Surprisingly, the cells were also able to survive higher concentrations of imatinib mesylate, the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor. However, the cells remained sensitive to vincristine. Our results show that elevated levels of ATP11a can protect malignant lymphoblastic leukemia cells against several novel small molecule signal transduction inhibitors. A determination of the expression levels of this gene may have prognostic value when treatment with such classes of drugs is contemplated.","['Zhang, Bin', 'Groffen, John', 'Heisterkamp, Nora']","['Zhang B', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']","['Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Ms#54, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles Saban Research Institute, 4650 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABCA1 protein, mouse)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis/*physiology', 'Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2005/04/30 09:00,2005/09/20 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53146-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3655 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Aug 15;106(4):1355-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3655.

However, there are conflicting reports regarding its role in carcinogenesis. We performed a microarray expression analysis in normal [human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)] and neoplastic (melanoma A375 and myelomonocytic leukemia U937) actively proliferating cells and found evidence that beta-carotene stimulated vital cellular functions in the former and suppressed them in the latter. These differential effects correlated with the expression of the proapoptotic BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), which was downregulated in HUVECs and upregulated in the two neoplastic cell lines. The quantitative expression analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction largely confirmed the inhibition of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) pathway-mediated apoptosis in HUVECs and its activation in melanoma and leukemic cells. The assays for apoptosis, detecting DNA breaks and caspase activation, showed consistent proapoptotic and antiapoptotic effects in U937 and HUVEC lines, respectively. However, beta-carotene-induced expression changes of BAX and other BCL2 pathway genes did not lead to the predicted induction of apoptosis in the A375 cells.","['Bodzioch, Marek', 'Dembinska-Kiec, Aldona', 'Hartwich, Jadwiga', 'Lapicka-Bodzioch, Katarzyna', 'Banas, Agnieszka', 'Polus, Anna', 'Grzybowska, Joanna', 'Wybranska, Iwona', 'Dulinska, Joanna', 'Gil, Dorota', 'Laidler, Piotr', 'Placha, Wojciech', 'Zawada, Magdalena', 'Balana-Nowak, Agnieszka', 'Sacha, Tomasz', 'Kiec-Wilk, Beata', 'Skotnicki, Aleksander', 'Moehle, Christoph', 'Langmann, Thomas', 'Schmitz, Gerd']","['Bodzioch M', 'Dembinska-Kiec A', 'Hartwich J', 'Lapicka-Bodzioch K', 'Banas A', 'Polus A', 'Grzybowska J', 'Wybranska I', 'Dulinska J', 'Gil D', 'Laidler P', 'Placha W', 'Zawada M', 'Balana-Nowak A', 'Sacha T', 'Kiec-Wilk B', 'Skotnicki A', 'Moehle C', 'Langmann T', 'Schmitz G']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland. mb22@mp.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '01YAE03M7J (beta Carotene)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling/methods', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', '*Protein Array Analysis/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Umbilical Veins/drug effects/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'beta Carotene/*pharmacology']",2005/04/30 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1207/s15327914nc5102_13 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2005;51(2):226-35. doi: 10.1207/s15327914nc5102_13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, FISH analysis with a PML/RARalpha dual-color kit showed a more complex translocation, resulting presumably from a two-step rearrangement, with PML-RARalpha fusion gene located as expected on the der(15) but the residual 5'-RARalpha signal located on the der(6). The patient achieved complete remission with all-trans retinoic acid treatment associated with chemotherapy. This case illustrates the usefulness of combined cytogenetics, FISH, and molecular biology to evidence the PML/RARalpha fusion gene in complex cases.","['Eclache, Virginie', 'Viguie, Franck', 'Frocrain, Claudie', 'Cassinat, Bruno', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Cymbalista, Florence', 'Fenaux, Pierre']","['Eclache V', 'Viguie F', 'Frocrain C', 'Cassinat B', 'Chomienne C', 'Cymbalista F', 'Fenaux P']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Jean Verdier, Bondy, France. eclache@avc.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/04/30 09:00,2005/06/10 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2004/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(04)00431-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2004.09.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2005 May;159(1):69-73. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2004.09.013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of its clinical significance and considerable efforts in many laboratories, however, the molecular basis of GC-induced apoptosis and the clinically important resistance phenomenon remains poorly defined. The anti-leukemic GC effects are critically dependent upon sufficient expression of the GC receptor (GR) throughout the response. In ALL cell lines, this is associated with, and may depend upon, GR autoinduction. In corresponding in vitro models, GC resistance frequently results from mutations in the GR gene and/or deficient regulation of its expression. The downstream components of the pathway, i.e., the GC-regulated genes responsible for cell death induction, have been studied by microarray-based comparative expression profiling, resulting in identification of a considerable number of GC-regulated candidate genes. Their possible function in the death response is, however, still undefined. One model predicts direct regulation of the apoptotic machinery, e.g., components of the ""Bcl-2 rheostat"", while a complementary hypothesis suggests deleterious GC effects on essential cellular functions, such as metabolism, production of and/or response to oxygen radicals, general transcription/translation, pH and volume control, etc. These regulatory effects may entail cell death, particularly if maintained for sufficient time through GR autoinduction. The latter form of cell death may occur even in the absence of functional apoptotic machinery (e.g., when caspases are blocked), but in this case appears to entail a more necrotic morphology. Taken together, GC may induce different types of cell death through distinct molecular pathways, depending on the cellular context. GC resistance might frequently result from defective GR expression, perhaps the most efficient means to target multiple antileukemic pathways.","['Ploner, Christian', 'Schmidt, Stefan', 'Presul, Elisabeth', 'Renner, Kathrin', 'Schrocksnadel, Kathrin', 'Rainer, Johannes', 'Riml, Stefan', 'Kofler, Reinhard']","['Ploner C', 'Schmidt S', 'Presul E', 'Renner K', 'Schrocksnadel K', 'Rainer J', 'Riml S', 'Kofler R']","['Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, Biocenter Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics']",2005/04/30 09:00,2005/07/08 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-0760(04)00433-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jsbmb.2004.12.017 [doi]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2005 Feb;93(2-5):153-60. doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2004.12.017.

However, treatments are complex and aggressive, potentially compromising QOL for children and their parents. Although previous work has shown increased anxiety and depression among parents after diagnosis, the recent development of standardised measures of QOL enables us to look more directly at the impact of diagnosis on mothers' and children's QOL. The aims of this study are to i) describe QOL for children and their mothers after diagnosis by comparing their scores with population norms, ii) explore the relationship between mothers' worries about the illness and their QOL, and iii) determine the relationship between mothers ratings of their own QOL and their child. METHOD: A total of 87 families took part, constituting 60% of those eligible. The children included 58 males and 29 females aged between 2 years 6 months to 16 years 3 months (mean = 7 years, median = 5 years 8 months). Diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, n = 57), brain tumours (n = 11), bone tumours (n = 17) and 2 rare cancers. Mothers completed questionnaires about their own and the child's QOL. RESULTS: Mothers' reported their own and the child's QOL to be significantly lower than population norms. There were significant correlations between mothers' worries and their own and their ratings of the child's QOL and mothers' ratings of their own QOL correlated with their ratings of the child's QOL. CONCLUSION: Both children and their mothers experience significantly compromised QOL in the months following diagnosis. Mothers who rated their own QOL to be poor also rate their child's QOL to be low. These results suggest caution is required where mothers rate their child's QOL. Efforts must continue to be made to improve QOL of children especially in the period immediately following diagnosis.","['Eiser, Christine', 'Eiser, J Richard', 'Stride, Christopher B']","['Eiser C', 'Eiser JR', 'Stride CB']","['CR-UK Child and Family Research Group, Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield, S10 2TP, UK. c.eiser@shef.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Health Qual Life Outcomes,Health and quality of life outcomes,101153626,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anxiety', 'Bone Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', 'Brain Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mothers/*psychology', 'Neoplasms/classification/*psychology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/psychology/therapy', 'Proxy', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', '*Sickness Impact Profile', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United Kingdom']",2005/04/30 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['1477-7525-3-29 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7525-3-29 [doi]']",epublish,Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2005 Apr 28;3:29. doi: 10.1186/1477-7525-3-29.,20050428,PMC1097748,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial presentation of disease in this site (primary retroperitoneal lymphoma) is considered to be rare. Because of the uncommon anatomic location, the diagnosis and subsequent management of these patients tend to be difficult for both pathologists and clinicians. OBJECTIVE: This report describes our experience during a period of 6 years 4 months with patients with hematologic malignancies primarily presenting in the retroperitoneum. DESIGN: A retrospective search of our medical records generated 32 patients who presented initially with abdominal pain or discomfort as their predominant symptom and who were found by imaging studies to have retroperitoneal mass or masses. All the histopathology slides were reviewed and classified based on the World Health Organization classification. RESULTS: There were 13 male and 19 female patients. Tumor types included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 12); grade 1 follicular lymphoma (n = 4); grade 3 follicular lymphoma (n = 1); B chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 2); multiple myeloma (n = 1); mixed-cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1); nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1); aggressive B-cell lymphoma (n = 4); low-grade B-cell lymphoma (n = 4); lymphoblastic lymphoma, null cell type (n = 1); and precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (n = 1). More than half of the cases (17/32) were diagnosed on needle biopsy with immunophenotyping.

The authors used a cross-sectional ecological study design to investigate such a potential association. In areas proximate to 42 amplitude modulated (AM) radio transmitters, 11 high-power study sites (i.e., areas exposed to 100-1500-kW transmission power) and 31 low-power study sites (i.e., areas exposed to 50-kW transmission power) were identified. The incidence of cancer within a 2-km radius of each transmitter was obtained from (a) Korean medical-insurance data for the years 1993 through 1996, (b) population census data for the year 1995, and (c) resident registration data for the year 1995. The authors calculated age-standardized rate ratios for total cancer, leukemia, malignant lymphoma, brain cancer, and breast cancer, and compared the incidence of cancer within 2 km of the high-power transmitters vs. the incidence within 2 km of the low-power transmitters. Four control areas for each high-power transmitter were also selected. The control areas were located in the same, or nearest adjacent, province as the high-power sites, but were at least 2 km from any of the transmitters. Indirect standardized observed/expected ratios for the high-power sites vs. control areas were calculated for each transmitter separately, and for 4 transmitter groupings defined by power level (i.e., 100 kW, 250 kW, 500 kW, and 1500 kW). The authors found no significant increase in age-standardized rate ratios of cancers for high-power vs. low-power sites, with the exceptions of total cancer and of brain cancer in women. Among the 11 high-power sites, there were significantly increased incidences of leukemia in 2 areas and of brain cancer in 1 area.

The resulting gene fusion was cloned into pET16b under the control of T7 promoter, giving rise to the expression plasmid pET-IL15M-PEdelta293. Using Ni2+ -NTA affinity chromatography, IL15M-PEdelta293 was purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS transformed with pET-IL15M-PEdelta293. The fusion toxin showed cytotoxicity to IL-15R-bearing myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 and K562-derived multidrug resistant cell line K562/AO2. However, IL-15R negative cell line Jurkat was insensitive to IL15M-PEdelta293. In addition, the toxic effect of IL15M-PEdelta293 on K562 was completely blocked by excessive amount of recombinant human IL-15. These results demonstrated that the selective cytotoxicity of IL15M-PEdelta293 correlated with the appropriate IL-15R expression on target cells. The present data suggest that the chimeric toxin constructed in this report may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of diseases associated with abnormal expression of IL-15/IL-15R, even in the treatment of chemotherapy refractory tumors.","['Niu, Yun-Fei', 'Zheng, Ying', 'Mao, Xiao-Hua']","['Niu YF', 'Zheng Y', 'Mao XH']","['Key Laboratory of Developmental Genes and Human Diseases, Ministry of Education, Department of Developmental Biology and Genetics, School of Basic Medical Science, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao,Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,9426463,"['0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Escherichia coli/genetics/metabolism', 'Exotoxins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology']",2005/04/30 09:00,2009/07/23 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao. 2005 Jan;21(1):42-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon removal of LIF, from the culture medium they cease to express markers such as Oct 4, rapidly losing the capacity for self-renewal and differentiating into a variety of cell types. Gene targeting is feasible in murine ES cells because these cells can be maintained in an undifferentiated state long enough to allow selection of properly targeted cell colonies with a high frequency of homologous recombination. Furthermore, blastocysts cloned from cultured murine ES cells develop to term at an efficiency (10-30%) that is three to ten times higher than blastocysts cloned from the nuclei of differentiated somatic cells. It seems likely that ES cells require less extensive reprogramming than do somatic cells, perhaps because in ES cells, many genes that are essential for early development are already active and thus do not require reactivation. Recently, we succeeded in isolating immortalized equine and bovine ES cells with a normal karyotype, that exhibit features similar to those of murine ES cells and express Oct 4, STAT-3, SSEA-1 and AP. We further confirmed the pluripotential ability of these cells, which were able to undergo somatic differentiation in vitro to neural progenitors and to endothelial or hematopoietic lineages. We were able to use bovine ES cells, as a source of nuclei for nuclear transfer (NT) and we generated cloned cattle with a higher frequency of pregnancies to term than has been achieved with differentiated somatic cells. Moreover, bovine ES cells that expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were incorporated into both the inner cell mass (ICM) and the trophectdermal cells of developing blastocysts. These findings should facilitate targeted genetic manipulation of the genome and should allow production of cloned cattle in a single step after modification, as appropriate, of the genome.","['Saito, Shigeo', 'Liu, Bingbing', 'Yokoyama, Kazunari']","['Saito S', 'Liu B', 'Yokoyama K']","['Saito Laboratory of Cell Technology, Kataoka, Yaita, Tochigi 329-1571, Japan. saict1@maple.ocn.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/physiology', 'Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Organism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lewis X Antigen/physiology', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",2005/04/30 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2005/04/30 09:00'],"['2005/04/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-0774.2004.tb00026.x [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Cell. 2004 Sep;17(3):107-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-0774.2004.tb00026.x.,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 10 % of newborns with DS show transient myeloproliferative disease (TMD) which normally resolves spontaneously. The blast cells of both entities show megakaryoblastic/erythroblastic features (M7/M6) and cannot be distinguished by morphological characteristics. DESIGN AND METHODS: Blast cells of 62 children were analyzed by four-color flow cytometry and dual color fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: The immunophenotype of blast cells from children with TMD and DS-AMKL is characterized by the expression of CD33 (+)/CD13 (+/-)/CD38 (+)/CD117 (+)/CD34 (+/-)/CD7 (+)/CD56 (+/-)/CD36 (+)/CD71 (+)/CD42b (+)/CD4dim (+)/TPO-R (+)/EPO-R (-)/IL-3-Ralpha (+)/IL-6-Ralpha (-). Non-DS children with morphologically related diseases, i. e. myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), or AML-M6 and AML-M7, did not show this expression profile. CD34 expression was observed in 93 % of TMD, but only 50 % of DS-AMKL patients. The blast cells of all TMD and DS-AMKL cases were positive for TPO-R and IL-3R, whereas EPO-R and IL-6R were absent. CONCLUSIONS: Immunophenotyping by the use of surface antigens and growth factor receptors is a useful tool to discriminate TMD and DS-AMKL from diseases with morphologically similar or identical blasts. The absence of EPO-R on the blast cells might be a sign of the high expression of the mutated -- and less active -- GATA1 in DS. The higher amount of CD34 co-expression in TMD may be interpreted to indicate that TMD is a slightly more immature disease than DS-AMKL.","['Langebrake, C', 'Creutzig, U', 'Reinhardt, D']","['Langebrake C', 'Creutzig U', 'Reinhardt D']","[""University Children's Hospital Muenster, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 48129 Muenster. langebra@uni-muenster.de""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/diagnosis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors']",2005/04/29 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/04/29 09:00'],"['2005/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2005-836510 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2005 May-Jun;217(3):126-34. doi: 10.1055/s-2005-836510.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LPL mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from 104 CLL patients differed by 1.5 orders of magnitude between cases with mutated (N=51) or unmutated (N=53) IGV(H) (median: 1.33 vs 45.22 compared to normal PBMNC). LPL expression correlated strongly with IGV(H) mutational status (R=0.614; P<0.0001). High LPL expression predicted unmutated IGV(H) status with an odds ratio of 25.90 (P<0.0001) and discriminated between mutated and unmutated cases in 87 of 104 patients (84%). LPL expression was higher in patients with poor risk cytogenetics. High LPL expression was associated with a shorter treatment-free survival (median 40 vs 96 months, P=0.001) and a trend for a shorter median overall survival (105 months vs not reached).

Additional karyotypic alterations to the t(9;22) translocation were found in only 1/18 CML-CP patients. In contrast, 11/16 (73%) CML-BC patients displayed additional karyotype alterations in 48.7% of analyzed cells, correlating with an abnormal centrosome status (P=0.0005). Our results indicate that centrosome defects are a common and early detectable feature in CML that may contribute to acquisition of chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy. They may be considered as the driving force of disease progression and could serve as future prognostic markers.","['Giehl, M', 'Fabarius, A', 'Frank, O', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Hafner, M', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Seifarth, W']","['Giehl M', 'Fabarius A', 'Frank O', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hafner M', 'Hehlmann R', 'Seifarth W']","['Medical Clinic III, Faculty for Clinical Medicine Mannheim of University Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Centrosome/pathology', 'Chromosomal Instability/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2005/04/29 09:00,2005/08/25 09:00,['2005/04/29 09:00'],"['2005/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403779 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403779 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jul;19(7):1192-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403779.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Case report].,839-45,"UNLABELLED: Genetic abnormalities and immune system disorders resulting from them are the causes of neoplastic diseases as well as inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease. However, the rearrangement of genes may not only be the cause of neoplasms but also the result of oncolytic treatment used. One of the late treatment-related complications of neoplastic diseases is the development of a second neoplasm and possible disorders belonging to the group of inflammatory bowel diseases, for example Crohn's disease. The paper presents the case of a 13-year-old boy (K.G.) treated for a second neoplasm, complicated by Crohn's disease. The patient was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia -- middle risk group (ALL-MRG) at the age of 3, treated according to the BFM 87 Protocol (dexamethasone, prednisone, vincristine, daunoribicin, asparaginase, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, thioguanine, doxorubicin), and complete remission was achieved. Eight years after the first line treatment the boy was diagnosed with the second neoplastic process -- pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL-L2 pre-B common +). The ALLIC 2002 Protocol (dexamethasone, prednisone, vincristine, daunoribicin, asparaginase, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, mercaptopurine. methotrexate, thioguanine, doxorubicin) was started. On day 71 of the therapy, during aplasia of blood marrow following chemotherapy, inflammation of the caecum was diagnosed and metronidazole was introduced. Once blood counts improved, the complaints decreased and with continued chemotherapy of Protocol M (mercaptopurine, methotrexate), completely subsided. The symptoms reappeared during the 2-week break before Protoco II. The physical examination revealed the presence of a hard, painless tumour (3 x 10 cm) in the right iliac fossa. Colonoscopy showed a cauliflower-like formation within the Mauchin's valve projecting to the caecum lumen. The histopathological evaluation of the sections demonstrated a typical picture of Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease of the ileum was diagnosed, the treatment with dexamethazone (according to Protocol II) was instituted which led to complete regression of the iliac lesions. Steroid therapy (prednisone) continued until the treatment supporting the remission according to Protocol ALLIC 2002 (mercaptopurine, methotrexate orally) was initiated. CONCLUSION: The differential diagnosis of complications accompanying neoplasms should consider the inflammatory bowel diseases; their atypical course may be masked by the treatment of the underlying disease.","['Nurzynska-Flak, Joanna', 'Mitura-Lesiuk, Malgorzata', 'Skomra, Stanislaw', 'Skomra, Danuta', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy R']","['Nurzynska-Flak J', 'Mitura-Lesiuk M', 'Skomra S', 'Skomra D', 'Kowalczyk JR']","['Klinika Hematologii i Onkologii Dzieciecej, Dzieciecy Szpital Kliniczny, Chodzki 2, 20-093 Lublin, Poland. info@prolab.lublin.pl']",['pol'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Med Wieku Rozwoj,Medycyna wieku rozwojowego,100928610,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Crohn Disease/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/29 09:00,2006/10/18 09:00,['2005/04/29 09:00'],"['2005/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Wieku Rozwoj. 2004 Jul-Sep;8(3 Pt 2):839-45.,,,,,Drugi nowotwor powiklany choroba Crohna u 13-letniego chlopca.

However, the mechanism that regulates this event remains largely unknown. Recent studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) likely regulates tight junction (TJ) dynamics in the testis via the cGMP/protein kinase G (cGMP-dependent protein kinase, PRKG) signaling pathway. Due to the proximity of TJ and adherens junctions (AJ) in the testis, in particular at the blood-testis barrier, it is of interest to investigate if NO can affect AJ dynamics. Studies using Sertoli-germ cell cocultures in vitro have shown that the levels of NOS (nitric oxide synthase), cGMP, and PRKG were induced when anchoring junctions were being established. Using an in vivo model in which adult rats were treated with adjudin [a molecule that induces adherens junction disruption, formerly called AF-2364, 1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-IH-indazole-3-carbohydrazide], the event of AJ disruption was also associated with a transient iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase, NOS2) induction. Immunohistochemistry has illustrated that NOS2 was intensely accumulated in Sertoli and germ cells in the epithelium during adjudin-induced germ cell loss, with a concomitant accumulation of intracellular cGMP and an induction of PRKG but not cAMP or protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PRKA). To identify the NOS-mediated downstream signaling partners, coimmunoprecipitation was used to demonstrate that NOS2 and eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase, NOS3) were structurally associated with the N-cadherin (CDH2)/beta-catenin (CATNB)/actin complex but not the nectin-3 (poliovirus receptor-related 3, PVRL 3)/afadin (myeloid/lymphoid or mixed lineage-leukemia tranlocation to 4 homolog, MLLT4) nor the integrin beta1 (ITB1)-mediated protein complexes, illustrating the spatial vicinity of NOS with selected AJ-protein complexes. Interestingly, CDH2 and CATNB were shown to dissociate from NOS during the adjudin-mediated AJ disruption, implicating the CDH2/CATNB protein complex is the likely downstream target of the NO signaling. Furthermore, PRKG, the downstream signaling protein of NOS, was shown to interact with CATNB in the rat testis. Perhaps the most important of all, pretreatment of testes with KT5823, a specific PRKG inhibitor, can indeed delay the adjudin-induced germ cell loss, further validating NOS/NO regulates Sertoli-germ cell AJ dynamics via the cGMP/PRKG pathway. These results illustrate that the CDH2/CATNB-mediated adhesion function in the testis is regulated, at least in part, via the NOS/cGMP/PRKG/CATNB pathway.","['Lee, Nikki P Y', 'Mruk, Dolores D', 'Wong, Ching-Hang', 'Cheng, C Yan']","['Lee NP', 'Mruk DD', 'Wong CH', 'Cheng CY']","['Population Council, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)indazole-3-carbohydrazide)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Ctnnb1 protein, rat)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '126643-37-6 (KT 5823)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.11.12 (Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",IM,"['Adherens Junctions/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic GMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Hydrazines/pharmacology', 'Indazoles/pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sertoli Cells/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Spermatozoa/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'beta Catenin']",2005/04/29 09:00,2005/10/29 09:00,['2005/04/29 09:00'],"['2005/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['biolreprod.105.040766 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.105.040766 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2005 Sep;73(3):458-71. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.105.040766.

The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the short arm of chromosome 9 (9pLOH) in myeloproliferative disorders suggests that 9p harbors a mutation that contributes to the cause of clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells in these diseases. METHODS: We performed microsatellite mapping of the 9pLOH region and DNA sequencing in 244 patients with myeloproliferative disorders (128 with polycythemia vera, 93 with essential thrombocythemia, and 23 with idiopathic myelofibrosis). RESULTS: Microsatellite mapping identified a 9pLOH region that included the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene. In patients with 9pLOH, JAK2 had a homozygous G-->T transversion, causing phenylalanine to be substituted for valine at position 617 of JAK2 (V617F). All 51 patients with 9pLOH had the V617F mutation. Of 193 patients without 9pLOH, 66 were heterozygous for V617F and 127 did not have the mutation. The frequency of V617F was 65 percent among patients with polycythemia vera (83 of 128), 57 percent among patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis (13 of 23), and 23 percent among patients with essential thrombocythemia (21 of 93). V617F is a somatic mutation present in hematopoietic cells. Mitotic recombination probably causes both 9pLOH and the transition from heterozygosity to homozygosity for V617F. Genetic evidence and in vitro functional studies indicate that V617F gives hematopoietic precursors proliferative and survival advantages. Patients with the V617F mutation had a significantly longer duration of disease and a higher rate of complications (fibrosis, hemorrhage, and thrombosis) and treatment with cytoreductive therapy than patients with wild-type JAK2. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of patients with myeloproliferative disorders carry a dominant gain-of-function mutation of JAK2.","['Kralovics, Robert', 'Passamonti, Francesco', 'Buser, Andreas S', 'Teo, Soon-Siong', 'Tiedt, Ralph', 'Passweg, Jakob R', 'Tichelli, Andre', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Skoda, Radek C']","['Kralovics R', 'Passamonti F', 'Buser AS', 'Teo SS', 'Tiedt R', 'Passweg JR', 'Tichelli A', 'Cazzola M', 'Skoda RC']","['Department of Research, Experimental Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Point Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/*genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Thrombocytosis/*genetics']",2005/04/29 09:00,2005/05/04 09:00,['2005/04/29 09:00'],"['2005/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['352/17/1779 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa051113 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2005 Apr 28;352(17):1779-90. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa051113.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2005 Massachusetts Medical Society.'],,,"['N Engl J Med. 2005 Apr 28;352(17):1744-6.

A report of two cases.,550-2,"AIM: To report two examples of an angiocentric immunoproliferative lesion (AIL) and angiocentric angiodestructive lymphoma (AL) presenting in lymph nodes in children. Most commonly involving extranodal sites, AIL/AL rarely presents in the spleen and lymph nodes. METHODS/RESULTS: Case 1 presented as a cervical lymphadenopathy in a 3 year old girl being treated for pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Histological and immunohistochemistry studies revealed an Epstein-Barr virus positive (EBV+), large B cell (CD20 and CD30+) AIL with large areas of necrosis, the whole resembling lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Case 2 presented as a large supraclavicular lymphadenopathy in a 13 year old boy. Histology and immunohistochemistry revealed an EBV-, large T cell (CD45RO, CD56, and CD30+) AL, presenting the features of so called angiocentric T cell/natural killer cell lymphoma, nasal type. CONCLUSIONS: The term AIL/AL refers to a heterogeneous group of conditions not unique to a particular type of lymphoid cell.

METHODS: Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was undertaken on the CD4+ALK+ (anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive) ALCL derived cell line Karpas299 and as comparison on CD4+ T cells. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were performed on five ALCL derived cell lines and 32 tissue samples to confirm the SAGE data. RESULTS: High expression of Mcl-1 was seen in the Karpas299 cell line, whereas the two other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), were not detected in the SAGE library. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the high expression of Mcl-1 mRNA and low expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) in Karpas299 and in four other ALCL cell lines. To expand on these initial observations, primary tissue samples were analysed for Mcl-1, Bcl-X(L), and Bcl-2 by immunohistochemistry. All 23 ALK+ and nine ALK- ALCL cases were positive for Mcl-1. Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) were expressed infrequently in ALK+ ALCL cases, but were present in a higher proportion of ALK- ALCL cases. CONCLUSION: The consistent high expression of Mcl-1 in ALK+ and ALK- ALCL suggests that Mcl-1 is the main antiapoptotic protein in this disease. The high frequency of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-X(L) positive ALCL cases in the ALK- group compared with the ALK+ group indicates that ALK induced STAT3 activation is not the main regulatory pathway in ALCL.","['Rust, R', 'Harms, G', 'Blokzijl, T', 'Boot, M', 'Diepstra, A', 'Kluiver, J', 'Visser, L', 'Peh, S-C', 'Lim, M', 'Kamps, W A', 'Poppema, S', 'van den Berg, A']","['Rust R', 'Harms G', 'Blokzijl T', 'Boot M', 'Diepstra A', 'Kluiver J', 'Visser L', 'Peh SC', 'Lim M', 'Kamps WA', 'Poppema S', 'van den Berg A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Universal Medical Centre Groningen and University of Groningen, 9700 RB Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/04/29 09:00,2005/06/10 09:00,['2005/04/29 09:00'],"['2005/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['58/5/520 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2004.022335 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2005 May;58(5):520-4. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2004.022335.,,PMC1770666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dimeric RNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) undergoes rearrangement during virion maturation, whereby the dimeric RNA genome assumes a more stable conformation. Previously, we have shown that the packaging of the HIV-1 polymerase (Pol) proteins reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) is essential for the generation of the mature RNA dimer conformation. Analysis of HIV-1 mutants that are defective in processing of Pol showed that these mutant virions contained altered dimeric RNA conformation, indicating that the mature RNA dimer conformation in HIV-1 requires the correct proteolytic processing of Pol. The HIV-1 Pol proteins are multimeric in their mature enzymatically active forms; RT forms a heterodimer, and IN appears to form a homotetramer. Using RT and IN multimerization defective mutants, we have found that dimeric RNA from these mutant virions has the same stability and conformation as wild-type RNA dimers, showing that the mature enzymatically active RT and IN proteins are dispensable for the generation of mature RNA dimer conformation. This also indicated that formation of the mature RNA dimer structure occurs prior to RT or IN maturation. We have also investigated the requirement of Pol for RNA dimerization in both Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) and found that in contrast to HIV-1, Pol is dispensable for RNA dimer maturation in M-PMV and MoMuLV, demonstrating that the requirement of Pol in retroviral RNA dimer maturation is not conserved among all retroviruses.","['Buxton, Penelope', 'Tachedjian, Gilda', 'Mak, Johnson']","['Buxton P', 'Tachedjian G', 'Mak J']","['The Macfarlane Burnet Institute for Medical Research and Public Health, Cnr Punt & Commercial Rds, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia 3004. mak@burnet.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Dimerization', 'Gene Products, pol/physiology', 'Integrases/*physiology', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/*metabolism']",2005/04/29 09:00,2005/06/21 09:00,['2005/04/29 09:00'],"['2005/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/10/6338 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.10.6338-6348.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 May;79(10):6338-48. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.10.6338-6348.2005.,,PMC1091692,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we used the information to, in silico, reconstruct a putative ancestral HERV-H. A calculated consensus sequence was nearly open in all genes. A few manual adjustments resulted in a putative 9-kb HERV-H provirus with open reading frames (ORFs) in gag, pro, pol, and env. Long terminal repeats (LTRs) differed by 1.1%, indicating proximity to an integration event. The gag ORF was extended upstream of the normal myristylation start site. There was a long leader (including a ""pre-gag"" ORF) region positioned like the N terminus of murine leukemia virus (MLV) ""glyco-Gag,"" potentially encoding a proline- and serine-rich domain remotely similar to MLV pp12. Another ORF, starting inside the 5' LTR, had no obvious similarity to known protein domains. Unlike other hitherto described gammaretroviruses, the reconstructed Gag had two zinc finger motifs. Alternative splicing of sequences related to the HERV-H consensus was confirmed using dbEST data. env transcripts were most prevalent in colon tumors, but also in normal testis. We found no evidence for full length env transcripts in the dbEST. HERV-H had a markedly skewed nucleotide composition, disfavoring guanine and favoring cytidine. We conclude that the HERV-H consensus shared a gene arrangement common to gammaretroviruses with gag separated by stop codon from pro-pol in the same reading frame, while env resides in another reading frame. There was also alternative splicing. HERV-H consensus yielded new insights in gammaretroviral evolution and will be useful as a model in studies on expression and function.","['Jern, Patric', 'Sperber, Goran O', 'Ahlsen, Goran', 'Blomberg, Jonas']","['Jern P', 'Sperber GO', 'Ahlsen G', 'Blomberg J']","['Section of Virology, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Academic Hospital, Dag Hammarskjolds v. 17, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.

In this study, we demonstrated that the E4 ORF3 protein effects the relocalization of both PML and MRN proteins to similar structures within the nucleus at early times after infection. These proteins colocalize with E4 ORF3. Through the analysis of specific viral mutants, we found a direct correlation between MRN reorganization at early times after infection and the establishment of viral DNA replication domains. Further, the reorganization of MRN components may be uncoupled from the ability of E4 ORF3 to rearrange PML. At later stages of infection, components of the MRN complex disperse within the nucleus, Nbs1 is found within viral replication centers, Rad50 remains localized with E4 ORF3, and Mre11 is degraded. The importance of viral regulation of the MRN complex is underscored by the complementation of E4 mutant viruses in cells that lack Mre11 or Nbs1 activity. These results illustrate the importance of nuclear organization in virus growth and suggest that E4 ORF3 regulates activities in both PML nuclear bodies and the MRN complex to stimulate the viral replication program.","['Evans, Jared D', 'Hearing, Patrick']","['Evans JD', 'Hearing P']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Stony Brook University School of Medicine, Stony Brook, New York 11794-5222, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRE11 protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Rad50 protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Adenoviridae/metabolism/*physiology', 'Adenovirus E4 Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Virus Assembly']",2005/04/29 09:00,2005/06/21 09:00,['2005/04/29 09:00'],"['2005/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/10/6207 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.10.6207-6215.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 May;79(10):6207-15. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.10.6207-6215.2005.,,PMC1091726,,"['P01 CA028146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This fusion protein is generated by the Philadelphia translocation t(9;22). CML is a progressive condition that invariably advances from a drug-sensitive to a drug-resistant, aggressive, acute leukemia. The mechanisms responsible for this progression are largely unknown; however, in many cases, progression is accompanied by an increase in Bcr-Abl expression. Osteopontin (OPN) expression has been shown to be involved in the progression and increased aggression and invasiveness of many solid tumors. Here, we demonstrate that OPN expression is induced in a model of leukemia, and we describe the identification of specific signaling pathways required for the induction of OPN expression by p210 Bcr-Abl. We have determined that high levels of Bcr-Abl activate a signaling cascade involving the sequential activation of Ras, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, atypical protein kinase C, Raf-1, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, leading to the ultimate expression of OPN. Our results suggest that these molecules represent a single pathway and also that there is no redundancy in this pathway, as inhibition of any individual component results in a block in the induction of OPN. The data presented here define for the first time the ability of Bcr-Abl to stimulate the expression of OPN and also identify the signaling pathway involved. This may not only prove important in understanding the mechanisms of progression of CML but also highlights a pathway that may prove significant in many other cases of oncogenesis, where OPN expression is implicated.","['Hickey, Fionnuala B', 'England, Karen', 'Cotter, Thomas G']","['Hickey FB', 'England K', 'Cotter TG']","['Department of Biochemistry, Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SPP1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Spp1 protein, mouse)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PKC-3 protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Osteopontin', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Up-Regulation', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2005/04/29 09:00,2005/09/09 09:00,['2005/04/29 09:00'],"['2005/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1104655 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1104655 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2005 Jul;78(1):289-300. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1104655.

Little attention has been paid to the potential phenotypic consequences of germline genetic variation on downstream genes. We determined the germline status of 16 well-characterized functional polymorphisms in 126 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We assessed whether global gene expression profiles of diagnostic ALL blasts from the same patients differed by these germline polymorphic genotypes. Gene expression values were adjusted for ALL-subtype-specific patterns. Of the 16 loci, only the UGT1A1 promoter repeat polymorphism [A(TA)nTAA] (UGT1A1*28) and GSTM1 deletion were significant predictors of global gene expression in a supervised approach, which divided patients based on their germline genotypes [UGT1A1: 124 probe sets, false discovery rate (FDR)=13%, P< or =0.0031; GSTM1: 112 probe sets, FDR=42.5%, P< or =0.0084]. Genes whose expression distinguished the UGT1A1 (TA) 7/7 genotype from the other UGT1A1 genotypes included HDAC1, RELA and SLC2A1; those that distinguished the GSTM1 null genotype from non-null genotype included NBS1 and PRKR. In an unsupervised approach, the gene expression profiles using the entire array delineated two major clusters of patients. The only germline genotype frequency that differed between the two clusters was UGT1A1 (P=0.002; Fisher's exact test).

GR is susceptible to attack from exogenous electrophiles, particularly carbamoylation from alkyl isocyanates, rendering the enzyme unable to catalyze the reduction of oxidized glutathione. Evidence implicates inhibition of GR as a cause of the pulmonary toxicity often seen in high-dose BCNU-treated animals and human cancer patients. Herein we demonstrate that the prodrug Cloretazine (1,2-bis[methylsulfonyl]-1-[2-chloroethyl]-2-[(methylamino)carbonyl]hydrazine; VNP40101M), which yields methyl isocyanate and chloroethylating species upon activation, did not produce similar inhibition of cellular GR activity, despite BCNU and Cloretazine being equally potent inhibitors of purified human GR (IC(50) values of 55.5 microM and 54.6 microM, respectively). Human erythrocytes, following exposure to 50 microM BCNU for 1h at 37 degrees C, had an 84% decrease in GR activity, whereas 50 microM Cloretazine caused less than 1% inhibition under the same conditions. Similar results were found using L1210 murine leukemia cells. The disparity between these compounds remained when cells were lysed prior to drug exposure and were partially recapitulated using purified enzyme when 1mM reduced glutathione was included during the drug exposure. The superior antineoplastic potential of Cloretazine compared to BCNU in animal models could be attributed in part to the contribution of the methyl isocyanate, which is synergistic with the co-generated cytotoxic alkylating species, while at the same time unable to significantly inhibit cellular GR.","['Rice, Kevin P', 'Penketh, Philip G', 'Shyam, Krishnamurthy', 'Sartorelli, Alan C']","['Rice KP', 'Penketh PG', 'Shyam K', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Program, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Isocyanates)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '14J2G0U3NQ (laromustine)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carmustine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Reductase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Isocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2005/04/29 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/04/29 09:00'],"['2004/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(05)00140-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2005.02.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2005 May 15;69(10):1463-72. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2005.02.016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported that grape extract could inhibit proteasome activity and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In this study, we examined the flavonoids apigenin, quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin for their proteasome-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing abilities in human tumor cells. We report that apigenin and quercetin are much more potent than kaempferol and myricetin at: (i) inhibiting chymotrypsin-like activity of purified 20S proteasome and of 26S proteasome in intact leukemia Jurkat T cells; (ii) accumulating putative ubiquitinated forms of two proteasome target proteins, Bax and Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappabeta-alpha in Jurkat T cells and (iii) inducing activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in Jurkat T cells. The proteasome-inhibitory abilities of these compounds correlated with their apoptosis-inducing potencies. Results from computational modeling of the potential interactions of these flavonoids to the chymotrypsin site (beta5 subunit) of the proteasome were consistent with the obtained proteasome-inhibitory activities. We found that the C(4) carbon may be a site of nucleophilic attack by the OH group of N-terminal threonine of proteasomal beta5 subunit and that the C(3) hydroxyl may alter the ability of these flavonoids to inhibit the proteasome. Finally, apigenin neither effectively inhibited the proteasome activity nor induced apoptosis in non-transformed human natural killer cells. Our results suggested that the proteasome may be a target of these dietary flavonoids in human tumor cells and that inhibition of the proteasome by flavonoids may be one of the mechanisms responsible for their cancer-preventive effects.","['Chen, Di', 'Daniel, Kenyon G', 'Chen, Marina S', 'Kuhn, Deborah J', 'Landis-Piwowar, Kristin R', 'Dou, Q Ping']","['Chen D', 'Daniel KG', 'Chen MS', 'Kuhn DJ', 'Landis-Piwowar KR', 'Dou QP']","['The Prevention Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, and Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, 640 HWCRC, 4100 John R, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Kaempferols)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '731P2LE49E (kaempferol)', '76XC01FTOJ (myricetin)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apigenin/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors', 'Diet', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kaempferols/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Quercetin/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2005/04/29 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/04/29 09:00'],"['2004/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(05)00138-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2005.02.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2005 May 15;69(10):1421-32. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2005.02.022.,,,,['CA11262/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monoclonal antibodies as well as small tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed and have undergone extensive evaluation in preclinical and clinical studies. Most of these studies have been conceived on the general idea that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a critical role on the growth and survival of human tumors. This assumption has been derived by the successful development of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors in human chronic myeloid leukemia as well as on the activity of antiCD20 monoclonal antibodies in lymphoproliferative disease and of anti HER2 agents in breast tumors overexpressing the targeted antigens. It is now becoming clear that factors regulating sensitivity to kinase inhibitors may differ from monoclonal antibodies and that the molecules targeted by interferring drugs must be prioritaire for growth and survival of those specific tumors in order to achieve valuable results. Recent evidence of major responses to the EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib in tumors harboring activating mutations in the EGFR appears on line with this concept. In this article we will discuss the significance of targeting the EGFR driven survival pathways. Specifically, we will afford the point of EGFR survival signalling prioritization by means of pharmacological treatment. Finally, we will address the role of profiling technologies and of novel computational system biology-based approaches for identification of innovative strategies for effective targeting of EGFR driven survival pathways.","['Tagliaferri, P', 'Tassone, P', 'Blotta, S', 'Viscomi, C', 'Grillone, F', 'Budillon, A', 'Caraglia, M', 'Venuta, S']","['Tagliaferri P', 'Tassone P', 'Blotta S', 'Viscomi C', 'Grillone F', 'Budillon A', 'Caraglia M', 'Venuta S']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Via T.

We now studied if cells at a more advanced stage of transformation were also subject to such microenvironmental control. To accomplish this, 3D human tissues that mimic intraepithelial neoplasia were fabricated by mixing genetically marked (beta-gal), early-stage (II-4 cells) or advanced-stage (SCC13) transformed keratinocytes with normal keratinocytes, and tumor cell fate and phenotype were monitored in organotypic culture and after surface transplantation to nude mice. In vivo, SCC13 cells evaded local growth suppression to undergo connective tissue invasion at significantly lower tumor cell volumes (12:1, 50:1 normal:tumor cells) than II-4 cells. This behavior was explained by the growth suppression of II-4 cells, while advanced-stage tumor cells escaped this control and continued to undergo clonal expansion in mixed cultures to form large, intraepithelial tumor clusters. These communities of tumor cells underwent autonomous growth that was associated with altered expression of markers of differentiation (keratin 1) and cell-cell communication (connexin-43). Furthermore, significantly greater numbers of SCC13 cells expanded into a basal position after low-calcium stripping of suprabasal cells of mixed cultures compared to II-4 cells, suggesting that expansion of these cells enabled tumor cell invasion after transplantation. These findings demonstrated that early tumor development in human stratified squamous epithelium required escape from microenvironmental growth control that was dependent on the transformation stage of intraepithelial tumor cells during the premalignant stage of cancer progression.","['Zhang, Weitian', 'Vaccariello, Michael A', 'Wang, Youai', 'Alt-Holland, Addy', 'Fusenig, Norbert E', 'Garlick, Jonathan A']","['Zhang W', 'Vaccariello MA', 'Wang Y', 'Alt-Holland A', 'Fusenig NE', 'Garlick JA']","['Division of Cancer Biology and Tissue Engineering, Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, Boston, MA 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Progression', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Keratinocytes/*cytology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology/prevention & control', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2005/04/28 09:00,2005/10/20 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21103 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2005 Oct 10;116(6):885-93. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21103.,,,,['DE-11250-06/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, by acridine orange staining of the cells, it was suggested that apicularen A but not apicularen B inhibits vacuolar-type H+-ATPase.","['Hong, Jangja', 'Ishihara, Kenji', 'Zee, Okpyo', 'Ohuchi, Kazuo']","['Hong J', 'Ishihara K', 'Zee O', 'Ohuchi K']","['Laboratory of Pathophysiological Biochemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (apicularen A)', '0 (apicularen B)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Macrolides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Phytotherapy']",2005/04/28 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2005-864095 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2005 Apr;71(4):306-12. doi: 10.1055/s-2005-864095.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Synergistic interaction between FAMP or 2-CdA with cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside, Ara-C) has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies. The current multicenter phase II study was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of induction treatment consisting of 2-CdA (5 mg/m2), Ara-C (2 g/m2), mitoxantrone (MIT, 10 mg/m2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (CLAG-M) in refractory AML. In case of partial remission, a second CLAG-M was administered. Patients in complete remission (CR) received consolidation courses based on high-dose Ara-C and MIT with or without 2-CdA. Forty-three patients from five centers were registered: 25 primary resistant and 18 relapsed. CR was achieved in 21 (49%) patients, 20 (47%) were refractory and 2 (5%) died early. Hematologic toxicity was the most prominent toxicity of this regimen. The overall survival (OS; 1 year) for the 42 patients as a whole and the 20 patients in CR were 43% and 73%, respectively. Disease-free survival (1 year) was 68.6%. None of the analyzed prognostic factors influenced the CR and OS probability significantly. We conclude that CLAG-M regimen has significant antileukemia activity in refractory AML, which seems to be better than the activity of many other regimens.

METHODS: Stable MKP-1 overexpressing transformants of the 697 pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line were created and tested for sensitivity to the GC triamcinolone acetonide (TA) and HU, and compared to a control 697 cell line containing normal MKP-1 expression levels. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were designed to inhibit MKP-1 expression and evaluated for their effect on GC-mediated cell death. RESULTS: MKP-1 overexpression caused a phenotype of partial resistance to HU-induced apoptosis but not to GC-induced apoptosis. Electroporation of siRNAs effectively silenced MKP-1 expression, and increased sensitivity to TA by 9.6+/-1.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Because MKP-1 protects certain tumor cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, its inhibition is being considered as a possible strategy for combination cancer therapy. However, this study suggests that while MKP-1 inhibition may improve the efficacy of DNA damaging agents, it may have only limited utility in combination with glucocorticoids.","['Abrams, Marc T', 'Robertson, Noreen M', 'Litwack, Gerald', 'Wickstrom, Eric']","['Abrams MT', 'Robertson NM', 'Litwack G', 'Wickstrom E']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Thomas Jefferson University, BLSB #219, Philadelphia, PA, 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (DUSP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'F446C597KA (Triamcinolone Acetonide)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1', '*Gene Silencing', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide/*pharmacology']",2005/04/28 09:00,2006/01/06 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2004/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00432-004-0659-3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun;131(6):347-54. doi: 10.1007/s00432-004-0659-3.

Microarray analysis reveals defective induction of p53 target genes and upregulation of chaperone genes.,4559-71,"We have previously demonstrated that c-Myc impairs p53-mediated apoptosis in K562 human leukemia cells, which lack ARF. To investigate the mechanisms by which c-Myc protects from p53-mediated apoptosis, we used K562 cells that conditionally express c-Myc and harbor a temperature-sensitive allele of p53. Gene expression profiles of cells expressing wild-type conformation p53 in the presence of either uninduced or induced c-Myc were analysed by cDNA microarrays. The results show that multiple p53 target genes are downregulated when c-Myc is present, including p21WAF1, MDM2, PERP, NOXA, GADD45, DDB2, PIR121 and p53R2. Also, a number of genes that are upregulated by c-Myc in cells expressing wild-type conformation p53 encode chaperones related to cell death protection as HSP105, HSP90 and HSP27. Both downregulation of p53 target genes and upregulation of chaperones could explain the inhibition of apoptosis observed in K562 cells with ectopic c-Myc. Myc-mediated impairment of p53 transactivation was not restricted to K562 cells, but it was reproduced in a panel of human cancer cell lines derived from different tissues. Our data suggest that elevated levels of Myc counteract p53 activity in human tumor cells that lack ARF. This mechanism could contribute to explain the c-Myc deregulation frequently found in cancer.","['Ceballos, Eva', 'Munoz-Alonso, Maria J', 'Berwanger, Bernd', 'Acosta, Juan C', 'Hernandez, Rafael', 'Krause, Michael', 'Hartmann, Oliver', 'Eilers, Martin', 'Leon, Javier']","['Ceballos E', 'Munoz-Alonso MJ', 'Berwanger B', 'Acosta JC', 'Hernandez R', 'Krause M', 'Hartmann O', 'Eilers M', 'Leon J']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Unidad de Biomedicina-CSIC, Grupo de Biologia Molecular del Cancer, Facultad de Medicina, University of Cantabria, Santander 39011, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular Chaperones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/04/28 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208652 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208652 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Jun 30;24(28):4559-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208652.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, an increased dose of RUNX1 is suggested as a basis for several kinds of leukemias. Amplifications of chromosome 21 or the RUNX1 gene are shown to be associated with leukemias with lymphoid lineage, whereas its involvement in myeloid lineage remains unclear. In this study, we generated GATA-1 promoter-driven Runx1 transgenic (Tg) mice, which showed a transient mild increase of megakaryocyte marker-positive myeloid cells but no spontaneous leukemia. These mice were then crossed with BXH2 mice, which have a replication-competent retrovirus in the mouse and develop myeloid leukemia due to insertional mutagenesis by random integration of the virus. Overexpressed Runx1 transgene in BXH2 mice resulted in shortening of the latency of leukemia with increased frequency of megakaryoblastic leukemia, suggesting that increased Runx1 dosage is leukemogenic in myeloid lineage. Identifications of retroviral integration sites revealed the genetic alterations that may cooperate with Runx1 overdose in myeloid leukemogenesis. This mouse model may be useful for analysing the pathogenesis of myeloid leukemias with RUNX1 overdose, especially to examine whether an extra-copy of RUNX1 by trisomy 21 is causally related to Down's syndrome-related acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL).","['Yanagida, Masatoshi', 'Osato, Motomi', 'Yamashita, Namiko', 'Liqun, Huang', 'Jacob, Bindya', 'Wu, Feng', 'Cao, Xinmin', 'Nakamura, Takuro', 'Yokomizo, Tomomasa', 'Takahashi, Satoru', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki', 'Shigesada, Katsuya', 'Ito, Yoshiaki']","['Yanagida M', 'Osato M', 'Yamashita N', 'Liqun H', 'Jacob B', 'Wu F', 'Cao X', 'Nakamura T', 'Yokomizo T', 'Takahashi S', 'Yamamoto M', 'Shigesada K', 'Ito Y']","['Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta3/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2005/04/28 09:00,2005/07/29 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208675 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208675 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Jun 30;24(28):4477-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208675.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate a direct interaction between several nuclear MLL fusion partners and present evidence for a role of these proteins in histone binding. In two-hybrid studies, ENL interacted with AF4 and AF5q31 as well as with a fragment of AF10. A structure-function analysis revealed that the AF4/AF5q31/AF10 binding domain in ENL coincided with the C-terminus that is essential for transformation by MLL-ENL. The ENL/AF4 association was corroborated by GST-pulldown experiments and by mutual coprecipitation. Both proteins colocalized in vivo in a nuclear speckled pattern. Moreover, AF4 and ENL coeluted on sizing columns together with the known ENL binding partner Polycomb3, suggesting the presence of a multiprotein complex. The overexpression of ENL alone activated a reporter construct and a mutational screen indicated the conserved YEATS domain as essential for this function. Overlay and pulldown-assays finally showed a specific and YEATS domain-dependent association of ENL with histones H3 and H1.

In addition, the use of small molecules against specific cell surface receptors, enzymes, and proteins has become an important strategy in the treatment of such disorders. METHODS: The author reviewed the published clinical trials of monoclonal antibody and other targeted therapies in hematologic malignancies. RESULTS: Results from several trials demonstrate a therapeutic benefit for the use of monoclonal antibodies (either native or conjugated) and other targeted therapies, used alone or in combination with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted therapy of hematologic malignancies seems to be an effective and less toxic approach to the treatment of such disorders. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to determine where and when such management fits into a therapeutic regimen for any given disorder, whether upfront or as salvage therapy, alone or in combination with chemotherapy (concurrent or sequential).","['Kuriakose, Philip']",['Kuriakose P'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI 48202, USA. pkuriak1@hfhs.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/classification/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*trends', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology', 'Radioimmunotherapy']",2005/04/28 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/107327480501200203 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2005 Apr;12(2):82-90. doi: 10.1177/107327480501200203.,,,129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the role of a pro-death Bcl-2 family protein, Bid, in liver tumor development using a neonatal diethylnitrosamine model. Diethylnitrosamine was administrated to 15-day-old wild-type and bid-null mice. The development of microfoci at the early stage and of gross tumors at the later stage was compared between the two groups of mice. Both microfoci and gross tumor development were significantly retarded in the bid-null mice, despite reduced cell death as measured by TUNEL staining. Further studies indicated that there were significantly less proliferating cells in diethylnitrosamine-treated bid-null livers. The regulation of cell proliferation by Bid was confirmed in two other systems not involving carcinogenesis. Hepatocyte proliferation following partial hepatectomy and T lymphocyte proliferation following anti-CD3 stimulation were both retarded in bid-null mice. Thus, these studies revealed a previously undisclosed function of Bid in regulating cell proliferation, which can be important to tumor development. Furthermore, the role of Bid in promoting hepatocarcinogenesis is in contrast to its reported role in suppressing myeloid leukemia and thus suggests an organ- and/or etiology-specific role of the Bcl-2 family proteins in regulating oncogenesis.","['Bai, Li', 'Ni, Hong-Min', 'Chen, Xiaoyun', 'DiFrancesca, Daniell', 'Yin, Xiao-Ming']","['Bai L', 'Ni HM', 'Chen X', 'DiFrancesca D', 'Yin XM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Scaife Hall, 7th Floor, Room S739, 3550 Terrace Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bid protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '3IQ78TTX1A (Diethylnitrosamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Diethylnitrosamine', 'Hepatectomy/methods', 'Hepatocytes/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout']",2005/04/28 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)62368-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62368-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2005 May;166(5):1523-32. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62368-1.,,PMC1606404,,"['R01 CA083817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA 74885/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 83817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This rearrangement fuses the CBFB and MYH11 genes, with the latter encoding the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC). The myeloid transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) is crucial for normal granulopoiesis. Alterations of structure and expression of CEBPA have been implicated in particular subtypes of AML. Here, we found that conditional expression of core-binding factor beta (CBFB)-SMMHC in U937 cells suppresses CEBPA protein expression and binding activity. However, CEBPA mRNA levels remained unchanged. No differences were detected in CEBPA mRNA levels in patients with inv(16) AML-M4Eo (n = 12) compared to patients with AML with a normal karyotype and M4 subtype (n = 6), whereas CEBPA protein and binding activity were significantly reduced in patients with CBFB-SMMHC. Furthermore, calreticulin, an inhibitor of CEBPA translation, was induced on mRNA and protein level in CBFB-SMMHC patients with AML and after expression of CBFB-SMMHC in the U937-cell system. Inhibition of calreticulin by siRNA restored CEBPA levels. Our results suggest that modulation of CEBPA by calreticulin represents a novel mechanism involved in the differentiation block in CBFB-SMMHC AML.","['Helbling, Daniel', 'Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Timchenko, Nikolai A', 'Schardt, Julian', 'Eyer, Myriam', 'Betts, David R', 'Jotterand, Martine', 'Meyer-Monard, Sandrine', 'Fey, Martin F', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Helbling D', 'Mueller BU', 'Timchenko NA', 'Schardt J', 'Eyer M', 'Betts DR', 'Jotterand M', 'Meyer-Monard S', 'Fey MF', 'Pabst T']","['Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital, Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (inv(16) fusion protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics/metabolism', 'Calreticulin/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2005/04/28 09:00,2005/09/20 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53148-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-11-4392 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Aug 15;106(4):1369-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-11-4392.

This particular subnuclear localization of IEX-1 was not observed with a green fluorescent protein-IEX-1 fusion protein lacking a putative nuclear localization sequence, along with a decreased effect on apoptosis. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed a partial co-localization of endogenous promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and IEX-1 in these subnuclear structures. Nuclear localization of IEX-1 is also enhanced upon treatment of cells with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of the nuclear exporter CRM1. These observations indicate that IEX-1 is specifically shuttled to and from the nucleus. Overexpression experiments using PML isoforms III and IV revealed distinct intranuclear interaction of IEX-1 and PML. Coprecipitation experiments showed physical interaction between IEX-1 and PML.

The effect on two cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) and CCRF-CEM (leukaemia) were studied after CHS 828 was administered orally as a single dose or in a 5-day schedule, at different total dose levels. The 5-day schedules were associated with greater effects on both cell lines compared with single doses. A one-compartment pharmacokinetic model, with a half-life of 2.3h and a consecutive zero- and first-order process to describe dissolution and absorption, fit the concentration data. Pharmacokinetics were dose-dependent, as the fraction absorbed decreased with increasing dose. Clearance increased with accumulative exposure. Twenty hours after administration, concentrations started to increase again, probably due to coprophagy. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models characterized the cell growth and cell kill over time and showed that schedule-dependent antitumour effects were present also when the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics were accounted for.

Normalized WT1 expression level (WT1(N)) was determined as a ratio of WT1 to GAPDH times 10(4). RESULTS: The median expression levels of WT1(N) in 17 samples of newly diagnosed patients, 6 samples of relapsed patients, 88 samples from leukemia patient in complete remission and 23 samples of non-leukemic controls were 40.18 (5.48 to 510.27), 125.89 (34.50 to 273.95), 4.80 (0 to 56.96) and 1.47 (0 to 8.56) respectively. Nonparameter statistic analysis (Mann-Whitney U test) showed that the WT1(N) expression levels in the newly diagnosed group and relapsed group were statistically higher than in those in the complete remission group and non-leukemic controls (all P < 0.01), without significant differences between the complete remission group and control group (P = 0.692) and between the newly diagnosed group and relapsed group (P = 0.595). In general, the dynamic curves of WT1(N) levels following allo-BMT were consistent with the tendency of changes in expression levels of corresponding fusion genes for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. Spearman Rho correlation analysis revealed that the correlation coefficient between the WT1(N) expression levels and BCR/ABL, AML/ETO, PML/RARalpha and MLL/AF17 fusion genes expression were 0.678 (P = 0.00), 0.677 (P = 0.00), 0.806 (P = 0.00) and 0.553 (P = 0.049) respectively. Three patients relapsed after allo-BMT and one patient relapsed before allo-BMT during the follow-up. A re-increment of WT1(N) expression level during follow-up could be detected 40 to 180 days earlier to hematological relapse. CONCLUSION: The WT1 expression level of leukemia patients following allo-BMT measured by real time RT-PCR can be a useful tool for monitoring MRD and warning the clinical relapse during follow-up.","['Gu, Wei-Ying', 'Chen, Zi-Xing', 'Hu, Shao-Yan', 'Zhu, Jiang', 'Wang, Zhi-Lin', 'Yan, Feng', 'Wang, Wei', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'Shen, Hui-Ling', 'Qian, Jun']","['Gu WY', 'Chen ZX', 'Hu SY', 'Zhu J', 'Wang ZL', 'Yan F', 'Wang W', 'Cen JN', 'Shen HL', 'Qian J']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,['0 (WT1 Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'WT1 Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2005/04/28 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Feb 23;85(7):444-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: CML cells of the line K561 transcribing a type of b3: a2 mRNA of bcr-abl chimeric gene were cultured. A 21nt siRNA targeting against the chimeric location of the b3: a2 mRNA of bcr-abl chimeric gene was designed, synthesized, and transfected into the K562 cells as RNA interference group. Another K562 cells were transfected with fluorescein enzyme gene specific siRNA as indifferent controls, or with lipid alone as blank vector controls. Some K562 cells without treatment were used as normal controls. 48 hours after the transfection Western blotting was used to detect the expression of P210bcr-abl fusion protein. 3H-TdR incorporation was used to detect the proliferation activity of K562. Annexin V-fluorescencein isothiocyanate (FITC)/phosphatidylinositol (PI) staining was used to detect the apoptosis of K2562 cells. Flow cytometry was used to observe the cell cycle of K562 cells. Benzidine staining was used to detect the differentiation of K562 cells towards erythrocytic series. Western blotting was used further to detect the expression of apoptosis-related protein Bcl-xL/Bax. RESULTS: (1) In contrast with the control groups, the expression level of bcr-abl chimeric gene was much lower in the RNAi group. (2) (3)H-TdR incorporation test showed time-dependent inhibition of proliferation of K562 cells, reflected in decrease of counts per minute (CPM) value in RNAi group 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after siRNA transfection by 33.06%, 52.25%, 57.64%, and 70.87% respectively (F=17.7, P < 0.01). (3) About 43.2% of K562 cells in the RNAi group were apoptotic 48 h after siRNA transfection (F=13.6, P < 0.01). (4) In contrast with the control groups, the expression of apoptosis-associated protein Bcl-xL was greatly down-regulated; however, the expression of Bax protein showed little change. (5) The percentage of benzidine-positive cells in the RNAi group was 23.5% +/- 3.2%, significantly higher than those in the indifferent control group, blank vector group, and normal control group (2.4% +/- 0.3%, 4.5% +/- 0.5%, and 3.6% +/- 0.2% respectively, all P < 0.01), which meant that part of the K562 cells differentiated towards erythrocytic series. (6) The percentage of G1 phase of K561 cells in the RNA1 group was significantly higher than those of the other groups (F = 6.2, P < 0.05), showing a capture in G1-phase of cell cycle. CONCLUSION: The specific siRNA distinctly inhibits the expression of bcr-abl chimeric gene and influences essential biological traits of K562 cells, which will ultimately result in differentiation or apoptosis of K562 cells.","['Wang, Sha', 'Chai, Yu-bo', 'Liu, Fei', 'Zhang, Xiao-yong', 'Jia, Wei', 'Xie, Xin', 'Yu, Wen-qiang', 'Shang, Zhen-chuan', 'Jin, Bo-quan', 'Sun, Bing-zhong']","['Wang S', 'Chai YB', 'Liu F', 'Zhang XY', 'Jia W', 'Xie X', 'Yu WQ', 'Shang ZC', 'Jin BQ', 'Sun BZ']","[""Department of Hematology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/metabolism', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2005/04/28 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Jan 19;85(3):198-202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that in the lineage-related antibodies of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), the sensitivity of CD13 and CD33 was higher (95.5% and 91.2%, respectively), the specificity of them was deficient (72.5% and 62.2%, respectively); the sensitivity of MPO was low (69.1%), but the specificity was high (100%); the sensitivity and specificity of CD117 were high (88.2% and 100%, respectively); the sensitivity of CD14 and CD15 was low (18.4% and 27.2%, respectively); the specificity of CD14 with monocytes was high. As the lineage-related antibodies of B-lineage ALL were concerned, CD19 showed high sensitivity and low specificity (100% vs 83.4%); the sensitivity and specificity of CD79a (96.4% vs 100%) and CD22 (100% vs 100%) were high; the sensitivity and specificity of CD10 (53.6% vs 82.5%) and CD20 (70.4% vs 87.5%) were low.

The results showed that after first extensive amplification in primary culture with rhFlt3-L and rhTPO for 7 days, CD34(+) cells had a total cell number with (77 +/- 5) fold expansion, and DC were (39 +/- 8)% of total cell respectively after induction culture of DC with rhGM-CSF, rhTNF and rhIL-4 for 14 days. Both the amplification of cell number and yield of DC were higher than the system without extensively culture (P < 0.01). Such DC could stimulate T cells to proliferate and kill leukemia cells finally. In conclusion, two-step culture method can obviously improve the cell number of DC required, that is better than inducing them directly. DC derived from CML cells induce the generation of anti-leukemia immunization.","['Ji, Lei', 'Xing, Pei-Ni', 'Wei, Xu-Cang', 'Wang, Tong', 'Li, Mei-Sheng', 'Zhang, Wang-Gang']","['Ji L', 'Xing PN', 'Wei XC', 'Wang T', 'Li MS', 'Zhang WG']","[""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, China. jilei@163.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2005/04/28 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2005)02-0198-07 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Apr;13(2):198-204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The validation of microarray results using independent mRNA quantitation techniques remains a desirable element of any microarray experiment. To facilitate the comparison of microarray expression data between laboratories it is essential that validation methodologies be critically examined. We have assessed the correlation between expression scores obtained for 48 human genes using oligonucleotide microarrays and the expression levels for the same genes measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Correlations with qRT-PCR data were obtained using microarray data that were processed using robust multi-array analysis (RMA) and the MAS 5.0 algorithm. Our results indicate that when identical transcripts are targeted by the two methods, correlations between qRT-PCR and microarray data are generally strong (r = 0.89). However, we observed poor correlations between qRT-PCR and RMA or MAS 5.0 normalized microarray data for 13% or 16% of genes, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the complementarity of oligonucleotide microarray and qRT-PCR technologies for validation of gene expression measurements, while emphasizing the continuing requirement for caution in interpreting gene expression data.","['Dallas, Peter B', 'Gottardo, Nicholas G', 'Firth, Martin J', 'Beesley, Alex H', 'Hoffmann, Katrin', 'Terry, Philippa A', 'Freitas, Joseph R', 'Boag, Joanne M', 'Cummings, Aaron J', 'Kees, Ursula R']","['Dallas PB', 'Gottardo NG', 'Firth MJ', 'Beesley AH', 'Hoffmann K', 'Terry PA', 'Freitas JR', 'Boag JM', 'Cummings AJ', 'Kees UR']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research and Centre for Child Health Research, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia. peterd@ichr.uwa.edu.au""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Software']",2005/04/28 09:00,2006/05/02 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2004/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2164-6-59 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-6-59 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2005 Apr 27;6:59. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-6-59.,20050427,PMC1142514,,['95475/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of the current state of art in the search for new therapeutic agents, the property of selectivity is a mode of action thought to have a high degree of desirability. Consequently there is a growing activity in this area of research. Selectivity is generally a worthy property in a drug because a drug having high selectivity may have a dramatic effect when there is a single agent that can be targeted against the appropriate molecular-driver involved in the pathogenesis of a disease. An example is chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CML has a specific chromosomal abnormality, the Philadelphia chromosome, that results in a single gene that produces an abnormal protein. DISCUSSION: There is a burgeoning understanding of the cellular mechanisms that control the etiology and pathogeneses of diseases. This understanding both enables and motivates the development of drugs that induce a specific action in a selected cell population; i.e., a targeted treatment. Consequently, drugs that can target distinct molecular targets involved in pathologic/pathogenetic processes, or signal-transduction pathways, are being developed. However, in most cases, diseases involve multiple abnormalities. A disease may be associated with more than one dysfunctional protein and these may be out-of-balance with each other. Likewise a drug might strongly target a protein that shares a similar active domain with other proteins. A drug may also target pleiotropic cytokines, or other proteins that have multi-physiological functions. In this way multiple normal cellular pathways can be simultaneously influenced. Long term experience with drugs supposedly designed for only a single target, but which unavoidably involve other functional effects, is uncovering the fact that molecular targeting is not medically flawless. SUMMARY: We contend that an ideal drug may be one whose efficacy is based not on the inhibition of a single target, but rather on the rebalancing of the several proteins or events, that contribute to the etiology, pathogeneses, and progression of diseases, i.e., in effect a promiscuous drug. Ideally, if this could be done at minimum drug concentration, side effects could be minimized. Corollaries to this argument are that the growing fervor for researching truly selective drugs may be imprudent when considering the totality of responses; and that the expensive screening techniques used to discover these, may be both medically and financially inefficient.","['Mencher, Simon K', 'Wang, Long G']","['Mencher SK', 'Wang LG']","['The NYU Cancer Institute, New York University School of Medicine, Manhattan VA Hospital, 18003 W, 423 East 23rd Street, NY, NY 10010, USA. skm123@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,BMC Clin Pharmacol,BMC clinical pharmacology,101088667,"['0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)']",IM,"['Drug Delivery Systems/*methods/trends', 'Drugs, Investigational/*administration & dosage', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/*administration & dosage', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2005/04/28 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/04/28 09:00'],"['2004/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['1472-6904-5-3 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6904-5-3 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Clin Pharmacol. 2005 Apr 26;5:3. doi: 10.1186/1472-6904-5-3.,20050426,PMC1090568,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although individual components of FE have antioxidant, antiestrogenic, immunostimulant and antitumor properties, in vitro evidence of anticancer activity for the herbal tea itself is still lacking. We studied the antiproliferative effect of FE on MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer, and Jurkat and K562 leukemia cell lines. We found that FE significantly inhibited the proliferation of both breast and leukemia cells in vitro only at high concentrations, with 50% inhibition of MDA-MB-468 cells at about 1[sol ]20 dilution, Jurkat cells at about 1[sol ]10 dilution and MCF7 and K562 cells at less than 1[sol ]10 dilution. Flow cytometry analysis showed that treatment with a high concentration of FE induced G2[sol ]M arrest in MCF7 and Jurkat cells, with also an increased SubG0[sol ]G1 fraction in MCF7 cells. MDA-MB-468 cells showed a significantly increased Sub G0[sol ]G1 fraction after treatment with 1[sol ]10 dilution of FE while the cell cycle of K562 was unaffected. When MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were treated with a combination of FE with either paclitaxel or cisplatin, results showed that only the combination of 1[sol ]20 dilution of FE with 0.5 microM cisplatin resulted in a small but significantly higher MCF7 cell survival than 0.5 microM cisplatin treatment alone. FE at 1[sol ]20 and 1[sol ]50 dilutions did not affect the antiproliferative properties of these two commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. The results suggest that FE at high concentrations show differential inhibitory effect on different human cancer cell lines.

However, the risk for specific cancer sites and variations in risk by treatment and STS histology remain unclear. METHODS: The study evaluated 1499 children (age < 18 years) who survived for > or = 1 year after they were diagnosed with STS and who were reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-based cancer registries from 1973 to 2000. RESULTS: Twenty-seven children developed 28 subsequent primary malignancies, compared with 4.5 expected malignancies based on general population rates (observed-to-expected [O/E] ratio = 6.3 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.2-9.1). The risk of developing a subsequent malignancy was increased among children with rhabdomyosarcoma (observed = 11 malignancies; O/E ratio = 7.7), fibromatous neoplasms (observed = 9 malignancies; O/E ratio = 5.8), and other specified STS (observed = 7 malignancies; O/E ratio = 6.5). Initial therapy with radiation and chemotherapeutic agents was associated with a significantly higher risk of second malignancies compared with surgery alone (O/E ratio = 15.2 vs. 1.4; P < 0.0001). Elevated risks were observed for acute myeloid leukemia, cutaneous melanoma, female breast cancer, and sarcomas of the bone and soft tissue, with generally higher risks among patients who initially received combined modality therapy. Excess cancers of the oral cavity were prominent among long-term survivors. For several children, the pattern of multiple malignancies was consistent with a genetic syndrome, particularly neurofibromatosis type 1 and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of second malignancies was increased for all histologic types of childhood STS and was particularly high among patients who received combined modality therapy.","['Cohen, Randi J', 'Curtis, Rochelle E', 'Inskip, Peter D', 'Fraumeni, Joseph F Jr']","['Cohen RJ', 'Curtis RE', 'Inskip PD', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Sarcoma/*therapy', '*Survivors']",2005/04/27 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/04/27 09:00'],"['2005/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21040 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Jun 1;103(11):2391-6. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21040.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Protein expression of p73, p15, and p57Kip2 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray (TMA) platform. The TMA was constructed using pretreatment bone marrow biopsy specimens from 64 adult patients with ALL. Protein expression was then correlated with DNA methylation and relevant clinical biologic characteristics. RESULTS: p73 protein expression was observed in 19 (30%) patients, cytoplasmic p15 in 19 (31%), and p57 in 40 (70%). Three patients (5%) had expression of all three proteins, 16 (29%) of two proteins, 31 (55%) of one protein, and six (11%) of zero proteins. An inverse association was observed between p73 DNA methylation and protein expression (P = .003). This effect was not observed for either p15 or p57Kip2. Expression of any of the proteins studied was not associated with any distinct biologic characteristic. By multivariate analysis, expression of p57Kip2, cytoplasmic p15, or a combination of p57Kip2 with either p15 or p73 was associated with a better overall survival (P < .001, .04, and .03 respectively).

METHODS: Cultured human RPE cells were infected with adenovirus encoding either mutant inhibitory (I)-kappaB or beta-galactosidase and treated with TNF-alpha for various times. Freshly prepared RPE/choroid and RPE samples were isolated from human donor eyes. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry were used to determine survival factor gene expression, cellular protein levels, and localization, respectively. RESULTS: Multiple survival factor genes, including cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (c-IAP1), c-IAP2, TNF receptor-associated factor-1 (TRAF-1), TRAF-2, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-x, A1, and cellular Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), were expressed in basal conditions in both cultured RPE cells and RPE cells in situ, whereas survivin was expressed only by cultured cells. TNF-alpha upregulated expression of TRAF-1, TRAF-2, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, c-FLIP, and A1. TRAF-1, c-FLIP, and to a lesser extent c-IAP2 protein levels were increased by TNF-alpha in a time-dependent manner, whereas c-IAP1, survivin, Bcl-x(L), and TRAF-2 protein levels were not influenced by TNF-alpha treatment at any time point tested. In contrast, Bcl-2 and A1 proteins were not detected under basal conditions or after TNF-alpha treatment. Overexpression of mutant IkappaB blocked TNF-alpha-induced TRAF-1, TRAF-2, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, c-FLIP, and A1 gene expression and downregulated TRAF-1 protein levels. TRAF-1 and Bcl-x(L) proteins were localized diffusely in RPE cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple RPE cell survival factors are expressed by human RPE cells. TNF-alpha regulates expression of some of these factors in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner, whereas others are not influenced by NF-kappaB. RPE cell survival factors may protect RPE cells from apoptosis normally and in diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).","['Yang, Ping', 'Wiser, Jessica L', 'Peairs, James J', 'Ebright, Jessica N', 'Zavodni, Zachary J', 'Bowes Rickman, Catherine', 'Jaffe, Glenn J']","['Yang P', 'Wiser JL', 'Peairs JJ', 'Ebright JN', 'Zavodni ZJ', 'Bowes Rickman C', 'Jaffe GJ']","['Departments of Ophthalmology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', 'Pigment Epithelium of Eye/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/04/27 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/04/27 09:00'],"['2005/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['46/5/1755 [pii]', '10.1167/iovs.04-1039 [doi]']",ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2005 May;46(5):1755-64. doi: 10.1167/iovs.04-1039.,,,,"['R01 EY011286/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY 05722/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY 11286/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY 9106/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Longitudinal study (July 1999-January 2002) of 37 paediatricians and 181 parents of patients (children aged 1-17 years) with cystic fibrosis admitted for a pneumonia or patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphatic leukaemia, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or asthma. Main outcome measure was percentage agreement on the attributes of the HUI3 between parents and paediatricians. RESULTS: Differences in perception of health and wellbeing between paediatricians and parents of children with a chronic disease were found, not only at diagnosis but also after a period of follow up. Differences were particularly clear in the subjective attributes emotion (range of agreement 28-68%) and pain/discomfort (range of agreement 11-33%). In all patient groups, at baseline and follow up, the paediatrician assessed the patient to have less pain/discomfort in comparison to the parents. Despite a prolonged patient- paediatrician relationship, differences at follow up did not decrease compared to baseline. CONCLUSION: At the onset of a chronic disease, but also after a period of follow up, quality of life of paediatric patients may be misunderstood by healthcare professionals, especially in the subjective attributes. Systematic assessment of quality of life may contribute to better understanding between physicians and parents.","['Janse, A J', 'Sinnema, G', 'Uiterwaal, C S P M', 'Kimpen, J L L', 'Gemke, R J B J']","['Janse AJ', 'Sinnema G', 'Uiterwaal CS', 'Kimpen JL', 'Gemke RJ']","[""Department of Paediatrics, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Arthritis, Juvenile/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Asthma/psychology/rehabilitation', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Cystic Fibrosis/complications/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Emotions', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Pain Measurement', 'Parents/*psychology', '*Pediatrics', 'Perception', 'Pneumonia/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/psychology/rehabilitation', '*Quality of Life']",2005/04/27 09:00,2005/05/26 09:00,['2005/04/27 09:00'],"['2005/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['90/5/486 [pii]', '10.1136/adc.2004.051722 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2005 May;90(5):486-91. doi: 10.1136/adc.2004.051722.,,PMC1720390,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such modification, histone methylation, contributes to human cancer through deregulation of cancer-relevant genes. The yeast Dot1 and its human counterpart, hDOT1L, methylate lysine 79 located within the globular domain of histone H3. Here we report that hDOT1L interacts with AF10, an MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) fusion partner involved in acute myeloid leukemia, through the OM-LZ region of AF10 required for MLL-AF10-mediated leukemogenesis. We demonstrate that direct fusion of hDOT1L to MLL results in leukemic transformation in an hDOT1L methyltransferase activity-dependent manner. Transformation by MLL-hDOT1L and MLL-AF10 results in upregulation of a number of leukemia-relevant genes, such as Hoxa9, concomitant with hypermethylation of H3-K79. Our studies thus establish that mistargeting of hDOT1L to Hoxa9 plays an important role in MLL-AF10-mediated leukemogenesis and suggests that the enzymatic activity of hDOT1L may provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","['Okada, Yuki', 'Feng, Qin', 'Lin, Yihui', 'Jiang, Qi', 'Li, Yaqiang', 'Coffield, Vernon M', 'Su, Lishan', 'Xu, Guoliang', 'Zhang, Yi']","['Okada Y', 'Feng Q', 'Lin Y', 'Jiang Q', 'Li Y', 'Coffield VM', 'Su L', 'Xu G', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXA7 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT10 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/04/27 09:00,2005/06/01 09:00,['2005/04/27 09:00'],"['2004/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2005/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0092-8674(05)00186-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2005 Apr 22;121(2):167-78. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2005.02.020.,,,,"['AI04840704/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI5380402/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA119133-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM68804/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM63076/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Cell. 2005 Jun 3;121(5):809'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) originates from dysregulated hematopoietic progenitors, the Notch system may be involved in the abnormal growth. We previously reported that AML cells express Notch proteins. In this study, we examined the effects of recombinant human Notch ligand proteins, Jagged1 and Delta1, on the growth and differentiation of primary AML cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML cells separated from blood from 12 patients were cultured in wells coated with Jagged1, Delta1, or control IgG. The short-term growth was evaluated using a colorimetric assay. The self-renewal capacity was evaluated by the clonogenic cells recovered, which were obtained via a colony assay involving cells cultured with the ligands or control IgG. Differentiation was evaluated by the morphology of the cultured cells and flow cytometric analysis. RESULTS: The ligand stimulation caused three types of response in the short-term growth of the primary AML cells, namely, promotion, suppression, or no significant effect. The self-renewal capacity was suppressed or not significantly affected by the ligands, even in cells showing short-term growth promotion. The ligand stimulation altered blast cells into macrophage-like cells from their morphology and increased the expression of differentiation markers such as CD13 or CD14 in some samples. CONCLUSIONS: The Notch ligands had diverse effects on the short-term growth of primary AML cells. The ligands did not promote the self-renewal capacity of any of the cells examined and instead tended to induce differentiation under the conditions used.","['Tohda, Shuji', 'Kogoshi, Hanae', 'Murakami, Naomi', 'Sakano, Seiji', 'Nara, Nobuo']","['Tohda S', 'Kogoshi H', 'Murakami N', 'Sakano S', 'Nara N']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan. tohda.mlab@tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG1 protein, human)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)', '0 (delta protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Signal Transduction']",2005/04/27 09:00,2005/06/28 09:00,['2005/04/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2005/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00085-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.01.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 May;33(5):558-63. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.01.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether a member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins, PKC-delta, is activated during treatment of BCR-ABL cells with IFN-alpha and participates in the induction of interferon responses. METHODS: Immunoblots and immune complex kinase assays were performed to study the phosphorylation and activation of PKC-delta in response to IFN-alpha in CML-derived cell lines. The effects of pharmacological inhibition of PKC-delta on the suppressive effects of IFN-alpha on leukemic CFU-GM progenitors from CML patients were assessed by clonogenic assays in methylcellulose. RESULTS: IFN-alpha treatment of the sensitive CML-derived KT-1 cell line resulted in phosphorylation of PKC-delta and activation of its kinase domain. Such phosphorylation/activation of PKC-delta was required for phosphorylation of Stat1 on serine 727, as inhibition of PKC-delta activity blocked the IFN-alpha-dependent serine phosphorylation of Stat1 and IFN-alpha-inducible gene transcription. IFN-alpha treatment strongly inhibited leukemic CFU-GM progenitor colony formation from bone marrow or peripheral blood of patients with CML, and such inhibition was reversed by concomitant treatment of the cells with the PKC-delta pharmacologic inhibitor rottlerin. CONCLUSION: Taken altogether, our data demonstrate that PKC-delta plays a critical role in Type I IFN signaling in BCR-ABL expressing cells, acting as a serine kinase for Stat1, to regulate transcriptional activation of interferon-regulated genes and induction of antileukemic responses.","['Kaur, Surinder', 'Parmar, Simrit', 'Smith, Jessica', 'Katsoulidis, Efstratios', 'Li, Yongzhong', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Majchrzak, Beata', 'Uddin, Shahab', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Fish, Eleanor N', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Kaur S', 'Parmar S', 'Smith J', 'Katsoulidis E', 'Li Y', 'Sassano A', 'Majchrzak B', 'Uddin S', 'Tallman MS', 'Fish EN', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

In previous studies, we found significant telomere shortening in Ph+ cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Interestingly, imatinib treatment was found to lead to a normalization of previously shortened telomere length in CML patients. Based on recent reports demonstrating that c-ABL phosphorylates hTERT and thereby inhibits hTERT activity, a direct effect of imatinib on hTERT activity leading to telomere elongation in BCR-ABL-positive cells has been proposed by others. Such an effect could be of potential importance for telomere maintenance in Ph+ cells by facilitating clonal selection and progression of the disease to blast crisis. METHODS: We investigated the impact of imatinib on telomere length and telomerase activity of the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine pro-B cell line BaF3 and the BCR-ABL-positive, IL-3-independent transfectant BaF3p185 in vitro. RESULTS: When BaF3 and BaF3p185 cells were treated with imatinib (the latter being rescued with IL-3), no effect on either telomerase activity or telomere length was observed. These findings can be explained by the cytoplasmatic localization of BCR-ABL found in BaF3p185 as compared to the nuclear localization of telomerase (and c-ABL). CONCLUSION: As opposed to recent reports for c-ABL, we do not see evidence for a functional interaction between BCR-ABL and hTERT in this model system arguing against imatinib-mediated upregulation of hTERT as a crucial factor for clonal selection and disease progression of CML.","['Hartmann, Ulrike', 'Balabanov, Stefan', 'Ziegler, Patrick', 'Fellenberg, Jorg', 'van der Kuip, Heiko', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Lipp, Hans-Peter', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Hartmann U', 'Balabanov S', 'Ziegler P', 'Fellenberg J', 'van der Kuip H', 'Duyster J', 'Lipp HP', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Kanz L', 'Brummendorf TH']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Culture Media', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', '*Telomere']",2005/04/27 09:00,2005/06/28 09:00,['2005/04/27 09:00'],"['2004/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2005/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00090-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.02.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 May;33(5):542-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.02.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most studies show that they accelerate myeloid recovery, regardless of whether they are instituted on day 0 or day 10 after transplant. However, this does not correlate with an improvement in the outcome. One disadvantage is that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis is associated with slower platelet engraftment due to an increase in platelet aggregation. There is also no agreement as regards the value of G-CSF given as prophylaxis after ASCT, the effects on graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), and the survival rate. A large retrospective study from Europe showed that patients with acute leukemia who received bone marrow from HLA-identical siblings and were treated with G-CSF ran a higher risk of acute and chronic GVHD and transplant-related mortality, while the survival and the leukemia-free survival rates were reduced. In contrast, a meta-analysis of 18 small studies showed no evidence of an increase in acute and chronic GVHD, using G-CSF as prophylaxis after ASCT. Two studies from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research showed contradictory data. When G-CSF is given to the recipient as prophylaxis, the levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor-alpha increase, which aggravates GVHD. When it is given to the donor, G-CSF polarizes T cells to produce T-helper cell-2 cytokines, which reduce GVHD after transplantation. G-CSF has no effect on relapse. Available findings suggest that there is no indication to use G-CSF as prophylaxis after ASCT.","['Ringden, Olle T H', 'Le Blanc, Katarina', 'Remberger, Mats']","['Ringden OT', 'Le Blanc K', 'Remberger M']","['Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation and Division of Clinical Immunology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.

Inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway with a selective inhibitor (e.g., LY294002, or wortmannin) in leukemic cells markedly potentiated fludarabine-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt downstream target mTOR by rapamycin also significantly enhanced fludarabine-induced apoptosis. The co-treatment of fludarabine/LY294002 resulted in significant attenuation in the levels of both phospho-Erk1/2 and phospho-Akt, as well as a marked increase in the level of phospho-JNK. The broad spectrum caspase inhibitor BOC-D-fmk markedly blocked fludarabine/LY-induced apoptosis, had no effect on cytochrome c release to the cytosol, and did abrogate caspase and PARP cleavage. This indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction is upstream of the caspase cascade. Moreover, constitutive activation of the MEK/Erk pathway completely blocked apoptosis induced by the combination of fludarabine/LY294002. Additionally, either constitutive activation of Akt or blockage of the JNK pathway significantly diminished apoptosis induced by the combination. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that inactivation of MAPK, Akt, and activation of the JNK pathway contributes to the induction of apoptosis induced by fludarabine/LY. Comparatively, MAPK inactivation plays a crucial role in fludarabine/LY-induced apoptosis. These results also strongly suggest that combining fludarabine with an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for hematological malignancies.","['Yu, C', 'Mao, X', 'Li, W X']","['Yu C', 'Mao X', 'Li WX']","['College of Life Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'U937 Cells', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2005/04/27 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/04/27 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(05)00705-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.03.182 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Jun 3;331(2):391-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.03.182.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) and their modified forms have been shown to inhibit bacterial gene expression, representing a potential for developing highly specific and efficacious antibacterial agents. In this study, a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible, randomized single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) expression library was constructed and screened for conditional growth-defective or lethal phenotypes in an Escherichia coli system. From approximately 5000 transformants screened, 12 bacterial colonies were identified with either growth-defective or lethal phenotypes. One clone, CY01, with a lethal phenotype was selected and sequenced, and the ODN sequence that it generates was designated as RBL-1. Because RBL-1 shows no significant homologies to any bacterial gene sequence, a potential RBL-1 targeting protein was isolated by affinity purification. Using mass spectrometry analysis, this protein was identified as bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP). RBL-1 was further shown to effectively inhibit RNA polymerase activity in vitro. The usage of this randomized ssDNA expression library screening technology to selectively modulate production and/or function of proteins may provide a powerful strategy in both identifying novel gene targets for antibiotic discovery and developing novel antibacterial agents.","['Tan, Xin-Xing', 'Chen, Yin']","['Tan XX', 'Chen Y']","['Cytogenix, Inc., 3100 Wilcrest Drive, Suite 140, Houston, Texas 77042, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA, Bacterial/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology/genetics/growth & development', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/*genetics', 'Gene Library', 'Gene Targeting/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Tetracycline/chemistry']",2005/04/27 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/04/27 09:00'],"['2005/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi0475626 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2005 May 3;44(17):6708-14. doi: 10.1021/bi0475626.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the expression of the UPA-R on bone marrow (BM) cells of 93 patients with acute myeloid leukemia at first diagnosis and 8 healthy probands as controls by FACS analysis using phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies. A case was defined as UPA-R-positive (UPA-R+) if >20% of the gated cells expressed UPA-R. Whereas none of the 8 healthy BM samples was positive for the UPA-R, 32 (34%) of the 93 AML samples were UPA-R+. Expression of UPA-R was heterogeneous in different FAB types, however, with the highest expression rates in monocytic subtypes (FAB M4/M5): 18%/19%/30% of UPA-R+ cases were found in M1/M2 or M3, and 58%/80% of cases with M4 or M5 were UPA-R+. Proportions of UPA-R+ cells varied between 1% and 98% of the mononuclear cell fractions, with the highest proportions in M4/M5 subtypes (on average 27%/40% UPA-R+ cells) and the lowest expression in AML M2 (11% UPA-R+ cells). The density of expressed UPA-R, estimated as mean channel fluorescence activity, was highest in cases with AML M1 (mFI: 124) followed by M4 and M5 (mFI: 78/77) and lowest in AML M2 (mFI: 43). In sAML, higher proportions of UPA-R+ cases (8 of 18; 44%) compared to pAML (24 of 75; 32%) were found as well as higher proportions of UPA-R+ cells (27% vs. 19%). Separating our patients' cohort in cytogenetic risk groups, we could not detect significant differences in the UPA-R expression profiles. For evaluations of the clinical course of AML, only patients treated by the AML-CG protocol (n = 65) were included. In the group of patients who did not respond to AML-CG therapy, significantly higher proportions of UPA-R+ cells (31% vs. 14%, P = 0.0015, t-test) were found. By evaluating a cut-off value for the percentage of positive cells that allows the most significant separation and differentiation between cases with shorter or longer relapse-free survival times, we could show that patients with >26.5% UPA-R-positive cells were characterized by a significantly higher risk for relapse compared to cases with <26.5% positive cells (P = 0.05). In summary, our data show a high expression of the UPA-R in AML, especially in (myelo)monocytoid subtypes. Cases with higher proportions of UPA-R+ cells were characterized by a significant lower remission rate after AML-CG therapy and a higher risk for relapse. Although prospective trials are still lacking, UPA-R is a prognostically relevant factor independent from the karyotype. UPA-R positivity may identify subtypes of AML associated with a more aggressive clinical course. Thus due to lower remission probabilities in UPA-R+ cases, a more intensive induction therapy regimen could be considered.","['Graf, Michaela', 'Reif, Susanne', 'Hecht, Karin', 'Pelka-Fleischer, Renate', 'Pfister, Karin', 'Schmetzer, Helga']","['Graf M', 'Reif S', 'Hecht K', 'Pelka-Fleischer R', 'Pfister K', 'Schmetzer H']","['Medical Department III, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator']",2005/04/26 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/04/26 09:00'],"['2005/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20337 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2005 May;79(1):26-35. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20337.,,,,,,,"['2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we scanned for mutations in the exons 4, 5, 6, and 7 of p73, as well as methylation of the CpG island in the untranslated region of exon 1, in 100 de novo AML patients. Four patients showed mutation in exon 5 and one in exon 6, and none of the patients showed mutation in exons 4 and 7. None of the patients showed p73 gene methylation. The expression level of p73 mRNA was also examined in 40 AML samples using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Only six AML patients showed p73 mRNA expression, as analyzed by RT-PCR analysis. However, p73 over-expression in 30% of patients was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. Further, mutation of p73 has been correlated with p73 mRNA and p73 protein status. The results show the presence of over-expressed p73 mRNA and protein in the samples with mutated p73 gene. Thus, it is presumed that mutation of p73 might lead to production of defective p73 protein and p73 mRNA, and this might have a role in the process of leukemogenesis of AML.

Design and setting The United Kingdom childhood cancer study (UKCCS) is a large population based case-control study of childhood cancer across 10 regions of the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 6305 children (aged 2-14 years) without cancer; 3140 children with cancer (diagnosed 1991-6), of whom 1286 had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Day care and social activity during the first year of life were used as proxies for potential exposure to infection in infancy. RESULTS: Increasing levels of social activity were associated with consistent reductions in risk of ALL; a dose-response trend was seen. When children whose mothers reported no regular activity outside the family were used as the reference group, odds ratios for increasing levels of activity were 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.87) for any social activity, 0.62 (0.51 to 0.75) for regular day care outside the home, and 0.48 (0.37 to 0.62) for formal day care (attendance at facility with at least four children at least twice a week) (P value for trend < 0.001). Although not as striking, results for non-ALL malignancies showed a similar pattern (P value for trend < 0.001). When children with non-ALL malignancies were taken as the reference group, a significant protective effect for ALL was seen only for formal day care (odds ratio = 0.69, 0.51 to 0.93; P = 0.02). Similar results were obtained for B cell precursor common ALL and other subgroups, as well as for cases diagnosed above and below age 5 years. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that reduced exposure to infection in the first few months of life increases the risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Gilham, C', 'Peto, J', 'Simpson, J', 'Roman, E', 'Eden, T O B', 'Greaves, M F', 'Alexander, F E']","['Gilham C', 'Peto J', 'Simpson J', 'Roman E', 'Eden TO', 'Greaves MF', 'Alexander FE']","['Cancer Research UK Epidemiology and Genetics Unit, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton SM2 5NG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child Day Care Centers/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child, Preschool', 'Communicable Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Behavior', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2005/04/26 09:00,2005/06/24 09:00,['2005/04/26 09:00'],"['2005/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['bmj.38428.521042.8F [pii]', '10.1136/bmj.38428.521042.8F [doi]']",ppublish,BMJ. 2005 Jun 4;330(7503):1294. doi: 10.1136/bmj.38428.521042.8F.

By microarrays, we compared the effect of nuclear PLCbeta1 overexpression with that of PLC M2b cytoplasmatic mutant, which is exclusively located in the cytoplasm, in murine erythroleukemia cells. Out of 9000 genes analyzed, the CD24 gene, coding for an antigen involved in differentiation and hematopoiesis as well, was up-regulated in cells overexpressing nuclear PLCbeta1 as compared with both cells overexpressing the M2b cytoplasmatic mutant and the wild type cells. Here we show that nuclear PLCbeta1 up-regulated the expression of CD24. The correlation was strengthened by the observation that when PLCbeta1 expression was silenced by means of small interfering RNA, CD24 expression was down-regulated. We also demonstrated that PLCbeta1-dependent up-modulation of CD24 was mediated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level, in that PLCbeta1 affected the CD24 promoter activity. Moreover, the up-regulation of CD24 was higher during erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells. Altogether our findings, obtained by combining microarrays, phenotypic analysis, and small interfering RNA technology, identify CD24 as an molecular effector of nuclear PLCbeta1 signaling pathway in murine erythroleukemia cells and strengthen the contention that nuclear PLCbeta1 constitutes a key step in erythroid differentiation in vitro.","['Fiume, Roberta', 'Faenza, Irene', 'Matteucci, Alessandro', 'Astolfi, Annalisa', 'Vitale, Marco', 'Martelli, Alberto Maria', 'Cocco, Lucio']","['Fiume R', 'Faenza I', 'Matteucci A', 'Astolfi A', 'Vitale M', 'Martelli AM', 'Cocco L']","['Department of Anatomical Sciences, Cellular Signaling Laboratory, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Plcb1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'DNA Primers', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phospholipase C beta', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/04/26 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/04/26 09:00'],"['2005/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)67481-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M411833200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Jun 24;280(25):24221-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M411833200.

To identify appropriate time points for the gene expression analysis, the dynamics of loss of pluripotency were investigated using three functional assays: chimeric mouse formation, embryoid body generation, and colony-forming ability. A rapid loss of pluripotency was detected within 24 hours, with very low residual activity in all assays by 72 hours. Gene expression profiles of undifferentiated ESCs and ESCs cultured for 18 and 72 hours in the absence of LIF were determined using the Affymetrix GeneChip U74v2. In total, 473 genes were identified as significantly differentially expressed, with approximately one third having unknown biological function. Among the 275 genes whose expression decreased with ESC differentiation were several factors previously identified as important for, or markers of, ESC pluripotency, including Stat3, Rex1, Sox2, Gbx2, and Bmp4. A significant number of the decreased genes also overlap with previously published mouse and human ESC data.

DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and samples were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified for 5 short tandem repeat (STR) loci (TH01, VWA31, FES/FPS, F13A01, and SE33) and for one variable number of tandem repeats locus (D1S80). Samples were run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in an automated ALFexpress sequencer. In all 36 donor-recipient pairs we found differences for at least two STR loci. In most cases the difference was observed for SE33 and D1S80 loci. Mixed chimerism (MC) was detected in 18 patients: 4 with unrelated BMT and 14 with related sibling donors. In 11 patients MC was detected in the early period after BMT, but was soon followed by full donor chimerism (FDC) in peripheral blood. In 5 cases patients MC appearing after FDC was established, and was predictive for the relapse. One patient showed alternating MC and FDC, but at the end showed only recipient cells and graft rejection. In conclusion, the PCR-STR analysis is a highly informative, fast, and simple screening method for monitoring chimerism in a BMT program.","['Grubic, Z', 'Stingl, K', 'Cecuk-Jelicic, E', 'Zunec, R', 'Serventi Seiwerth, R', 'Labar, B', 'Rajic, Lj', 'Brkljacic-Kerhin, V']","['Grubic Z', 'Stingl K', 'Cecuk-Jelicic E', 'Zunec R', 'Serventi Seiwerth R', 'Labar B', 'Rajic Lj', 'Brkljacic-Kerhin V']","['National Referral Organ Transplantation and Tissue Typing Centre, University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia. zgrubic@kbc-zagreb.hr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/genetics/surgery', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/mortality', 'Child', 'Croatia', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/surgery', 'Lymphoma/genetics/surgery', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/surgery', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Chimera/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/26 09:00,2005/09/27 09:00,['2005/04/26 09:00'],"['2005/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-1345(05)00029-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transproceed.2005.01.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplant Proc. 2005 Mar;37(2):1388-91. doi: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2005.01.022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our knowledge of the targets for LIF and the consequences of its absence is still very incomplete. In this study, we have examined the ultrastructure of the potential implantation site in LIF-null MF1 female mice compared to that of wild type animals. We also compared expression of proteins associated with implantation in luminal epithelium and stroma. Luminal epithelial cells (LE) of null animals failed to develop apical pinopods, had increased glycocalyx, and retained a columnar shape during the peri-implantation period. Stromal cells of LIF-null animals showed no evidence of decidual giant cell formation even by day 6 of pregnancy. A number of proteins normally expressed in decidualizing stroma did not increase in abundance in the LIF-null animals including desmin, tenascin, Cox-2, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and -7, and Hoxa-10. In wild type animals, the IL-6 family member Oncostatin M (OSM) was found to be transiently expressed in the luminal epithelium on late day 4 and then in the stroma at the attachment site on days 5-6 of pregnancy, with a similar but not identical pattern to that of Cox-2. In the LIF-null animals, no OSM protein was detected in either LE or stroma adjacent to the embryo, indicating that expression requires uterine LIF in addition to a blastocyst signal. Fucosylated epitopes: the H-type-1 antigen and those recognized by lectins from Ulex europaeus-1 and Tetragonolobus purpureus were enhanced on apical LE on day 4 of pregnancy. H-type-1 antigen remained higher on day 5, and was not reduced even by day 6 in contrast to wild type uterus. These data point to a profound disturbance of normal luminal epithelial and stromal differentiation during early pregnancy in LIF-nulls. On this background, we also obtained less than a Mendelian ratio of null offspring suggesting developmental failure.","['Fouladi-Nashta, A A', 'Jones, C J P', 'Nijjar, N', 'Mohamet, L', 'Smith, A', 'Chambers, I', 'Kimber, S J']","['Fouladi-Nashta AA', 'Jones CJ', 'Nijjar N', 'Mohamet L', 'Smith A', 'Chambers I', 'Kimber SJ']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, 3.239 Stopford Building, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Female', 'Glycosylation', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Uterus/*metabolism/*ultrastructure']",2005/04/26 09:00,2005/07/09 09:00,['2005/04/26 09:00'],"['2004/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2005/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-1606(05)00074-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.01.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2005 May 1;281(1):1-21. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.01.033.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Graft-versus-host reactions are capable of accelerating the clearance of isohemagglutinins. Whether immunogenicity of the A- and B-antigen is important in this process is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of 807 patients from three centers were screened for patients with major or bidirectionally ABO-mismatched donors. Clinical data and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion support were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 158 patients with major or bidirectionally mismatched donors were identified. After major mismatched HPCT, patients with anti-A directed against the donor blood group required RBC transfusion support for a median of 109 days (range, 0-324 days) compared to 21 days (range, 2-98 days) for patients with anti-B directed against donor blood group (log-rank test, p = 0.0001). Other risk factors associated with prolonged RBC transfusion support in univariate analysis were age (p = 0.024), cytomegalovirus infection (p = 0.016), hemolytic anemia (p = 0.027), and chronic bleeding disorders (p = 0.038). The independent influence of donor blood group and recipient age were confirmed in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the immunogenicity of the ABO antigen plays an important role for the kinetics of erythroid engraftment after ABO-mismatched HPCT.","['Schetelig, Johannes', 'Breitschaft, Astrid', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Zabelina, Tatjana', 'Ebell, Wolfram', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Haack, Astrid', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Salama, Abdulgabar', 'Siegert, Wolfgang']","['Schetelig J', 'Breitschaft A', 'Kroger N', 'Zabelina T', 'Ebell W', 'Bornhauser M', 'Haack A', 'Ehninger G', 'Salama A', 'Siegert W']","['Medical Department I, University Hospital Carl Gustay Carus, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*immunology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Blood Grouping and Crossmatching', 'Blood Transfusion/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/transplantation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",2005/04/26 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/04/26 09:00'],"['2005/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF04236 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2005.04236.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2005 May;45(5):779-87. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2005.04236.x.,,,,,,,,,,,['Cooperative Transplantations Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,

It is widely accepted that the plasma membrane is a target of cytotoxins, but the mechanism of their action remains obscure. Using the confocal spectral imaging technique, we show for the first time that cytotoxins from cobra venom penetrate readily into living cancer cells and accumulate markedly in lysosomes. Cytotoxins CT1 and CT2 from Naja oxiana, CT3 from Naja kaouthia and CT1 from Naja haje are demonstrated to possess this property with respect to human lung adenocarcinoma A549 and promyelocytic leukaemia HL60 cells. Immobilized plasma membrane binding accompanies the internalization of CT3 from Naja kaouthia in the HL60 cells, but it is very weak for other cytotoxins. Detectable membrane binding is not a property of any of the cytotoxins tested in A549 cells. The kinetics and concentration-dependence of cytotoxin accumulation in lysosomes correlate well with their cytotoxic effects. On the basis of the results obtained, we propose that lysosomes are a primary target of the lytic action of cytotoxins.

High levels of Mcl-1 may correlate with unfavourable clinical outcome. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to determine the biologic significance and the prognostic value of the protein Mcl-1 in a group of patients with rectal cancer using immunohistochemical staining in archival specimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression of the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 was determined in 23 rectal malignancies. Half of the patients with rectal cancer were treated with preoperative short-term radiation therapy of 25 Gy followed by radical surgery; the other patients were treated just with radical surgery. Differences in Mcl-1 expression between irradiated and non-irradiated rectal cancer cells were analysed immunohistochemically, and Mcl-1 expression was correlated with overall survival. Induction of Mcl-1 expression by irradiation versus control in colorectal cancer cells was detected using Western blot. RESULTS: Mcl-1 was expressed at high levels in 35% of all specimens. Significantly stronger expression was detected in specimens of irradiated rectal cancer compared with non-irradiated tissues (p-value: 0.005). No association was seen between marker expression patterns and clinicopathological data of the respective patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that irradiated rectal cancer produces significantly higher levels of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 than non-irradiated rectal carcinoma. The data also suggest that the high level of Mcl-1 was induced by the radiotherapy. As Mcl-1 is an antiapoptotic regulator, its over-expression in irradiated rectal cancer could constitute a detrimental development antagonizing the potential benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy. Further evaluation of the correlation between Mcl-1 expression and overall survival seems warranted.","['Ulrich-Pur, Herbert', 'Erovic, Boban M', 'Soleiman, Afschin', 'Jech, Barbara', 'Pennwieser, Wolfgang', 'Czembirek, Cornelia', 'Zielinski, Christoph C', 'Thurnher, Dietmar']","['Ulrich-Pur H', 'Erovic BM', 'Soleiman A', 'Jech B', 'Pennwieser W', 'Czembirek C', 'Zielinski CC', 'Thurnher D']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Vienna University Medical School, Vienna, Austria. herbert.ulrich-pur@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics as Topic']",2005/04/26 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/04/26 09:00'],"['2005/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00508-004-0278-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2005 Feb;117(4):136-40. doi: 10.1007/s00508-004-0278-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Incubation of K562 cells with LPA, progesterone, ZK112,933 and RU486 significantly induced the expression of glycodelin protein and messenger RNA. The addition of RU486 to LPA activated cells markedly reduced expression of glycodelin. Addition of ZK112,993, an antiprogestin without antioxidant properties, to LPA activated cells did not reduce glycodelin. Histiocytes in leiomyoma and myometrium co-localize with glycodelin.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of MNNG on the growth of a U937 human leukemia cell model. The effects of this compound were also tested on cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. Treatment of U937 cells with MNNG resulted in the inhibition of viability and the induction of apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, which was associated with a dose-dependent upregulation in pro-apoptotic Bax protein, downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins, and proteolytic activation of caspase-3 protease. Furthermore, MNNG decreased the levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression without significant changes in the levels of COX-1, which was correlated with inactivation of the reporter construct of a COX-2 promoter and decrease in prostaglandin E2 synthesis. Taken together, these findings provide important new insights into the possible molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer activity of MNNG.","['Park, Cheol', 'Choi, Byung Tae', 'Kang, Kwang Il', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu', 'Cheong, Jaehun', 'Lee, Won Ho', 'Kim, Nam Deuk', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Park C', 'Choi BT', 'Kang KI', 'Kwon TK', 'Cheong J', 'Lee WH', 'Kim ND', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Oriental Medicine, , Dongeui University Graduate School, Busan 614-052, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 1)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase 1', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis']",2005/04/23 09:00,2005/09/20 09:00,['2005/04/23 09:00'],"['2005/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['00001813-200506000-00006 [pii]', '10.1097/00001813-200506000-00006 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2005 Jun;16(5):507-13. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200506000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Bcr-Abl-transfected HL60 (HL/Bcr-Abl) cells, procaspase-9 was increased and partially processed. The Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib (Gleevec, STI-571) released the apoptotic stream. Also, HL/Bcr-Abl cells were hyper-sensitive to geldanamycin (GA), which depletes Bcr-Abl and Raf-1. Raf-1 and Bcr-Abl-transfected FDC-P1 hematopoietic cells were selectively sensitive to GA and imatinib, respectively. Remarkably, cell clones with high levels of Bcr-Abl that could not be depleted by GA were relatively resistant to both GA and imatinib. GA and flavopiridol sensitized such resistant cells to imatinib. These data suggest bi-phasic sensitivity to mechanism-based therapeutic agents. Although Bcr-Abl renders cells hyper-sensitive, an excess of Bcr-Abl results in resistance (due to the remaining activity). We discuss therapeutic approaches to overcome bi-phasic resistance to mechanisms-based agents.","['Demidenko, Zoya N', 'An, Won G', 'Lee, John T', 'Romanova, Larisa Y', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Blagosklonny, Mikhail V']","['Demidenko ZN', 'An WG', 'Lee JT', 'Romanova LY', 'McCubrey JA', 'Blagosklonny MV']","['Brander Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinones)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Benzoquinones', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Models, Biological', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Piperidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",2005/04/23 09:00,2006/03/28 09:00,['2005/04/23 09:00'],"['2005/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1702 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.4.4.1702 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2005 Apr;4(4):484-90. doi: 10.4161/cbt.4.4.1702.

We report here that PEP005 also has potent antileukemic effects, inducing apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells at nanomolar concentrations. Of importance, PEP005 did not induce apoptosis in normal CD34+ cord blood myeloblasts at up to 2-log concentrations higher than those required to induce cell death in primary AML cells. The effects of PEP005 were PKC dependent, and PEP005 efficacy correlated with expression of PKC-delta. The delta isoform of PKC plays a key role in apoptosis and is therefore a rational potential target for antileukemic therapies. Transfection of KG1a leukemia cells, which did not express PKC-delta or respond to PEP005, with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-PKC-delta restored sensitivity to induction of apoptosis by PEP005. Our data therefore suggest that activation of PKC-delta provides a novel approach for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and that screening for PKC-delta expression may identify patients for potential responsiveness to PEP005.","['Hampson, Peter', 'Chahal, Hema', 'Khanim, Farhat', 'Hayden, Rachel', 'Mulder, Anneke', 'Assi, Lakhvir Kaur', 'Bunce, Christopher M', 'Lord, Janet M']","['Hampson P', 'Chahal H', 'Khanim F', 'Hayden R', 'Mulder A', 'Assi LK', 'Bunce CM', 'Lord JM']","['MRC Centre for Immune Regulation, Division of Immunity and Infection, The Medical School, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (3-ingenyl angelate)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Esters)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Esters/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/04/23 09:00,2005/09/20 09:00,['2005/04/23 09:00'],"['2005/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53147-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-10-4117 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Aug 15;106(4):1362-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-10-4117.

Based on three independent experiments, Act upregulated the expression of 34 genes involved in cell growth, adhesion, signaling, immune responses (including interleukin-8 [IL-8] production), and apoptosis. We verified the upregulation of 14 genes by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR and confirmed Act-induced production of IL-8 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on supernatants from nonpolarized and polarized HT-29 cells. Maximal production of IL-8 in response to Act required the presence of intracellular calcium, since chelation of calcium with BAPTA-AM significantly reduced Act-induced IL-8 production in HT-29 cells. We also examined activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis of apical side-treated polarized HT-29 cells, Act induced phosphorylation of p38, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. In addition, KinetWorks proteomics screening of whole-cell lysates revealed Act-induced phosphorylation of cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB), c-Jun, adducin, protein kinase C, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and decreased phosphorylation of protein kinase Balpha, v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (i.e., Raf1), and STAT1.

The objective was to investigate the differences in perception of quality of life between parents of chronically ill children and pediatricians. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in four tertiary pediatric care centers in The Netherlands. The Health Utilities Index mark 3 (HUI3) was used by 37 pediatricians and 279 parents of patients (children aged 1 to 17 years) with cystic fibrosis admitted either in daycare or for a pneumonia, or patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or asthma. RESULTS: Differences in perception of quality of life between parents and pediatricians appeared to be dependent of the disease. In patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (OR 7.4; [95% CI 2.88-18.97], juvenile idiopathic arthritis (4.7; [95% CI 2.00-11.22]), and asthma (2.3; [95% CI 1.13-4.69]) a difference in perception was more likely to occur than in patients with cystic fibrosis admitted in daycare. CONCLUSION: At the onset of a chronic disease, the parents of pediatric patients may be misunderstood by health care professionals, especially in subjective attributes. Assessment of quality of life may contribute to better understanding between pediatricians and parents, and thus may even enhance compliance and treatment effects.","['Janse, A J', 'Uiterwaal, C S P M', 'Gemke, R J B J', 'Kimpen, J L L', 'Sinnema, G']","['Janse AJ', 'Uiterwaal CS', 'Gemke RJ', 'Kimpen JL', 'Sinnema G']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Epidemiol,Journal of clinical epidemiology,8801383,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Arthritis, Juvenile/physiopathology/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Asthma/physiopathology/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Cognition', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cystic Fibrosis/physiopathology/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Locomotion/physiology', 'Male', 'Pain/physiopathology', 'Parents/*psychology', '*Pediatrics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/physiopathology/psychology/rehabilitation', '*Quality of Life', '*Social Perception', 'Speech/physiology']",2005/04/23 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/04/23 09:00'],"['2004/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2004/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0895-4356(05)00018-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Epidemiol. 2005 May;58(5):495-502. doi: 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.09.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the effect of ATO on human lung carcinoma PG cells in vitro. We found ATO significantly inhibited the proliferation of PG cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. ATO-induced apoptosis of PG cells was confirmed by the observance of typical morphological changes and detected by the analysis of flow cytometry (FCM). ATO significantly inhibited Bcl-2 and Pgp expression of PG cells by SABC immunohistochemistry and FCM analysis. In conclusion, our findings indicated that ATO induced apoptosis of PG cells and down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Pgp expressions, and these data might provide some theoretical basis for its clinical use in treating lung carcinoma.","['Han, Bo', 'Zhou, Gengyin', 'Zhang, Qinghui', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Wang, Xiaojuan', 'Tang, Weihua', 'Kakudo, Kennichi']","['Han B', 'Zhou G', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhang J', 'Wang X', 'Tang W', 'Kakudo K']","['Department of Pathology, Shandong University, Jinan city, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Ther Oncol,Journal of experimental therapeutics & oncology,9604933,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2005/04/23 09:00,2005/06/07 09:00,['2005/04/23 09:00'],"['2005/04/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Ther Oncol. 2004 Dec;4(4):335-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its clinical activity and minimal toxicity are related to specific inhibition of cellular targets including BCR-ABL, platelet-derived growth factor receptor and c-kit kinases, resulting in the collapse of downstream signaling cascades important for transformation. In some patients, unexpected toxicities arise that are not associated with inhibition of any known cellular imatinib target. In this report, we investigated the effects of imatinib on squamous carcinoma cell signaling. Imatinib induced expression of COX-2 in a dose-dependent manner with concomitant accumulation of prostaglandin E2. COX-2 induction by imatinib was initiated through epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase activation and downstream signaling through mitogenic-activated protein kinase. COX-2 induction by imatinib was blocked by MEK1 or EGF receptor inhibition. Imatinib did not activate stressor cytokine-signaling pathways (p38 kinase, nuclear factor-kB nuclear translocation) or affect COX-1 expression. Imatinib failed to activate EGF receptor signals in other tumor types, suggesting that COX-2 induction in imatinib-treated cells is mediated through release of autocrine factors expressed or activated in squamous tumors. COX-2 induction by imatinib in squamous tumors derived from the head and neck region is unique with respect to other target-specific agents and may represent one of the unintended toxic effects of imatinib described in some patients.","['Johnson, Faye M', 'Yang, Peiying', 'Newman, Robert A', 'Donato, Nicholas J']","['Johnson FM', 'Yang P', 'Newman RA', 'Donato NJ']","['Department of Thoracic and Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas M.

This pattern of GH production yields a dynamic state between a low baseline and intervening peaks, posing a challenge for the clinician attempting to understand the 'true GH status' in a specific patient. This pulsatile pattern is maintained throughout the day, but there are clear differences between different segments of the day, with approximately two-thirds of the total daily secretion produced at night. The dynamic nature of GH production has led many investigators to suggest that when evaluating short stature, parameters of spontaneous GH production be applied rather than the GH response to artificial stimulation. GH secretory patterns in healthy control populations are compared to those in patients with several conditions seen by the pediatric endocrinologist (classical GH deficiency, GH neurosecretory dysfunction, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hypothyroidism, small for gestational age, Russell-Silver syndrome, constitutional delay of growth and puberty and Fanconi's anemia) and variables used for analysis of these patterns are described.

Transcriptional signatures correlating with clinical subtypes/primary genetic changes were identified and annotated based on their biological/molecular properties and chromosomal localization. Furthermore, the expression profile of tyrosine kinase-encoding genes was investigated, identifying several differentially expressed members, segregating with primary genetic changes, which may be targeted with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

We first examined the inducing effect of myeloma cells on migration of human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Five myeloma cell lines produced varying amounts of VEGF, and migration of HUVECs was induced by coculture with myeloma cells. We next examined the inhibitory effect of a novel synthetic retinoid Am80 (Tamibarotene) on both myeloma cells and HUVECs. Am80 is specific for the retinoic-acid receptor-alpha/beta, and has therapeutic effects in all-trans retinoic acid resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia. Am80 slightly inhibited the growth of both myeloma cells and HUVECs, and remarkably inhibited the growth of HUVECs stimulated by VEGF. Am80 showed little growth inhibition of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), but it markedly inhibited migration of HUVECs by cocultured myeloma cells. Am80 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor. In addition, VEGF-induced formation of tube-like structures in vitro and neovascularization in mouse corneas were significantly inhibited by Am80. These findings clearly demonstrate that Am80 is a potential inhibitor of angiogenesis caused by the interaction between vascular endothelial cells and myeloma cells, and might be a useful therapeutic agent against MM.","['Sanda, T', 'Kuwano, T', 'Nakao, S', 'Iida, S', 'Ishida, T', 'Komatsu, H', 'Shudo, K', 'Kuwano, M', 'Ono, M', 'Ueda, R']","['Sanda T', 'Kuwano T', 'Nakao S', 'Iida S', 'Ishida T', 'Komatsu H', 'Shudo K', 'Kuwano M', 'Ono M', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Molecular Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya 467-8601, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '08V52GZ3H9 (tamibarotene)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoates/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cornea/*blood supply/pathology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Retinoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/pharmacology']",2005/04/22 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/04/22 09:00'],"['2005/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403754 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403754 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jun;19(6):901-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403754.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism of this inhibition is not clear. In the present study, we observed that NF-kappaB transcriptional activity as well as cell growth decreased significantly in HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines in the presence of ATRA. Furthermore, we observed that ATRA reduced HTLV-1 proviral DNA, HTLV-1 genes (gag, tax, or pol mRNA) using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. SIL-2R was reduced by ATRA in both protein level (culture supernantant) and mRNA level in HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines. Interestingly, ATRA significantly inhibited RT activity similar to azidothimidine (AZT) in HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines. Moreover, AZT inhibited proviral DNA but not NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, and sIL-2R on HTLV-1; however, ATRA inhibited of NF-kappaB, proviral DNA and sIL-2R on HTLV-1. These results suggested that the decrease in sIL-2R induced by ATRA may be caused by the actions of a NF-kappaB inhibitor acting on the NF-kappaB/sIL-2R signal pathway. These results suggested that ATRA could have two roles, as a NF-kappaB inhibitor and as an RT inhibitor.","['Yamaguchi, T', 'Maeda, Y', 'Ueda, S', 'Hijikata, Y', 'Morita, Y', 'Miyatake, J-i', 'Matsuda, M', 'Kanamaru, A']","['Yamaguchi T', 'Maeda Y', 'Ueda S', 'Hijikata Y', 'Morita Y', 'Miyatake JI', 'Matsuda M', 'Kanamaru A']","['Department of Hematology, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka 589-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics', 'Genes, pX/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/growth & development', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Solubility', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Viral Load']",2005/04/22 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/04/22 09:00'],"['2005/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403760 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403760 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jun;19(6):1010-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403760.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of NK cell-triggering receptor expression has been so far restricted to only NKp46 and NKp30 in Macaca fascicularis. In this study, we extended the molecular and functional characterization to the various NK cell-triggering receptors using PBMC and to the in vitro-derived NK cell populations by cytofluorometry and by cytolytic activity assays. In addition, RT-PCR strategy, cDNA cloning/sequencing, and transient transfections were used to identify and characterize NKp80, NKG2D, CD94/NKG2C, and CD94/NKG2A in M. fascicularis and Macaca mulatta as well as in the signal transducing polypeptide DNAX-activating protein DAP-10. Both M. fascicularis and M. mulatta NK cells express NKp80, NKG2D, and NKG2C molecules, which displayed a high degree of sequence homology with their human counterpart. Analysis of NK cells in simian HIV-infected M. fascicularis revealed reduced surface expression of selected NK cell-triggering receptors associated with a decreased NK cell function only in some animals. Overall surface density of NK cell-triggering receptors on peripheral blood cells and their triggering function on NK cell populations derived in vitro was not decreased compared with uninfected animals. Thus, triggering NK cell receptor monitoring on macaque NK cells is possible and could provide a valuable tool for assessing NK cell function during experimental infections and for exploring possible differences in immune correlates of protection in humans compared with cynomolgus and rhesus macaques undergoing different vaccination strategies.","['Biassoni, Roberto', 'Fogli, Manuela', 'Cantoni, Claudia', 'Costa, Paola', 'Conte, Romana', 'Koopman, Gerrit', 'Cafaro, Aurelio', 'Ensoli, Barbara', 'Moretta, Alessandro', 'Moretta, Lorenzo', 'De Maria, Andrea']","['Biassoni R', 'Fogli M', 'Cantoni C', 'Costa P', 'Conte R', 'Koopman G', 'Cafaro A', 'Ensoli B', 'Moretta A', 'Moretta L', 'De Maria A']","['Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HCST protein, human)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRC2 protein, human)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRF1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*metabolism/virology', 'Lectins, C-Type/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/genetics/*immunology/metabolism']",2005/04/22 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/04/22 09:00'],"['2005/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/9/5695 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.9.5695 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 May 1;174(9):5695-705. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.9.5695.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AJ426429', 'GENBANK/AJ426430', 'GENBANK/AJ554300', 'GENBANK/AJ554301', 'GENBANK/AJ554302', 'GENBANK/AJ585526', 'GENBANK/AJ585527', 'GENBANK/AJ585528', 'GENBANK/AJ585529', 'GENBANK/AJ585530', 'GENBANK/AJ585531', 'GENBANK/AJ622828']",,,,,,

Previous studies reported the binding of soluble FcepsilonRIalpha to membrane IgE exposed on B cells. In this study, the functional interaction between human membrane IgE and human FcepsilonRI is presented. Four different IgE versions were expressed in mouse B cell lines, namely: a truncation at the Cepsilon2-Cepsilon3 junction of membrane IgE isoform long, membrane IgE isoform long (without Igalpha/Igbeta BCR accessory proteins), and both epsilonBCRs (containing membrane IgE isoforms short and long). All membrane IgE versions activated a rat basophilic leukemia cell line transfected with human FcepsilonRI, as detected by measuring the release of both preformed and newly synthesized mediators. The interaction led also to Ca(2+) responses in the basophil cell line, while membrane IgE-FcepsilonRI complexes were detected by immunoprecipitation. FcepsilonRI activation by membrane IgE occurs in an Ag-independent manner. Noteworthily, human peripheral blood basophils and monocytes also were activated upon contact with cells bearing membrane IgE. In humans, the presence of FcepsilonRI in several cellular entities suggests a possible membrane IgE-FcepsilonRI-driven cell-cell dialogue, with likely implications for IgE homeostasis in physiology and pathology.","['Vangelista, Luca', 'Soprana, Elisa', 'Cesco-Gaspere, Michela', 'Mandiola, Paola', 'Di Lullo, Giulia', 'Fucci, Rita N', 'Codazzi, Franca', 'Palini, Alessio', 'Paganelli, Giovanni', 'Burrone, Oscar R', 'Siccardi, Antonio G']","['Vangelista L', 'Soprana E', 'Cesco-Gaspere M', 'Mandiola P', 'Di Lullo G', 'Fucci RN', 'Codazzi F', 'Palini A', 'Paganelli G', 'Burrone OR', 'Siccardi AG']","['Department of Biology and Genetics, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. vangelista.luca@hsr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (SRS-A)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Basophils/immunology/metabolism', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive/immunology', 'CHO Cells', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Communication/immunology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism/physiology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, IgE/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'SRS-A/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Time Factors']",2005/04/22 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/04/22 09:00'],"['2005/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/9/5602 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.9.5602 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 May 1;174(9):5602-11. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.9.5602.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice lacking T cells expressing these TCRVbeta, we demonstrate that alternative TCRVbeta can substitute for the lack of the dominant TCRVbeta in the H-2-restricted M-MuLV Ag recognition. We show that, at least for the H-2(b)-restricted response, the shift of TCR usage is not related to a variation of the immunodominant M-MuLV epitope recognition. After virus immunization, all the potentially M-MuLV-reactive lymphocytes are primed, but only the deletion of dominant Vbeta rescues the alternative Vbeta response. The mechanism of clonal T cell ""immunodomination"" that guides the preferential Vbeta expansion is likely the result of a proliferative advantage of T cells expressing dominant Vbeta, due to differences in TCR affinity and/or cosignal requirements. In this regard, a CD8 involvement is strictly required for the virus-specific cytotoxic activity of CTL expressing alternative, but not dominant, Vbeta gene rearrangements. The ability of T cells expressing alternative TCRVbeta rearrangements to mediate tumor protection was evaluated by a challenge with M-MuLV tumor cells. Although T cells expressing alternative Vbeta chains were activated and expanded, they were not able to control tumor growth in a long-lasting manner due to their incapacity of conversion and accumulation in the T central memory pool.","['Facchinetti, Antonella', 'Dalla Santa, Silvia', 'Mezzalira, Silvio', 'Rosato, Antonio', 'Biasi, Giovanni']","['Facchinetti A', 'Dalla Santa S', 'Mezzalira S', 'Rosato A', 'Biasi G']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/biosynthesis/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Graft Rejection/*immunology/virology', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology/prevention & control', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology/prevention & control']",2005/04/22 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/04/22 09:00'],"['2005/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/9/5398 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.9.5398 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 May 1;174(9):5398-406. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.9.5398.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unknown whether telomerase activity is increased in association with activation and proliferation of NK cells. We found that telomerase activity in a human NK cell line (NK-92), which requires IL-2 for proliferation, was increased within 24 h after stimulation with IL-2. Levels of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA and protein correlated with telomerase activity. ERK1/2 and Akt kinase (Akt) were activated by IL-2 stimulation. LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, abolished expression of hTERT mRNA and protein expression and abolished hTERT activity, whereas PD98059, which inhibits MEK1/2 and thus ERK1/2, had no effect. In addition, radicicol, an inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), and rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), blocked IL-2-induced hTERT activity and nuclear translocation of hTERT but not hTERT mRNA expression. hTERT was coimmunoprecipitated with Akt, Hsp90, mTOR, and p70 S6 kinase (S6K), suggesting that these molecules form a physical complex. Immunoprecipitates of Akt, Hsp90, mTOR, and S6K from IL-2-stimulated NK-92 cells contained telomerase activity. Furthermore, the findings that Hsp90 and mTOR immunoprecipitates from primary samples contained telomerase activity are consistent with the results from NK-92 cells. These results indicate that IL-2 stimulation induces hTERT activation and that the mechanism of IL-2-induced hTERT activation involves transcriptional or posttranslational regulation through the pathway including PI3K/Akt, Hsp90, mTOR, and S6K in NK cells.","['Kawauchi, Kiyotaka', 'Ihjima, Kimiko', 'Yamada, Osamu']","['Kawauchi K', 'Ihjima K', 'Yamada O']","[""Department of Medicine, Daini Hospital, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Arakawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kD, polypeptide 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'I60EH8GECX (monorden)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Macrolides', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*immunology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*immunology']",2005/04/22 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/04/22 09:00'],"['2005/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/9/5261 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.9.5261 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 May 1;174(9):5261-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.9.5261.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists on lymphoma risk and characteristics is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess expected rates and relative risks of haematopoietic malignancies, especially those associated with TNF antagonists, in large population based cohorts of patients with RA. METHODS: A population based cohort study was performed of patients with RA (one prevalent cohort (n = 53,067), one incident cohort (n = 3703), and one TNF antagonist treated cohort 1999 through 2003 (n = 4160)), who were linked with the Swedish Cancer Register. Additionally, the lymphoma specimens for the 12 lymphomas occurring in patients with RA exposed to TNF antagonists in Sweden 1999 through 2004 were reviewed. RESULTS: Study of almost 500 observed haematopoietic malignancies showed that prevalent and incident patients with RA were at increased risk of lymphoma (SIR = 1.9 and 2.0, respectively) and leukaemia (SIR = 2.1 and 2.2, respectively) but not of myeloma. Patients with RA treated with TNF antagonists had a tripled lymphoma risk (SIR = 2.9) compared with the general population. After adjustment for sex, age, and disease duration, the lymphoma risk after exposure to TNF antagonists was no higher than in the other RA cohorts. Lymphomas associated with TNF antagonists had characteristics similar to those of other RA lymphomas. CONCLUSION: Overall, patients with RA are at equally increased risks for lymphomas and leukaemias.

A case-control study of lymphoma risk in polymyalgia rheumatica/giant cell arteritis.,1765-8,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate increased risks of malignant lymphomas among individuals treated with corticosteroids, but have not taken into account the underlying reasons for steroid use, so the increased risks might be attributable to the underlying disease or concomitant treatments other than steroids. Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis, GCA) are common inflammatory conditions treated with steroids as single immunosuppressive therapy, but data on lymphoma risk in GCA/PMR are limited. OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of lymphoma associated with steroid treatment of GCA/PMR. METHODS: The association between GCA/PMR and malignant lymphomas (overall, and separately for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and chronic lymphatic leukaemia) was examined in a nationwide, population based, case-control study of 42,676 lymphoma cases and 78,487 matched population controls, using prospectively recorded data on lymphomas from the Swedish cancer register 1964-2000 and data on pre-lymphoma hospital admissions for GCA/PMR from the Swedish inpatient register 1964-2000. Odds ratios (OR) associated with a pre-lymphoma hospital admission for GCA/PMR were calculated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: 153 lymphoma cases and 345 population controls had a history of GCA/PMR, resulting in an overall OR for malignant lymphomas of 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.98). The OR varied little with lymphoma type, sex, age, and calendar period. The OR for GCA was 0.67 (0.48 to 0.98) and for PMR, 0.83 (0.67 to 1.04).

DESIGN: Markov cohort analysis and first-order Monte Carlo microsimulation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Direct medical costs were measured from the perspective of a third-party payer. Efficacy data and probabilities were obtained from survivability findings, most of which were derived from randomized controlled trials. We employed a 2-year time horizon with 3-month treatment cycles. The comparator was BMT with a matched unrelated donor, and the base case was defined as a 35-year-old, Ph(+) man with newly diagnosed CML. The Monte Carlo microsimulation indicated that the incremental cost:efficacy ratio was -$5000 for imatinib (95% confidence interval -$70,000-84,000). Analysis of the cost-efficacy plane revealed that imatinib was dominant over BMT in 84.69% of cases, whereas BMT dominated imatinib in 0.76% of cases. Trade-offs were warranted in the remaining cases. Sensitivity analyses of costs and discount rates found these results to be generally robust. CONCLUSION: In most cases, imatinib was both less costly and more efficacious than BMT in the 2-year treatment of CML. Results of this investigation should be viewed in the context of emerging long-term clinical data. These data are necessary to assess cost-efficacy beyond the short-term time horizon of this study.","['Skrepnek, Grant H', 'Ballard, Erin E']","['Skrepnek GH', 'Ballard EE']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, and the Center for Health Outcomes and PharmacoEconomic Research, Tucson, Arizona 85721, USA. skrepnek@pharmacy.arizona.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*economics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Insurance, Health, Reimbursement/economics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*economics/therapy', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Piperazines/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*economics/therapeutic use']",2005/04/22 09:00,2005/05/19 09:00,['2005/04/22 09:00'],"['2005/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1592/phco.25.3.325.61593 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2005 Mar;25(3):325-34. doi: 10.1592/phco.25.3.325.61593.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we found that 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induced cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), but not COX-1, protein expression in HL-60 cells, and the addition of arachidonic acid (AA) in the presence or absence of TPA significantly reduced the viability of HL-60 cells, an effect that was blocked by adding the COX inhibitors, NS398 and aspirin. The AA metabolites, PGD(2) and PGJ(2), but not PGE(2) or PGF(2alpha), reduced the viability of the human HL60 and Jurkat leukemia cells according to the MTT assay and LDH release assay.

This response was here investigated using human myeloid leukemia cells. Cisplatin stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and caused apoptosis in U-937 promonocytic cells, an effect which was attenuated by the MEK/ERK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126. While ERK1/2 activation was a general phenomenon, irrespective of the used cell type or antitumour drug, the MEK/ERK inhibitors only reduced cisplatin toxicity in human myeloid cells (THP-1, HL-60 and NB-4), but not in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages and NRK-52E rat renal tubular cells; and failed to reduce the toxicity etoposide, camptothecin, melphalan and arsenic trioxide, in U-937 cells. U0126 attenuated cisplatin-DNA binding and intracellular peroxide accumulation, which are important regulators of cisplatin toxicity. Although cisplatin decreased the intracellular glutathione (GSH) content, which was restored by U0126, treatments with GSH-ethyl ester and dl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine revealed that GSH does not regulate cisplatin toxicity in the present experimental conditions. In spite of it, PD98059 and U0126 reduced the intracellular accumulation of cisplatin. These results suggest that GSH-independent modulation of drug transport is a major mechanism explaining the anti-apoptotic action of MEK/ERK inhibitors in cisplatin-treated myeloid cells.","['Amran, Donna', 'Sancho, Patricia', 'Fernandez, Carlos', 'Esteban, Diego', 'Ramos, Adrian M', 'de Blas, Elena', 'Gomez, Milagros', 'Palacios, Maria A', 'Aller, Patricio']","['Amran D', 'Sancho P', 'Fernandez C', 'Esteban D', 'Ramos AM', 'de Blas E', 'Gomez M', 'Palacios MA', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, CSIC.

Although LIF has been shown to stimulate muscle cell proliferation, its precise role in differentiation is unclear. Thus, we examined the effect of LIF on the differentiation of cultured C2C12 myoblast cells. In this study, we used both non-glycosylated LIF expressed in bacteria and glycosylated LIF secreted from NIH3T3 cells infected with Ad-LIF. Both non-glycosylated and glycosylated LIF blocked differentiation of myoblasts as measured by expression of myosin heavy chain and myotube formation. Treatment of myoblasts with LIF induced phosphorylation of ERK, and the LIF-induced inhibitory effect on myogenesis was blocked by pretreatment with U0126, a specific MEK inhibitor, and transient transfection with dominant negative (DN)-MEK1. In contrast, although LIF activated STAT3, the LIF-induced repression of the MCK transcriptional activity was not reversed by pretreatment with AG490, a specific Jak kinase inhibitor or transient transfection with DN-STAT3. Additionally, LIF exhibited its inhibitory effect on myogenesis only when cells were treated at earlier than 12 h after inducing differentiation.

However, the results of electrophysiological studies are rather controversial and the functional impact of cytoskeleton assembly-disassembly on stretch-activated channel properties remains unclear. Here, the possible involvement of cytoskeletal elements in the regulation of stretch-activated Ca2+-permeable channels was studied in human leukaemia K562 cells with the use of agents that selectively modify the actin or tubulin system. F-actin disassembly resulted in a considerable reduction of the amplitude of stretch-activated currents without significant change in channel open probability. The effects of treatments with cytochalasins or latrunculin were principally similar, developed gradually and consisted a strong decrease of single channel conductance. Microtubule disruption did not affect stretch-activated channels. The data presented here are in principal agreement with the general conclusion that mechanosensitive channel functions are largely dependent on the integrity of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Specifically, changes in conductive properties of the pore may provide an essential mechanism of channel regulation underlying functional modulation of membrane currents. Our results allow one to speculate that microfilament organization may be an important determinant in modulating biophysical characteristics of stretch-activated cation channels in cells of blood origin.","['Staruschenko, Alexander', 'Negulyaev, Yuri A', 'Morachevskaya, Elena A']","['Staruschenko A', 'Negulyaev YA', 'Morachevskaya EA']","['Institute of Cytology RAS, 4 Tikhoretsky Ave., St. Petersburg 194064, Russia. starushchenk@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidines)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', 'LW7U308U7U (latrunculin B)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Thiazolidines']",2005/04/22 09:00,2005/07/13 09:00,['2005/04/22 09:00'],"['2004/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2005/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0005-2736(05)00055-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamem.2005.02.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2005 May 15;1669(1):53-60. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamem.2005.02.013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A co-cultured system of monocytes and endothelial cells was established through addition of THP-1 to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in various rates. After 24 hours, the changes in activity and expression of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in the co-culture system were studied by zymography and reverse zymography. The 1:1 co-culture system was selected and one control group (no pravastatin added) and experimental groups (with concentration of pravastatin being 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 micromol/ml respectively) were studied. All groups were cultured for another 24 hours and analyzed in the same way. RESULTS: Compared to the single cultured HUVECs, the activity of proMMP-2 in the co-cultured system increased by 2.09, 2.46 and 2.07 folds respectively (number = 8, P < 0.01). There was also activated MMP-2 secretion in the co-culture system. The secretion of proMMP-2 and active MMP-2 in the 1:1 co-cultured system was most obvious. After pravastatin treatment, the activity of proMMP-2 and MMP-2, decreased significantly (number = 8, P < 0.01). MMP-2 secretion was completely suppressed after 1.0 micromol/ml pravastatin treatment. Reverse zymography revealed that, compared to the single culture HUVECs or THP-1, the secretion of TIMP-2 decreased in the co-cultured system, regardless of the ratio of mixture.

METHODS: THP-1 monocytes were incubated with HCY, with and without NF-kappaB inhibitor pyrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) pretreatment. Northern blot analysis and flow cytometry were used to detect MIP-1alpha mRNA and protein respectively. The nuclear protein NF-kappaB P65 subunit and the inhibitory protein IkappaB-alpha were analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Compared with controls, HCY, at a concentration of 0.1 mmol/L, was able to enhance the expression of MIP-1alpha mRNA (up to 3.69-fold) and protein (1.16-fold) in THP-1 monocytes, as well as enhance NF-kappaB P65 transcription to nuclear proteins. These actions were significantly suppressed after pretreatment with 100 micromol/L PDTC for 30 minutes before HCY incubation; whereas incubation of THP-1 monocytes with PDTC only had no effect on both the expression of MIP-1alpha and nuclear transcription of NF-kappaB P65. Moreover, the level of IkappaB-alpha protein in THP-1 monocytes decreased after a 30-minute incubation with HCY, which gradually increased after 120 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Homocysteine at a pathologic concentration stimulates MIP-1alpha expression in THP-1 monocytes, probably via NF-kappaB activation. Such activation may be caused by enhanced phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor protein IkappaB-alpha.","['Xing, Wei', 'Deng, Zhong-Duan', 'Qu, Zhi-Ling', 'Ni, Juan']","['Xing W', 'Deng ZD', 'Qu ZL', 'Ni J']","['Department of Pathology, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. grace_xingw@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,"['0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '135467-92-4 (prolinedithiocarbamate)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Homocysteine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proline/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Thiocarbamates/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2005/04/22 09:00,2007/04/11 09:00,['2005/04/22 09:00'],"['2005/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Feb;34(2):101-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Apoptotic cell death was determined by morphological examination and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. The activity of caspase-3 was assessed using Western blotting and the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax genes was analyzed using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. RESULTS: GC-51 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells with an IC50 of 2.4+/-0.2 micromol/L and effectively induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Exposure of HL-60 cells to 10 micromol/L GC-51 for 8 h resulted in approximately 53% of the cells undergoing apoptosis. Caspase-3 was activated in GC-51-treated cells, which was manifested by the appearance of the 17 kDa active form of caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Meanwhile, GC-51 markedly reduced the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax. The apoptosis-inducing effect of GC-51 was cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) dependent because PKA, but not the protein kinase C, specific inhibitor H-89, blocked the induction of apoptosis by GC-51 in HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that GC-51 effectively induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells and that this effect is PKA-dependent and involves the downregulation of Bcl-2 expression and the activation of caspase-3.","['Zhong, Li', 'Li, Chao-ming', 'Hao, Xiao-jiang', 'Lou, Li-guang']","['Zhong L', 'Li CM', 'Hao XJ', 'Lou LG']","['Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (cheliensisin A)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'M876330O56 (N-(2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)']",IM,"['*Annonaceae/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Epoxy Compounds/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrones/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2005/04/22 09:00,2005/10/27 09:00,['2005/04/22 09:00'],"['2005/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1745-7254.2005.00077.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2005 May;26(5):623-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7254.2005.00077.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 83 patients were studied (age 48 +/- 16 years), among whom 60% were neutropenic on admission. For 68%, admission occurred within the first month following diagnosis of AML. The main reason for ICU admission was an acute respiratory disease in 82% of cases. Mechanical ventilation (MV) was required in 57% of patients. In-ICU mortality was 34%. Among patients discharged alive from ICU, 49% died within a year after discharge. Factors significantly associated with in-ICU death in multivariate analysis were simplified acute physiology score II and need for invasive MV (IMV). Age, performance status, AML3 subtype and complete remission were significantly associated with 1-year survival. Patients with acute respiratory failure initially supported with non-invasive MV had significantly better ICU outcome than patients initially supported with IMV. In conclusion, ICU admission is justified for selected patients with AML. The ICU mortality rate is highly predictable by the acute illness severity score. A 1-year survival is predicted by haematological prognostic factors.","['Rabbat, Antoine', 'Chaoui, Driss', 'Montani, David', 'Legrand, Ollivier', 'Lefebvre, Aurelie', 'Rio, Bernard', 'Roche, Nicolas', 'Lorut, Christine', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Huchon, Gerard']","['Rabbat A', 'Chaoui D', 'Montani D', 'Legrand O', 'Lefebvre A', 'Rio B', 'Roche N', 'Lorut C', 'Marie JP', 'Huchon G']","['Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Hopital Hotel-Dieu, 75004 Paris, France. antoine.rabbat@htd.ap-hop-paris.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Critical Care', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/22 09:00,2005/06/15 09:00,['2005/04/22 09:00'],"['2005/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5459 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05459.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 May;129(3):350-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05459.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Sequential BM specimens taken at intervals of 21 +/- 6 months were investigated by enzyme- and immunohistochemistry including proliferating cell nuclear antigen and apoptosis. Evaluation was performed either by semiquantitative scoring or by morphometry (CD61+ megakaryopoiesis). In 41 patients with chronic phase CML, treatment resulted in a significant decrease in cellularity and neutrophil granulopoiesis contrasting with an accumulation of erythroid precursor cells. Morphometry showed a reduction of abnormal micromegakaryocytes consistent with normalization. Regression of myelofibrosis was identified in eight of 15 patients, whereas progression occurred in 17 patients; mostly in those with acceleration and blastic crisis. The increased post-treatment incidence of reactive lymphoid nodules was remarkable. Myeloblasts, CD34+ progenitors and immature myelomonocytic cells initially decreased, but recurred in 14 patients who later developed a relapse. STI571 exerted an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation associated with enhanced apoptosis in responding patients.

By immunohistochemistry, overexpression of Mcl-1 was present in all germ cell tumours that were studied, including embryonal carcinoma and yolk sac tumour, as well as choriocarcinoma and teratoma. In teratomas, Mcl-1 was widely distributed in the epithelial, myogenic, neural and mesenchymal components.

Tinnitus sufferers and medical students served as comparison groups. Cancer patients showed significantly more anxious depression and a significantly lower QOL than controls. Their BI was restricted, focusing the functional status of body organs (e.g. opposing healthy vs. ill organs) as well as emotional aspects (e.g. trust vs. fear). The data convey fundamental psychological distress in newly diagnosed cancer patients. Restriction of BI and use of functional constructs may help to buffer the threat to body integrity.

It is quite common, however, for research subjects not to be given one particularly significant piece of information: the possibility of obtaining the ""new"" treatment being studied directly from a doctor without participating in the study. Since many people enroll in studies precisely to get such a new treatment, they frequently would prefer that option--which guarantees them that new treatment--to enrolling in a study where there is only a 50% chance of getting the new treatment. This issue becomes more complicated in the context of pediatric oncology research, since physician-researchers in this field have entered into a unique informal agreement not to offer such new treatments outside of research studies.

This paper explores the possible effects of ethnicity and culture on the consent process for pediatric cancer clinical trials. Informed consent discussions were observed, recorded, transcribed, and coded. Question asking by parents and clinician/parent word ratios were used to create an interactivity measure, or ""I-score."" Visual analog scales were used to rate the clarity of specific explanations. Cases were sorted into two groups on the basis of parents' self-reported ethnicity: Caucasian (n=79, 56%) and minority (predominantly Latino) parents (n=61, 44%). Chi-square and t-tests were used to compare the groups. A series of logistic regression analyses (controlling for ethnicity and SES) were run for variables that showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that the content and quality of the informed consent process is linked to parental ethnicity, or clinician attitudes toward parental ethnicity. These findings are discussed in terms of current perspectives on culture and ""cultural competence"" in health care. Further research is needed to understand how cultural factors affect outcomes such as parental understanding, decision making, mutual trust, and satisfaction within the informed consent process.","['Simon, Christian M', 'Kodish, Eric D']","['Simon CM', 'Kodish ED']","['Department of Bioethics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106-4976, USA. cxs66@po.cwru.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Comment']",United States,Perspect Biol Med,Perspectives in biology and medicine,0401132,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Communication Barriers', '*Cultural Diversity', '*Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Parental Consent', 'Parents/psychology', 'Pediatrics', 'Physician-Patient Relations', '*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Subjects/psychology']",2005/04/22 09:00,2005/05/25 09:00,['2005/04/22 09:00'],"['2005/04/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Perspect Biol Med. 2005 Winter;48(1 Suppl):S123-38.,,,,['R01 CA83267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Perspect Biol Med. 2005 Winter;48(1 Suppl):S139-49.

In 1982, the French-American-British (FAB) group proposed a classification for the MDS, based on morphological characteristics of peripheral blood and of the bone marrow. Later, cytogenetics proved to be a useful tool for the refinement of prognosis, through the use of the International Prognosis Score System (IPSS), as well as through evidence of clonality. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a new classification for the MDS, based on significant modifications of the FAB proposal, with the inclusion of chromosome analysis. A cytogenetic analysis was made of 17 patients with symptoms of MDS in the State of Para, based on WHO recommendations, and application of the IPSS. Good metaphases were obtained for 13 patients; 12 had a normal karyotype and only one had a clonal abnormality, del(3)(p25). The genes related to neoplastic processes that have been mapped to 3p are: XPC in 3p25.1 and FANCD2 and VHL in 3p25-26. Four patients had classic symptoms of MDS; in the rest the possibility of MDS was excluded or several months of observation before diagnosis were recommended. Among those with MDS, it was not possible to apply IPSS and WHO recommendations, because fundamental data were lacking, specifically the medullary blast and ring sideroblast counts. We advocate the implementation of routine cytogenetic analyses for the study of MDS, especially in patients with moderate hematopoietic dysplasia.","['Pinto, Giovanny Reboucas', 'Overal, David James', 'Moraes, Leopoldo Silva de', 'Van Den Berg, Ana Virginia', 'Lemos, Jose Alexandre Rodrigues', 'Smith, Marilia de Arruda Cardoso', 'Burbano, Rommel Rodriguez']","['Pinto GR', 'Overal DJ', 'Moraes LS', 'Van Den Berg AV', 'Lemos JA', 'Smith Mde A', 'Burbano RR']","['Laboratorio de Oncogenetica, Departamento de Genetica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, USP, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'World Health Organization']",2005/04/21 09:00,2005/08/16 09:00,['2005/04/21 09:00'],"['2005/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['0108 [pii]'],epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2005 Mar 31;4(1):18-30.,20050331,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that the p110delta isoform of PI3K is consistently expressed at a high level in blast cells from AML, in contrast to the other class I isoforms, the expression of which was very variable among patients.

Thus, understanding functional interactions between genes that regulate normal blood cell development, including cell growth and differentiation, and how their altered expression contributes to leukemia, is important for rational drug design. Previously, we have shown that the zinc finger transcription factor Egr-1 plays a role in monocytic differentiation. Ectopic expression of Egr-1 in M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells was observed to activate the macrophage differentiation program in the absence of the differentiation inducer interleukin 6 (IL-6) and to promote terminal differentiation in its presence. In addition, we have shown that deregulated expression of the proto-oncogene c-myc blocks the myeloid terminal differentiation program. Here we show that restoring expression of Egr-1 in M1 cells that express deregulated c-Myc abrogates the c-Myc block in terminal differentiation, resulting in cells that undergo functional macrophage maturation. However, there is an absence of both growth arrest and cell adhesion. In addition, Egr-1 expression diminished M1myc leukemogenicity in vivo. These findings indicate that Egr-1 can act as a tumor suppressor gene and suggest that Egr-1 or Egr-1 targets may provide important tools for differentiation therapy in certain leukemic phenotypes.","['Shafarenko, Marianna', 'Liebermann, Dan A', 'Hoffman, Barbara']","['Shafarenko M', 'Liebermann DA', 'Hoffman B']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, 3307 N Broad St, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Egr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",2005/04/21 09:00,2005/09/22 09:00,['2005/04/21 09:00'],"['2005/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53199-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-08-3056 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Aug 1;106(3):871-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-08-3056.

Such complexity indicates that not only individual genes but also entire signaling pathways will be crucial in angiogenesis. To define an angiogenic blueprint of regulated genes, we utilized our well-characterized three-dimensional collagen gel model of in vitro angiogenesis, in which the majority of cells synchronously progress through defined morphological stages culminating in the formation of capillary tubes. We developed a comprehensive three-tiered approach using microarray analysis, which allowed us to identify genes known to be involved in angiogenesis and genes hitherto unlinked to angiogenesis as well as novel genes and has proven especially useful for genes where the magnitude of change is small. Of interest is the ability to recognize complete signaling pathways that are regulated and genes clustering into ontological groups implicating the functional importance of particular processes. We have shown that consecutive members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and leukemia inhibitory factor signaling pathways are altered at the mRNA level during in vitro angiogenesis. Thus, at least for the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, mRNA changes as well as the phosphorylation changes of these gene products may be important in the control of blood vessel morphogenesis.

It targets the BCR/ABL oncogenic tyrosine kinase, inhibiting its activity. Using the alkaline comet assay we showed that STI571 at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 2 microM induced DNA damage in human leukemic K562 and BV173 cells expressing the BCR/ABL oncogene, whereas it had no effect in normal human lymphocytes and leukemic CCRF-CEM cells without the expression of BCR/ABL. Imatinib did not induce DNA strand breaks in the direct interaction with DNA as examined by the circular plasmid relaxation assay. Because the extent of DNA damage observed in the neutral and pH 12.1 versions of the comet assay was much lesser than in the alkaline version, we concluded that the drug induced DNA alkali-labile sites rather than strand breaks. K562 cells were unable to repair H(2)O(2)-induced DNA damage during a 120-min incubation, if they had been preincubated with STI571, whereas normal lymphocytes did so within 60 min. Pre-treatment of K562 cells with Vitamins A, C and E reduced the extent of DNA damage evoked by STI571. Similar results brought experiments with the nitrone spin traps POBN and PBN, suggesting that free radicals may be involved in the formation of DNA lesions induced by STI571 in K562 cells. These cells exposed to imatinib and treated with endonuclease III, formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase and 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase II, the enzymes recognizing oxidized and alkylated bases, displayed greater extent of DNA damage than those not treated with these enzymes. Therefore, the mechanism of the anti-leukemic action of STI571 may involve not only the inhibition of BCR/ABL, but also DNA damage in the cells expressing this fusion protein. DNA damage induced by STI571 may follow from oxidative and alkylative base modifications.","['Czechowska, Agnieszka', 'Poplawski, Tomasz', 'Drzewoski, Jozef', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Czechowska A', 'Poplawski T', 'Drzewoski J', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Ul.

Preparation of CIK cells was as follows: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patient were collected by using blood cell separator, then cultured in the medium containing monoclonal antibody against CD(3), interleukin-2 and interferon gamma for about 10 days, and finally infused back to the patient on the first day after chemotherapy. The programs of chemotherapy in the two groups were similar.

No LRP15 methylation was detected in COS7, but LRP15 was methylated in K562 and HL60. In nearly all of the French-American-British leukemia subtypes, we found that the frequency of LRP15 methylation was 71.2% (52/73) of AL and none in the 9 healthy subjects. The difference in mean methylation for LRP15 between these two kinds of samples is statistically significant (P < 0.05). Hypermethylation of the LRP15 gene was found in 57.1% (16/28) of the newly diagnosed AL and 83.3% of the relapsed AL respectively; this is also statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: LRP15 methylation change is a common abnormality in leukemia and LRP15 is postulated to be a tumor suppressor gene.","['Dou, Li-ping', 'Yu, Li', 'Lu, Qing', 'Xu, Zhou-min', 'Liu, Hai-chuan', 'Lou, Fang-ding']","['Dou LP', 'Yu L', 'Lu Q', 'Xu ZM', 'Liu HC', 'Lou FD']","['Department of Hematology, PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China. lipingdou@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,"['0 (LRRC3B protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proteins/*genetics']",2005/04/21 09:00,2005/09/03 09:00,['2005/04/21 09:00'],"['2005/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/21 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2005 Feb;44(2):92-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For these viruses association of newly synthesized viral proteins with lipid rafts has been shown. RESULTS: Here we provide evidence for the association of the envelope protein (Env) of the 4070A isolate of amphotropic murine leukaemia virus (A-MLV) with lipid rafts. Using density gradient centrifugation and immunocytochemical analyses, we show that Env co-localizes with cholesterol, ganglioside GM1 and caveolin-1 in these specific regions of the plasma membrane. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a large amount of A-MLV Env is associated with lipid rafts and suggest that cholesterol-rich microdomains are used as portals for the exit of A-MLV.","['Beer, Christiane', 'Pedersen, Lene', 'Wirth, Manfred']","['Beer C', 'Pedersen L', 'Wirth M']","['Molecular Biotechnology, German Research Centre for Biotechnology, GBF, Mascheroder Weg 1, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany. chb@mb.au.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Gene Products, env/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells']",2005/04/21 09:00,2006/09/19 09:00,['2005/04/21 09:00'],"['2005/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['1743-422X-2-36 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-2-36 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2005 Apr 19;2:36. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-2-36.,20050419,PMC1087893,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we prepared radiolabeled [3H]UDP [2-(3-ethylureido)-6-[3H]-acetylaminopyridine] as ligand and investigated whether it interacts selectively with novel binding proteins. MEL and RD/TE-671 cells, incubated with the inducer [3H]UDP and subsequently fractionated, yielded a radiolabeled postmitochondrial soluble fraction containing the [3H]UDP-protein complex. We purified the UDP binding protein by using UDP-sepharose affinity chromatography, gel filtration, and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and analyzed its structure. The data presented here indicate for the first time that the inducer UDP interacts with a 38,333 +/- 30 Da binding protein(s) (p38), of unknown function, in both cell lines. Microsequencing and sequence alignment search revealed that the p38 protein(s) contains at least two homologous domains, one being part of ABC-type transporters and another found in the Wingless-type (Wnt) proteins. Kinetic analysis revealed that the p38 forms a relatively stable protein complex with [3H]UDP that accumulates within the cytosol and nucleus of MEL cells during the precommitment period. This complex, however, decays later on after commitment to erythroid maturation has been initiated. De novo protein and mRNA synthesis is needed for the UDP-p38 complex to form, as shown by the use of metabolic inhibitors. Purified p38 was used to develop an anti-p38 polyclonal serum, and Western blot analysis revealed that the level of p38 was quite similar in both UDP-inducible and -resistant MEL subclones that we developed. Although only a portion of the primary structure of the p38 is known from microsequencing, the mechanism by which the UDP-p38 complex contributes to induction of differentiation in both UDP-responsive mouse MEL and human RD/TE-671 cells is discussed.","['Pappas, Ioannis S', 'Lambris, John D', 'Vizirianakis, Ioannis S', 'Winters, Michael S', 'Tsiftsoglou, Asterios S']","['Pappas IS', 'Lambris JD', 'Vizirianakis IS', 'Winters MS', 'Tsiftsoglou AS']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GR-54121 Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cytosol', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors/*pathology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2005/04/21 09:00,2005/07/12 09:00,['2005/04/21 09:00'],"['2005/04/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/096504005775082084 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2005;15(1):21-37. doi: 10.3727/096504005775082084.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PPAR-gamma ligands have recently been demonstrated to affect proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of different cell types. The present study was undertaken to investigate PPAR-gamma ligands induced cell growth inhibition and its influence on matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities on leukemia K562 and HL-60 cells in vitro. The results revealed that PPAR-gamma expression was detectable in the two kinds of leukemia cells; Both 15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2(15d-PGJ2) and troglitazone (TGZ) have significant growth inhibition effects on these two kinds of leukemia cells. These two PPAR-gamma ligands could inhibit the leukemic cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and the invasion through matrigel matrix. The expressions of MMP-9 and MMP-2 as well as their gelatinolytic activities in both HL-60 and K562 cells were inhibited by 15d-PGJ2 and TGZ significantly. We therefore conclude that PPAR-gamma ligands 15d-PGJ2 and TGZ have significant growth inhibition effects on myeloid leukemia cells in vitro, and that PPAR-gamma ligands can inhibit K562 and HL-60 cell adhesion to and invasion through ECM as well as downregulate MMP-9 and MMP-2 expressions.

Since MPSs in children occur much less commonly than adults, one can argue that the biology and the categories of the various pediatric MPSs seem to be different from adults. Furthermore, confusion exists between pediatric MPS and other overlapping conditions, such as myelodysplastic syndrome. The authors' objectives were to develop a classification system with a list of disorders relevant to children and to characterize pediatric cases of MPS that were devised according to this classification. Based on the predominant proliferating cell lineage, the authors established a classification system for childhood MPS. Primary MPS was classified into granulocytic proliferation--chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML); monocytic--juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML); megakaryocytic--essential thrombocythemia (ET), familial thrombocytosis, transient myeloproliferative disorder of Down syndrome (TMD); erythrocytic--polycythemia vera, familial erythrocytosis; fibroblastic--idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF); eosinophilic--idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (IHES); and mast cells--mastocytosis. Secondary MPS was classified as non-clonal proliferation (eg, infections, drugs, toxins, autoimmune, non-hematologic neoplasm, and trauma), and these were excluded from the study. Next, the classification system was applied to the patient population at the authors' institution. One hundred two cases with primary MPS were identified between 1970 and 2001. Patients were evaluated for clinical manifestations, blood and bone marrow parameters, cytogenetics, and survival following different treatment modalities. Significant proportions of cases of childhood MPS (60%) were unique to the pediatric population and not seen in adults. The most common disorders were JMML (n = 31), TMD of Down syndrome (n = 30), and CML (n = 30); the other disorders were rare: four cases of ET, two of IMF, two of IHES, two of mastocytosis, and one primary erythrocytosis. In contrast to adults, MPS in children is more frequently treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only available curative option for most of these diseases. HSCT was particularly successful in the more recent cases due to more advanced techniques for HSCT. The authors found that all the cases could be easily classified. MPS in children is different from adult-type MPS in terms of biology, categories, classification, and prognosis.","['Gassas, Adam', 'Doyle, John J', 'Weitzman, Sheila', 'Freedman, Melvin H', 'Hitzler, Johann K', 'Sharathkumar, Anjali', 'Dror, Yigal']","['Gassas A', 'Doyle JJ', 'Weitzman S', 'Freedman MH', 'Hitzler JK', 'Sharathkumar A', 'Dror Y']","['Divisions of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada. adam.gassas@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*classification/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2005/04/20 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/04/20 09:00'],"['2005/04/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-200504000-00004 [pii]', '10.1097/01.mph.0000159934.35079.b5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2005 Apr;27(4):192-6. doi: 10.1097/01.mph.0000159934.35079.b5.,,,,,,,,,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2006 Oct;28(10):700-1.

Longitudinal data, however, are rare. METHODS: Serial echocardiograms (N = 499) were obtained from 115 doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (median age at diagnosis, 4.8 years; median follow-up after completion of doxorubicin, 11.8 years). Results were expressed as z scores to indicate the number of standard deviations (SDs) above (+) or below (-) the normal predicted value. Median individual and cumulative doxorubicin doses were 30 mg/m2 per dose and 352 mg/m2, respectively. RESULTS: Left ventricular fractional shortening was significantly reduced after doxorubicin therapy, and the reduction was related to cumulative dose. z scores for fractional shortening transiently improved before falling to -2.76 more than 12 years after diagnosis. Reduced fractional shortening was related to impaired contractility and increasing afterload, consequences of a progressive reduction of ventricular mass, and wall thickness relative to body-surface area. Left ventricular contractility fell significantly over time and was depressed at last follow-up in patients receiving more than 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were below normal more than 9 years after diagnosis. Even patients receiving lower cumulative doxorubicin doses experienced reduced mass and dimension. Fractional shortening and dimension at the end of therapy predicted these parameters 11.8 years later. CONCLUSION: Cardiac abnormalities were persistent and progressive after doxorubicin therapy. Inadequate ventricular mass with chronic afterload excess was associated with progressive contractile deficit and possibly reduced cardiac output and restrictive cardiomyopathy. The deficits were worst after highest cumulative doses of doxorubicin, but appeared even after low doses.","['Lipshultz, Steven E', 'Lipsitz, Stuart R', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Dalton, Virginia M', 'Mone, Suzanne M', 'Gelber, Richard D', 'Colan, Steven D']","['Lipshultz SE', 'Lipsitz SR', 'Sallan SE', 'Dalton VM', 'Mone SM', 'Gelber RD', 'Colan SD']","['Department of Pediatrics (D820), Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami, Miami, FL 33101, USA. slipshultz@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Pressure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Morbidity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*chemically induced']",2005/04/20 09:00,2005/05/20 09:00,['2005/04/20 09:00'],"['2005/04/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/12/2629 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.12.121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Apr 20;23(12):2629-36. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.12.121.,,,,"['CA 55576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA79060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 53392/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 59837/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 69800/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 72705/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HR 96041/HR/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Phase 2 prospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care academic medical centers. PATIENTS: Forty-five patients entered this study. All patients had stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and had been treated with surgical resection, radiation, or both. All patients were then treated with bioadjuvant chemopreventive treatment for 12 months. We previously reported a 24-month median follow-up of this phase 2 trial of the combination of isotretinoin, interferon alfa-2a, and vitamin E as bioadjuvant therapy after definitive local therapy. In that study, all 45 patients completed treatment, but 1 patient was excluded from analysis of recurrence and development of second primary tumors. Main Outcome Measure Longer-term (49.4-month median) follow-up. RESULTS: Among the 45 patients treated under the protocol, only 7 patients (16%) had died. Nine (20%) of 45 patients experienced progressive disease. Only 1 second primary tumor (acute promyelocytic leukemia) occurred during follow-up, and no aerodigestive second primary tumors occurred among the 45 patients. The 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival percentages were 80% (95% confidence interval, 65.1%-89.1%) and 81.3% (95% confidence interval, 63.7%-90.9%), respectively. These results are significantly better than the historical 5-year overall survival for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (approximately 40%). CONCLUSION: The bioadjuvant combination is highly effective in preventing recurrence and second primary tumors, and its role as standard therapy in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is being investigated in a randomized phase 3 study.","['Seixas-Silva, Jose A Jr', 'Richards, Thomas', 'Khuri, Fadlo R', 'Wieand, H Samuel', 'Kim, Ed', 'Murphy, Barbara', 'Francisco, Marites', 'Hong, Waun Ki', 'Shin, Dong M']","['Seixas-Silva JA Jr', 'Richards T', 'Khuri FR', 'Wieand HS', 'Kim E', 'Murphy B', 'Francisco M', 'Hong WK', 'Shin DM']","['University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,8603209,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Isotretinoin/*administration & dosage', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Vitamin E/*administration & dosage']",2005/04/20 09:00,2005/05/11 09:00,['2005/04/20 09:00'],"['2005/04/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['131/4/304 [pii]', '10.1001/archotol.131.4.304 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2005 Apr;131(4):304-7. doi: 10.1001/archotol.131.4.304.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, the mechanism of intracellular accumulation of G3139 following in vivo administration remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to assess whether detectable intracellular concentrations of G3139 are achievable in vivo and how these relate to Bcl-2 down-regulation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cellular uptake of G3139 was studied in leukemia myeloid cell lines and blasts collected from treated patients using a newly developed, novel, and highly sensitive ELISA-based assay. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was used to quantify Bcl-2 mRNA changes in treated cells. RESULTS: The assay was fully validated and showed a limit of quantification of 50 pmol/L. When exposed to 0.33 to 10 mumol/L G3139, K562 cells exhibited intracellular concentrations in the range of 2.1 to 11.4 pmol/mg protein. When G3139 was delivered with cationic lipids, a 10- to 25-fold increase of the intracellular concentrations was observed. There was an accumulation of G3139 in the nuclei, and the ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm was increased 7-fold by cationic lipids. Intracellular concentrations of G3139 were correlated with Bcl-2 mRNA down-regulation. Robust intracellular concentrations of G3139 were achieved in vivo in bone marrow (range, 3.4-40.6 pmol/mg protein) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (range, 0.47-19.4 pmol/mg protein) from acute myeloid leukemia patients treated with G3139. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence that measurable intracellular levels of G3139 are achievable in vivo in acute myeloid leukemia patients and that Bcl-2 down-regulation is likely to depend on the achievable intracellular concentrations rather than on plasma concentrations.","['Dai, Guowei', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Hoyt, Dale', 'Whitman, Susan', 'Klisovic, Marko', 'Shen, Tiansheng', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Byrd, John', 'Grever, Michael', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Dai G', 'Chan KK', 'Liu S', 'Hoyt D', 'Whitman S', 'Klisovic M', 'Shen T', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Byrd J', 'Grever M', 'Marcucci G']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Medicine and Public Health, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '85J5ZP6YSL (oblimersen)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thionucleotides/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Time Factors']",2005/04/20 09:00,2005/08/30 09:00,['2005/04/20 09:00'],"['2005/04/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/8/2998 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1505 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 15;11(8):2998-3008. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1505.,,,,"['P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA 94552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1-CA 76576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Long-term clinical outcome in 45 t(12;21)+ ALL patients was related to mRNA expression of TEL, AML1, TEL-AML1, and AML1-TEL, determined by real-time quantitative PCR, and the in vitro sensitivity to prednisolone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase, using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. RESULTS: A significant approximately 3.5-fold lower TEL expression in t(12;21)+ compared with t(12;21)- ALL samples (P = 0.006) and normal controls (P = 0.004) was found. Expression of AML1 did not differ between t(12;21)+ and t(12;21)- ALL. However, AML1 expression in the leukemic cells was 2-fold higher compared with normal controls (P = 0.02). The TEL-AML1 fusion product was expressed in all t(12;21)+ cases, whereas the reciprocal fusion product AML1-TEL was expressed in only 76%. High expression levels of TEL-AML1 [hazard ratio (HR), 1.3; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.10-1.57; P = 0.003], AML1-TEL (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.99-12.40; P = 0.001) and AML1 (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.03-1.22; P = 0.006) were associated with a poor long-term clinical outcome within t(12;21)+ ALL. Cellular drug resistance towards prednisolone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase could not explain this predictive value.

Knowledge of the mechanisms by which telomerase is differentially regulated in neuroendocrine lung tumors is important for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of these malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated telomerase activity in 86 neuroendocrine lung tumors and correlated the enzyme activity with the expression of the enzyme subunits [human RNA component (hTR), human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), and alternatively spliced hTERT variants], with the telomere-associated protein human protection of telomere-1, and with the telomere length pattern. RESULTS: A significantly (P = 0.0001) lower frequency of telomerase-positive cases was found in typical carcinoids (14%) than in large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (87%) and small cell lung cancers (92%). hTR was constitutively expressed in all carcinoids. Telomerase-negative carcinoids were characterized by the absence of any hTERT transcript, only displayed the beta(-) alternatively spliced variant, or concomitantly expressed the alpha(+)beta(+) full-length message with different combinations of alternatively spliced variants. However, in these tumors, a more abundant level of alternatively spliced transcripts than that of the alpha(+)beta(+) full-length transcript was generally found. No significant difference was observed in human protection of telomere-1 expression between telomerase-negative and telomerase-positive carcinoids. Telomeres were significantly (P < 0.05) longer in telomerase-negative carcinoids than in telomerase-positive carcinoids (median value, 9.15 versus 4.47 kb). However, alternative lengthening of telomeres, as shown by associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies, was not observed in these tumors.

In this study, we describe a role of CREB in human cancer. CREB overexpression is associated with increased risk of relapse and decreased event-free survival. CREB levels are elevated in blast cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. To understand the role of CREB in leukemogenesis, we studied the biological consequences of CREB overexpression in primary human leukemia cells, leukemia cell lines, and transgenic mice. Our results demonstrate that CREB promotes abnormal proliferation and survival of myeloid cells in vitro and in vivo through upregulation of specific target genes.

Extravillous trophoblast cells resemble malignancies in their invasive and destructive features, excluding the fact of sequential restriction to the first trimester of pregnancy. Trophoblast cells from term placentas have reduced invasive capacity [Hohn HP, Denker HW. Experimental modulation of cell-cell adhesion, invasiveness and differentiation in trophoblast cells.

Constitutively activated Stat3 DNA-binding activity in choriocarcinoma cells, carcinomatous derivates of trophoblast cells, have been reported to correlate with its invasiveness [Corvinus FM, Fitzgerald JS, Friedrich K, Markert UR. Evidence for a correlation between trophoblast invasiveness and STAT3 activity. Am J Reprod Immunol 2003;50:316-21]. Here we demonstrate using RNAi that Stat3 activation is necessary in the invasive phenotype of trophoblast cells and can be controlled via Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF). LIF provides a soluble extracellular signal that stimulates invasion in trophoblast and Jeg-3 choriocarcinoma cells. Loss of LIF-mediated invasion in these cells subsequent to STAT3 knock-down strongly suggests that STAT3 plays a crucial role in mediating this invasion.","['Poehlmann, T G', 'Fitzgerald, J S', 'Meissner, A', 'Wengenmayer, T', 'Schleussner, E', 'Friedrich, K', 'Markert, U R']","['Poehlmann TG', 'Fitzgerald JS', 'Meissner A', 'Wengenmayer T', 'Schleussner E', 'Friedrich K', 'Markert UR']","['Placenta-Laboratory, Department of Obstetrics, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Bachstrasse 18, 07740 Jena, Germany. tobias.poehlmann@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Placenta,Placenta,8006349,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Trophoblasts/cytology/*physiology']",2005/04/20 09:00,2005/08/23 09:00,['2005/04/20 09:00'],"['2005/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0143-4004(05)00034-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.placenta.2005.01.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Placenta. 2005 Apr;26 Suppl A:S37-41. doi: 10.1016/j.placenta.2005.01.007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is enriched in cold TritonX-100 insoluble membrane domains (i.e., rafts). The purpose of this work was to characterize the ATPase activities of raft preparations from P388 cells overexpressing P-gp (P388/ADR) or devoid of P-gp (P388) and to establish a P-gp-enriched screening system for P-gp-interfering compounds. METHODS: Rafts were extracted with cold TritonX-100. The ATPase activity was characterized in 96-well plates using a fluorescence assay. RESULTS: The ATPase activity per mg protein was about five times higher in P388/ADR rafts than in crude membranes. The anti-P-gp antibody C219 inhibited 20% of the activity in P388/ADR rafts but only about 10% of the activity in P388/ADR crude membranes and had no effect on the activity of P388 rafts. The known P-gp-activating compounds verapamil, progesterone, and valinomycin revealed the typical bell-shaped activity/concentration profiles in P388/ADR rafts, indicative for activation at low compound concentrations and inhibition at concentrations >10 to 100 microM. The inhibitory effect was also observed in P388 rafts. CONCLUSIONS: Extracted rafts are rich in functional ATPases. Rafts from P-gp-overexpressing cells display P-gp-typical ATPase activity and provide an easy, P-gp-enriched screening system.","['Bucher, Karsten', 'Besse, Camille A', 'Kamau, Sarah W', 'Wunderli-Allenspach, Heidi', 'Kramer, Stefanie D']","['Bucher K', 'Besse CA', 'Kamau SW', 'Wunderli-Allenspach H', 'Kramer SD']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH, Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/analysis/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*enzymology', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Mice']",2005/04/20 09:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2005/04/20 09:00'],"['2005/04/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11095-004-1883-x [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Res. 2005 Mar;22(3):449-57. doi: 10.1007/s11095-004-1883-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With better understanding of the biology of the disease, and routine use of high-dose cytarabine as post-remission therapy with or without haematopoietic blood stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the results have improved in the past two decades. We analysed our results in a cohort of recently treated patients. METHODS: A total of 166 newly diagnosed patients with AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukaemia), 15-60 years of age were treated with daunorubicin (60 mg/m2/day x3 days) or idarubicin (12 mg/m2/day x3 days) with cytarabine (100 mg/m2/day continuous i.v. infusion x7 days) induction chemotherapy. Post-remission therapy included 2 cycles of high-dose cytarabine (15-18 g/m2) followed by monthly cycles of outpatient maintenance chemotherapy x4 cycles, consisting of daunorubicin (45 mg/m2 i.v. x1 day and cytarabine 100 mg/ m2 s.c. twice daily x5 days). Six patients in remission received sibling donor allogeneic HSCT. RESULTS: Morphological complete remission was achieved in 69.9% of the patients. Resistant disease after induction chemotherapy was seen in 14.6% and early mortality occurred in 16%. Relapse-free survival and event-free survival at a median of 36 months was 34% and 22%, respectively. Relapse occurred in 43.9%. The median duration of remission was 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our results conform to the published literature from larger cooperative studies from the West. Currently available cytotoxic drugs are unlikely to improve the results any further.","['Saikia, T K', 'Bakshi, A', 'Bhagwat, R', 'Tawde, S', 'Nair, R', 'Nair, C N', 'Parikh, P M']","['Saikia TK', 'Bakshi A', 'Bhagwat R', 'Tawde S', 'Nair R', 'Nair CN', 'Parikh PM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai 400008, Maharashtra. saikias@vsnl.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Natl Med J India,The National medical journal of India,8809315,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'India', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/20 09:00,2005/05/20 09:00,['2005/04/20 09:00'],"['2005/04/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Med J India. 2005 Jan-Feb;18(1):12-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior reports indicate that patients with some hematologic malignancies (for example chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) may be at increased risk of second neoplasms. AIM: The aim of the authors was to explore the possible association between hematologic malignancies and subsequent solid tumours. PATIENTS, METHODS: Between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 2002, in the county of Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg 151 cases with both malignant hematologic diseases and cancers were registered by the authors. In their 60 patients (50 with lymphoid and 10 with myeloid malignancies) the first tumour was the hematologic malignancy. Among these cases the number of second cancers was 64. RESULTS: The most common kind of second tumours was lung cancer. There was a significant connection between lymphoid malignancies and second cancers as compared to myeloid malignancies and subsequent cancers (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Analysing the epidemiologic data the authors established the following conclusions: the association of second cancers with hematologic malignancies in most of the cases is not accidental. The age of patients with second cancers seemed to be not too important, but it was of crucial importance in patients with Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The role of immunodeficiency in the development of second cancers may be important in patients with Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (the number of second cancers in their patients with multiple myeloma and hairy cell leukemia was too small do draw a conclusion).","['Jako, Janos', 'Szerafin, Laszlo', 'Nagy, Peter']","['Jako J', 'Szerafin L', 'Nagy P']","['Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg Megyei Onkormanyzat Josa Andras Korhaza, II.

Recently, missense mutations of PTPN11, the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP-2, were identified in patients with NS. Further, somatic mutations in PTPN11 were detected in childhood leukemia. Recent studies showed that the phosphatase activities of five mutations identified in NS and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) were increased. However, the functional properties of the other mutations remain unidentified. In this study, in order to clarify the differences between the mutations identified in NS and leukemia, we examined the phosphatase activity of 14 mutants of SHP-2. We identified nine mutations, including a novel F71I mutation, in 16 of 41 NS patients and two mutations, including a novel G503V mutation, in three of 29 patients with leukemia. Immune complex phosphatase assays of individual mutants transfected in COS7 cells showed that ten mutants identified in NS and four mutants in leukemia showed 1.4-fold to 12.7-fold increased activation compared with wild-type SHP-2. These results suggest that the pathogenesis of NS and leukemia is associated with enhanced phosphatase activity of mutant SHP-2. A comparison of the phosphatase activity in each mutant and a review of previously reported cases showed that high phosphatase activity observed in mutations at codons 61, 71, 72, and 76 was significantly associated with leukemogenesis.","['Niihori, Tetsuya', 'Aoki, Yoko', 'Ohashi, Hirofumi', 'Kurosawa, Kenji', 'Kondoh, Tatsuro', 'Ishikiriyama, Satoshi', 'Kawame, Hiroshi', 'Kamasaki, Hotaka', 'Yamanaka, Tsutomu', 'Takada, Fumio', 'Nishio, Kimio', 'Sakurai, Masahiro', 'Tamai, Hiroshi', 'Nagashima, Tatsuro', 'Suzuki, Yoichi', 'Kure, Shigeo', 'Fujii, Kunihiro', 'Imaizumi, Masue', 'Matsubara, Yoichi']","['Niihori T', 'Aoki Y', 'Ohashi H', 'Kurosawa K', 'Kondoh T', 'Ishikiriyama S', 'Kawame H', 'Kamasaki H', 'Yamanaka T', 'Takada F', 'Nishio K', 'Sakurai M', 'Tamai H', 'Nagashima T', 'Suzuki Y', 'Kure S', 'Fujii K', 'Imaizumi M', 'Matsubara Y']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Sendai, 980-8574, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Sendai, 980-8574, Japan. aokiy@mail.tains.tohoku.ac.jp.', ""Division of Medical Genetics, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", ""Division of Medical Genetics, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagasaki University of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan.', ""Division of Clinical Genetics and Cytogenetics, Shizuoka Children's Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan."", ""Division of Medical Genetics, Nagano Children's Hospital, Nagano, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', ""Okazaki Women's Junior College, Okazaki, Japan."", 'Department of Medical Genetics, Kitasato University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Sagamihara, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical College, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Jikei University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Sendai, 980-8574, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Sendai, 980-8574, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Miyagi Children's Hospital, Sendai, Japan."", 'Department of Medical Genetics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, 1-1 Seiryo-machi, Sendai, 980-8574, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Noonan Syndrome/enzymology/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics', 'SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'src Homology Domains']",2005/04/19 09:00,2005/06/24 09:00,['2005/04/19 09:00'],"['2004/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10038-005-0239-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s10038-005-0239-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2005;50(4):192-202. doi: 10.1007/s10038-005-0239-7.

Therefore, more potent and leukemia-specific therapies with favorable toxicity profiles are urgently needed. Here, we report on the construction of a novel therapeutic fusion protein, scFvCD7:sTRAIL, designed to induce target antigen-restricted apoptosis in human T-cell tumors. ScFvCD7:sTRAIL consists of the death-inducing tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) genetically linked to an scFv antibody fragment specific for the T-cell surface antigen CD7. Treatment with scFvCD7:sTRAIL induced potent CD7-restricted apoptosis in a series of malignant T-cell lines, whereas normal resting leukocytes, activated T cells, and vascular endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) showed no detectable apoptosis. The apoptosis-inducing activity of scFvCD7:sTRAIL was stronger than that of the immunotoxin scFvCD7:ETA. In mixed culture experiments with CD7-positive and CD7-negative tumor cells, scFvCD7:sTRAIL induced very potent bystander apoptosis of CD7-negative tumor cells. In vitro treatment of blood cells freshly derived from T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients resulted in marked apoptosis of the malignant T cells that was strongly augmented by vincristin. In conclusion, scFvCD7:sTRAIL is a novel recombinant protein causing restricted apoptosis in human leukemic T cells with low toxicity for normal human blood and endothelial cells.","['Bremer, Edwin', 'Samplonius, Douwe F', 'Peipp, Matthias', 'van Genne, Linda', 'Kroesen, Bart-Jan', 'Fey, Georg H', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'de Leij, Lou F M H', 'Helfrich, Wijnand']","['Bremer E', 'Samplonius DF', 'Peipp M', 'van Genne L', 'Kroesen BJ', 'Fey GH', 'Gramatzki M', 'de Leij LF', 'Helfrich W']","['Laboratory for Tumor Immunology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Section Medical Biology, University Hospital Groningen, Groningen University Institute for Drug Exploration, 9713 GZ Groningen, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD7/genetics/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetinae', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Immunotoxins/genetics/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2005/04/19 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/04/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/8/3380 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2756 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 15;65(8):3380-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2756.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This mini-HIV virus has five deletions (vif, vpR, vpU, nef, and U3) and replicated in the SupT1 cell line, but did not replicate in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The stripped down mini-HIV variant was also able to efficiently remove leukemic cells from a mixed culture with untransformed control cells. In contrast to wild-type HIV-1, we did not observe bystander killing in mixed culture experiments with the mini-HIV variant. Furthermore, viral escape was not detected in long-term cultures. The mini-HIV variant that uses CD4 and CXCR4 for cell entry could potentially be used against CXCR4-expressing malignancies such as T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, natural killer leukemia, and some myeloid leukemias.","['Jeeninga, Rienk E', 'Jan, Barbara', 'van der Linden, Birgit', 'van den Berg, Henk', 'Berkhout, Ben']","['Jeeninga RE', 'Jan B', 'van der Linden B', 'van den Berg H', 'Berkhout B']","['Department of Human Retrovirology, Emma Children Hospital, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, nef/genetics', 'Genes, vif/genetics', 'Genes, vpr/genetics', 'Genes, vpu/genetics', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat/genetics', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*therapy/*virology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Virus Replication']",2005/04/19 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/04/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/8/3347 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4280 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 15;65(8):3347-55. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4280.,,,,['R21-AI47017-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined SDF-1alpha-mediated responses of cells from 27 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although cells from the majority of cases showed chemotactic and proliferative responses to SDF-1alpha, a subset of cases did not undergo chemotaxis in response to SDF-1alpha, while still demonstrating dependence on SDF-1alpha for proliferation in stroma-supported cultures. This chemotactic defect was associated with an absence of phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced by SDF-1alpha, and of SDF-1alpha-induced augmentation of beta(1) integrin-mediated adhesion. Signaling through phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MEK was not affected. No correlation was observed between CXCR4 expression and chemotactic function, in vitro migration into bone marrow stromal layers, and engraftment of leukemic cells in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. This study suggests that signaling through p38 MAPK is required for ALL cell chemotaxis but not for proliferation, and that the loss of a chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha does not impede engraftment in NOD/SCID mice.","['Bendall, Linda J', 'Baraz, Rana', 'Juarez, Julius', 'Shen, Wei', 'Bradstock, Kenneth F']","['Bendall LJ', 'Baraz R', 'Juarez J', 'Shen W', 'Bradstock KF']","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales 2145, Australia. linda_bendall@wmi.usyd.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrin alpha5beta1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/physiology', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/metabolism', 'Integrin alpha5beta1/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2005/04/19 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/04/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/8/3290 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3402 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 15;65(8):3290-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3402.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show in both BCR-ABL cells (Mo7e-p210 and BaF/3-p210) and primary CML CD34+ cells that STI571 inhibition of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity results in a G(1) cell cycle arrest mediated by the PI3K pathway. This arrest is associated with a nuclear accumulation of p27(Kip1) and down-regulation of cyclins D and E. As a result, there is a reduction of the cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity and of the retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. By quantitative reverse transcription-PCR we show that BCR-ABL/PI3K regulates the expression of p27(Kip1) at the level of transcription. We further show that BCR-ABL also regulates p27(Kip1) protein levels by increasing its degradation by the proteasome. This degradation depends on the ubiquitinylation of p27(Kip1) by Skp2-containing SFC complexes: silencing the expression of Skp2 with a small interfering RNA results in the accumulation of p27(Kip1). We also demonstrate that BCR-ABL cells show transcriptional up-regulation of Skp2. Finally, expression of a p27(Kip1) mutant unable of being recognized by Skp2 results in inhibition of proliferation of BCR-ABL cells, indicating that the degradation of p27(Kip1) contributes to the pathogenesis of CML. In conclusion, these results suggest that BCR-ABL regulates cell cycle in CML cells at least in part by inducing proteasome-mediated degradation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) and provide a rationale for the use of inhibitors of the proteasome in patients with BCR-ABL leukemias.","['Andreu, Enrique J', 'Lledo, Elisa', 'Poch, Enric', 'Ivorra, Carmen', 'Albero, M Pilar', 'Martinez-Climent, Jose Angel', 'Montiel-Duarte, Cristina', 'Rifon, Jose', 'Perez-Calvo, Javier', 'Arbona, Cristina', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Perez-Roger, Ignacio']","['Andreu EJ', 'Lledo E', 'Poch E', 'Ivorra C', 'Albero MP', 'Martinez-Climent JA', 'Montiel-Duarte C', 'Rifon J', 'Perez-Calvo J', 'Arbona C', 'Prosper F', 'Perez-Roger I']","['Division of Cancer, Area of Cell Therapy and Hematology Service, Clinica Universitaria/School of Medicine, Foundation for Applied Medical Research, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2005/04/19 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/04/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/8/3264 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1357 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 15;65(8):3264-72. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1357.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these techniques are laborious and require the use of relatively large amounts of DNA if the whole genome is to be examined. Here we describe the use of oligonucleotide microarrays to characterize single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in lymphoblasts isolated from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia for the pan-genomic mapping of LOH with a resolution of 100 to 200 kb. Results were compared with DNA obtained during remission and on relapse. Abnormalities were seen in 8 of 10 cases. The two cases with no abnormalities and one case that showed identical changes at relapse and presentation remain in remission 1 to 9 years following retreatment. The remaining seven patients died following relapse. In four cases, LOH was only detectable at relapse suggesting that progressive LOH may be a cause of disease progression and/or drug resistance. This was supported by detailed analysis of one case in which LOH involving the glucocorticoid receptor was associated with mutation of the remaining allele. The most frequent abnormality detected involved chromosome 9p. In each of the four cases where this was observed LOH included the INK4 locus. In three of the four cases, INK4 loss was only observed at relapse, suggesting that this abnormality may be commonly associated with treatment failure. These observations show that SNP array analysis is a powerful new tool for the analysis of allelic imbalance in leukemic blasts.","['Irving, Julie A E', 'Bloodworth, Lisa', 'Bown, Nick P', 'Case, Marian C', 'Hogarth, Linda A', 'Hall, Andrew G']","['Irving JA', 'Bloodworth L', 'Bown NP', 'Case MC', 'Hogarth LA', 'Hall AG']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research and Institute for Human Genetics, Newcastle University, Newcastle, NE2 4HH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Recurrence']",2005/04/19 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/04/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/8/3053 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2604 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 15;65(8):3053-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2604.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because effector CD8(+) T cells are derived from a pool of less differentiated, replicating cells in secondary lymphoid organs, and because IL-2 mediates effector differentiation, the enhanced secondary response may reflect the enlargement of this generative pool by the transient repression of IL-2-mediated differentiation. We have examined for this function the transcriptional repressor BCL6b, a homologue of BCL6 that represses IL-2-induced B cell differentiation. BCL6b is expressed in a small subset of antigen-experienced CD8(+) T cells. Ectopic expression of BCL6b in CD8(+) T cells diminishes their growth in response to IL-2 in vitro. Female mice in which the BCL6b gene has been interrupted have normal primary responses of CD8(+) T cells to infection with vaccinia expressing the H-Y epitope, Uty, but Uty-specific, BCL6b(-/-), memory CD8(+) T cells have diminished recall proliferative responses to this epitope in vitro. BCL6b(-/-) mice also have normal primary CD8(+) T cell responses to influenza infection, but nucleoprotein peptide-specific, BCL6b(-/-), memory CD8(+) T cells have a cell autonomous defect in the number of effector cells generated in response to reinfection.

The endogenous RBCK1 was found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Particularly in the nucleus, it was localized in the granular structures, most likely nuclear bodies. In contrast, the over-expressed RBCK1 was detected exclusively in the cytoplasm. When the cells were treated with leptomycin B, the over-expressed RBCK1 accumulated in the nuclear bodies. These results suggest that RBCK1 possesses the signal sequences responsible for the nuclearcytoplasmic translocation. Mutational analysis of RBCK1 has indicated that an N-terminal region containing Leu-142 and Leu-145 and a C-terminal one containing the RING-IBR domain serve as the nuclear export and localization signals, respectively. Thus, RBCK1 is a transcription factor dynamically shuttling between cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, RBCK1 was found to interact with nuclear body proteins, CREB-binding protein (CBP), and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Coexpression of RBCK1 with CBP significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity of RBCK1. Although PML per se showed no effect on the transcriptional activity of RBCK1, the CBP-enhanced activity was repressed by coexpression with PML, presumably through the interaction of PML and CBP. Taken together, our data demonstrate that RBCK1 is involved in transcriptional machinery in the nuclear bodies, and its transcriptional activity is regulated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.","['Tatematsu, Kenji', 'Yoshimoto, Nobuo', 'Koyanagi, Tomoyoshi', 'Tokunaga, Chiharu', 'Tachibana, Taro', 'Yoneda, Yoshihiro', 'Yoshida, Minoru', 'Okajima, Toshihide', 'Tanizawa, Katsuyuki', ""Kuroda, Shun'ichi""]","['Tatematsu K', 'Yoshimoto N', 'Koyanagi T', 'Tokunaga C', 'Tachibana T', 'Yoneda Y', 'Yoshida M', 'Okajima T', 'Tanizawa K', 'Kuroda S']","['Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (protein kinase C-binding protein Beta15, rat)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leucine/chemistry', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/chemistry', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/04/19 09:00,2005/07/20 09:00,['2005/04/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)61464-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M413476200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Jun 17;280(24):22937-44. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M413476200.

Recent studies have shown that patients with increased risk of relapse can be identified by measuring residual leukemic cells, called minimal residual disease (MRD), during clinical remission. Current polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, however, for measuring MRD are cumbersome and time-consuming. To improve and simplify MRD assessment, the author developed a real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) assay for the detection of leukemic cells that harbor the tal-1 deletion. In addition, the author discussed the significance of MRD levels at different stages in treatment and prognosis of children with T-ALL. METHODS: A total of 50 consecutively enrolled patients with T-ALL were analysed for detection of leukemic cells harboring the most common tal-1 deletion. Serial dilutions of leukemic DNA were studied to find the sensitivity of detection with RQ-PCR assay. The MRD of 28 samples in clinical remission from 10 patients were quantified by RQ-PCR assay and limiting dilution assay. The results detected by both methods were compared statistically with correlation analysis. RESULTS: (1) A total of 10 patients presented tal-1 deletion involving the sildb1 breakpoint rearranged to tal1db1 in 50 cases with T-ALL. The breakpoints of relapsed samples are the same as those of the corresponding diagnostic samples; (2) The RQ-PCR assay had a sensitivity of detection of one leukemic cell among 100,000 normal cells. In 24 samples, MRD levels > 10(-5) could be detected with both methods. The percentages of leukemic cells measured by the two methods correlated well (r = 0.898, P < 0.001); (3) The MRD levels of 3 patients out of the 8 cases undergoing disciplinary regimen were over 10(-4) at the end of induction chemotherapy. They all relapsed in bone marrow during chemotherapy. The higher the MRD levels, the earlier the relapse. The other 5 patients with MRD levels < 10(-4) had been relapse-free survival (RFS) for 4-59 months, one of whom with increased MRD levels > 10(-4) for twice at the continuation stage had been RFS for 27 months till now. CONCLUSIONS: The sildb1-taldb1 deletion presents in 20% of T-ALL, and is an ideal PCR marker for its specificity, uniform and stability; The tal-1 RQ-PCR can be used for the rapidly, sensitively and accurately quantitative assessment of MRD in T-ALL with the tal-1 deletion. MRD levels at different stages of chemotherapy have different significance in prognosis and treatment.","['Wang, Lin', 'Zhang, Le-ping', 'Li, Zhi-gang', 'Cheng, Yi-fei', 'Tian, Kai-gong', 'Lu, Ai-dong']","['Wang L', 'Zhang LP', 'Li ZG', 'Cheng YF', 'Tian KG', 'Lu AD']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2005/04/19 09:00,2010/05/12 06:00,['2005/04/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [medline]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2005 Mar;43(3):170-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have demonstrated previously that activation of the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signalling cascade plays a major role in cell growth and survival induced by these proteins. Interaction between STAT5 and p85, the regulatory subunit of the PI3K, has been suggested to be required for this activation. We show in the present study that the scaffolding protein Gab2 [Grb2 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2)-associated binder-2] is an essential component of this interaction. Gab2 is persistently tyrosine-phosphorylated in Ba/F3 cells expressing caSTAT5 (constitutively activated STAT5), independent of JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) activation where it interacts with STAT5, p85 and Grb2, but not with Shp2 [SH2 (Src homology 2)-domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase] proteins. Interaction of STAT5 with Gab2 was also observed in Ba/F3 cells stimulated with interleukin-3 or expressing the oncogenic fusion protein Tel-JAK2. The MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) ERK1 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1) and ERK2 were constitutively activated in the caSTAT5-expressing cells and were found to be required for caSTAT5-induced cell proliferation. Overexpression of Gab2-3YF, a mutant of Gab2 incapable of binding PI3K, inhibited the proliferation and survival of caSTAT5-expressing cells as well as ERK1/2 and Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation. Taken together, our results indicate that Gab2 is required for caSTAT5-induced cell proliferation by regulating both the PI3K/Akt and the Ras/MAPK pathways.","['Nyga, Remy', 'Pecquet, Christian', 'Harir, Noria', 'Gu, Haihua', 'Dhennin-Duthille, Isabelle', 'Regnier, Aline', 'Gouilleux-Gruart, Valerie', 'Lassoued, Kaiss', 'Gouilleux, Fabrice']","['Nyga R', 'Pecquet C', 'Harir N', 'Gu H', 'Dhennin-Duthille I', 'Regnier A', 'Gouilleux-Gruart V', 'Lassoued K', 'Gouilleux F']","[""INSERM E0351, Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Picardie Jule Verne, 3 rue des Louvels, 80036 Amiens, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Milk Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2005/04/19 09:00,2005/11/08 09:00,['2005/04/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20041523 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20041523 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2005 Aug 15;390(Pt 1):359-66. doi: 10.1042/BJ20041523.,,PMC1188271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rather, benzene is thought to act through a series of phenolic- and quinone-based metabolites, especially 1,4-benzoquinone. A recent study found that 1,4-benzoquinone is a potent topoisomerase II poison in vitro and in cultured human cells [Lindsey et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 7363-7374]. Because benzene is metabolized to multiple compounds in addition to 1,4-benzoquinone, we determined the effects of several phenolic metabolites, including catechol, 1,2,4-benzenetriol, 1,4-hydroquinone, 2,2'-biphenol, and 4,4'-biphenol, on the DNA cleavage activity of human topoisomerase II alpha. Only 1,4-hydroquinone generated substantial levels of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission. DNA cleavage with this compound approached levels observed with 1,4-benzoquinone (approximately 5- vs 8-fold) but required a considerably higher concentration (approximately 250 vs 25 microM). 1,4-Hydroquinone is a precursor to 1,4-benzoquinone in the body and can be activated to the quinone by redox cycling. It is not known whether the effects of 1,4-hydroquinone on human topoisomerase II alpha reflect a lower reactivity of the hydroquinone or a low level of activation to the quinone. The high concentration of 1,4-hydroquinone required to increase enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage is consistent with either explanation. 1,4-Hydroquinone displayed attributes against topoisomerase II alpha, including DNA cleavage specificity, that were similar to those of 1,4-benzoquinone. However, 1,4-hydroquinone consistently inhibited DNA ligation to a greater extent than 1,4-benzoquinone. This latter result implies that the hydroquinone may display (at least in part) independent activity against topoisomerase II alpha. The present findings are consistent with the hypothesis that topoisomerase II alpha plays a role in the initiation of specific types of leukemia that are induced by benzene and its metabolites.","['Lindsey, R Hunter Jr', 'Bender, Ryan P', 'Osheroff, Neil']","['Lindsey RH Jr', 'Bender RP', 'Osheroff N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0146, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/drug effects/*physiology', 'Benzene/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/drug effects/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Leukemia/chemically induced']",2005/04/19 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/04/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/tx049659z [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2005 Apr;18(4):761-70. doi: 10.1021/tx049659z.,,,,"['T32 CA009582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 T32 CA09582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM33944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These phosphoramidate prodrugs contain an ester group that undergoes intracellular activation, liberating phosphoramidate anion, which in turn undergoes spontaneous cyclization and P-N bond cleavage to yield the nucleoside monophosphate quantitatively. This approach has now been extended to cytarabine [1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C)], an anti-cancer nucleoside that is limited in its utility because of poor intracellular transport characteristics and weak activity as a substrate for tumor cell kinases. The cytarabine phosphoramidate prodrug 1 has been synthesized and evaluated in comparison with cytarabine for growth inhibitory activity against wild-type, nucleoside transport-deficient, and nucleoside kinase-deficient CEM leukemia cell lines. The prodrug was comparable in growth inhibitory activity (IC50 = 32 nM) to cytarabine (IC50 = 16 nM) in wild-type CCRF-CEM cells following drug treatment for 72 h. The nucleoside transport-deficient CEM/AraC8C exhibited a high level of resistance (6400-fold) to cytarabine but was more sensitive (210-fold resistant vs CCRF-CEM cells) to prodrug 1. Similarly, the deoxycytidine kinase-deficient cell line (CEM/dCK-) was highly resistant to cytarabine (13900-fold) but more sensitive (106-fold resistant vs CCRF-CEM cells) to prodrug 1. These results indicate that prodrug 1 is significantly more potent than cytarabine against transport- and kinase-deficient cell lines and are consistent with a mechanism involving intracellular delivery of cytarabine 5'-monophosphate.","['Tobias, Sandra C', 'Borch, Richard F']","['Tobias SC', 'Borch RF']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and Cancer Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Phosphoric Acids)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9Q189608GB (phosphoramidic acid)']",IM,"['Amides/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Phosphoric Acids/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Prodrugs/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology']",2005/04/19 09:00,2005/07/12 09:00,['2005/04/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/mp034019v [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2004 Mar-Apr;1(2):112-6. doi: 10.1021/mp034019v.,,,,"['R01 CA34619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09634/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To access their ability to deliver 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) 5'-monophosphate to cells, the decomposition pathway of an 18O-labeled AZT amino acid phosphoramidate was investigated by capillary reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography interfaced with negative ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI(-)-MS/MS). 18O-labeled L-AZT tryptophan phosphoramidate methyl ester ([18O]2) was synthesized with an 18O/16O relative ratio of 1.22 +/- 0.18. For CEM cells, a human T-lymphoblast leukemia cell line, incubated with [18O]2, values of 1.55 +/- 0.37, 0.34, and 0.13 were found for the 18O/16O relative ratio of intracellular AZT-MP for time intervals of 0.5, 4, and 20 h, respectively. The decrease in the level of labeled AZT-MP in CEM cells corresponded to a rapid increase in the amount of intracellular AZT presumably by dephosphorylation of AZT-MP. In contrast, for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the 18O/16O relative ratio values of intracellular AZT-MP were 1.43, 1.06, and 0.61 for time intervals of 0.5, 4, and 20 h, respectively. Intracellular AZT in PBMCs was nearly undetectable for each time interval. Taken together, these results are consistent with the detection of direct P-N bond cleavage by CEM cells and PBMCs. However, AZT phosphoramidates are able to more effectively deliver AZT-MP to PBMCs than to CEM cells. Differential expression of 5'-nucleotidase in CEM cells relative to PBMCs is likely the reason for this discrepancy. Although applied to a phosphoramidate pronucleotide, the judicious use of 18O labeling and LC-MS is a general approach that could be applied to the investigation of the intracellular fate of other pronucleotides.","['Kim, Jisook', 'Chou, Tsui-fen', 'Griesgraber, George W', 'Wagner, Carston R']","['Kim J', 'Chou TF', 'Griesgraber GW', 'Wagner CR']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Dideoxynucleotides)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Oxygen Isotopes)', '0 (Phosphoric Acids)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', ""29706-85-2 (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine 5'phosphate)"", '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '9Q189608GB (phosphoramidic acid)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Amides', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dideoxynucleotides', 'Drug Carriers', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling/methods', 'Oxygen/pharmacokinetics', 'Oxygen Isotopes', 'Phosphoric Acids', 'Ribonucleotides/*pharmacokinetics', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Thymine Nucleotides/*pharmacokinetics', 'Zidovudine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics']",2005/04/19 09:00,2005/07/12 09:00,['2005/04/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/mp0340338 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2004 Mar-Apr;1(2):102-11. doi: 10.1021/mp0340338.,,,,['CA 89615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since drug and ionizing radiation resistance is an impediment to successful chemotherapy against cancer, we wanted to check if etoposide/ionizing radiation combined treatment could have a synergic effect to improve cell death in K562, a well-known human erythroleukemia ionizing radiation resistant cell line. In this study, we examined the role played by JNK/SAPK, p53, and mitochondrial pathways in cell death response of K562 cells to etoposide and IR treatment. Our results let us suppose that the induction of cell death, already evident in 15 Gy exposed cells, mainly in 15 Gy plus etoposide, may be mediated by JNK/SAPK pathway. Moreover, p53 is a potential substrate for JNK and may act as a JNK target for etoposide and ionizing radiation. Thus further investigation on these and other molecular mechanisms underlying the cell death response following etoposide and ionizing radiation exposure could be useful to overcome resistance mechanisms in tumor cells.","['Sabatini, Nadia', 'Di Giacomo, Viviana', 'Rapino, Monica', 'Rana, Rosalba', 'Garaci, G', 'Cataldi, Amelia']","['Sabatini N', 'Di Giacomo V', 'Rapino M', 'Rana R', 'Garaci G', 'Cataldi A']","[""Dipartimento di Biomorfologia, Universita G.

II. 6-mercaptopurine-riboside.,298-310,"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been applied to characterize the interaction of 6-mercaptopurine-ribose (6MPR), an active drug used in chemotherapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with a model biological substrate at therapeutic concentrations and as function of the pH value. Therefore, a detailed vibrational analysis of crystalline and solvated (6MPR) based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of the thion and thiol tautomers has been performed. 6MPR adopts the thion tautomeric form in the polycrystalline state. The SERS spectra of 6MPR and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) recorded on silver colloid provided evidence that the ribose derivative shows different adsorption behavior compared with the free base. Under acidic conditions, the adsorption of 6MPR on the metal surface via the N7 and possibly S atoms was proposed to have a perpendicular orientation, while 6MP is probably adsorbed through the N9 and N3 atoms. Under basic conditions both molecules are adsorbed through the N1 and possibly S atoms, but 6MP has a more tilted orientation on the silver colloidal surface while 6MPR adopts a perpendicular orientation. The reorientation of the 6MPR molecule on the surface starts at pH 8 while in the case of 6MP the reorientation starts around pH 6. Under basic conditions, the presence of the anionic molecular species for both molecules is suggested. The deprotonation of 6MP is completed at pH 8 while the deprotonation of the riboside is finished at pH 10. For low drug concentrations under neutral conditions and for pH values 8 and 9, 6MPR interacts with the substrate through both N7 and N1 atoms, possibly forming two differently adsorbed species, while for 6MP only one species adsorbed via N1 was evidenced.","['Szeghalmi, A V', 'Leopold, L', 'Pinzaru, S', 'Chis, V', 'Silaghi-Dumitrescu, I', 'Schmitt, M', 'Popp, J', 'Kiefer, W']","['Szeghalmi AV', 'Leopold L', 'Pinzaru S', 'Chis V', 'Silaghi-Dumitrescu I', 'Schmitt M', 'Popp J', 'Kiefer W']","['Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Wuerzburg, Am Hubland, D-97074, Wuerzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biopolymers,Biopolymers,0372525,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Colloids)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Adsorption', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*chemistry', 'Colloids', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mercaptopurine/*chemistry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Silver', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman/methods', 'Thioinosine/*chemistry']",2005/04/16 09:00,2005/09/16 09:00,['2005/04/16 09:00'],"['2005/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bip.20280 [doi]'],ppublish,Biopolymers. 2005 Aug 15;78(6):298-310. doi: 10.1002/bip.20280.,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We searched our surgical pathology files for malignant lymphomas identified from prostate surgical specimens from 1989 to 2004. Of 4,831 cases of prostate specimens (3,405 biopsies, 266 transurethral resections, 1,160 prostatectomies) examined at the City of Hope during this period, 29 cases of malignant lymphomas involving the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes were identified (0.6%). These malignant lymphomas can be divided into two groups: 1) 18 incidental cases (0.37%) without prior history of malignant lymphoma; and 2) 11 cases (0.23%) with concurrent known malignant lymphoma. For the first group, the patients with pelvic node involvement ranged in age from 59 to 78 years (mean, 69.2 years; median, 70 years), and the patients with prostate involvement ranged in age from 45 to 78 years (mean, 64.6 years; median, 67.5 years). For the second group, the patients ranged in age from 53 to 80 years (mean, 66.8 years; median, 69 years). Diagnoses of all cases were confirmed by immunohistochemistry or molecular analysis. Ten of 18 cases in the first group involved pelvic nodes only, and the other 8 cases were primary prostatic lymphoma. Of 18 cases in the first group, 13 were small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL), 3 were marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, and 1 was mantle cell lymphoma. These lymphomas were not readily apparent in most cases by histologic examination, and may be confused with chronic prostatitis when the prostate was involved or with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia when pelvic nodes were involved. Immunohistochemistry and molecular studies may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. For the second group, prostate and pelvic lymph nodes were involved as part of systemic dissemination of concurrent malignant lymphoma. The diagnosis was usually easily established in these cases. Of 11 cases, 4 were SLL/CLL, 4 were follicular lymphoma, 2 were mantle cell lymphoma, and 1 was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","['Chu, Peiguo G', 'Huang, Qin', 'Weiss, Lawrence M']","['Chu PG', 'Huang Q', 'Weiss LM']","['Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. pchu@coh.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/chemistry/*pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemistry/*pathology/surgery', 'Pelvis/pathology', 'Prostate/chemistry/*pathology/surgery', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/chemistry/pathology/surgery', '*Transurethral Resection of Prostate']",2005/04/16 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/04/16 09:00'],"['2005/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['00000478-200505000-00018 [pii]', '10.1097/01.pas.0000153122.65138.b1 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2005 May;29(5):693-9. doi: 10.1097/01.pas.0000153122.65138.b1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether this applies to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still unclear but of paramount interest, particularly in the safety evaluation of newer immunosuppressive drugs. Reports also indicate a possible increase in the risk of leukaemia in IBD. We therefore assessed the risk of haematopoietic cancers in a large cohort of patients with IBD. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed a population based cohort study using prospectively recorded data, including 47 679 Swedish patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) assembled from regional cohorts of IBD from 1955 to 1990 (n = 8028) and from the Inpatient Register of 1964-2000 (n = 45 060), with follow up until 2001. Relative risks were expressed as standardised incidence ratios (SIR). RESULTS: Overall, we observed 264 haematopoietic cancers during follow up, which corresponded to a borderline significant 20% increased risk in both UC and CD. In UC, lymphomas occurred as expected (SIR 1.0, n = 87) but myeloid leukaemia occurred significantly more often than expected (SIR 1.8, n = 32). In CD, there was a borderline significant increased lymphoma risk (SIR 1.3, n = 65), essentially confined to the first years of follow up. Proxy markers of disease activity had little impact on lymphoma risk. CONCLUSION: On average, patients with IBD have a marginally increased risk of haematopoietic cancer. In UC, this is accounted for by an excess of myeloid leukaemia. In CD, a modest short term increase in the risk of lymphoma of unknown significance cannot be excluded but any long term risk increase seems unlikely.","['Askling, J', 'Brandt, L', 'Lapidus, A', 'Karlen, P', 'Bjorkholm, M', 'Lofberg, R', 'Ekbom, A']","['Askling J', 'Brandt L', 'Lapidus A', 'Karlen P', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Lofberg R', 'Ekbom A']","['Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet and Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden. johan.askling@medks.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gut,Gut,2985108R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/complications/epidemiology', 'Crohn Disease/complications/epidemiology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*complications/epidemiology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2005/04/16 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/04/16 09:00'],"['2005/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['54/5/617 [pii]', '10.1136/gut.2004.051771 [doi]']",ppublish,Gut. 2005 May;54(5):617-22. doi: 10.1136/gut.2004.051771.,,PMC1774486,,,,,,,,['Gut. 2005 May;54(5):574-5.

Analysis of bone sections shows small to large foci of similarly well-differentiated mast cells.

We report the gene expression profiles of 78 de novo AMLs (72 with normal karyotype; 6 without major chromosomal abnormalities) that were characterized for the subcellular localization and mutation status of NPM. Unsupervised clustering clearly separated NPMc+ from NPMc- AMLs, regardless of the presence of FLT3 mutations or non-major chromosomal rearrangements, supporting the concept that NPMc+ AML represents a distinct entity. The molecular signature of NPMc+ AML includes up-regulation of several genes putatively involved in the maintenance of a stem-cell phenotype, suggesting that NPMc+ AML may derive from a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor.","['Alcalay, Myriam', 'Tiacci, Enrico', 'Bergomas, Roberta', 'Bigerna, Barbara', 'Venturini, Elisa', 'Minardi, Simone P', 'Meani, Natalia', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Bernard, Loris', 'Tizzoni, Laura', 'Volorio, Sara', 'Luzi, Lucilla', 'Colombo, Emanuela', 'Lo Coco, Francesco', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Falini, Brunangelo', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe']","['Alcalay M', 'Tiacci E', 'Bergomas R', 'Bigerna B', 'Venturini E', 'Minardi SP', 'Meani N', 'Diverio D', 'Bernard L', 'Tizzoni L', 'Volorio S', 'Luzi L', 'Colombo E', 'Lo Coco F', 'Mecucci C', 'Falini B', 'Pelicci PG']","['IFOM-IEO Campus, Via Adamello 16, 20139, Milan, Italy. myriam.alcalay@ifom-ieo-campus.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cytoplasm/*chemistry', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/04/16 09:00,2005/09/22 09:00,['2005/04/16 09:00'],"['2005/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53203-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-02-0560 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Aug 1;106(3):899-902. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-02-0560.

For example, leukemia-free patients surviving a bone marrow transplant are at risk of developing acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease, or they might develop infections. In this situation, competing risks models provide a natural framework to describe the disease. When incorporating covariates influencing the transition intensities, an obvious approach is to use Cox's proportional hazards model for each of the transitions separately. A practical problem then is how to deal with the abundance of regression parameters. Our objective is to describe the competing risks model in fewer parameters, both in order to avoid imprecise estimation in transitions with rare events and in order to facilitate interpretation of these estimates. Suppose that the regression parameters are gathered into a p x K matrix B, with p and K as the number of covariates and transitions, respectively. We propose the use of reduced rank models, where B is required to be of lower rank R, smaller than both p and K. One way to achieve this is to write B = AGamma(intercal) with A and Gamma matrices of dimensions p x R and K x R, respectively. We shall outline an algorithm to obtain estimates and their standard errors in a reduced rank proportional hazards model for competing risks and illustrate the approach on a competing risks model applied to 8966 leukemia patients from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.","['Fiocco, M', 'Putter, H', 'Van Houwelingen, J C']","['Fiocco M', 'Putter H', 'Van Houwelingen JC']","['Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, P.O.

The nuclear transcription factor, NF-kappaB, is induced by HTLV-I and is central to the ensuing neoplasia. To examine the effect of a novel NF-kappaB inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), on ATL in vivo, we developed an improved severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model for ATL. Five-week-old SCID mice in which natural killer (NK) cell activity had been eliminated were inoculated intraperitoneally with the HTLV-I-infected cell lines, TL-Om1, MT-1, MT-2 and HUT-102. No engraftment of TL-Om1 cells and little tumorigenesis of MT-1 cells were detected 40 days after injection. In contrast, inoculation of mice with MT-2 and HUT-102 cells elicited high mortality, 100% frequency of gross tumor formation and tumor cell infiltration of various organs, all of which were reduced by coadministration of DHMEQ during the inoculation. Moreover, tumors from mice treated with DHMEQ had a high frequency of apoptosis. These results suggest that DHMEQ induces apoptosis in HTLV-I-transformed cells in vivo, resulting in inhibition of tumor formation and organ infiltration, thereby enhancing survival.","['Ohsugi, Takeo', 'Horie, Ryouichi', 'Kumasaka, Toshio', 'Ishida, Akira', 'Ishida, Takaomi', 'Yamaguchi, Kazunari', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Umezawa, Kazuo', 'Urano, Toru']","['Ohsugi T', 'Horie R', 'Kumasaka T', 'Ishida A', 'Ishida T', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Watanabe T', 'Umezawa K', 'Urano T']","['Division of Microbiology and Genetics, Center for Animal Resources and Development, Institute of Resource Development and Analysis, Kumamoto University, 2-2-1 Honjo, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan. ohsugi@gpo.kumamoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclohexanones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cyclohexanones/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2005/04/16 09:00,2005/09/21 09:00,['2005/04/16 09:00'],"['2005/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgi095 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgi095 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2005 Aug;26(8):1382-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgi095.

Activating mutations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3), notably, internal tandem duplications in the juxtamembrane domain (FLT-3 ITD), have been causally linked to acute myeloid leukemia. As we describe here, FLT-3 ITD exists predominantly in an immature, underglycosylated 130-kDa form, whereas wild-type FLT-3 is expressed predominantly as a mature, complex glycosylated 150-kDa molecule. Endogenous FLT-3 ITD, but little wild-type FLT-3, is detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment. Conversely, cell surface expression of FLT-3 ITD is less efficient than that of wild-type FLT-3. Inhibition of FLT-3 ITD kinase by small molecules, inactivating point mutations, or coexpression with the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) SHP-1, PTP1B, and PTP-PEST but not RPTPalpha promotes complex glycosylation and surface localization. However, PTP coexpression has no effect on the maturation of a surface glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus. The maturation of wild-type FLT-3 is impaired by general PTP inhibition or by suppression of endogenous PTP1B. Enhanced complex formation of FLT-3 ITD with the ER-resident chaperone calnexin indicates that its retention in the ER is related to inefficient folding. The regulation of RTK maturation by tyrosine phosphorylation was observed with other RTKs as well, defines a possible role for ER-resident PTPs, and may be related to the altered signaling quality of constitutively active, transforming RTK mutants.","['Schmidt-Arras, Dirk-E', 'Bohmer, Annette', 'Markova, Boyka', 'Choudhary, Chunaram', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Bohmer, Frank-D']","['Schmidt-Arras DE', 'Bohmer A', 'Markova B', 'Choudhary C', 'Serve H', 'Bohmer FD']","['Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Medical Faculty, Friedrich Schiller University, Drackendorfer Strasse 1, D-07747 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '139873-08-8 (Calnexin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calnexin/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/04/16 09:00,2005/06/15 09:00,['2005/04/16 09:00'],"['2005/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/9/3690 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.9.3690-3703.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 May;25(9):3690-703. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.9.3690-3703.2005.,,PMC1084288,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since PIASy itself was also modified with SUMO-1, we studied the role of sumoylation of PIASy in the regulation of Tcf-4. Lys(35) was found to be a sumoylation site of PIASy. PIASy(K35R), in which Lys(35) was mutated to Arg, did not enhance sumoylation of Tcf-4, although this PIASy mutant did not lose the ligase activity of sumoylation for other proteins. Wild-type PIASy and PIASy(K35R) showed a distinct distribution in the nucleus, although both were colocalized with Tcf-4. Promyelocytic leukemia protein, which is involved in transcriptional regulation, was associated with PIASy(K35R) more frequently than wild-type PIASy in the nucleus. PIASy(K35R) could not stimulate the transcriptional activity of Tcf-4 under the conditions in which wild-type PIASy enhanced it. Conjugation of SUMO-1 to the amino terminus of PIASy(K35R) neither enhanced sumoylation of Tcf-4 nor stimulated the transcriptional activity of Tcf-4. These results suggest that sumoylation of Lys(35) in PIASy determines the nuclear localization of PIASy and that it is necessary for PIASy-dependent sumoylation and transcriptional activation of Tcf-4.","['Ihara, Motomasa', 'Yamamoto, Hideki', 'Kikuchi, Akira']","['Ihara M', 'Yamamoto H', 'Kikuchi A']","['Department of Biochemistry, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8551, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PIAS4 protein, human)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Animals', 'Arginine/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*physiology', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*physiology']",2005/04/16 09:00,2005/06/15 09:00,['2005/04/16 09:00'],"['2005/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/9/3506 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.9.3506-3518.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 May;25(9):3506-18. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.9.3506-3518.2005.,,PMC1084305,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apart from morphological changes in cells, apoptosis is characterized by fragmentation of nuclear DNA. The characteristic DNA ladder formation that is observed on gel electrophoresis does not reflect the DNA breakdown in individual cells; contributions from small subpopulations are usually overlooked. On the other hand, alkaline comet assay as measured by single cell gel electrophoresis accurately measures DNA fragmentation at a single cell level. The comet assay was originally developed as a cytogenetic test to measure the genotoxicity of various chemicals. However, the comet image generated by an apoptotic cell is different from that obtained with a cell treated for a short time with a genotoxic agent. In the present study using human leukemic cells, typical apoptotic features such as morphological characteristics, FACS analysis, caspase activation, and expression of apoptosis-related genes as induced by tea polyphenols have been found to correlate with the comet tail formation. It is apparent from the high degree of correlation observed between the comet tail moment and each parameter of apoptosis that the comet assay can accurately reflect the measure of DNA fragmentation and, hence, can be used to detect a cell undergoing apoptosis.","['Kundu, Trina', 'Bhattacharya, Rathin K', 'Siddiqi, Maqsood', 'Roy, Madhumita']","['Kundu T', 'Bhattacharya RK', 'Siddiqi M', 'Roy M']","['Department of Environmental Carcinogenesis and Toxicology, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata 700 026, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol,"Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer",8501420,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biflavonoids)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Tea)', '1IA46M0D13 (theaflavin)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biflavonoids/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Comet Assay', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Polyphenols', '*Tea']",2005/04/16 09:00,2005/05/28 09:00,['2005/04/16 09:00'],"['2005/04/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['25da730331f0aac4,11497e613458bc9a [pii]', '10.1615/jenvpathtoxoncol.v24.i2.50 [doi]']",ppublish,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol. 2005;24(2):115-28. doi: 10.1615/jenvpathtoxoncol.v24.i2.50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since further investigations were needed, the patient's blood sample was sent to a reference laboratory where anti-Rg(a) was identified. Since the percentage of antigen-positive cells in the red cell panel was low, crossmatch compatible units of RBCs were transfused with no discernible immediate or delayed transfusion reaction.

METHODS: Between 1998 and 2002, the authors treated 117 newly diagnosed patients (acute promyelocytic leukemia excluded) with AML > or = 60 years (median, 67 years; range, 60-82 years). Karyotype (Medical Research Council classification) at diagnosis was categorized as good risk (n = 3), intermediate risk (n = 69), adverse risk (n = 26), and suboptimal/not done (n = 19). A normal karyotype was seen in 41 patients and 40 (34%) had secondary AML. RESULTS: The outcome of induction included the following: CR, 62 (53%); early death, 5 (4%); death during hypoplasia, 14 (12%); and resistant disease, 36 (31%). The 3-year event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 9% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3-16%) and 17% (95% CI, 9-29%), respectively. In a univariate analysis, cytogenetics, lactate dehydrogenase level, leukocyte count, and performance status were the significant factors for EFS and OS. Age was not a significant prognostic factor for either CR or survival. In a multivariate model, adverse-risk cytogenetics, previous history of myelodysplastic syndrome or antecedent hematologic disorder, and high leukocyte count (> 30 x 10(9)/L) were independent adverse prognostic factors for survival. The impact of adverse karyotype on EFS and OS was time dependent and was observed after 50 and 150 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that candidacy for intensive therapy in older patients should be based on biologic features of disease and fitness, rather than on age.","['Gupta, Vikas', 'Chun, Kathy', 'Yi, Qi-Long', 'Minden, Mark', 'Schuh, Andre', 'Wells, Richard', 'Brandwein, Joseph']","['Gupta V', 'Chun K', 'Yi QL', 'Minden M', 'Schuh A', 'Wells R', 'Brandwein J']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital/University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/15 09:00,2005/07/15 09:00,['2005/04/15 09:00'],"['2005/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21006 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 May 15;103(10):2082-90. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of this study were to update the long-term experience with imatinib in patients who had accelerated-phase CML and to compare outcomes with historic experience. METHODS: The outcomes of 176 patients who received treatment with imatinib were reviewed and compared with the outcomes of 213 historic control patients with accelerated-phase CML who received treatment with interferon-alpha or with other modalities. RESULTS: With imatinib, the complete hematologic response rate was 82% versus a rate < or = 50% for others, and the complete cytogenetic response rate was 43% versus rates of 0-6% for others. The estimated 4-year survival rates were 53% with imatinib, 42% with interferon-alpha, and 0-21% for others. A multivariate analysis of the total population of 389 patients indicated that imatinib therapy (vs. other therapies) was an independent, favorable prognostic factor for survival (P < 0.0001; hazard rate, 0.62). A subset analysis that included only patients who were treated with imatinib and interferon-alpha (276 patients) also identified imatinib as an independent favorable prognostic factor (P < 0.0001; hazard rate, 0.65). The 3-month cytogenetic response to imatinib was associated with significantly different survival outcomes (P < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis that included pretreatment characteristics and 3-month cytogenetic response among 150 patients who received imatinib and were alive at 3 months identified only 2 adverse independent prognostic factors: lack of a cytogenetic response at 3 months (P < 0.001) and anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL; P = 0.003). Patients who had neither factor (41%) had an estimated 4-year survival rate of 88%; in the other patients, the 4-year survival rate was < or = 60%. This may have implications in relation to subsequent therapy, because, according to the outcomes of patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation in accelerated phase at the authors' institution and from literature reports, the estimates of 5-year survival were 25-30%. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that imatinib improved survival compared with other therapies in patients with accelerated-phase CML.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Talpaz, Moshe', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Giles, Francis', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Champlin, Richard', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Kantarjian H', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles F', 'Faderl S', 'Verstovsek S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Shan J', 'Rios MB', 'Champlin R', 'de Lima M', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

The infected cells exhibit an unusual EBV program, they express the nuclear proteins but not latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1). Similar cells were encountered in lymphoid tissues of infectious mononucleosis (IM) patients and in lymphoproliferations of immunosuppressed patients. EBV infected B-CLL cells can be regarded as model for this viral program. In B cells the regulation of LMP-1 is executed mainly by EBV encoded nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2), interacting with several cellular proteins and these complexes bind to specific sequences in the LMP-1 promoter. ATF2 and c-Jun were shown to be among the interacting partners of EBNA-2. These molecules can be detected in experimentally infected B lymphocytes. We found c-Jun and/or phosphorylated ATF-2 (p-ATF-2) expression in some B-CLL ex vivo samples. They disappeared or their expression declined promptly in explanted cells, even if they were infected with EBV in vitro. Activation of the infected B-CLL cells by exposure to CD40L was accompanied by p-ATF-2 and c-Jun but not by LMP-1 expression. In one of three clones tested, subsequent treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), TSA or n-butyrate, could induce LMP-1.

This study investigated the immunohistochemical profile of BP1, to determine whether the expression of BP1 protein correlated with breast tumor progression and invasion and whether BP1 was co-localized with erbB2. DESIGN: Paraffin sections from normal reduction mammoplasties (n = 34) and a variety of in situ and invasive breast cancers (n = 270) were either singly immunostained for BP1, or doubly immunostained for BP1 plus either erbB2 or Ki-67. RESULTS: The prevalence of BP1 positive cells and the intensity of BP1 immunoreactivity increased with the extent of ductal proliferation and carcinogenesis. BP1 expression was barely detectable in normal reduction mammoplasties compared to distinct staining in 21, 46, and 81% of hyperplastic, in situ, and infiltrating lesions, respectively. In cases with co-existing normal, hyperplastic, in situ, and invasive lesions, the tumor cells of the invasive lesions consistently showed the highest frequency and the highest intensity of BP1 immunostaining, followed by in situ tumor cells. Double immunostaining revealed that BP1 co-localized with a subset of erbB2 positive cells in all 15 in situ and IDC tumors examined, and that BP1 positive cells had a substantially higher proliferation rate than morphologically similar cells without BP1 expression. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that BP1 is an important upstream factor in an oncogenic pathway, and that expression of BP1 may reliably reflect or directly contribute to tumor progression and/or invasion.","['Man, Yan-gao', 'Fu, Sidney W', 'Schwartz, Arnold', 'Pinzone, Joseph J', 'Simmens, Samuel J', 'Berg, Patricia E']","['Man YG', 'Fu SW', 'Schwartz A', 'Pinzone JJ', 'Simmens SJ', 'Berg PE']","['Department of Gynecologic and Breast Pathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, The George Washington University Medical Center, 2300 Eye Street, Washington, DC 20037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0 (DLX4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis']",2005/04/15 09:00,2005/07/21 09:00,['2005/04/15 09:00'],"['2005/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10549-004-4492-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2005 Apr;90(3):241-7. doi: 10.1007/s10549-004-4492-9.,,,,"['CA 91149/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA 101875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cycle state decides cells' fates, which includes self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. Proper cell cycle regulation is a pivotal element for the maintenance of hematopoiesis homeostasis. HTm4 is a newly identified specific cell cycle regulator of the hematopoietic cell. Through interacting with KAP-CDK2 complex, it arrests cells in G(0)/G(1) phase. K562 is a human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell; it could be induced to megakaryoblast by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Such differentiation must be associated with cell cycle change. To further clarify HTm4's function in hematopoietic cell cycle regulation, K562 cells were treated with PMA. Cell cycle change was analysed using flow cytometric system. And during the induction process gene expression of HTm4 as well as CycleE and CDK2, which are responsible for G(1) to S transition, were analysed using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The C-terminal domain of HTm4 protein has been shown to be important for HTm4's binding with KAP-CDK2 complex. To determine its impact on HTm4's function, HTm4 and C-terminal truncated HTm4 (HTm4-ct) were transfected into K562 cells using Tet-Off regulation expression system. Their influence on cell cycle was observed. The results showed that PMA induced both expansion and differentiation of K562 cells as measured by cell number count and NBT staining respectively. During PMA treatment, G(0)/G(1) cell proportion and HTm4 expression displayed coordinated change, which suggested that HTm4 might drive K562 cells out of cell cycle but was not involved in the quiescence maintenance. Additionally, transfection of HTm4 caused G(0)/G(1) arrest in K562 cells, while transfection of HTm4-ct did not. It is therefore suggested that the C-terminal domain is important for the function of HTm4 in cell cycle regulation.","['Li, Jin', 'Xie, Chao', 'Xie, Xiao-Yan', 'Wang, Dong-Mei', 'Pei, Xue-Tao']","['Li J', 'Xie C', 'Xie XY', 'Wang DM', 'Pei XT']","['Department of Stem Cell Biology, Beijing Institute of Transfusion Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Sheng Li Xue Bao,Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],20730130R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MS4A3 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2005/04/15 09:00,2012/06/29 06:00,['2005/04/15 09:00'],"['2005/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sheng Li Xue Bao. 2005 Apr 25;57(2):188-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two populations were matched by adjusting the primary risk factor, the conditioning regimen, in a series of Cox models for age, sex, donor type, remission status at transplant and analyzed for its effect on TRM, relapse incidence, event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS). After adjustment, a significant reduction of TRM became evident for the RIC population (hazard ratio (HR) 0.4 (95% confidence interval 0.18-0.9); P=0.03). On the other hand, RIC was associated with an increased relapse incidence (HR 2.65 (0.98-7.12); P=0.054). There was no significant difference between RIC and MC in terms of EFS (HR 0.69 (0.38-1.25); P=0.22) and OS (HR 0.65 (0.33-1.28); P=0.21).

Its functions during cell cycle progression of somatic cells are incompletely understood. Here, we have analysed the cell cycle functions of cyclin A1 in transformed and nontransformed cells. Murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from cyclin A1-deficient mice were significantly impaired in their proliferative capacity. In accordance, cyclin A1-/- cells accumulated in G1 and G2/M phase while the percentage of S phase cells decreased. Also, lectin stimulated splenic lymphocytes from cyclin A1-/- mice proliferated slower than their wild-type counterparts. Forced cyclin A1 overexpression in NIH3T3 cells and in U937 leukemic cells either by transient transfection or by retroviral infection enhanced S phase entry. Consequently, siRNA mediated silencing of cyclin A1 in highly cyclin A1 expressing ML1 leukemic cells significantly slowed S phase entry, decreased proliferation and inhibited colony formation. Taken together, these analyses demonstrate that cyclin A1 contributes to G1 to S cell cycle progression in somatic cells. Cyclin A1 overexpression enhances S phase entry consistent with an oncogenic function. Finally, cyclin A1 might be a therapeutic target since its silencing inhibited leukemia cell growth.","['Ji, Ping', 'Agrawal, Shuchi', 'Diederichs, Sven', 'Baumer, Nicole', 'Becker, Annette', 'Cauvet, Thomas', 'Kowski, Sascha', 'Beger, Carmela', 'Welte, Karl', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Ji P', 'Agrawal S', 'Diederichs S', 'Baumer N', 'Becker A', 'Cauvet T', 'Kowski S', 'Beger C', 'Welte K', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Munster, Domagkstr. 3, 48149 Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CCNA1 protein, human)', '0 (Ccna1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclin A/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin A1', 'Female', '*G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oligoribonucleotides', '*S Phase', 'U937 Cells']",2005/04/15 09:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2005/04/15 09:00'],"['2005/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208356 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208356 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Apr 14;24(16):2739-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208356.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RasGRP1 is highly expressed on most T lymphocytic leukemias and is a common site of proviral insertion in retrovirus-induced murine T-cell lymphomas. We used RasGRP1 transgenic mice to determine if deregulated expression of RasGRP1 has a causative role in the development of T-cell malignancies. Thymic lymphomas occurred in three different RasGRP1 transgenic mouse lines. Thymocyte transformation correlated with high transgene expression in early stage lymphomas, indicating that deregulated RasGRP1 expression contributed to the initiation of lymphomagenesis. Expression of the positively selectable H-Y TCR accelerated lymphomagenesis in RasGRP1 transgenic mice. However, the transformed thymocytes lacked markers of positive selection and lymphomas occurred when positive selection was precluded by negative selection of the H-Y TCR. Therefore, initiation of lymphomagenesis via RasGRP1 was not associated with TCR-dependent positive selection of thymocytes. Thymic lymphomas occurred in RasGRP1 transgenic/Rag2-/- mice, demonstrating that neither TCR nor pre-TCR were required for RasGRP1-driven lymphomagenesis. The RasGRP1 transgene conferred pre-TCR-independent survival and proliferation of immature thymocytes, suggesting that deregulated expression of RasGRP1 promotes lymphomagenesis by expanding the pool of thymocytes which are susceptible to transformation.","['Klinger, Mark B', 'Guilbault, Benoit', 'Goulding, Rebecca E', 'Kay, Robert J']","['Klinger MB', 'Guilbault B', 'Goulding RE', 'Kay RJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Rasgrp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Transgenes']",2005/04/15 09:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2005/04/15 09:00'],"['2005/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208334 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208334 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Apr 14;24(16):2695-704. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208334.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histologic examination and electron microscopy were performed on the corneal buttons obtained. RESULTS: Histology and electron microscopy confirmed pancorneal extracellular calcium deposition with increasing severity in each consecutive keratoplasty. Calcification was associated with necrosis and inflammation of the corneal stroma. Clinically unsuspected fungal keratitis was observed in 1 specimen.

We studied acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with the t(15;17) translocation that developed after treatment of breast or laryngeal cancer with chemotherapeutic agents that poison topoisomerase II. METHODS: We used long-range polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis to characterize t(15;17) genomic breakpoints in therapy-related APL. To determine whether topoisomerase II was directly involved in mediating breaks of double-stranded DNA at the observed translocation breakpoints, we used a functional in vitro assay to examine topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage in the normal homologues of the PML and RARA breakpoints. RESULTS: Translocation breakpoints in APL that developed after exposure to mitoxantrone, a topoisomerase II poison, were tightly clustered in an 8-bp region within PML intron 6. In functional assays, this ""hot spot"" and the corresponding RARA breakpoints were common sites of mitoxantrone-induced cleavage by topoisomerase II. Etoposide and doxorubicin also induced cleavage by topoisomerase II at the translocation breakpoints in APL arising after exposure to these agents. Short, homologous sequences in PML and RARA suggested the occurrence of DNA repair by means of the nonhomologous end-joining pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-induced cleavage of DNA by topoisomerase II mediates the formation of chromosomal translocation breakpoints in mitoxantrone-related APL and in APL that occurs after therapy with other topoisomerase II poisons.","['Mistry, Anita R', 'Felix, Carolyn A', 'Whitmarsh, Ryan J', 'Mason, Annabel', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Cassinat, Bruno', 'Parry, Anne', 'Walz, Christoph', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Segal, Mark R', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Blair, Ian A', 'Osheroff, Neil', 'Peniket, Andrew J', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Solomon, Ellen', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Grimwade, David']","['Mistry AR', 'Felix CA', 'Whitmarsh RJ', 'Mason A', 'Reiter A', 'Cassinat B', 'Parry A', 'Walz C', 'Wiemels JL', 'Segal MR', 'Ades L', 'Blair IA', 'Osheroff N', 'Peniket AJ', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Cross NC', 'Chomienne C', 'Solomon E', 'Fenaux P', 'Grimwade D']","[""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Guy's, King's, and St. Thomas' School of Medicine, London.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/chemically induced/enzymology/*genetics', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/enzymology/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/04/15 09:00,2005/04/20 09:00,['2005/04/15 09:00'],"['2005/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['352/15/1529 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa042715 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2005 Apr 14;352(15):1529-38. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa042715.,,,,"['CA89032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM33944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA77683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA80175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0185469/PHS HHS/United States']",,,['Copyright 2005 Massachusetts Medical Society.'],,,['N Engl J Med. 2005 Apr 14;352(15):1591-4.

Here, we have used Drosophila genetics to investigate two models of AML1-ETO function. In the first model, AML1-ETO is a constitutive transcriptional repressor of AML1 target genes, regardless of whether they are normally activated or repressed by AML1. In the second model, AML1-ETO dominantly interferes with AML1 activity by, for example, competing for a common co-factor. To discriminate between these models, the effects of expressing AML1-ETO were characterized and compared with loss-of-function phenotypes of lozenge (lz), an AML1 homolog expressed during Drosophila eye development. We also present results of genetic interaction experiments with AML1 co-factors that are not consistent with AML1-ETO behaving as a dominant-negative factor.

We show here that BLM is a substrate for small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification, with lysines at K317, K331, K334 and K347 being preferred sites of modification. Unlike normal BLM, a double mutant BLM protein with lysine to arginine substitutions at residues 317 and 331 was not modified by SUMO, and it failed to localize efficiently to the PML nuclear bodies. Rather, double mutant BLM protein induced the formation of DNA damage-induced foci (DDI) that contained BRCA1 protein and phosphorylated histone H2AX. Double mutant BLM only partially complemented the genomic instability phenotypes of Bloom syndrome cells as assessed by sister-chromatid exchange and micronuclei formation assays.

Patients with clinically suspected resectable early stage lung cancer were eligible for enrollment if they had no evidence of mediastinal or hilar adenopathy on CT scan or if they had CT evidence of potential N2 or N3 disease (lymph node > or =1.0 cm) but with negative mediastinoscopy. No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy was permitted. RESULTS: Of the 502 patients felt to have clinical stage 1 NSCLC enrolled in CALGB 9761, 489 underwent resection with complete surgical staging and routine histopathologic analysis. From these 489 patients, only 422 (86.3%) turned out to have pathologically documented NSCLC. Of these 422 patients, 302 (71.6%) had pathologic stage 1 disease (173 stage 1A and 129 stage 1B). Despite clinical assessment of stage 1 disease, 59 (14%) patients had pathologic stage 2 disease, 57 (13.5%) had stage 3 disease, and four (0.9%) patients had stage 4 disease. Of the patients undergoing resection for clinical stage 1 NSCLC, 65 patients did not have NSCLC (44 had benign disease and 21 had malignancies other than NSCLC) and two additional patients had dual synchronous primary NSCLC tumors and were not eligible for the study. Overall, only 61.7% (302 of 489) of patients with suspected stage 1 NSCLC disease retained that stage and diagnosis after complete surgical staging, while 38.3% had an inaccurate pre-operative clinical stage or diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this prospective trial demonstrate the poor predictive value of current clinical staging techniques in early stage NSCLC. These findings will serve as a benchmark for comparison of future clinical imaging modalities and other tests evaluating early stage NSCLC.","[""D'Cunha, Jonathan"", 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Herzan, Debra L', 'Patterson, G Alexander', 'Kohman, Leslie J', 'Harpole, David H', 'Kernstine, Kemp H', 'Kern, Jeffrey A', 'Green, Mark R', 'Maddaus, Michael A', 'Kratzke, Robert A']","[""D'Cunha J"", 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Herzan DL', 'Patterson GA', 'Kohman LJ', 'Harpole DH', 'Kernstine KH', 'Kern JA', 'Green MR', 'Maddaus MA', 'Kratzke RA']","['Division of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8800805,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*pathology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', 'Mediastinoscopy', 'Neoplasm Staging/*methods/*standards', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2005/04/15 09:00,2005/07/20 09:00,['2005/04/15 09:00'],"['2004/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2004/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0169-5002(04)00575-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lungcan.2004.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Lung Cancer. 2005 May;48(2):241-6. doi: 10.1016/j.lungcan.2004.11.006.

We, therefore, examined the regulation of PKCtheta activity in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). We demonstrated that PMA did not stimulate PKCtheta activation and phospholipase C inhibition did not block anti-CD3-stimulated PKCtheta activation in a CTL clone. This suggests that diacylglycerol is neither sufficient nor required for PKCtheta activation. Furthermore, PKCtheta was only activated in a CTL clone stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 but not soluble anti-CD3. However, PMA or cross-linked anti-CD3 stimulated phosphorylation of PKCtheta as measured by a migratory shift, suggesting that phosphorylation was not sufficient for activity. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity was required for anti-CD3, but not PMA, stimulated phosphorylation and for immobilized anti-CD3-triggered PKCtheta activity. A substantial fraction of PKCtheta was constitutively membrane associated and PMA or CD3 stimulation did not significantly increase membrane association.

Soon afterwards, the asparaginase of bacterial origin was isolated. The asparaginases of bacterial origin induce anti-asparaginase neutralising antibodies in a large proportion of patients (44-60%), thus negating the specific enzymatic activity and resulting in failure of the target amino acid deamination in serum. There is immunological cross-reaction between the antibodies against various formulations of native Escherichia coli-asparaginase and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-asparaginases, but not to Erwinia asparaginase, as suggested by laboratory preclinical findings. This evidence was strongly inferred from the interim analyses in the Children's Cancer Group (CCG)-1961 study. Thus, anti-E. coli or PEG-asparaginase antibodies seropositive patients may benefit from the Erwinia asparaginase. The inter-relationships between asparaginase activity, asparagine (ASN) and glutamine deamination remain largely unexplored in patients. Studies have shown that ASN depletion is insufficient to induce apoptosis in T lymphoblasts in vitro and that the inhibitory concentration of CEM T-cell line is correlated with the asparaginase concentration responsible for 50% glutamine deamination. The optimal catalysis of ASN and glutamine deamination in serum by asparaginase induces apoptosis of leukaemic lymphoblasts. The percentage of ASN and glutamine deamination was predicted by asparaginase activity. Asparaginase activity of 0.1 IU/mL provided insufficient depletion of both amino acids in high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients. With increasing glutamine deamination, mean asparaginase activities and percentages of post-treatment samples with effective ASN depletion (<3 micromol/L) increase. Both glutamine and ASN deamination are predicted by asparaginase activity. Further population analyses resulted in identification of sigmoid relationships between asparaginase levels and post-treatment glutamine and ASN deamination.Furthermore, pharmacodynamic analyses strongly suggested that >/=90% deamination of glutamine must occur before optimal ASN deamination takes place, due to the de novo ASN biosynthesis by the liver. These pharmacodynamic results from the best-fit population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model obtained from nonlinear mixed effects model pharmacodynamic analyses for standard-risk ALL patients are similar. These analyses produced the following results: (i) asparaginase activity </=0.4 IU/mL provided insufficient deamination of ASN, whereas >0.4-0.7 IU/mL was required for optimal (90%) ASN and glutamine deamination; and (ii) deamination of glutamine is dependent on asparaginase activity and it correlates with enhanced serum ASN deamination. Thus, glutamine deamination enhances asparaginase efficacy in ALL patients. Deamination of ASN >/=90% of control or ASN concentration <3 micromol/L may be associated with improved survival in this subset of patients. Our findings support the pharmacodynamic mechanism of PEG-asparaginase for disease control in ALL patients. These results taken together strongly support new experimental approaches for application of population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses to further enhance survival of leukaemia patients.","['Avramis, Vassilios I', 'Panosyan, Eduard H']","['Avramis VI', 'Panosyan EH']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA. vavramis@chla.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/history/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/history/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/enzymology', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2005/04/15 09:00,2005/08/04 09:00,['2005/04/15 09:00'],"['2005/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['4443 [pii]', '10.2165/00003088-200544040-00003 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2005;44(4):367-93. doi: 10.2165/00003088-200544040-00003.,,,88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reversing MDR is possible by using agents that inhibit the activity of P-gp. In this study, we tried to elucidate the prognostic relevance of P-gp in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and neuroblastoma. In a first prospective study in childhood ALL, an immunocytochemical APAAP assay was applied. Children scoring positive had a significantly worse outcome than those with a negative test result. In a second prospective study, the prognostic relevance of P-gp was confirmed, using the combination of immunocytochemistry and a functional flow cytometric assay. The combination of immunocytochemistry with the flow cytometric functional assay is being promoted as the most sensitive and clinically relevant amongst the different techniques. In neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma, P-gp is detected by different assays: immunocytochemistry, flow cytometric immunological and functional tests and an in vivo imaging technique using 99mTc sestamibi. Immunocytochemistry alone did not provide a prognostic role for P-gp in neuroblastoma. On the contrary, using flow cytometric tests, many neuroblastomas scored positive and a discordance was found between the expression and activity of P-gp. P-gp was found more frequently in low-stage neuroblastoma, differentiated tumours and tumours after chemotherapy. A good correlation between flow cytometric results and imaging results was seen. Consequently, 99mTc sestamibi scintigraphy is not useful as an in vivo predictor of MDR in neuroblastoma. Unlike the findings in childhood ALL, P-gp does not contribute to MDR in neuroblastoma but seems to be a marker of differentiation.","['De Moerloose, B']",['De Moerloose B'],"['UZ Gent, Kliniek voor Kinderziekten C.

There are different types of immunodepression related to the disease, the moment of its evolution and the treatment received. For practical purposes we will distinguish between patients with severe neutropenia, those with some alteration to humoral immunity and, finally, cellular immunodeficiencies. There are no immunodeficiencies associated to each disease, instead several immunitarian deficiencies can be associated in a single clinical entity. Neutropenic patients, generally with acute leukaemias and following intensive chemotherapy, have bacterial and fungal infections conditioned by the intensity and duration of the neutropenia. In the case of patients with humoral immunodeficiency (multiple myeloma, chronic lymphatic leukaemia, splenectomised) there are frequent infections by encapsulated germs. When there is cellular immunodepression (Hodgkin's disease, advanced chronic lymphoproliferative syndromes, treatment with glucocorticoids, analogues of the purines and treatment with monoclonal antibodies) the risk of infection by opportunist germs is conditioned by the reduction of the figure of CD4 lymphocytes. We review the different strategies of prophylaxis and treatment in each of the situations.","['Mateos, M C', 'Arginano, J M', 'Ardaiz, M A', 'Oyarzabal, F J']","['Mateos MC', 'Arginano JM', 'Ardaiz MA', 'Oyarzabal FJ']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Virgen del Camino, Pamplona. mmateosr@cfnavarra.es']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,An Sist Sanit Navar,Anales del sistema sanitario de Navarra,9710381,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/immunology', 'Neutropenia/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Opportunistic Infections/*prevention & control']",2005/04/14 09:00,2005/07/08 09:00,['2005/04/14 09:00'],"['2005/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.4321/s1137-66272005000100006 [doi]'],ppublish,An Sist Sanit Navar. 2005 Jan-Mar;28(1):59-81. doi: 10.4321/s1137-66272005000100006.,,,62,,Infecciones en pacientes oncohematologicos no trasplantados.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore developed a rapid and sensitive method to quantify hTERT and its splicing variants as well as the hTR by a Taqman real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to determine whether their altered expression may contribute to telomere attrition in vivo or not. Fresh leukaemia cells obtained from 38 consecutive patients were used in this study. The enzymatic level of telomerase activity measured by TRAP assay was generally associated with the copy numbers of full-length hTERT+alpha+beta mRNA (P=0.0024), but did not correlate with hTR expression (P=0.6753). In spite of high copy numbers of full-length hTERT mRNA, telomerase activity was low in some cases correlating with low copy numbers of hTR, raising the possibility that alteration of the hTR : hTERT ratio may affect functionally active telomerase activity in vivo. The spliced nonactive hTERT mRNA tends to be lower in patients with high telomerase activity, suggesting that this epiphenomenon may play some role in telomerase regulation. An understanding of the complexities of telomerase gene regulation in biologically heterogeneous leukaemia cells may offer new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of acute leukaemia.","['Ohyashiki, J H', 'Hisatomi, H', 'Nagao, K', 'Honda, S', 'Takaku, T', 'Zhang, Y', 'Sashida, G', 'Ohyashiki, K']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Hisatomi H', 'Nagao K', 'Honda S', 'Takaku T', 'Zhang Y', 'Sashida G', 'Ohyashiki K']","['Intractable Immune System Diseases Research Center, Tokyo Medical University, 6-7-1, Nishishinjuku, Shinjuku, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan. junko@hh.iij4u.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/*analysis/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/04/14 09:00,2005/06/17 09:00,['2005/04/14 09:00'],"['2005/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['6602546 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6602546 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2005 May 23;92(10):1942-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602546.,,PMC2361762,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism by which LfcinB causes the death of cancer cells is not well understood. Here, we show that in vitro treatment with LfcinB rapidly induced apoptosis in several different human leukemia and carcinoma cell lines as determined by DNA fragmentation assays and phosphatidylserine headgroup inversion detected by Annexin V binding to the surface of cancer cells. Importantly, LfcinB treatment did not adversely affect the viability of untransformed human lymphocytes, fibroblasts, or endothelial cells. Studies with different LfcinB-derived peptide fragments revealed that the cytotoxic activity of LfcinB resided within the amino acid sequence FKCRRWQWRM. Treatment of Jurkat T leukemia cells with LfcinB resulted in the production of reactive oxygen species followed by caspase-2-induced dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Selective inhibitors of caspase-2 (Z-VDVAD-FMK), caspase-9 (Z-LEHD-FMK), and caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-FMK) protected both leukemia and carcinoma cells from LfcinB-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) had no effect, which argued against a role for caspase-8 and was consistent with the finding that death receptors were not involved in LfcinB-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Jurkat T leukemia cells that overexpressed Bcl-2 were less sensitive to LfcinB-induced apoptosis, which was characterized by mitochondrial swelling and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosolic compartment. We conclude that LfcinB kills cancer cells by triggering the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis at least in part through the generation of reactive oxygen species.","['Mader, Jamie S', 'Salsman, Jayme', 'Conrad, David M', 'Hoskin, David W']","['Mader JS', 'Salsman J', 'Conrad DM', 'Hoskin DW']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Sir Charles Tupper Medical Building, 5850 College Street, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada B3H 1X5.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-valyl-aspartyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-threonyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl', 'ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-glutamyl-histidyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', '146897-68-9 (lactoferricin B)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/chemistry', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Caspase 2', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactoferrin/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/chemistry', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Tetrazolium Salts/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2005/04/14 09:00,2005/10/07 09:00,['2005/04/14 09:00'],"['2005/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/4/612 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0077 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 Apr;4(4):612-24. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0077.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining showed that oridonin caused apoptosis of MT-1 cells in a time-dependent manner. We explored effects of oridonin on antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and found that it down-regulated levels of Mcl-1 and BCL-x(L), but not Bcl-2 protein, in both MT-1 and RPMI8226 cells. Further studies found that oridonin inhibited nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) DNA-binding activity in these cells as measured by luciferase reporter gene, ELISA-based, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Oridonin also blocked tumor necrosis factor-alpha- and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated NF-kappa B activity in Jurkat cells as well as RAW264.7 murine macrophages.

On the other hand, oridonin did not affect survival of normal lymphoid cells from healthy volunteers.

Here we demonstrate that Hsp70 is also incorporated into oncoretroviral virions and that it remains associated with membrane-stripped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virion cores. To determine if Hsp70 promotes virion infectivity, we attempted to generate Hsp70-deficient virions with gag deletion mutations, Hsp70 transdominant mutants, or RNA interference, but these efforts were confounded, largely because they disrupt virion assembly. Given that polypeptide substrates are bound and released by Hsp70 in an ATP-hydrolytic reaction cycle, we supposed that incubation of HIV-1 virions with ATP would perturb Hsp70 interaction with substrates in the virion and thereby decrease infectivity. Treatment with ATP or ADP had no observable effect, but ATPgammaS and GTPgammaS, nucleotide triphosphate analogues resistant to Hsp70 hydrolysis, dramatically reduced the infectivity of HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus virions. ATPgammaS-treated virions were competent for fusion with susceptible target cells, but viral cDNA synthesis was inhibited to an extent that correlated with the magnitude of decrease in infectivity. Intravirion reverse transcription by HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus, or murine leukemia virus was also inhibited by ATPgammaS. The effects of ATPgammaS on HIV-1 reverse transcription appeared to be indirect, resulting from disruption of virion core morphology that was evident by transmission electron microscopy. Consistent with effects on capsid conformation, ATPgammaS-treated viruslike particles failed to saturate host antiviral restriction activity. Our observations support a model in which the catalytic activity of virion-associated Hsp70 is required to maintain structural integrity of the virion core.","['Gurer, Cagan', 'Hoglund, Anders', 'Hoglund, Stefan', 'Luban, Jeremy']","['Gurer C', 'Hoglund A', 'Hoglund S', 'Luban J']","['Department of Microbiology and Medicine, Columbia University, 701 W. 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', ""35094-46-3 (adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate))"", ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, gag/genetics', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'HIV Infections/virology', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'HIV-1/chemistry/pathogenicity/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*chemistry/genetics', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology', 'Virion/chemistry/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Virulence', 'Virus Assembly']",2005/04/14 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/04/14 09:00'],"['2005/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/9/5557 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.9.5557-5567.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 May;79(9):5557-67. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.9.5557-5567.2005.,,PMC1082765,,"['R01 AI041857/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI41857/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The determinants of disease outcome are not well understood but are thought to include viral, host, and environmental factors. In particular, genetic variations in the FeLV long terminal repeat (LTR) and SU gene have been linked to disease outcome. FeLV-945 was previously identified as a natural isolate predominant in non-T-cell neoplastic and nonneoplastic diseases in a geographic cohort. The FeLV-945 LTR was shown to contain unique repeat elements, including a 21-bp triplication downstream of the enhancer. The FeLV-945 SU gene was shown to encode mutational changes in functional domains of the protein. The present study details the outcomes of infection with recombinant FeLVs in which the LTR and envelope (env) gene of FeLV-945, or the LTR only, was substituted for homologous sequences in a horizontally transmissible prototype isolate, FeLV-A/61E. The results showed that the FeLV-945 LTR determined the kinetics of disease. Substitution of the FeLV-945 LTR into FeLV-A/61E resulted in a significantly more rapid disease onset but did not alter the tumorigenic spectrum. In contrast, substitution of both the FeLV-945 LTR and env gene changed the disease outcome entirely. Further, the impact of FeLV-945 env on the disease outcome was dependent on the route of inoculation. Since the TM genes of FeLV-945 and FeLV-A/61E are nearly identical but the SU genes differ significantly, FeLV-945 SU is implicated in the outcome. These findings identify the FeLV-945 LTR and SU gene as determinants of disease.","['Chandhasin, Chandtip', 'Coan, Patricia N', 'Pandrea, Ivona', 'Grant, Chris K', 'Lobelle-Rich, Patricia A', 'Puetter, Adriane', 'Levy, Laura S']","['Chandhasin C', 'Coan PN', 'Pandrea I', 'Grant CK', 'Lobelle-Rich PA', 'Puetter A', 'Levy LS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, 1430 Tulane Ave. SL-38, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cats', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Virulence']",2005/04/14 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/04/14 09:00'],"['2005/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/9/5278 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.9.5278-5287.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 May;79(9):5278-87. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.9.5278-5287.2005.,,PMC1082761,,"['P51 RR000164/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA083823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AY706341', 'GENBANK/AY706342', 'GENBANK/AY706343', 'GENBANK/AY706344', 'GENBANK/AY706345', 'GENBANK/AY706346', 'GENBANK/AY706347', 'GENBANK/AY706348', 'GENBANK/AY706349', 'GENBANK/AY706350', 'GENBANK/AY706351', 'GENBANK/AY706352', 'GENBANK/AY706353', 'GENBANK/AY706354', 'GENBANK/AY706355', 'GENBANK/AY706356', 'GENBANK/AY706357', 'GENBANK/AY706360', 'GENBANK/AY706361', 'GENBANK/AY706362', 'GENBANK/AY706363', 'GENBANK/AY706364', 'GENBANK/AY706365', 'GENBANK/AY706366', 'GENBANK/AY706367', 'GENBANK/AY706368', 'GENBANK/AY706369', 'GENBANK/AY706370', 'GENBANK/AY706371', 'GENBANK/AY706372', 'GENBANK/AY706373', 'GENBANK/AY706374', 'GENBANK/AY706375', 'GENBANK/AY706376', 'GENBANK/AY706377', 'GENBANK/AY706378', 'GENBANK/AY706379', 'GENBANK/AY706380']",,,,,,

Immunoblotting experiments demonstrated the presence of multiple Gnn protein isoforms in most organs, with the lowest levels of expression of the protein detected in bone marrow and spleen. The Evi12-containing leukemia cell line NFS107 showed high levels of expression of a approximately 150-kDa Gnn isoform (Gnn107) that was not observed in control cell lines. Overexpression may be due to the viral insertion in Evi12. The Gnn107 protein is probably encoded by a Gnn cDNA isoform that is expressed exclusively in NFS107 cells and that includes sequences of TU12B1-TY, a putative protein with homology to 5'-nucleotidase enzymes. Interestingly, using Affymetrix gene expression data of a cohort of 285 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we found that GNN/TU12B1-TY expression was specifically increased in two AML clusters. One cluster consisted of all AML patients with a t(8;21) translocation, and the second cluster consisted of AML patients with a normal karyotype carrying a FLT3 internal tandem duplication. These findings suggest that we identified a novel proto-oncogene that may be causally linked to certain types of human leukemia.","['van den Akker, Eric', 'Vankan-Berkhoudt, Yolanda', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['van den Akker E', 'Vankan-Berkhoudt Y', 'Valk PJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'Delwel R']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Dr. Molewaterplein 50, 3015 GE Rotterdam, The Netherlands. h.vandenakker@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (EVI2A protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Retroviridae/physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2005/04/14 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/04/14 09:00'],"['2005/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/9/5249 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.9.5249-5258.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 May;79(9):5249-58. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.9.5249-5258.2005.,,PMC1082726,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AY651019', 'GENBANK/AY651020', 'GENBANK/AY651021', 'GENBANK/AY651022']",,,,,,

To define T-cell epitopes of RHAMM/CD168 toward specific immunotherapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 10 potential HLA-A2-binding RHAMM/CD168 peptides (R1 to R10) were synthesized based on computer algorithms and screened by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) analysis using CD8+ T cells isolated from peripheral blood (PB) of patients with AML and healthy donors. We found that CD8+ cells from 7 of 13 (54%) patients with AML presensitized with peptides R3 (ILSLELMKL) or R5 (SLEENIVIL) specifically recognized T2 cells pulsed with R3 (39%) or R5 (15%) peptide. In contrast, only 4 of 21 (19%) healthy volunteers had CD8+ cells reactive with R3- or R5-pulsed T2 cells after presensitization. The presence of R3 peptide-specific effector T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with AML could be confirmed by staining as HLA-A2/R3 peptide tetramer+ CCR7-CD45RA+ cells. In chromium-51 release assays, peptide-primed CD8+ T cells from patients with AML were able to lyse RHAMM/CD168 peptide-pulsed T2 cells, AML blasts, and dendritic cells generated thereof (AML DCs). Transfection of COS7 cells with RHAMM/CD168 cDNA revealed that peptides R3 and R5 are naturally processed epitopes of RHAMM/CD168 that are presented in an HLA-A2-restricted manner. In summary, RHAMM/CD168 is a promising target for immunotherapies in patients with AML, and we have therefore initiated a clinical vaccination trial with R3 peptide. Because RHAMM/CD168 is also expressed in various other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, vaccines targeting this antigen may have even wider application.","['Greiner, Jochen', 'Li, Li', 'Ringhoffer, Mark', 'Barth, Thomas F E', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof', 'Guillaume, Phillipe', 'Ritter, Gerd', 'Wiesneth, Markus', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Greiner J', 'Li L', 'Ringhoffer M', 'Barth TF', 'Giannopoulos K', 'Guillaume P', 'Ritter G', 'Wiesneth M', 'Dohner H', 'Schmitt M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ulm, Robert-Koch-Str 8, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitope Mapping', '*Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*immunology', 'Female', '*HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/immunology']",2005/04/14 09:00,2005/09/22 09:00,['2005/04/14 09:00'],"['2005/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53211-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-12-4787 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Aug 1;106(3):938-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-12-4787.

Seliciclib (CYC202 or R-roscovitine) is a potent CDK inhibitor currently undergoing phase-2 clinical testing in lung and B-cell malignancies. Here we studied the in vitro cytotoxic activity of seliciclib against multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Our data demonstrate that seliciclib has potent cytotoxicity against MM cells that are both sensitive and resistant to conventional therapy as well as primary MM cells from patients. Cell-cycle and Western blot analysis confirmed apoptosis. Importantly, seliciclib triggered a rapid down-regulation of Mcl-1 transcription and protein expression independent of caspase cleavage. Adherence of MM cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) induced increased Mcl-1 expression associated with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, which was inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner by seliciclib. Furthermore, seliciclib inhibited interleukin 6 (IL-6) transcription and secretion triggered by tumor cell binding to BMSCs. Up-regulation of Mcl-1 expression in cocultures was only partially blocked by neutralizing antibody to IL-6, suggesting alternative mechanisms of Mcl-1 modulation by seliciclib. Finally, combination studies of seliciclib with doxorubicin and bortezomib show in vitro synergism, providing the rationale for testing these drug combinations to improve patient outcome in MM.","['Raje, Noopur', 'Kumar, Shaji', 'Hideshima, Teru', 'Roccaro, Aldo', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji', 'Yasui, Hiroshi', 'Shiraishi, Norihiko', 'Chauhan, Dharminder', 'Munshi, Nikhil C', 'Green, Simon R', 'Anderson, Kenneth C']","['Raje N', 'Kumar S', 'Hideshima T', 'Roccaro A', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Yasui H', 'Shiraishi N', 'Chauhan D', 'Munshi NC', 'Green SR', 'Anderson KC']","['Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Mayer 557, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/*genetics', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Roscovitine', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/04/14 09:00,2005/09/22 09:00,['2005/04/14 09:00'],"['2005/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53225-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-01-0320 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Aug 1;106(3):1042-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-01-0320.

Because T-ALL develops very rapidly in rag2-EGFP-mMyc transgenic fish (in which ""mMyc"" represents mouse c-Myc), this line can only be maintained by in vitro fertilization.

Given such two-class high-dimensional data, many methods have been proposed for classifying data points into one of the two classes. However, finding very small sets of features able to correctly classify the data is problematic as the fundamental mathematical proposition is hard. Existing methods can find ""small"" feature sets, but give no hint how close this is to the true minimum size. Without fundamental mathematical advances, finding true minimum-size sets will remain elusive, and more importantly for the microarray community there will be no methods for finding them. RESULTS: We use the brute force approach of exhaustive search through all genes, gene pairs (and for some data sets gene triples). Each unique gene combination is analyzed with a few-parameter linear-hyperplane classification method looking for those combinations that form training error-free classifiers. All 10 published data sets studied are found to contain predictive small feature sets. Four contain thousands of gene pairs and 6 have single genes that perfectly discriminate. CONCLUSION: This technique discovered small sets of genes (3 or less) in published data that form accurate classifiers, yet were not reported in the prior publications. This could be a common characteristic of microarray data, thus making looking for them worth the computational cost. Such small gene sets could indicate biomarkers and portend simple medical diagnostic tests. We recommend checking for small gene sets routinely. We find 4 gene pairs and many gene triples in the large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, Liver cancer) data set of Chen et al. The key component of these is the ""placental gene of unknown function"", PLAC8. Our HMM modeling indicates PLAC8 might have a domain like part of lP59's crystal structure (a Non-Covalent Endonuclease lii-Dna Complex). The previously identified HCC biomarker gene, glypican 3 (GPC3), is part of an accurate gene triple involving MT1E and ARHE. We also find small gene sets that distinguish leukemia subtypes in the large pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cancer set of Yeoh et al.","['Grate, Leslie R']",['Grate LR'],"['Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA. lesliegrate@comcast.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/*chemistry', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/diagnosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Markov Chains', 'Models, Molecular', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Software', 'Software Design']",2005/04/14 09:00,2006/01/27 09:00,['2005/04/14 09:00'],"['2004/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-6-97 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-6-97 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2005 Apr 13;6:97. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-6-97.,20050413,PMC1090559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MyAgs in ALL are interpreted e.g. as hallmarks of early differentiation stage and/or lineage indecisiveness. Granulocytic marker CD66c -- Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6) is aberrantly expressed on ALL with strong correlation to genotype (negative in TEL/AML1 and MLL/AF4, positive in BCR/ABL and hyperdiploid cases). METHODS: In a cohort of 365 consecutively diagnosed Czech B-precursor ALL patients, we analyze distribution of MyAg+ cases and mutual relationship among CD13, CD15, CD33, CD65 and CD66c. The most frequent MyAg (CD66c) is studied further regarding its stability from diagnosis to relapse, prognostic significance and regulation of surface expression. For the latter, flow cytometry, Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR on sorted cells is used. RESULTS: We show CD66c is expressed in 43% patients, which is more frequent than other MyAgs studied. In addition, CD66c expression negatively correlates with CD13 (p < 0.0001), CD33 (p = 0.002) and/or CD65 (p = 0.029). Our data show that different myeloid antigens often differ in biological importance, which may be obscured by combining them into ""MyAg positive ALL"". We show that unlike other MyAgs, CD66c expression is not shifted from the onset of ALL to relapse (n = 39, time to relapse 0.3-5.3 years). Although opposite has previously been suggested, we show that CEACAM6 transcription is invariably followed by surface expression (by quantitative RT-PCR on sorted cells) and that malignant cells containing CD66c in cytoplasm without surface expression are not found by flow cytometry nor by Western blot in vivo. We report no prognostic significance of CD66c, globally or separately in genotype subsets of B-precursor ALL, nor an association with known risk factors (n = 254). CONCLUSION: In contrast to general notion we show that different MyAgs in lymphoblastic leukemia represent different biological circumstances. We chose the most frequent and tightly genotype-associated MyAg CD66c to show its stabile expression in patients from diagnosis to relapse, which differs from what is known on the other MyAgs. Surface expression of CD66c is regulated at the gene transcription level, in contrast to previous reports.","['Kalina, Tomas', 'Vaskova, Martina', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Madzo, Jozef', 'Trka, Jan', 'Stary, Jan', 'Hrusak, Ondrej']","['Kalina T', 'Vaskova M', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Madzo J', 'Trka J', 'Stary J', 'Hrusak O']","['Department of Immunology, Charles University 2nd Medical School, Prague, Czech Republic. tomas.kalina@lfmotol.cuni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (CD65s antigen, human)', '0 (CEACAM6 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD13 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Czech Republic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genotype', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Lewis X Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2005/04/14 09:00,2006/03/28 09:00,['2005/04/14 09:00'],"['2004/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-5-38 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-5-38 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2005 Apr 12;5:38. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-5-38.,20050412,PMC1112585,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fruits from different cultivars of lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) were evaluated for fruit quality, antioxidant activity, and anthocyanin and phenolic contents. The fruit soluble solids, titratable acids, antioxidant capacity, and anthocyanin and phenolic contents varied with cultivars. Lingonberries contain potent free radical scavenging activities for DPPH*, ROO*, *OH, and O2*- radicals. Pretreatment of JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cells with lingonberry extracts produced a dose-dependent inhibition on the activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) induced by either 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or ultraviolet-B (UVB). Lingonberry extract blocked UVB-induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling members ERK1, ERK2, p38, and MEK1/2 but not JNK. Lingonberry extract also prevented TPA-induced phosphorylation of ERK1, ERK2, and MEK1/2. Results of soft agar assays indicated that lingonberry extract suppressed TPA-induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 P(+) cells in a dose-dependent manner. Lingonberry extract also induced the apoptosis of human leukemia HL-60 cells in a dose-independent manner. These results suggest that ERK1, ERK2, and MEK1/2 may be the primary targets of lingonberry that result in suppression of AP-1, NF-kappaB, and neoplastic transformation in JB6 P(+) cells and causes cancer cell death by an apoptotic mechanism in human leukemia HL-60 cells.","['Wang, Shiow Y', 'Feng, Rentian', 'Bowman, Linda', 'Penhallegon, Ross', 'Ding, Min', 'Lu, Y']","['Wang SY', 'Feng R', 'Bowman L', 'Penhallegon R', 'Ding M', 'Lu Y']","['Fruit Laboratory, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, Maryland 20705-2350, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*analysis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fruit/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Vaccinium vitis-idaea/*chemistry']",2005/04/14 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/04/14 09:00'],"['2005/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jf048379m [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2005 Apr 20;53(8):3156-66. doi: 10.1021/jf048379m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 52 patients from 1979 to 2002 with a median age of 62.8 years (range, 60.1 to 67.8 years) using ablative preparative regimens followed by allogeneic HCT from sibling donors. Diagnoses included myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 35), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 8), acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 6), and other (n = 3). Conditioning regimens included cyclophosphamide (CY) and busulfan (BU) (67%), total-body irradiation and CY (21%), BU-fludarabine (10%), and CY (2%). RESULTS: Eighteen (35%) of 52 patients are alive at a median of 4.6 years (range, 0.8 to 9.1 years) after transplantation. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were 300 and 218 days, respectively. Three-year OS and relapse rates are estimated to be 34% and 24%, respectively. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rates at 100 days and 3 years are estimated to be 27% and 43%, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 20% of patients, and chronic extensive GVHD was described in 53% of patients. Fourteen (40%) of 35 patients with MDS are alive at a median of 2.8 years (range, 0.8 to 8.2 years). Four of six patients with CML in chronic or accelerated phase are alive at a median of 6.9 years (range, 4.1 to 9.1 years) after transplantation. None of the patients with AML, CML in blast crisis, or other diagnoses have survived. Patients who underwent transplantation after 1993 had improved survival. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that allogeneic HCT is feasible in selected patients > or = 60 years of age, although novel methods to reduce NRM while maintaining efficacy are needed.","['Wallen, Herschel', 'Gooley, Theodore A', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Pagel, John M', 'Press, Oliver W', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Storb, Rainer', 'Gopal, Ajay K']","['Wallen H', 'Gooley TA', 'Deeg HJ', 'Pagel JM', 'Press OW', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Storb R', 'Gopal AK']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D3-100, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. hwallen@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/13 09:00,2005/06/25 09:00,['2005/04/13 09:00'],"['2005/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.05.694 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.05.694 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 May 20;23(15):3439-46. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.05.694.

Herein, we investigated the feasibility of this approach in untreated elderly AML patients by administering oblimersen sodium (G3139), an 18-mer phosphorothioate antisense to Bcl-2, during induction and consolidation treatments. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Untreated patients with primary or secondary AML (stratified to cohort 1 or 2, respectively) who were > or = 60 years received induction with G3139, cytarabine, and daunorubicin at one of two different dose levels (45 and 60 mg/m2) and, on achievement of complete remission (CR), consolidation with G3139 and high-dose cytarabine. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assay was used to measure plasma and intracellular concentrations (IC) of G3139. Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels were quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and ELISA, respectively, in bone marrow samples collected before induction treatment and after 72 hours of G3139 infusion, prior to initiation of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of the 29 treated patients, 14 achieved CR. With a median follow-up of 12.6 months, seven patients had relapsed. Side effects of this combination were similar to those expected with chemotherapy alone and were not dose limiting at both dose levels. After 72-hour G3139 infusion, Bcl-2/ABL mRNA copies were decreased compared with baseline (P = .03) in CR patients and increased in nonresponders (NRs; P = .05). Changes in Bcl-2 protein showed a similar trend. Although plasma pharmacokinetics did not correlate with disease response, the median IC of the antisense was higher in the CR patients compared with NRs (17.0 v 4.4 pmol/mg protein, respectively; P = .05). CONCLUSION: G3139 can be administered safely in combination with intensive chemotherapy, and the degree of Bcl-2 downmodulation may correlate with response to therapy.","['Marcucci, Guido', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Dai, Guowei', 'Klisovic, Rebecca B', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Klisovic, Marko I', 'Blum, William', 'Kefauver, Cheryl', 'Sher, Dorie A', 'Green, Margaret', 'Moran, Mollie', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Novick, Steven', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Zwiebel, James A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Byrd, John C']","['Marcucci G', 'Stock W', 'Dai G', 'Klisovic RB', 'Liu S', 'Klisovic MI', 'Blum W', 'Kefauver C', 'Sher DA', 'Green M', 'Moran M', 'Maharry K', 'Novick S', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Zwiebel JA', 'Larson RA', 'Grever MR', 'Chan KK', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, 433A Starling-Loving Hall, 320 West 10th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. marcucci-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '85J5ZP6YSL (oblimersen)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Biological Availability', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*drug effects/metabolism', '*Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thionucleotides/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/13 09:00,2005/06/25 09:00,['2005/04/13 09:00'],"['2005/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.09.118 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.09.118 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 May 20;23(15):3404-11. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.09.118.

SUMO targets include proteins involved in numerous roles including nuclear transport and transcriptional regulation. The previous finding that mutant ataxin-1[82Q] disrupted promyelocytic leukemia (PML) oncogenic domains prompted us to determine whether ataxin-1 disrupts another component of PML oncogenic domains, Sp100 (100-kDa Speckled protein). Similar to the PML protein, mutant ataxin-1[82Q] redistributed Sp100 to mutant ataxin-1[82Q] nuclear inclusions. Based on the ability of PML and Sp100 to be covalently modified by SUMO, we investigated the ability of ataxin-1 to be SUMOylated. SUMO-1 was found to covalently modify the polyglutamine repeat protein ataxin-1. There was a decrease in ataxin-1 SUMOylation in the presence of the expanded polyglutamine tract, ataxin-1[82Q]. The phospho-mutant, ataxin-1[82Q]-S776A, restored SUMO levels to those of wild-type ataxin-1[30Q]. SUMOylation of ataxin-1 was dependent on a functional nuclear localization signal. Ataxin-1 SUMOylation was mapped to at least five lysine residues. Lys(16), Lys(194) preceding the polyglutamine tract, Lys(610)/Lys(697) in the C-terminal ataxin high mobility group domain, and Lys(746) all contribute to ataxin-1 SUMOylation.","['Riley, Brigit E', 'Zoghbi, Huda Y', 'Orr, Harry T']","['Riley BE', 'Zoghbi HY', 'Orr HT']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Biophysics, Institute of Human Genetics, The University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATXN1 protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Ataxin-1)', '0 (Ataxins)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '26700-71-0 (polyglutamine)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'Ataxin-1', 'Ataxins', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Detergents/pharmacology', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Lysine/chemistry', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Octoxynol/pharmacology', 'Peptides/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2005/04/13 09:00,2005/08/03 09:00,['2005/04/13 09:00'],"['2005/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)69137-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M501677200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Jun 10;280(23):21942-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M501677200.

Upon noting low blood levels of zinc in a 3-year-old 11.3 kg girl, zinc at the rate of 3.18 mg/kg body weight/day was administered from the start of chemotherapy through the full 3 years of maintenance therapy. Dosage was split with 18 mg given at breakfast and 18 mg zinc with supper. The result was a bone marrow remission from 95+% blast cells to an observed zero blast cell count in both hips within the first 14 days of treatment which never relapsed. In addition to the reduction of blast cells to an observed count of zero (not a single leukemic or normal blast), red blood cell production and other hemopoietic functions returned to normal at a clinically remarkable rate. There were no side effects from zinc or chemotherapy at any time, and zinc is hypothesized to have improved the patient's overall ability to withstand toxic effects of chemotherapy. This report identifies zinc treatment as being vital to rapid and permanent recovery from ALL. The extremely broad role of zinc in pre-leukemic adverse health conditions, viral, fungal and tumoral immunity, hemopoietics, cell growth, division and differentiation, genetics and chemotherapy interactions are considered. If a nutrient such as zinc could be shown to strengthen the function of chemotherapy and immune function, then it could be hypothesized that the relapse rate would be lessened since the relapse rate is related to both the rate at which a remission is obtained and the thoroughness of the elimination of leukemic blasts. Identical results also occurred in 13 other children with ALL whose parents chose to treat with zinc adjuvant. Since treatment with zinc and other identified deficient nutrients, particularly magnesium, did not appear injurious in ALL and they appear to be highly beneficial, controlled clinical studies of zinc (3.18 mg/kg body weight/day) with magnesium (8.0 mg/kg body weight/day) as adjuvants to chemotherapy in the treatment of childhood ALL are suggested. Treatment with zinc adjuvant is hypothesized to accelerate recovery from ALL, and in conjunction with chemotherapy, cure ALL.","['Eby, George A']",['Eby GA'],"['George Eby Research, 14909-C Fitzhugh Road, Austin, TX 78736, USA. george.eby@coldcure.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,"['0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (Gluconates)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'R4R8J0Q44B (gluconic acid)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Chickenpox Vaccine/immunology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gluconates/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immune System/drug effects', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/complications/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Magnesium Deficiency/etiology', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Models, Biological', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Remission Induction', 'Survivors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Zinc/blood/deficiency/*physiology']",2005/04/13 09:00,2005/10/01 09:00,['2005/04/13 09:00'],"['2004/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-9877(05)00029-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2004.12.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2005;64(6):1124-6. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2004.12.019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors are designed to exploit the molecular differences between tumor cells and normal tissues. Herein, we will review the current state-of-the-art using agents that target as prototypes Bcr-Abl, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), KIT (stem cell factor receptor), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). These compounds are remarkably effective in treating diverse cancers that are highly resistant to conventional treatment, including various forms of leukemia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, mast cell disease, sarcomas, and lung cancer.

When these symptoms predominate at the onset of the disease, the differential diagnosis includes several rheumatic diseases. OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency, clinical features and types of cancer manifested in children presenting with musculoskeletal complaints over a seven-year period. TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective. SETTING: Discipline of Allergy, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo-Escola Paulista de Medicina. METHODS: The medical records of patients with musculoskeletal complaints and final diagnosis of malignant disease were reviewed. The data collected were: age when symptoms initially presented, age at diagnosis, clinical features presented, laboratory findings, and the initial and final diagnoses. RESULTS: A final diagnosis of cancer was found in nine out of 3,528 patients (0.25%) whose initial symptom was musculoskeletal pain. The mean time between disease onset and final diagnosis was five months. The most common features presented were pauciarticular arthritis or arthralgia involving the large joints. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was the most frequent initial diagnosis, in four out of nine patients. Anemia was the most frequent initial hematological change. Six out of eight patients had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The lactate dehydrogenase level was raised in five out of eight patients. The malignancies found included acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma and Ewing's sarcoma. DISCUSSION: The frequency of neoplasia in patients with musculoskeletal pain resembled reports in the literature. Consumptive symptoms were not the warning signal in most of our patients. In subsidiary tests, progressive anemia was the most common finding, although the peripheral blood cell count may continue to be normal for weeks or months after symptom onset. CONCLUSION: Malignancy always needs to be ruled out in cases of children with musculoskeletal complaints. Uncharacteristic clinical manifestations and nonspecific laboratory tests may cause difficulty in the final diagnosis, and rigorous investigation should be performed.","['Goncalves, Marcela', 'Terreri, Maria Teresa Ramos Ascensao', 'Barbosa, Cassia Maria Passarelli Lupolli', 'Len, Claudio Arnaldo', 'Lee, Lucia', 'Hilario, Maria Odete Esteves']","['Goncalves M', 'Terreri MT', 'Barbosa CM', 'Len CA', 'Lee L', 'Hilario MO']","['Department of Pediatrics, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases/*etiology', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Pain/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",2005/04/12 09:00,2005/11/04 09:00,['2005/04/12 09:00'],"['2005/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1516-31802005000100005 [pii]', '10.1590/s1516-31802005000100005 [doi]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2005 Jan 2;123(1):21-3. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31802005000100005.

To conclude, these data demonstrate that the transplants performed in CR, with ATG, are associated with a good outcome, low incidence of cGvHD and no increase of relapse.","['Basara, N', 'Baurmann, H', 'Kolbe, K', 'Yaman, A', 'Labopin, M', 'Burchardt, A', 'Huber, C', 'Fauser, A A', 'Schwerdtfeger, R']","['Basara N', 'Baurmann H', 'Kolbe K', 'Yaman A', 'Labopin M', 'Burchardt A', 'Huber C', 'Fauser AA', 'Schwerdtfeger R']","['Clinic for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Hematology/Oncology, Idar-Oberstein, Germany.

Persistence of recipient hematopoiesis augments the risk of relapse, which is one of the main reasons for mortality after allo-SCT. Another main reason for morbidity and mortality is severe extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD). We examined chimerism in peripheral blood of 54 allogeneic stem cell recipients using multiplex STR-PCR method and compared it with the timing and severity of cGvHD. In total, 25 patients achieved early CC (by day 100 post transplant) at a median time of 60 days. In total, 21 of them developed extensive cGvHD. In those patients CC uniformly preceded emergence of cGvHD by a mean of 85 days. A total of 26 patients obtained late CC at a median time of 270 days post transplant. Of this group, only eight patients developed extensive disease. Development of cGvHD in those patients preceded achievement of CC in 10 of 13 cases by a mean of 100 days. The difference between early and late CC groups as to the frequency of the extensive cGvHD was statistically significant (P<0.001). Also, there was a significant correlation of the time of CC and time between CC and cGvHD. Additionally, patients with early CC developed significantly more severe cGvHD measured by the need of three-drug treatment to control the disease (P<0.005). It can be concluded that achievement of early complete donor hematopoietic chimerism in peripheral blood is strongly predictive of severe extensive GvHD.","['Balon, J', 'Halaburda, K', 'Bieniaszewska, M', 'Reichert, M', 'Bieniaszewski, L', 'Piekarska, A', 'Pawlowski, R', 'Hellmann, A']","['Balon J', 'Halaburda K', 'Bieniaszewska M', 'Reichert M', 'Bieniaszewski L', 'Piekarska A', 'Pawlowski R', 'Hellmann A']","['Department of Haematology, Medical University School of Gdansk, Ul Debinki 7, 80-952 Gdansk, Poland. klhem@amg.gda.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'CD3 Complex/biosynthesis', 'Child', 'Chimerism', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Leukocytes/cytology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/12 09:00,2005/08/20 09:00,['2005/04/12 09:00'],"['2005/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1704962 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1704962 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2005 Jun;35(11):1083-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704962.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total, 53 patients (18 received RIT) were given two questionnaires designed to measure emotional distress (HADS, POMS) before starting conditioning (t1) and at discharge (t2). During the in-patient period, patients answered questions daily relating to physical distress, psychological distress, and how they were ""coping with the situation"". At t2, the transplant team assessed the manner in which the patients were coping. The data displayed no relevant differences with regard to emotional distress between the two groups, both at t1 and t2. For both groups, anxiety and vigor decreased and fatigue increased between t1 and t2. On average, perceived distress was higher for those patients being treated with RIT during the in-patient time, but the differences between both groups were significant only regarding physical distress during the recovery period. No difference was found for the transplant team's assessment. We hypothesize that an intensified conditioning regimen with RIT per se has only a small distressing effect on the patients' psyche during their stay at the hospital. Differences between both groups probably result from independent factors such as, for example, the patients' pre-existing health conditions.","['Grulke, N', 'Bailer, H', 'Kachele, H', 'Bunjes, D']","['Grulke N', 'Bailer H', 'Kachele H', 'Bunjes D']","['University Clinic for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Frauensteige 14a, D-89075 Ulm, Germany. norbert.grulke@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*psychology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*psychology', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods/*psychology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*psychology']",2005/04/12 09:00,2005/08/20 09:00,['2005/04/12 09:00'],"['2005/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1704971 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1704971 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2005 Jun;35(11):1107-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704971.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This degranulation was blocked by BSA-conjugated progesterone (PROG-BSA) or 17beta-estradiol, both of which are antagonistic neurosteroids. 2 DHEAS-induced beta-HEX release was blocked by U-73122 or xestospongin C, but not by PTX or EGTA. DHEAS-induced beta-HEX release was also abolished by G(q/11)-AS, but not by G(q/11)-MS. Pharmacological analyses revealed that the neurosteroids stimulated a putative membrane receptor through activation of the novel G(q/11) and phospholipase C. 3 While representative endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) did not show any degranulation or nocifensive actions by themselves, they blocked the DHEAS-induced degranulation. 4 The binding of a PROG-BSA-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (PROG-BSA-FITC) to cells was inhibited by neurosteroids and EDCs. 5 In the algogenic-induced biting and licking responses test, DHEAS caused agonistic nocifensive actions in a dose-dependent manner between 1 and 10 fmol (i.pl.). DHEAS-induced nocifensive actions were abolished by PROG-BSA or nonylphenol. 6 Taken together, these results suggest that a G(q/11)-coupled neurosteroid receptor may regulate the neuroimmunological activity related to sensory stimulation and that some EDCs have antagonistic actions for this receptor.","['Mizota, Kaori', 'Yoshida, Akira', 'Uchida, Hitoshi', 'Fujita, Ryousuke', 'Ueda, Hiroshi']","['Mizota K', 'Yoshida A', 'Uchida H', 'Fujita R', 'Ueda H']","['Division of Molecular Pharmacology and Neuroscience, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-14 Bunkyo-machi, Nagasaki 852-8521, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Estrenes)', '0 (Macrocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (xestospongin A)', '112648-68-7', '(1-(6-((3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '459AG36T1B (Dehydroepiandrosterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '57B09Q7FJR (Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate)', '73R90F7MQ8 (Pregnenolone)', '79F6A2ILP5 (nonylphenol)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal/drug effects', 'Binding, Competitive/drug effects', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone/pharmacology', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Estrenes/pharmacology', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/chemistry', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrocyclic Compounds', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nociceptors/drug effects', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Oxazoles/pharmacology', 'Pain/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Pertussis Toxin/pharmacology', 'Phenols/pharmacology', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pregnenolone/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidinones/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Steroid/*metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/chemistry', 'Type C Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2005/04/12 09:00,2005/08/30 09:00,['2005/04/12 09:00'],"['2005/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['0706213 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjp.0706213 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2005 Jun;145(4):545-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0706213.,,PMC1576165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this phase II, prospective, multicenter, cooperative group trial, high-risk patients had one or more of the following risk factors: forced expiratory volume in 1 second less than 40%, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity in lung less than 50%, and maximum oxygen consumption less than 45 mm Hg. Patients underwent video-assisted wedge resection followed by local (56 Gy) radiotherapy. The primary end point was the proportion of patients whose disease could be completely resected and who received radiotherapy without treatment complications. RESULTS: Between September 1995 and September 1999, a total of 65 patients were accrued, of which 58 were eligible (52% male, median age 69 years). Pathologic staging resulted in upgrading to T2 or greater in 16 of 58 cases (28%) and in reassessment as benign in 10 of 58 cases (17%). Conversion to thoracotomy was required in 10 cases (17%), including 1 of 10 benign T1-size lesion (10%), 4 of 35 non-small cell lung cancer T1 lesions (13%), and 5 of 14 non-small cell lung cancer T2 lesions (31%). Resection margins were positive in 5 patients: 6% of T1 and 23% of T2. Surgery was aborted in 2 cases (3.5%), and operative mortality was 4%. Overall operative failure rates of video-assisted wedge resection were 20% for benign T1-size lesions, 22% for T1 non-small cell lung cancer, 21% for all T1 lesions, 50% for T2 non-small cell lung cancer, and 29% for all lesions in this study (clinical T1). Prolonged air leaks occurred in 10%, pneumonia in 6%, and respiratory failure in 4%. Thirty-one patients were eligible for radiotherapy; 3 of them refused, and 1 died before treatment. Among the 28 patients who received radiotherapy, severe dyspnea was noted in 3 patients (11%) and moderate pneumonitis in 4 (14%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical staging in high-risk patients is often inaccurate (45% difference from pathologic staging). Intention to treat clinically staged T1 disease by video-assisted wedge resection is associated with a high failure rate. Pathologically staged T1 lesions can be successfully resected in 75% of cases; however, narrow resection margins remain a concern.","['Shennib, Hani', 'Bogart, Jeffrey', 'Herndon, James E', 'Kohman, Leslie', 'Keenan, Robert', 'Green, Mark', 'Sugarbaker, David']","['Shennib H', 'Bogart J', 'Herndon JE', 'Kohman L', 'Keenan R', 'Green M', 'Sugarbaker D']","['McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

It is of interest to study the dynamics of individual molecules in cell membranes as the mechanism of how biological membranes function at the single molecule remains to be elucidated. In this letter we describe a study in which we incubate rat basophilic leukemia cells with a fluorescently labeled cell membrane component on a surface containing zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs). We used the ZMW to confine fluorescent excitation to an approximately 100-nm region of the membrane to monitor lipid diffusion along the cellular membrane. We showed that confinement with a ZMW largely reduced fluorescent contributions from the cytosolic pool that is present when using a more standard technique such as laser-induced confocal microscopy.

We have immortalized human primary endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) isolated from a normal proliferative phase endometrium by stably transfecting the catalytic subunit (hTERT) of the human telomerase complex and cultured these hTERT-EECs now for over 350 population doublings. Active hTERT was detected in hTERT-EECs employing the telomerase repeat amplification assay protocol. hTERT-EECs revealed a polarized, non-invasive epithelial phenotype with apical microvilli and production of a basal lamina when grown on a three-dimensional collagen-fibroblast lattice. Employing atomic force microscopy, living hTERT-EECs were shown to produce extracellular matrix (ECM) components and ECM secretion was modified by estrogen and progesterone (P4). hTERT-EECs expressed inducible and functional endogenous estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) as demonstrated by estrogen response element reporter assays and induction of P4 receptor (PR). P4 treatment down-regulated PR expression, induced MUC-1 gene activity and resulted in increased ER-beta transcriptional activity. Gene activities of cytokines and their receptors interleukin (IL)-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-11 and IL-6 receptor (IL6-R), LIF receptor and gp130 relevant to implantation revealed a 17 beta-estradiol (E2)-mediated up-regulation of IL-6 and an E2- and P4-mediated up-regulation of IL6-R in hTERT-EECs.

The first BCR-ABL inhibitor to come into use in clinical practice, imatinib mesylate, is now the first-choice treatment for all newly diagnosed CML patients, but the initial striking efficacy of this drug has been overshadowed by the development of clinical resistance. The most common mechanisms of resistance include (i) BCR-ABL overexpression, and (ii) BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations disrupting critical contact points between imatinib and BCR-ABL or inducing a transition to a conformation to which imatinib is unable to bind. Several approaches to overcoming resistance have been studied both in vitro and in vivo. They include dose escalation of imatinib, the combination of imatinib with chemotherapeutic drugs, alternative BCR-ABL inhibitors, and inhibitors of kinases acting downstream of BCR-ABL such as Src kinases.

Therefore, innovative treatment strategies are mandatory. Bivatuzumab mertansine is a novel cytotoxic immunoconjugate specifically targeting the CD44 splice variant CD44v6. To investigate the applicability of this compound to clonal plasma cell disorders, we analyzed CD44v6 expression on malignant plasma cells from patients with multiple myeloma. DESIGN AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 57 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), MM, and plasma cell leukemia (PCL) were examined for CD44v6 expression by using flow cytometry (FACS) analysis. In addition, all samples were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a specific probe for the chromosomal band 13q14. RESULTS: In only 1 of 16 cases (6%) with MGUS and 1 out of 6 cases (17%) with stage I MM were plasma cells CD44v6 positive. In contrast, 43% of the cases with stage II/III MM or PCL expressed CD44v6. In these cases, CD44v6 expression was significantly correlated with chromosome 13q14 deletion as determined by FISH (p=0.02). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: CD44v6 is frequently expressed in advanced, high-risk MM. CD44v6 expression correlates with chromosomal band 13q14 deletions, a well-known risk factor in MM. These results suggest that this epitope is a potential new target for monoclonal antibodies such as bivatuzumab mertansine.","['Liebisch, Peter', 'Eppinger, Susanne', 'Schopflin, Christine', 'Stehle, Gerd', 'Munzert, Gerd', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Schmid, Mathias']","['Liebisch P', 'Eppinger S', 'Schopflin C', 'Stehle G', 'Munzert G', 'Dohner H', 'Schmid M']","['Dept. of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD44v6 antigen)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*genetics/*immunology', 'Paraproteinemias/drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Burden/immunology']",2005/04/12 09:00,2006/05/26 09:00,['2005/04/12 09:00'],"['2005/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Apr;90(4):489-93.,,,,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2005 Apr;90(4):436-7.

However, the traditional cut-off level dividing mutated and unmutated cases, i.e. more or less than 2% mutations, has been questioned and other cut-offs have been suggested. We investigated whether an alternative cut-off should be applied and the relation of mutational status to another prognostic marker, Binet staging. DESIGN AND METHODS: VH gene mutation status was assessed in 332 CLL cases by polymerase chain reaction amplification and nucleotide sequencing and was further correlated with overall survival using different VH mutation cut-offs (1-7%) and Binet stage. RESULTS: After testing different mutation borders, the 2% cut-off remained the best discriminative level for determining prognosis. Interestingly, prognostic stratification was improved by combining the information on VH gene mutation status with that of Binet stage: unmutated cases (all stages, n=151, mutated cases with stage A (n=77), and mutated cases with stage B or C (n=37) had a median survival of 82, 179 and 74 months, respectively. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: CLL cases displaying mutated VH genes with Binet stage B or C had a survival similar to that of unmutated cases and significantly shorter than that of mutated stage A CLL. Our result reveals clinical heterogeneity within the VH mutated CLL group by inclusion of Binet stage data, a finding which is of importance when considering surrogate marker(s) for VH mutation status.","['Tobin, Gerard', 'Thunberg, Ulf', 'Laurell, Anna', 'Karlsson, Karin', 'Aleskog, Anna', 'Willander, Kerstin', 'Soderberg, Ola', 'Merup, Mats', 'Vilpo, Juhani', 'Hultdin, Magnus', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Roos, Goran', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Tobin G', 'Thunberg U', 'Laurell A', 'Karlsson K', 'Aleskog A', 'Willander K', 'Soderberg O', 'Merup M', 'Vilpo J', 'Hultdin M', 'Sundstrom C', 'Roos G', 'Rosenquist R']","['Dept. of Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/12 09:00,2006/05/26 09:00,['2005/04/12 09:00'],"['2005/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Apr;90(4):465-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a subgroup of patients is refractory at the cytogenetic level. Clinically, it would be advantageous to identify such patients a priori, since they may benefit from more aggressive therapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: To elucidate mechanisms underlying cytogenetic refractoriness, we used Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays to determine the transcriptional signature associated with cytogenetic refractoriness in unselected white blood or bone marrow cells from 29 patients with CML in first CP prior to treatment with imatinib. Patients with CCR within 9 months were defined as responders (n = 16) and patients lacking a major cytogenetic response (> 35% Philadelphia-positive metaphases) after 1 year were defined as non-responders (n = 13). RESULTS: Differences in gene expression between responders and non-responders were subtle. Stringent statistical analysis with multiple comparison adjustments revealed very few differentially expressed genes. Differentially expressed genes could not be confirmed in an independent test set.

Some patients present minimal symptoms and others organomegaly requiring rapidly therapy. Therapeutic options take into account efficacy, toxicity and prognostic factors. One of the well known prognosis factor is the clinical staging developed either by Rai et al. or by Binet et al. However, there is an important heterogeneity concerning the course of the disease among patients within a single stage group. Recently, several important observations related to the biologic significance of VH gene mutational status, expression of CD38, over-expression of ZAP-70 and chromosomal aberrations have led to the ability to identify high risk patients with rapid disease progression and lower survival. It has been demonstrated that the VH mutation status is clinically highly relevant. CLL patients with unmutated VH gene show an unfavourable course with a very rapid progression. Specific genomic aberrations have been associated with disease characteristics such as lymphadenopathy related to 11q deletion and resistance to treatment related to 17p deletion. VH gene mutation status and genomic aberrations appear separate parameters when considering their prognostic relevance but nevertheless they are correlated: unfavourable aberrations (11q- and 17p-) occur more frequently in VH unmutated CLL patients. According to these prognostic factors, several treatments including purine analogues and/or monoclonal antibodies have been tested with different schedules and doses of monoclonal antibodies (rituximab and alemtuzumab) considering safety to determine the better efficacy. Infections and haemolytic anemia remain the most frequent complications during conventional chemotherapy. In autologous transplant setting, the transplant related mortality is less than 10%, but survival curve do not show a plateau with about 50% of patients relapsing at 4 years. Conventional allogeneic transplantation could achieve durable remission and probably cure the disease but at the price of a too high transplant related mortality related to depressive immune status and old age of CLL population. In order to minimize the toxicity and to improve graft-versus-leukemia effect, development of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens appear particularly important for CLL patients. Recent studies, although a still short follow-up show very promising results and use of monoclonal antibodies in the conditioning or just after transplant could improve the results of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and cure a larger number of CLL patients. Recent advances to categorize CLL patients according to risk stratification regarding new prognostic factors (FISH, CD38, ZAP70, Ig mutational status) should allow to define better the best therapeutic strategy. In parallel, age, co morbidities and the notion of the risk-adapted strategy have also an important impact adding.","['Michallet, Anne-Sophie', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Coiffier, Bernard', 'Michallet, Mauricette']","['Michallet AS', 'Salles G', 'Coiffier B', 'Michallet M']","[""Hopital Edouard-Herriot, place d'Arsonval, 69437 Lyon Cedex 03. annesophie.michallet@voila.fr""]",['fre'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",2005/04/12 09:00,2005/04/23 09:00,['2005/04/12 09:00'],"['2004/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2005 Mar;92(3):249-56.,,,44,,Actualites therapeutiques de la leucemie lymphoide chronique.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preclinical work has revealed their ability to effectively inhibit tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in animal models across a wide range of malignant phenotypes. Acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are appropriate disease targets in that they express relevant biologic targets such as Ras, MEK, AKT, and others that may depend upon farnesyl protein transferase activity to promote cell proliferation and survival. Indeed, different intracellular proteins are substrates for prenylation. Interruption of prenylation may prevent substrates from undergoing maturation which may result in the inhibition of cellular events that depend on the function of those substrates. Phase I trials in AML and myelodysplasia have demonstrated biologic and clinical activities as determined by target enzyme inhibition, low toxicity, and both complete and partial responses. As a result, phase II trials have been initiated in order to further validate clinical activity and to identify downstream signal transduction targets that may be modified by these agents. It is anticipated that these studies will serve to define the optimal roles of FTIs in patients with these hematologic malignancies and provide insight into effective methods by which to combine FTIs with other agents.","['Thomas, Xavier', 'Elhamri, Mohamed']","['Thomas X', 'Elhamri M']","[""Service d'hematologie, hopital Edouard-Herriot, 5, place Arsonval, 69437 Lyon Cedex 03. xavier.thomas@chu-lyon.fr""]",['fre'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Quinolones)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', '2A2059P49U (L 778,123)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'IOW153004F (lonafarnib)', 'L2U9GFD244', '(7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thie', 'nylsulfonyl)-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)']",IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Benzodiazepines/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Piperidines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Prenylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pyridines/therapeutic use', 'Quinolones/therapeutic use', 'ras Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2005/04/12 09:00,2005/04/23 09:00,['2005/04/12 09:00'],"['2004/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2005 Mar;92(3):227-38.,,,111,,Inhibiteurs de farnesyl transferase: resultats cliniques dans la leucemie aigue myeloide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knowledge of the precise moment of infection is fundamental for identification and evaluation of factors related to BLV transmission. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide good evidence on the effects of medical interventions. The objectives were to estimate time to sero-conversion after experimental infection using data from retrieved literature and to detect factors that may influence the length of that interval using survival analysis on pooled data. An analysis using aggregate data from 36 studies totalling 438 observations was performed. From this, four sets were created and analysed by interval-censored accelerated failure time models (AFT) with different distributions (exponential, Weibull, log-logistic, lognormal and generalized gamma), and some variants of the Cox model (Andersen-Gill, smoothing splines) with and without a frailty effect. The AFT gamma model fit best and the estimated median time to sero-conversion in the null model was 57 days (95% confidence interval (CI): 49; 75) using all data and 47 days (95% CI: 39; 55) when only studies using experimental inoculation were considered. Some factors were consistently associated with time to sero-conversion. These included exposure by animal-to-animal contact (resulting in a seven-fold increase in time to sero-conversion compared to direct inoculation), diagnostic method to detect sero-conversion (time to sero-conversion was 1.4 times shorter when AGID was used compared to ELISA), and transmission by insect bites (biological media) delayed sero-conversion 2.3 times compared transmission via needles or other inanimate media. After fitting a frailty Cox model, results showed that sero-conversion in susceptible animals after infection using donors, in which presence of virus before the experiment started was confirmed, increased the hazard of sero-conversion two times in comparison with donors in which virus presence was not confirmed before start of the experiment. Inoculation with blood decreased the hazard 2.5 times in comparison with lymphocyte suspensions. Heterogeneity due to different research groups was also present. Finally, a Cox model with smoothing splines contained three variables: research group, route of inoculation and a non-linear spline for infective dose. In conclusion, it can be stated some factors that influence the time to sero-conversion were identified and quantified and that a moderate influence of research centre existed. These results may contribute to the estimation of the most probable times of infection in field conditions and in a better evaluation of control measures.","['Monti, G E', 'Frankena, K']","['Monti GE', 'Frankena K']","['Quantitative Veterinary Epidemiology Group, Wageningen Institute of Animal Sciences Wageningen, P.O.

It is not known, however, whether IAP expression in malignant hematopoietic cells is affected by chemotherapeutic agents such as homoharringtonine (HHT). In this study, we investigated mRNA expression levels of IAPs, especially survivin, in various hematopoietic cell lines in relation with apoptosis induced by HHT. METHODS: Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to determine survivin mRNA levels. Cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. Cell viability and proliferation assay was evaluated by MTT. The experiments were performed on the malignant hematopoietic cell lines MUTZ-1, K562, Jurkat, RMPI and HL60, with or without survivin antisense-oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODN) and HHT. RESULTS: The expression levels of survivin mRNA were variable in the cell lines and negatively correlated to HHT induced cell apoptosis. Survivin AS-ODN significantly decreased mRNA level of survivin, but not those of bax and bcl-2. Survivin also inhibited MUTZ-1 cell growth and induced apoptosis in a dose dependent manner. AS-ODN and HHT showed synergistic effect on MUTZ-1 cell growth. CONCLUSION: The apoptotic effect of HHT on the hematopoietic cell lines is associated with decreased level of survivin expression. Survivin could be a new marker for drug sensitivity and a new target for cancer treatment.","['Cai, Zhen', 'Bao, Han-ying', 'Lin, Mao-fang']","['Cai Z', 'Bao HY', 'Lin MF']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. caizhen1@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/metabolism/*pathology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Survivin', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2005/04/12 09:00,2005/05/05 09:00,['2005/04/12 09:00'],"['2005/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2005 Apr 5;118(7):548-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was to summarize clinical and pathologic features of T-cell NHL. METHODS: Records of 111 patients with T-cell NHL, treated from Jan. 1994 to Dec. 2001 in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University, were retrospectively analyzed. All the patients were classified according to WHO classification criteria. RESULTS: Median age of the whole group was 37 years (ranged 7-77 years). Of the 111 patients, 82 were men, 29 were women;45 (40.5%) were treated with chemoradiotherapy, 62 (55.8%) were treated with chemotherapy alone, and 4 (3.6%) were treated with radiotherapy alone. The 3-year survival rate of the whole group was 45% with a median follow-up of 28 months. The 3-year survival rates of chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy groups were 56%, 38%, and 25%, respectively.

Dendritic cells (DCs), specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs), play a pivotal role in activating initial T cells, and maintaining cell immune responses. Does the efficiency of IFN to CML relate to the DCs induced by IFNy What kind of effect do DCs have on IFN therapy for CMLy Up to now, few researches are available. This study aimed to observe whether the DCs were induced through culturing bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) of CML in vitro, investigate the mechanism of IFN-alpha therapy for CML, and then provide a new strategy for clinical therapy. METHODS: BMMNCs were obtained from blood of CML patients by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation, and induced with IFN-alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (IFN-alpha/ GM-CSF group), or interleukin-4 (IL-4) and GM-CSF (IL-4/ GM-CSF group), or IFN-alpha, GM-CSF, and IL-4 (IFN-alpha/GM-CSF/IL-4 group) for 7 days. Morphology of BMMNCs was observed under transmissional and optical microscope. The phenotypes [CD1a, CD83, CD86, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-ABC, HLA-DR, CD54] were assayed by flow cytometry (FCM). The mixed lymphocyte reaction(MLR) of DCs was evaluated by MTT assay. RESULTS: After inducements, BMMNCs showed typical dendritic projections, and highly expressed CD1a, CD83, CD86, HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, and CD54. Positive rates of HLA-ABC and HLA-DR were higher in IFN-alpha/ GM-CSF group and IFN-alpha/GM-CSF/IL-4 group than in IL-4/ GM-CSF group (P<0.05). Positive rate of CD86 and MLR were the highest in IFN-alpha/GM-CSF/IL-4 group (P<0.05). Positive rates of DC antigens and MLR in IFN-resistant group were significantly lower than those in newly diagnosed group and IFN-sensitive group (P<0.05), but positive rate of CD86 and MLR have no significant difference among 3 groups in the presence of IFN-alpha/GM-CSF/IL-4 (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The BMMNCs of CML cultured in the presence of IFN-alpha and other cytokines can be induced into DCs with morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics, overexpresses major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, co-stimulatory molecules, and adhesion molecules, and have enhancing MLR. The possible mechanism of IFN-alpha therapy for CML may be relate to DCs.","['Wu, Chong-Yang', 'Zhang, Lian-Sheng', 'Zhang, Yu-Fang', 'Chai, Ye', 'Yi, Liang-Cai', 'Song, Fei-Xue']","['Wu CY', 'Zhang LS', 'Zhang YF', 'Chai Y', 'Yi LC', 'Song FX']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Second Affilated Hospital, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, 730030, P.R.China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/04/12 09:00,2006/07/21 09:00,['2005/04/12 09:00'],"['2005/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['1000467X2005040425 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2005 Apr;24(4):425-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is possible to cure leukemia if specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can be induced from lymphocytes in cord blood (CB), and be used to eradicate minimal residual disease (MRD) in leukemia patients. This study was to induce CTLs from cord blood, and explore its in vitro anti-leukemia activity. METHODS: Dendritic cells (DCs) were generated from 8 samples of cord blood mononuclear cells by culturing with multiple cytokines. Immature DCs were pulsed with apoptotic leukemia cells to present leukemic antigens to cord blood original lymphocytes to obtain CTLs. The characteristics of maturation of DCs were evaluated by morphology and flow cytometry. Anti-leukemia effect of CTLs was measured by lactate dehydrogenase release assay. RESULTS: Typical DCs were induced from all of the 8 samples. Expressions of immunologic markers CD1a(+), HLA-DR(+), CD86(+), CD83(+) on DCs were significantly higher after culturing than before culturing [(29.6+/-13.8)% vs. (1.8+/-1.9)%, (81.1+/-17.8)% vs. (19.4+/-10.6)%, (42.7+/-21.9)% vs. (7.5+/-5.3)%, (8.0+/-6.9)% vs. (1.4+/-1.1)%, respectively, P< 0.05]. When E:T ratio was 50:1, CTLs showed far higher cytotoxicity to uncultured acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells than to K562 cells, and to mononuclear cells of bone marrow from the corresponding patients in complete remission phase (CR-MNCs) [(52.6+/-21.0)% vs. (18.2+/-20.2)%, and (3.3+/-6.3)%, P < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: Mature DCs derived from cord blood, which loaded leukemia antigens, could induce leukemia-specific CTLs. The CTLs have vigorous cytotoxicity to original leukemia cells rather than CR-MNCs.","['Zeng, Lin-Juan', 'Tan, Huo']","['Zeng LJ', 'Tan H']","['Oncology and Hematology Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical College, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510230, P.

This study was to explore regulatory effect of STAT5 decoy oligonucleotides (ODNs) on trans-activation of its downstream target bcl-x gene in K562 cells. METHODS: STAT5 decoy ODNs, mismatched ODNs (M-ODNs), and FAM-decoy ODNs were designed and synthesized. FAM-decoy ODNs were used as control, and transfected into K562 cells by cationic liposomes, analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM) and fluorescent inversive microscopy. The bcl-x promoter fragment acquired by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was inserted into pGL3-basic to construct luciferase report plasmid pGL3b-bclxp, which was co-transfected with decoy ODNs or M-ODNs into K562 cells. The activity of luciferase was detected. After transfection of decoy ODNs, and M-ODNs, expression of bcl-xL mRNA in K562 cells was detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR),cell apoptosis was detected by FCM. RESULTS: FAM-decoy ODNs were incorporated into K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The incorporation efficiency reached 99.1% at the concentration of 4 micromol/L 24 h after transfection, and green fluorescence could be observed in cells under fluorescent inversive microscope. The luciferase activity was significantly lower in STAT5 decoy ODNs group than in control group [(181.48+/-204.46) RLU/microg protein vs. (675.26+/-62.91) RLU/mug protein, P < 0.05], but that of M-ODNs group [(632.07+/-98.95) RLU/microg protein] has no significant difference with that of control group (P > 0.05). mRNA level of bcl-xL was decreased by STAT5 decoy ODNs, but not by M-ODNs. Moreover, Sub G1 peak was detected in STAT5 decoy ODNs group by FCM.

LIF plays a role in growth-promotion and differentiation, regulates calcium and bone metabolism, induces acute phase proteins and causes cachexia in organisms with neoplastic disorders. LIF is also to be found in normal skin, where it may be involved in the differentiation process of keratinocytes. In addition, recent data in medical literature indicates that LIF is engaged in the pathogenesis of some skin disorders as well. It has been clearly demonstrated that LIF may act as a proinflammatory cytokine. In allergic contact dermatitis, the expression of LIF mRNA is augmented to a significant degree, indicating that LIF may play a role in the early phase of allergic contact dermatitis. LIF also plays an important role in psoriatic lesions. As the mechanism is not yet fully understood, however, it is hypothesized that the LIF function in psoriatic processes is solely connected with IL-8, as it is known that LIF is able to induce the release of IL-8. Also, some reports have suggested that LIF may also play a role in the carcinogenesis of the skin.","['Szepietowski, J C', 'Reich, A', 'McKenzie, R C']","['Szepietowski JC', 'Reich A', 'McKenzie RC']","['Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University of Medicine, Ul.

The exact mechanisms responsible for imatinib-induced cell death are still unclear. We investigated the role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity in imatinib-induced cell death in Bcr-Abl-positive cells. Imatinib leads to a rapid increase of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PAR) preceding loss of integrity of mitochondrial membrane and DNA fragmentation. The effect of imatinib on PAR can be mimicked by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) implicating a central role of the PI3-K pathway in Bcr-Abl-mediated inhibition of PAR. Importantly, inhibition of PAR in imatinib-treated cells partially prevented cell death to an extent comparable to that observed after caspase inhibition. Simultaneous blockade of both caspases and PAR revealed additive cytoprotective effects indicating that both pathways function in parallel. In conclusion, our results suggest that in addition to the well-documented caspase-dependent pathway, imatinib also induces a PARP-mediated death process.","['Moehring, A', 'Wohlbold, L', 'Aulitzky, W E', 'van der Kuip, H']","['Moehring A', 'Wohlbold L', 'Aulitzky WE', 'van der Kuip H']","['Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Auerbachstr. 112, Stuttgart, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'DNA/genetics', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/10/07 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['4401608 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cdd.4401608 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2005 Jun;12(6):627-36. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401608.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TRX is a vital component of the thiol-reducing system and regulates various cellular function (redox regulation). Members of the TRX system regulate apoptosis through a wide variety of mechanisms. A family of thioredoxin-dependent peroxidases (peroxiredoxins) protects against apoptosis by scavenging hydrogen peroxide. Thioredoxin 2 is a critical regulator of cytochrome c release and mitochondrial apoptosis; transmembrane thioredoxin-related molecule (TMX) has a protective role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis. TRX interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and is a sensor of oxidative stress.

In contrast to this idea, we show here that Rap1/Gcr1/Gcr2 transcriptional activation in yeast cells occurs through a large anchored protein platform, the Nup84 nuclear pore subcomplex. Surprisingly, Nup84 and associated subcomplex components activate transcription themselves in vivo when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. The Rap1 coactivators Gcr1 and Gcr2 form an important bridge between the yeast nuclear pore complex and the transcriptional machinery. Nucleoporin activation may be a widespread eukaryotic phenomenon, because it was first detected as a consequence of oncogenic rearrangements in acute myeloid leukemia and related syndromes in humans. These chromosomal translocations fuse a homeobox DNA-binding domain to the human homolog (hNup98) of a transcriptionally active component of the yeast Nup84 subcomplex. We conclude that Rap1 target genes are activated by moving to contact compartmentalized nuclear assemblages, rather than through recruitment of the requisite factors to chromatin by means of diffusion. We term this previously undescribed mechanism ""reverse recruitment"" and discuss the possibility that it is a central feature of eukaryotic gene regulation. Reverse recruitment stipulates that activators work by bringing the DNA to an nuclear pore complex-tethered platform of assembled transcriptional machine components.","['Menon, Balaraj B', 'Sarma, Nayan J', 'Pasula, Satish', 'Deminoff, Stephen J', 'Willis, Kristine A', 'Barbara, Kellie E', 'Andrews, Brenda', 'Santangelo, George M']","['Menon BB', 'Sarma NJ', 'Pasula S', 'Deminoff SJ', 'Willis KA', 'Barbara KE', 'Andrews B', 'Santangelo GM']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg, MS 39406, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GCR1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (GCR2 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (NUP84 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (RAP1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Nuclear Envelope/chemistry/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/07/07 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['0501768102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0501768102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Apr 19;102(16):5749-54. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0501768102.

Starting imatinib in the setting of MRD may decrease this high relapse rate. In this prospective multicenter study, 27 Ph+ ALL patients received imatinib upon detection of MRD after SCT. Bcr-abl transcripts became undetectable in 14 (52%) of 27 patients, after a median of 1.5 months (0.9-3.7 months) ((early)CR(mol)). All patients who achieved an (early)CR(mol) remained in remission for the duration of imatinib treatment; 3 patients relapsed after imatinib was discontinued. Failure to achieve polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity shortly after starting imatinib predicted relapse, which occurred in 12 (92%) of 13 patients after a median of 3 months. Disease-free survival (DFS) in (early)CR(mol) patients is 91% +/- 9% and 54% +/- 21% after 12 and 24 months, respectively, compared with 8% +/- 7% after 12 months in patients remaining MRD+ (P < .001). In conclusion, approximately half of patients with Ph+ ALL receiving imatinib for MRD positivity after SCT experience prolonged DFS, which can be anticipated by the rapid achievement of a molecular complete remission (CR). Continued detection of bcr-abl transcripts after 2 to 3 months on imatinib identifies patients who will ultimately experience relapse and in whom additional or alternative antileukemic treatment should be initiated.","['Wassmann, Barbara', 'Pfeifer, Heike', 'Stadler, Michael', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Scheuring, Urban J', 'Bruck, Patrick', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Basara, Nadezda', 'Perz, Jolanta', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Ledderose, Georg', 'Mahlberg, Rolf', 'Binckebanck, Anja', 'Gschaidmeier, Harald', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Ottmann, Oliver G']","['Wassmann B', 'Pfeifer H', 'Stadler M', 'Bornhauser M', 'Bug G', 'Scheuring UJ', 'Bruck P', 'Stelljes M', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Basara N', 'Perz J', 'Bunjes D', 'Ledderose G', 'Mahlberg R', 'Binckebanck A', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ottmann OG']","['Departments of Hematology/Oncology of University Hospitals Frankfurt, Hannover, Dresden, Munster, Ulm, Heidelberg, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Genes, abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53266-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-05-1746 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 15;106(2):458-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-05-1746.

Many V(H)3-21+ patients also display restricted heavy- and light-chain Ig gene rearrangements, implying a role of antigen selection in disease development. To explore the specific phenotypic/genotypic features among V(H)3-21+ B-CLLs, we compared gene expression patterns in 15 V(H)3-21+ and 24 non-V(H)3-21 patients (11 with unmutated and 13 with mutated V(H) genes) using Affymetrix microarray analysis (approximately 12,500 genes). A distinct expression profile was identified for V(H)3-21+ patients in contrast to the Ig-unmutated and -mutated groups. By applying different algorithms, the data enabled an efficient class discrimination of the V(H)3-21+ subset based on 27 or 57 genes. A set of genes was sorted out which, using different analytical methods, consistently gave a distinction between V(H)3-21+ and non-V(H)3-21 samples. Several of these genes are involved in regulation of DNA replication/cell-cycle control, transcription and protein kinase activity, which may render the V(H)3-21+ cells with a higher proliferative drive. However, no clear evidence of increased B-cell receptor signaling was found in the V(H)3-21+ group.

We report a clinical trial to decrease graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in elderly patients receiving selectively depleted PBSC transplants from HLA-identical sibling donors. Sixteen patients (median age, 65 years [range, 51-73 years]), with advanced hematologic malignancies underwent transplantation following reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine and either cyclophosphamide (n = 5), melphalan (n = 5), or busulfan (n = 6).

We have evaluated the role of p38, a MAPK, in lymphoid cell apoptosis upon treatment with the synthetic GCs dexamethasone (Dex) or deacylcortivazol (DAC). The highly conserved phosphoprotein p38 MAPK is activated by specific phosphorylation of its threonine180 and tyrosine182 residues. We show that Dex and DAC stimulate p38 MAPK phosphorylation and increase the mRNA of MAPK kinase 3, a specific immediate upstream activator of p38 MAPK. Enzymatic assays confirmed elevated activity of p38 MAPK. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK activity was protective against GC-driven apoptosis in human and mouse lymphoid cells. In contrast, inhibition of the MAPKs, ERK and cJun N-terminal kinase, enhanced apoptosis. Activated p38 MAPK phosphorylates specific downstream targets. Because phosphorylation of the GR is affected by MAPKs, we examined its phosphorylation state in our system. We found serine 211 of the human GR to be a substrate for p38 MAPK both in vitro and intracellularly. Mutation of this site to alanine greatly diminished GR-driven gene transcription and apoptosis. Our results clearly demonstrate a role for p38 MAPK signaling in the pathway of GC-induced apoptosis of lymphoid cells.","['Miller, Aaron L', 'Webb, M Scott', 'Copik, Alicja J', 'Wang, Yongxin', 'Johnson, Betty H', 'Kumar, Raj', 'Thompson, E Brad']","['Miller AL', 'Webb MS', 'Copik AJ', 'Wang Y', 'Johnson BH', 'Kumar R', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, The University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Boulevard, Room 5.104, Medical Research Building, Route 1068, Galveston, Texas 77555-1068, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 3)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/chemistry', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glucocorticoids/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Propidium/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*chemistry', 'Serine/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Threonine/chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/09/15 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['me.2004-0528 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2004-0528 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2005 Jun;19(6):1569-83. doi: 10.1210/me.2004-0528.

Soon after, he developed rapidly progressing malignant peritoneal mesothelioma.

Since asbestos, simian virus 40 (SV40), or both have been associated with lymphoproliferative disease and mesothelioma, we investigated both possible links in our patient. Imaging studies provided evidence for asbestos exposure because bilateral pleural plaques were identified.

Recently, we have described the cytotoxic activity of ent-trachyloban-3beta-ol isolated from the leaves of Croton zambesicus, a plant used in African folk medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viability on several cell lines, cell morphology, DNA laddering, annexin Vand caspase-3 activation experiments were undertaken in order to analyse the cytotoxicty of trachylobane diterpene and to determine if this compound is able to induce apoptosis. RESULTS: ent-Trachyloban-3beta-ol exerts a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, which varies between cell lines. Induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells could be detected at a concentration of 50 microM after 24-h treatment. CONCLUSION: We show here, for the first time, that a trachylobane diterpene is able to induce apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia cells via caspase-3 activation in a concentration-dependent manner.","['Block, S', 'Gerkens, P', 'Peulen, O', 'Jolois, O', 'Mingeot-Leclercq, M P', 'De Pauw-Gillet, M Cl', 'Quetin-Leclercq, J']","['Block S', 'Gerkens P', 'Peulen O', 'Jolois O', 'Mingeot-Leclercq MP', 'De Pauw-Gillet MC', 'Quetin-Leclercq J']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacognosie, Universite Catholique de Louvain, UCL 72.30-CHAM, 1200 Bruxelles, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (trachyloban-3-ol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Croton/chemistry', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/05/17 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 Jan-Feb;25(1A):363-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FR-targeted liposomal delivery is an attractive strategy for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer agents against FR(+) tumors. In this study, FR-targeted liposomal daunorubicin was evaluated in an FR+ L1210JF murine ascites tumor model for therapeutic efficacy in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FR-targeted liposomal daunorubicin (F-L-DNR) and non-targeted liposomal daunorubicin (L-DNR) were prepared by polycarbonate membrane extrusion followed by remote loading of DNR. FR-targeted liposomal uptake by L1210JF cells was characterized in vitro using fluorescent liposomes entrapping calcein. For in vivo therapeutic study, B6D2F1 mice on a folate-free diet were intraperitoneally implanted with FR (+) L1210JF cells and treated with 4 intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg liposomal DNR at 1, 5, 9 and 13 days following tumor cell inoculation. Animal survival was then monitored daily. RESULTS: LI210JF cells showed approximately 10(3) times greater uptake for FR-targeted liposomal calcein compared to the non-targeted control. Uptake of the targeted liposomes could be blocked by 1 mM folic acid. In the therapeutic study, mice treated with F-L-DNR showed significantly greater tumor inhibition and 40.7% greater increase in life-span compared to those that received identical doses of L-DNR. Meanwhile, free DNR given at the same dose failed to prolong the survival of the treated mice. CONCLUSION: F-L-DNR can effectively target FR(+) leukemia cells in vivo. Further preclinical evaluation is warranted to determine its potential application in leukemia therapy.","['Pan, Xing Q', 'Lee, Robert J']","['Pan XQ', 'Lee RJ']","['Sibyl Pharmaceutical Inc, Columbus, OH 43212, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '39382-08-6 (phosphatidylethanolamine)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'EAG959U971 (1,2-distearoyllecithin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascites/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Fluorescent Dyes/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phosphatidylcholines/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/05/17 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 Jan-Feb;25(1A):343-6.,,,,"['R01CA095673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA79758/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R43CA102847/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R43CA81975/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Toxicity and pharmacokinetics studies were conducted in CD2F1 mice and beagle dogs. Therapeutic efficacy studies were performed in murine leukemia (P388 and P388/ADR) and in a human pancreatic (Capan-1) tumor models. RESULTS: Multiple dose administration (i.v. x 5) of LE-SN38 indicated a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 5.0 and 7.5 mg/kg/day for male and female mice, respectively. The MTD of LE-SN38 in dogs was 1.2 mg/kg. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of SN-38 in mouse plasma was 6.38 h with volume of distribution (VdSS) 2.55 L/kg.

TT-232 activates SSTR receptors (primarily the SSTR-1), which leads to irreversible cell cycle arrest, followed by secondary induction of apoptosis. TT-232 has passed phase I clinical trials without toxicity and significant side-effects. We examined the antiproliferative effect in vitro and the antitumor effect in vivo of TT-232 on leukemia cell lines. During in vivo experiments, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of TT-232 in various long-term administration routes; traditional injection versus infusion treatment via an inserted Alzet minipump on P-388 mice and HL-60 human leukemia models. Treatment with TT-232 started after development of the disease. In vitro, TT-232 inhibited the proliferation of P-388 mice lymphoid cells and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells in the range of 46%-97% with 24-hour treatment and 82%-100% with 48-hour treatment. Cells were treated with 30 microg/ml and 60 microg/ml dose of TT-232. With the same in vivo models, the best results were achieved when TT-232 was applied by infusion treatments. The infusion treatment with TT-232 produced 50%-80% inhibition of growth and resulted in 20%-40% long-term and leukemia-free survivors. TT-232 showed dose-, time- and administration mode-dependent antileukemia activity in vitro and in vivo, both on rodent and human models.

In the analysis by flow cytometry, high dose ara-C arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1-phase. Middle and low doses ara-C induced a block in the S-phase, that was not completely blocked by the low dose. Analysis of DNA fragmentation revealed that ara-C dose-dependently induced apoptosis, which was only slightly induced by the low dose. We measured activities of cellular thymidylate synthase (TS) and thymidine kinase (TK) after 24-h culture. Low and middle doses, but not high dose ara-C markedly enhanced TS activity to 2.9- in low and 5.3-fold in middle doses ara-C, and TK activity to 1.3- in low and 2.2-fold in middle doses, respectively, compared with those of the control. The cells accumulated in the S-phase by 48-h culture with low dose ara-C and markedly proliferated compared to that of the control in ara-C-free medium. These results indicate that non-high dose ara-C enhances DNA-synthesizing enzyme activities in L1210 cells, and withdrawal of the non-high dose ara-C results in paradoxical cell proliferation. Thus, daily intramuscular injections with an insufficient dose of ara-C may induce cells into S-phase, resulting in the proliferation of leukemic cells.","['Nakayama, Tohru', 'Sakamoto, Shinobu', 'Sassa, Shuji', 'Suzuki, Satoe', 'Kudo, Hideki', 'Nagasawa, Hiroshi']","['Nakayama T', 'Sakamoto S', 'Sassa S', 'Suzuki S', 'Kudo H', 'Nagasawa H']","['Nursing Science, School of Allied Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/05/17 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 Jan-Feb;25(1A):157-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether or not wogonin could affect the N-acetylation of AF in HL-60. N-acetylated and non-N-acetylated AF were determined by using high performance liquid chromatography. Wogonin displayed a dose-dependent inhibition of NAT activity in cytosols and intact cells. Wogonin also decreased AF-DNA adduct formation in these cells. The effects of wogonin on the NAT enzymes levels were also examined by Western blotting and flow cytometry and the changes of NAT gene expression were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cDNA microarray.

However, the majority of patients achieving cytogenetic remissions with imatinib treatment have molecular evidence of persistent disease, and residual BCR/ABL(+) progenitors can be detected. There is a need to develop new approaches that enhance elimination of malignant progenitors in imatinib-treated patients. Here we show that CML CD34(+) progenitors are sensitive to several apoptosis-inducing stimuli including the chemotherapeutic agents Ara-C and VP-16, radiation, arsenic trioxide, ceramide, growth factor withdrawal, and the death receptor activators TNFalpha and TRAIL. Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition by imatinib did not enhance sensitivity of CML progenitors to Ara-C, VP-16, ceramide, radiation or TRAIL-induced apoptosis but did enhance arsenic and TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. We further demonstrate that apoptosis was restricted to dividing cells, whereas nonproliferating BCR/ABL(+) CD34(+) cells were resistant to apoptosis induced by imatinib, Ara-C or arsenic, either alone or in combination. Resistance of quiescent CML progenitors to imatinib-induced apoptosis could contribute to persistence of residual malignant progenitors in imatinib-treated patients. Combination treatment with Ara-C or arsenic may not enhance targeting of nonproliferating CML progenitors. The assay described here may be useful for identifying agents targeting quiescent CML progenitors.","['Holtz, M S', 'Forman, S J', 'Bhatia, R']","['Holtz MS', 'Forman SJ', 'Bhatia R']","['Division of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403724 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403724 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jun;19(6):1034-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403724.,,,,"['5M01 RR00043/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA95684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Events that are responsible for this transformation process are largely unknown.

In total, 32 differentially expressed sequences were identified, of which 27 corresponded to known genes. On quantitative PCR, eight of these genes, YWHAZ, GAS2, IL8, IL6, PBEF1, CCL4, SAT and MMRN, showed comparable differential expression in additional CML patient samples.

FLT3-ITD has therefore been considered to be an attractive molecular target for a novel therapeutic modality. We describe here the identification and characterization of Ki23819 as a novel FLT3 inhibitor. Ki23819 suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of FLT3-ITD-expressing human leukemia cell lines. The growth-inhibitory effect of Ki23819 on MV4-11 cells was superior to that of SU11248, another FLT3 inhibitor (IC(50)<1 vs 3-10 nM). Ki23819 inhibited the autophosphorylation of FLT3-ITD more efficiently than that of wild-type FLT3. FLT3-ITD-dependent activation of the downstream signaling proteins ERK and STAT5 was also inhibited within similar concentration ranges. Thus, Ki23819 is a potent in vitro inhibitor of FLT3.","['Komeno, Y', 'Kurokawa, M', 'Imai, Y', 'Takeshita, M', 'Matsumura, T', 'Kubo, K', 'Yoshino, T', 'Nishiyama, U', 'Kuwaki, T', 'Kubo, K', 'Osawa, T', 'Ogawa, S', 'Chiba, S', 'Miwa, A', 'Hirai, H']","['Komeno Y', 'Kurokawa M', 'Imai Y', 'Takeshita M', 'Matsumura T', 'Kubo K', 'Yoshino T', 'Nishiyama U', 'Kuwaki T', 'Kubo K', 'Osawa T', 'Ogawa S', 'Chiba S', 'Miwa A', 'Hirai H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ki23819)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Milk Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Quinolines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Urea/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403736 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403736 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jun;19(6):930-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403736.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The typical group, which includes 69% cases of FL, is characterized by low histological grade (grade 1, 2), coexpression of BCL2 and CD10 and Bcl2 gene translocation. The rest comprises a small part of low-grade FL without Bcl2 gene translocation and high-grade (grade 3a, 3b) FL. These FLs include some heterogeneous disease entities.

This study addressed the global gene expression pattern of these two leukemia subtypes with respect to common deregulated pathways and lineage-associated differences. We analyzed 73 t(11q23)/MLL leukemias in comparison to 290 other acute leukemias and demonstrate that 11q23 leukemias combined are characterized by a common specific gene expression signature. Additionally, in unsupervised and supervised data analysis algorithms, ALL and AML cases with t(11q23) segregate according to the lineage they are derived from, that is, myeloid or lymphoid, respectively. This segregation can be explained by a highly differing transcriptional program. Through the use of novel biological network analyses, essential regulators of early B cell development, PAX5 and EBF, were shown to be associated with a clear B-lineage commitment in lymphoblastic t(11q23)/MLL leukemias. Also, the influence of the different MLL translocation partners on the transcriptional program was directly assessed.

A bsMAb was made by coupling the Fab' of a humanized anti-CD20 antibody to the Fab' of a murine antibody directed against the peptide histamine-succinyl-glycine (HSG). The tumor targeting of the bsMAb was separated from the subsequent delivery of the radionuclide-bearing HSG peptide conjugated with (111)In or (90)Y. Nude mice bearing s.c. Ramos human B-cell lymphomas were injected with the bsMAb and then, 48 h later, (111)In/(90)Y-HSG peptide was given. At 3 h postinjection, tumor/blood ratios for pretargeted (111)In-HSG-peptide were similar to that observed with the directly conjugated (111)In-anti-CD20 IgG at its highest level on day 7, but by day 1, tumor/blood ratios were about 10-fold higher than the IgG. Tumors progressed rapidly in animals given 800 microCi of (90)Y-HSG peptide alone, whereas 5/10 animals in the group pretargeted by the anti-CD20 bsMAb were tumor-free 18 weeks later. The antitumor response in animals administered the pretargeted (90)Y-HSG peptide was also significantly superior to treatment with the directly radiolabeled (90)Y-anti-CD20 IgG, whether given as a single injection (P<0.007) or as a divided dose (P=0.016).

In this study, murine marrow or human CD34(+) cells were transduced with retroviral or lentiviral vectors expressing CBFbeta-SMMHC or two mutant variants. CBFbeta-SMMHC reduced murine or human myeloid cell proliferation three- to four-fold in liquid culture relative to empty vector-transduced cells, during a period when vector-transduced cells accumulated five-fold and human cells 20-fold. CBFbeta-SMMHC decreased the formation of myeloid, but not erythroid, colonies two- to four-fold, and myeloid colonies expressing CBFbeta-SMMHC were markedly reduced in size. However, CBFbeta-SMMHC did not slow differentiation to granulocytes or monocytes. Neither CBFbeta-SMMHC(Delta2-11), which does not bind AML1, nor CBFbeta-SMMHC(DeltaACD), which does not multimerize or efficiently bind corepressors, slowed proliferation or reduced myeloid colonies. CBFbeta-SMMHC increased the G1/S ratio 1.4-fold. AML1 had an effect opposite to CBFbeta-SMMHC, stimulating proliferation of murine myeloid progenitors 2.0-fold in liquid culture. Thus, CBFbeta-SMMHC directly inhibits the proliferation of normal myeloid progenitors via inhibition of AML1 and dependent upon the integrity of its assembly competence domain.

The apoptosis-related protein profile at diagnosis is important for achieving complete remission thereby affecting survival variables such as disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).To investigate the role of the apoptosis protein profile in further response to therapy and outgrowth of disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied whether Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bax as well as the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and a combination of all (antiapoptosis index, AAI) are related to the frequency of malignant cells surviving the chemotherapy (i.e., minimal residual disease, MRD). MRD cells were identified by leukemia-associated aberrant phenotypes established at diagnosis by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that Bcl-2 (R = 0.55, P = 0.002), Bcl-2/Bax (R = 0.42, P = 0.02), and AAI (R = 0.47, P = 0.01) at diagnosis directly correlated with MRD after the first cycle of chemotherapy. In turn, MRD frequency after first cycle correlated with DFS (P = 0.04). Taken together, these results directly explain why Bcl-2/Bax and especially AAI (P = 0.007) at diagnosis correlate with DFS. CONCLUSION: Our results show that apoptosis resistance plays an important role in the first stage of the therapy (i.e., to eliminate the bulk of malignant cells), in terms of achievement of complete remission and frequency of MRD after first cycle of therapy.","['van Stijn, Amber', 'Feller, Nicole', 'Kok, Alice', 'van der Pol, Marjoleine A', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J']","['van Stijn A', 'Feller N', 'Kok A', 'van der Pol MA', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/08/09 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/7/2540 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1973 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 1;11(7):2540-6. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1973.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The univariate analysis showed that more CD34(+) cells per kilogram and more CD34(+) cells per kilogram per day were collected from patients who had a shorter interval (less than 2 months) between diagnosis and PBSC harvest (P = .0111). In conclusion, this study showed that the CD34(+) cell dose was most strongly correlated with a successful engraftment in AML CR1 patients who underwent APBSCT. The proper timing of PBSC collections should be explored to optimize the outcome of APBSCT in AML CR1 patients.","['Lee, Jeeyun', 'Lee, Mark H', 'Park, Keon Woo', 'Kang, Jung Hoon', 'Im, Do Hyung', 'Kim, Kihyun', 'Lee, Se-Hoon', 'Kim, Won Seog', 'Park, Jinny', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Parka, Keunchil']","['Lee J', 'Lee MH', 'Park KW', 'Kang JH', 'Im DH', 'Kim K', 'Lee SH', 'Kim WS', 'Park J', 'Jung CW', 'Parka K']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/06/17 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['JGTV32BPDQ2PHC07 [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.A30411 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 Apr;81(3):258-63. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.A30411.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic abnormalities of the several tumor suppressor genes, including p15INK4B, p16INK4A/p14ARF, p53, p73, and Rb genes have been reported. Deletions and point mutations of these genes are frequently detected in these diseases. It has been reported that tumor suppressor genes are inactivated by DNA methylation of the promoter region and/or first exon of the genes in a variety of human cancers. In this study we analyze the methylation status of the genes associated with cell cycle regulation, including p16INK4A, p15INK4B, p21/Waf1/Cip1, p27/Kip1, p73, and p14ARF, by methylation specific (MS) PCR and/or bisulfite sequencing. We examined 29 cases of NK cell disorders (five aggressive NK cell leukemia/lymphoma, three blastic NK cell lymphoma/leukemia, five nasal NK cell lymphoma, three myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia, 13 chronic NK lymphocytosis). We found methylation of the first exon of the p16INK4A gene in two cases (one aggressive, one blastic), and methylation of the p14ARF gene in one aggressive NK cell leukemia. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that methylation of the p15 and p27 genes was rare in these disorders. MS-PCR suggested that the p73 and p21 genes were methylated in seven cases, respectively (p73: one blastic, one nasal, five chronic; p21: one myeloid/NK, one aggressive, one nasal, and four chronic); bisulfite sequencing confirmed that methylated alleles of these genes were dominant in the samples except three cases (one myeloid/NK, one aggressive, and one chronic) in which methylated alleles of the p21 genes were less than 34% of all alleles. These results suggested that inactivation of the cell cycle regulatory genes by DNA methylation could be associated with tumorigenesis in NK cell disorders, not only aggressive subtypes but also chronic subtype.","['Kawamata, Norihiko', 'Inagaki, Naoko', 'Mizumura, Sachiko', 'Sugimoto, Kei-Ji', 'Sakajiri, Sakura', 'Ohyanagi-Hara, Mutsuko', 'Oshimi, Kazuo']","['Kawamata N', 'Inagaki N', 'Mizumura S', 'Sugimoto KJ', 'Sakajiri S', 'Ohyanagi-Hara M', 'Oshimi K']","['Division of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. kawamatan@cshs.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology/*physiology', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/05/25 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH417 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00417.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 May;74(5):424-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00417.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated long-term outcomes of unselected AML patients categorized according to the new WHO classification. Between 1990 and 2002, 109 adult AML cases were referred to our hospital. For the entire population, the median survival duration was 1.2 yr with a 5-yr survival rate of 31%. AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities accounted for 26%, AML with multilineage dysplasia for 29%, therapy-related AML for 13%, and AML not otherwise categorized for 32% of classifiable cases. Among the four groups, a significant difference was observed in terms of overall survival (P < 0.0001). Univariate analysis showed that six variables affected survival: cytogenetic risk, age, multilineage dysplasia, prior chemo/radiotherapy, type of treatment (intensive or palliative), and transplantation. However, in multivariate analysis no adverse prognostic impact of multilineage dysplasia and prior chemo/radiotherapy was detected (P = 0.4979 and 0.8702), whereas cytogenetic risk and patient age maintained their prognostic value (P = 0.0005 and 0.0100). These results indicate that outcomes for AML patients appear to be distinguished on the basis of the WHO classification, but the prognostic significance of multilineage dysplasia and prior therapy is lost after adjusting for cytogenetic risk and age.

METHODS: Cell viability was assessed by propidium iodide staining, and apoptosis by annexin-V and caspase activation flow cytometry assays. Additionally, expression of the apoptosis-regulating proteins Bax, Bak, Bid, Bcl-w, Bcl-2, XIAP and Mcl-1 was evaluated in B-CLL lymphocytes. RESULTS: Bortezomib alone induced significant, dose-dependent cytotoxicity starting from the low concentration 2.5 nm, inducing apoptosis of B-CLL cells. Combination of this agent with 2-CdA or FA resulted in an increase of cytotoxicity when compared with that mediated by single drugs. The observed increase was especially evident when 5 nm of bortezomib were combined with suboptimal doses of 2-CdA or FA. The combination index (CI) was 0.87 for bortezomib + 2-CdA and 0.82 for bortezomib + FA, indicating an evident additive effect of these combinations. Moreover, B-CLL cells were more sensitive to proteasome inhibitor used alone or combined with 2-CdA or FA comparing to CD3+ lymphocytes. Corresponding to enhanced apoptosis, the expression levels of several apoptosis-regulating proteins were altered. The most pronounced changes were down-regulation of XIAP and up-regulation of Bid proteins by the combination of bortezomib with either 2-CdA or FA. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggest that the in vitro cytotoxic effect through proteasome inhibition by bortezomib can be increased substantially with low doses of the purine nucleoside analogues, 2-CdA and FA, and that this effect on B-CLL cell is selectively higher than on normal, CD3-positive lymphocytes.","['Duechler, Markus', 'Linke, Anna', 'Cebula, Barbara', 'Shehata, Medhat', 'Schwarzmeier, Josef D', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Smolewski, Piotr']","['Duechler M', 'Linke A', 'Cebula B', 'Shehata M', 'Schwarzmeier JD', 'Robak T', 'Smolewski P']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cytokine Research, Department of Hematology, Clinic of Internal Medicine I, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*toxicity', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cladribine/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/05/25 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH406 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00406.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 May;74(5):407-17. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00406.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sole del(9q) was associated with a characteristic bone marrow phenotype at diagnosis: a single Auer rod was found in all cases examined. There was also an association with erythroid dysplasia (74%) and granylocytic lineage vacuolation (90%). The incidence of all three of these features was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the sole del(9q) group compared with control cases lacking del(9q).

Only rarely does CLL transform into Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). To further analyse the clinico-pathological and genetic findings in the HL variant of RS, we performed a single-institution study in four patients, who developed HL within a mean of 107 months after diagnosis of CLL. All were treated with fludarabine. Three cases were Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated mixed cellularity (MC) HL, the fourth was nodular sclerosis (NS) HL without EBV association. The sites involved by HL included supra- and infradiaphragmal lymph nodes and the tonsils; stage IV disease was also documented. All patients presented with CLL treatment-resistant lymphadenopathies and B-symptoms. In two of the MC cases, molecular analysis performed on CLL samples and microdissected Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells (HRSC) suggested a clonal relationship, while in NS no indication of a clonal relationship was detected. In summary, HL can occur in CLL patients at any site, up to 17 years after initial diagnosis, especially after treatment with fludarabine. The majority present with B-symptoms and CLL treatment-resistant lymphadenopathy, are of the MC type, clonally related to CLL and might be triggered by an EBV infection.","['Fong, Dominic', 'Kaiser, Alexandra', 'Spizzo, Gilbert', 'Gastl, Guenther', 'Tzankov, Alexandar']","['Fong D', 'Kaiser A', 'Spizzo G', 'Gastl G', 'Tzankov A']","['Division of Haematology and Oncology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Micromanipulation', 'Middle Aged', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/ultrastructure/virology', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/05/19 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5426 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05426.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Apr;129(2):199-205. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05426.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the in vitro drug resistance by the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) in 132 children with AML and 178 children with ALL (aged 0-17 years). In AML, children with t(9;11) (n = 10) were significantly more sensitive to cytarabine (P < 0.001) and doxorubicin (P = 0.005) than non-11q23 rearranged patients (n = 108). Children with other 11q23 rearrangements (n = 14) differed less from non-rearranged children. The 'AML-profile' common to all three groups included relative resistance to glucocorticoids and vincristine. In ALL, children with 11q23 rearrangement (n = 22) were significantly more sensitive to cytarabine (P = 0.026) than children without 11q23 rearrangement (n = 156), also after stratification for white blood cell count. In conclusion, the findings indicate that the cellular drug resistance is correlated to both the cell lineage and the type of 11q23 rearrangement. High cellular sensitivity to cytarabine and doxorubicin might explain the excellent treatment results in children with AML and t(9;11). The present study supports the strategy of contemporary protocols to include high-dose cytarabine in the treatment of 11q23-positive patients both in AML and ALL.","['Palle, J', 'Frost, B M', 'Forestier, E', 'Gustafsson, G', 'Nygren, P', 'Hellebostad, M', 'Jonsson, O G', 'Kanerva, J', 'Schmiegelow, K', 'Larsson, R', 'Lonnerholm, G']","['Palle J', 'Frost BM', 'Forestier E', 'Gustafsson G', 'Nygren P', 'Hellebostad M', 'Jonsson OG', 'Kanerva J', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Larsson R', 'Lonnerholm G']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. josefine.palle@akademiska.se""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fluorometry', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/05/19 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5433 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05433.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Apr;129(2):189-98. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05433.x.,,,,,,,,,,,['Nordic Society for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology'],,,,,,,,,,

Often the diagnosis can be difficult, but early diagnosis and aggressive treatment can prevent irreversible neurologic deficits. Diagnosis is usually established by the demonstration of malignant cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or by the presence of enhancing tumor nodules on cranial or spinal MRI. Treatment may require focal radiotherapy to symptomatic sites accompanied by chemotherapy. Intra-CSF chemotherapy requires normal CSF flow dynamics and is typically limited to the use of methotrexate, cytarabine or thiotepa. Intrathecal chemotherapy is rarely efficacious, except for hematopoietic neoplasms and, to a lesser extent, breast cancer. Increasingly, systemic chemotherapy is recognized as efficacious in the treatment of leptomeningeal metastasis in part because it has the ability to penetrate into bulky disease seen on neuroimaging. The optimum choice of therapy depends upon a thorough assessment of the neurologic extent of disease, which should include complete neuraxis imaging. Patients with extensive bulky disease may be best treated with systemic chemotherapy, whereas those with a positive CSF cytology but negative imaging may be treated with intrathecal chemotherapy and spared the systemic toxicity of intravenous drug. Despite vigorous therapy, many patients do poorly and the median survival is only about four months. Nevertheless, some patients, particularly those with leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer, respond and a substantial minority will be alive one to two years after diagnosis.","['DeAngelis, Lisa M', 'Boutros, Dina']","['DeAngelis LM', 'Boutros D']","['Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA. deangell@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy/radiotherapy/*secondary', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/04/09 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2005/04/09 09:00'],"['2005/04/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2005;23(2):145-54.,,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective. METHOD: In 1998-1999 PI was diagnosed in 9 of the 140 children with malignant disease in the department of Paediatric Oncology of the UMC St Radboud, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. By examination of the records of these 9 children, data were collected on the symptomatology, diagnostics, treatment and prognosis of PI. RESULTS: The 9 children included 7 boys and 2 girls, varying in age from 2 to 12 years. In 7 patients the underlying disease was acute lymphocytic leukaemia and in 2 it was a stage IV neuroblastoma. The presenting symptoms were nonspecific and included: a distended abdomen, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and constipation. In all children, PI was located in the colon. Supplemental blood and microbiological analysis did not reveal any typical abnormalities. 8 children were treated with lactitol because of constipation. A laparotomy was performed in the first patient, while the other 8 were treated with gastric suctioning, parenteral nutrition and antibiotics. All 9 children recovered within a few weeks. CONCLUSION: With supportive care, PI in children with malignant disease is mostly a self-limiting condition. A pneumoperitoneum in PI is no indication for surgery, except in the presence of an acute abdomen.

Chromosomal lesions, mutations, and abnormal gene expression with prognostic value determined the clustering. In fact, gene-expression profiling recognized leukaemias with certain chromosomal aberrations that had been missed by routine cytogenetics. Thus, gene-expression profiling allows a comprehensive classification of AML that includes previously-identified genetically-defined as well as novel prognostically-relevant subgroups.

Although some data regarding health behaviors of this population exist, receptivity to health promotion is largely unknown. METHODS: A survey was mailed to 380 survivors (age range, 11-33 years) of childhood leukemia, lymphoma, or central nervous system carcinomas (and guardians of survivors < 18 years old) to elicit data on exercise, dietary intake of calcium, fat, and fruits and vegetables, smoking status, readiness to pursue lifestyle change, quality of life, and interest in various health interventions. RESULTS: Responses from 209 survivors (a 55% response rate) suggested that most did not meet guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption (79%), calcium intake (68%), or exercise (52%), 42% were overweight/obese, and 84% consumed > 30% of calories from fat. Older (> 18 years) compared with younger (< 18 years) survivors were more likely to smoke (17% vs. 1%), to be obese (21.6% vs. 14.6%), and to have suboptimal calcium intakes (75.6% vs. 57.6%). No differences in lifestyle behaviors were observed between cancer groups. Compared with interventions aimed at weight control, improving self-esteem, or smoking cessation, the highest levels of interest were found consistently for interventions aimed at getting in shape and eating healthy. Survivors preferred mailed interventions to those delivered in-person, by telephone counselors, or via computers. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood cancer practiced several suboptimal health behaviors. Health promotion interventions aimed at areas of interest and delivered through acceptable channels have the potential to improve long-term health and function of this vulnerable population.","['Demark-Wahnefried, Wendy', 'Werner, Cary', 'Clipp, Elizabeth C', 'Guill, Ann Bebe', 'Bonner, Melanie', 'Jones, Lee W', 'Rosoff, Philip M']","['Demark-Wahnefried W', 'Werner C', 'Clipp EC', 'Guill AB', 'Bonner M', 'Jones LW', 'Rosoff PM']","['Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. demar001mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Calcium, Dietary)', '0 (Dietary Fats)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Attitude to Health', 'Calcium, Dietary/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Dietary Fats/administration & dosage', 'Exercise/psychology', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', '*Health Behavior', '*Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Legal Guardians/*psychology', 'Life Style', 'Male', '*Neoplasms', 'Obesity/psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Concept', 'Smoking/psychology', 'Smoking Cessation', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2005/04/07 09:00,2005/07/15 09:00,['2005/04/07 09:00'],"['2005/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21009 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 May 15;103(10):2171-80. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21009.,,,,['P30-CA14236-32/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA from B cells (tumour cells) and from T cells (normal controls) of 27 samples of 26 patients with previously untreated B-CLL was extracted. Microsatellite instability in six microsatellite markers was tested using GeneScan Analysis Software. The rate of replication errors positive phenotype (RER+) was determined (MSI in more than 30% of examined loci). RER+ was found in four out of 27 patients (14.8%). A larger proportion of patients with stage C B-CLL exhibited RER+ than those with stage A or B (P < 0.05). A higher prevalence of RER+ was demonstrated in a subgroup of patients with additional malignancies (three out of eight patients) in comparison with patients with B-CLL alone (1/19) (P = 0.031). In conclusion, our study demonstrated that MSI might have a more prominent role in pathogenesis of B-CLL than reported to date. This may result from a selection of microsatellite markers adjacent to chromosomal loci, which are involved in B-cell malignancies, and using GeneScan Analysis Software, which is most modern and precise method of microsatellite analysis.","['Niv, E', 'Bomstein, Y', 'Yuklea, M', 'Lishner, M']","['Niv E', 'Bomstein Y', 'Yuklea M', 'Lishner M']","['Department of Medicine, Meir Hospital, Kfar-Saba, Israel. niv.em@netvision.net.il']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomal Instability/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/genetics', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/04/07 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/04/07 09:00'],"['2005/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['6602532 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6602532 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2005 Apr 25;92(8):1517-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602532.,,PMC2361995,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cumulative incidence at 15 years is 10-12%. The B-cell proliferative disorders (BCLP) are the most common MD in the first year after SCT; the incidence probability is 1% in allogeneic transplants but is much higher (until 14%) after HLA-identical, T-cell-depleted SCT in which Campath 1G or ATG are given. BCLP develop because of reactivation of the EBV and a depressed cellular immunity. Prediction of risk of BCLP can be made by frequent monitoring of EBV load in patients with risk factors. The most effective therapies are the early administration of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and adoptive immunotherapy with in vitro generated EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells. Myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia with very poor prognosis have been described in 4-18% of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin disease, 12-24 months after autologous SCT. The risk of development of solid tumors increases over time and the cumulative incidence among children who underwent an SCT at less than 10 years of age is 6-11% at 15 years. There are few studies evaluating quality of life (QOL) in children and adolescents who had received an SCT. The findings of these studies can be summarized as follows: (a) The majority of long survivors enjoy good QOL and return successfully to school or work. (b) A minority (10-15%) complain of physical problems or present moderate cognitive or psychological dysfunctions. (c) The importance of family, other social support and psychological adjustments is generally recognized.

Survival rates have been reported to be as high as 90% for children. Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) is employed in patients who are not candidates for SCT due to donor unavailability. The addition of cyclosporin A to antilymphocyte globulin has improved the response rate to 70-80%, and survival at 5 years among responders is about 90%. In all, 30% of patients treated by IST suffer from relapse, but long-term prognosis does not appear to be affected by this complication. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) shares both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features. Survival (10-year) of patients with JMML without SCT is only 6%. Children with JMML should be transplanted early in the course of their disease. Conditioning regimen composed of three alkylating agents, busulfan, cyclophosphamide and melphalan has been favored by the EWOG-MDS and EBMT-Pediatric WP in the second half of the 1990s. SCT using this conditioning regimen is capable of curing approximately 50% of patients with JMML.

The aim of the study was to analyze whether the MLL translocations are as frequent in radiation-associated AML as in spontaneous AML cases. METHODS: Sixty one AML samples obtained at diagnosis were analyzed for the presence of MLL abnormalities using fluorescent in situ hybridization and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Of these patients, 27 had experienced radiation exposure due to the Chernobyl accident, 32 were non-irradiated (spontaneous AML), and 2 developed therapy-related AML after chemotherapy with topoisomerase II inhibitors. RESULTS: MLL gene translocations were detected in both groups of spontaneous and therapy-related AML (1/32 and 1/2 cases respectively). The sole MLL rearrangement found in the group of radiation-associated AML patients was a duplication of the gene. CONCLUSION: Our data preclude the involvement of MLL gene translocations in radiation-induced leukemogenesis, but support the assumption that loss and gain of chromosomal material could be crucial in the leukemogenesis of AML patients with the history of radiation exposure due to the Chernobyl accident.","['Klymenko, Sergiy V', 'Bink, Karin', 'Trott, Klaus R', 'Bebeshko, Vladimir G', 'Bazyka, Dimitry A', 'Dmytrenko, Iryna V', 'Abramenko, Iryna V', 'Bilous, Nadia I', 'Zitzelsberger, Horst', 'Misurin, Andrei V', 'Atkinson, Michael J', 'Rosemann, Michael']","['Klymenko SV', 'Bink K', 'Trott KR', 'Bebeshko VG', 'Bazyka DA', 'Dmytrenko IV', 'Abramenko IV', 'Bilous NI', 'Zitzelsberger H', 'Misurin AV', 'Atkinson MJ', 'Rosemann M']","['Research Centre for Radiation Medicine, Academy of Medical Science of Ukraine, Kyiv 04050, Ukraine. klymenko_sergiy@yahoo.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Chromosome Aberrations/chemically induced/*radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2005/04/07 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/04/07 09:00'],"['2005/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['21/395 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2005 Mar;27(1):71-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Four cell sublines resistant to widely used cytostatics taxotere (Tax) or vincristine (Vcr) were developed by long-term culturing of the parental lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9 with incremental doses of these drugs. Constant presence of cyclosporin A (CsA) as a P-glycoprotein (Pgp) blocker in some cell cultures simulated prophylactic inhibition of this protein activity for prevention of drug resistance development from the very beginning of treatment. Both types of resistant cell sublines (developed in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A) were undergone to the action of the same Pgp blocker and drug inducing agents in short time cultures. Pgp activity by flow cytometry with fluorescence dye retention was checked and cytotoxicity assay by MTT-test was performed for drug resistance. RESULTS: According to the experimental data obtained drug resistance prophylactics policy is problematically effective in prevention of tumor cells resistance to cytostatics.

We show here that the responses of B lymphocytes to LPS require the function of the Vav family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Vav1-mutant mice generate defective humoral immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses following administration of low doses of LPS but respond normally to higher doses, while mice lacking both Vav1 and Vav2 manifest defective responses even after a high dose of LPS. Vav1/2-mutant B cells fail to divide extensively in vitro in response to LPS or CD180, while deficiency of Vav1 alone impairs CD180-but not LPS-driven proliferation. Likewise, activation of Akt (a PI3K [phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase] target) and phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha in response to CD180 or LPS required Vav1 and Vav2, while Vav1 deficiency led to defective responses to CD180. In addition, activation of ERK (extracellular signal regulated kinase) required Vav1 and Vav2 in response to CD180 but was Vav1 and vav2 independent in response to LPS. Induction of CD86 and CD25 by anti-CD180 also required Vav function, as did the induction of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL (B-cell leukemia XL). These data provide evidence for the function for the Vav proteins in regulating the responses of B cells to LPS.","['Hebeis, Barbara', 'Vigorito, Elena', 'Kovesdi, Dorottya', 'Turner, Martin']","['Hebeis B', 'Vigorito E', 'Kovesdi D', 'Turner M']","['Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signaling and Development, The Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus, Cambridge CB2 4AT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Ly78 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Tlr4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Vav1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Vav2 protein, mouse)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lipopolysaccharides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/04/07 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/04/07 09:00'],"['2005/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53289-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-10-3919 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 15;106(2):635-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-10-3919.

In vitro studies demonstrated that the retinoid X receptor (RXR) retinoid, bexarotene, at biologically relevant concentrations of 10(-6) M to 10(-8) M, upregulated both the p55 and p75 subunits of the IL-2R and enhanced 5- to 10-fold the susceptibility of T-cell leukemia cells to denileukin diftitox. To determine whether this biomodulatory effect could be recapitulated in vivo, we treated 14 patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with escalating doses of bexarotene (75 mg/day-300 mg/day) and denileukin diftitox (18 mcg/kg per day x 3 days every 21 days) in a phase 1 trial.

Four patients experienced grade 2 or 3 leukopenia, and 2 had grade 4 lymphopenia.

Because several genes that regulate apoptosis, proliferation, and metastasis are regulated by nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), we postulated that indole-3-carbinol must mediate its activity through NF-kappaB modulation. We demonstrated that indole-3-carbinol suppressed constitutive NF-kappaB activation and activation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cigarette smoke; the suppression was not cell type specific, because activation was inhibited in myeloid, leukemia, and epithelial cells. This activation correlated with the sequential suppression of the IkappaBalpha kinase, IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha ubiquitination, IkappaBalpha degradation, p65 phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation, p65 acetylation, and NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression. The NF-kappaB-regulated gene products cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), survivin, inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein-1 (IAP1), IAP2, X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), Bcl-2, Bfl-1/A1, TNF receptor-associated factor-1 (TRAF1), and Fas-associated death domain protein-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (FLIP) were all down-regulated by indole-3-carbinol. This down-regulation led to the potentiation of apoptosis induced by cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents. Indole-3-carbinol suppressed constitutive NF-kappaB activation in mononuclear cells derived from bone marrow of acute myelogenous leukemia patients, and this correlated with inhibition of cell growth. Overall, our results indicated that indole-3-carbinol inhibits NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression and that this mechanism may provide the molecular basis for its ability to suppress tumorigenesis.","['Takada, Yasunari', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Takada Y', 'Andreeff M', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, The University of Texas M.

For a parental history of histopathology-specific concordant cancer, the risks were significantly increased for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (SIR = 11.8), follicular NHL (SIR = 6.1), plasma cell myeloma (SIR = 2.5), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR = 5.9). Familial clusters for NHL seemed stronger in females and in siblings. Our study provides the first quantification of the familial risks for NHL by histopathology. The present findings give evidence for a strong familial association of NHL, with little differences in the magnitude of risks for various histopathologic subtypes. The patterns of risks in parents and siblings support the hypothesis of an autosomal-dominant component for diffuse large B-cell NHL and a recessive one for follicular NHL.","['Altieri, Andrea', 'Bermejo, Justo Lorenzo', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Altieri A', 'Bermejo JL', 'Hemminki K']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany. a.altieri@dkfz-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/classification/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2005/04/07 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/04/07 09:00'],"['2005/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53293-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-01-0140 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 15;106(2):668-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-01-0140.

OBJECTIVE: Mitochondria are considered to be the primary intracellular target of arsenic trioxide, and preclinical and mechanistic studies suggest that this agent may have broad applicability in haematological and other malignancies. Investigations of this agent are ongoing in a range of haematological malignancies, and studies in newly diagnosed APL, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) are reviewed here using published articles and presentations at international congresses to June 2004. Medline was used to source published preclinical and clinical data, and abstract databases and publications from relevant major international haematology/oncology congresses were searched to source updates of preclinical and clinical trial data. FINDINGS: Accumulating data indicate that arsenic trioxide may be a useful addition to the therapeutic regimens that have been so successful in treating newly diagnosed APL, and investigations are ongoing to incorporate this agent into the first-line APL treatment paradigm. Preliminary data from clinical studies indicate that arsenic trioxide has clinical activity as a single agent in MDS and MM, and combination therapies are being investigated. In MM, the combination regimens under study incorporate ascorbic acid, which can enhance the efficacy of arsenic trioxide by reducing intracellular glutathione concentrations. In CML, arsenic trioxide is being investigated in combination with imatinib mesylate in patients who have failed initial imatinib treatment. In AML, although results with single-agent arsenic trioxide were not encouraging, treatment using arsenic trioxide in combination with ascorbic acid is a proposed strategy in elderly patients not able to withstand intensive chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This versatile agent has a predictable and manageable safety profile and avoids many of the severe toxicities associated with conventional chemotherapies. Ongoing clinical studies will help to define the role of arsenic trioxide in the treatment of haematological malignancies.","['Amadori, S', 'Fenaux, P', 'Ludwig, H', ""O'dwyer, M"", 'Sanz, M']","['Amadori S', 'Fenaux P', 'Ludwig H', ""O'dwyer M"", 'Sanz M']","['University Tor Vergata, Department of Hematology, St Eugenio Hospital, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/adverse effects/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Design', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria', 'Oxides/adverse effects/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis']",2005/04/07 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/04/07 09:00'],"['2005/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1185/030079904X20349 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2005 Mar;21(3):403-11. doi: 10.1185/030079904X20349.,,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neoplasms of other histogenesis may express CD10, including renal cell carcinoma. Renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the skin (MRCC) can simulate other more common clear cell lesions in which expression of CD10 has not been described. METHODS: Fifty-two cutaneous clear cell lesions including xanthomas (CX), xanthelasmas (XA), xanthogranulomas (XG), balloon cell nevi (BCN), nodular/clear cell hidradenomas (CCH), and MRCC were examined by immunohistochemistry for the expression of CD10, noting frequency and pattern of labeling. RESULTS: CD10 was expressed in 32/35 of the xanthomatous lesions (CX, XA, and XG), 3/3 MRCC, but only 2/8 BCN and 2/6 CCH. BCN and CCH expressed CD10 in fewer than 10% of the clear cells, whereas all MRCC and most xanthomatous lesions had labeling in greater than 10% (p < 0.001). Xanthomatous lesions exhibited a predominantly membranous pattern of labeling compared to the cytoplasmic pattern of MRCC (p < 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous clear cell lesions of different histogenesis express CD10, limiting its use as a specific diagnostic marker for MRCC. Among other clear cell lesions, however, BCN and CCH have a lower frequency of labeling than does MRCC, and xanthomatous lesions show a membranous pattern compared to the cytoplasmic pattern of MRCC, BCN, and CCH. This latter observation may be indicative of altered protein function or trafficking.","['Perna, Ashley G', 'Smith, Megan J', 'Krishnan, Bhuvaneswari', 'Reed, Jon A']","['Perna AG', 'Smith MJ', 'Krishnan B', 'Reed JA']","['Department of Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,['EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neprilysin/*metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution']",2005/04/07 09:00,2005/08/09 09:00,['2005/04/07 09:00'],"['2005/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['CUP333 [pii]', '10.1111/j.0303-6987.2005.00333.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2005 May;32(5):348-51. doi: 10.1111/j.0303-6987.2005.00333.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While in early childhood a high number of B-cell precursors is found in the bone marrow, only very few such cells are usually detectable in adult bone marrow. To assess the number of immature B cells present after haematopoietic cell transplantation the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-positive cells in regenerating bone marrow of adult patients was analysed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bone marrow biopsy specimens were analysed from patients after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT; n = 14) or stem cell transplantation (SCT; n = 25) and autologous BMT (n = 9). Specimens from 11 untransplanted adult patients and 11 infants were also studied, as negative and positive controls, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsy sections using TdT as a marker of lymphoid progenitors. Immunoreactivity for CD79a, CD20 and CD10 was used to confirm their B-cell origin. Using computer-assisted automated image analysis we quantitatively assessed the TdT+ cells present. We found a significant increase in the numbers of B-cell precursors in the bone marrow after allogeneic and autologous BMT/SCT compared with adult controls (P = 0.022). To analyse this in detail, we followed some patients after allogeneic BMT/SCT for up to 1445 days, when a marked B-cell increase was still detectable. However, the median number of TdT+ B cells after BMT/SCT was significantly lower than the number of equivalent B cells in infantile bone marrow biopsy specimens (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow of adult patients after BMT/SCT is capable of initiating vigorous precursor B-cell generation, which is not seen in untransplanted adults. However, the increase of immature B cells was variable in our study. Only in two young adult patients did it reach the magnitude of B-cell generation seen in infantile bone marrow where immunocompetent B cells are produced normally. A marked increase in number of immature B cells post-transplant may mimic B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL). This is a potential problem in patients transplanted for B-ALL itself. Since reactive and neoplastic B-cell precursors share the same immunophenotype in paraffin-embedded tissue, additional tools, particularly molecular techniques, may have to be employed to establish the correct diagnosis.","['Wolf, E', 'Harms, H', 'Winkler, J', 'Reulbach, U', 'Kirchner, T', 'Niedobitek, G', 'Baumann, I']","['Wolf E', 'Harms H', 'Winkler J', 'Reulbach U', 'Kirchner T', 'Niedobitek G', 'Baumann I']","['Department of Pathology, University of Erlangen-Nuremburg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,['EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphopoiesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology/therapy', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/04/07 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/04/07 09:00'],"['2005/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['HIS2109 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2559.2005.02109.x [doi]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2005 Apr;46(4):442-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2005.02109.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we report selective epigenetic silencing of the transcription factor TWIST2 (DERMO1) in Ig V(H) mutated CLL and describe a semiquantitative assay to study promoter methylation of this gene in primary tumor cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWIST2 promoter methylation was identified by restriction landmark genome scanning. Southern blot (SB), bisulfite sequencing, and combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA), and quantitative SB-COBRA was performed to study methylation of the TWIST2 promoter. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays were used to study TWIST2 expression in CLL cells. RESULTS: Following identification and confirmation of TWIST2 methylation in CLL patients, we demonstrated that expression of this transcription factor is related to the degree of promoter methylation. Expression of TWIST2 in a CLL cell line in which the promoter is methylated was increased following decitabine treatment. We next studied 53 patients by COBRA and demonstrated that 72% of patient samples with mutated Ig V(H) show TWIST2 methylation, while only 16% of patient samples with unmutated Ig V(H) were methylated (P < .001). In a subset of patients, methylation of TWIST2 correlated with mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: TWIST2 is differentially methylated in CLL cells relative to Ig V(H) mutational status and can be quantitatively monitored by SB-COBRA. Based on the known role of TWIST2 in silencing p53 function in other malignancies, future studies should focus on the role of TWIST2 in CLL and related lymphoproliferative diseases.","['Raval, Aparna', 'Lucas, David M', 'Matkovic, Jennifer J', 'Bennett, Kristi L', 'Liyanarachchi, Sandya', 'Young, Donn C', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Byrd, John C', 'Plass, Christoph']","['Raval A', 'Lucas DM', 'Matkovic JJ', 'Bennett KL', 'Liyanarachchi S', 'Young DC', 'Rassenti L', 'Kipps TJ', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC', 'Plass C']","['Division of Human Cancer Genetics, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TWIST2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Twist-Related Protein 1)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', '*Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Twist-Related Protein 1']",2005/04/06 09:00,2005/07/08 09:00,['2005/04/06 09:00'],"['2005/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.02.196 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.02.196 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun 10;23(17):3877-85. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.196.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the outcome of patients who underwent SCT according to their VH mutational status. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (14 allo-SCT and 20 autologous SCT [auto-SCT]) presented unmutated VH genes and 16 patients presented mutated VH genes (nine allo-SCT and seven auto-SCT). Tumoral burden pre-SCT was significantly higher in the allo-SCT patients independent of the VH mutational status. The risk of relapse was significantly higher after auto-SCT (5-year risk, 61%; 95% CI, 44% to 84%) than after allo-SCT (5-year risk 12%, 95% CI, 3% to 44%; P < .05).

The aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of patients with advanced CLL when treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients diagnosed with advanced CLL were treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning (2 Gy total-body irradiation with [n = 53] or without [n = 11] fludarabine) and HCT from related (n = 44) or unrelated (n = 20) donors. An adapted form of the Charlson comorbidity index was used to assess pretransplantation comorbidities. RESULTS: Sixty-one of 64 patients had sustained engraftment, whereas three patients rejected their grafts. The incidences of grades 2, 3, and 4 acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were 39%, 14%, 2%, and 50%, respectively. Three patients who underwent transplantation in complete remission (CR) remained in CR. The overall response rate among 61 patients with measurable disease was 67% (50% CR), whereas 5% had stable disease. All patients with morphologic CR who were tested by polymerase chain reaction (n = 11) achieved negative molecular results, and one of these patients subsequently experienced disease relapse. The 2-year incidence of relapse/progression was 26%, whereas the 2-year relapse and nonrelapse mortalities were 18% and 22%, respectively. Two-year rates of overall and disease-free survivals were 60% and 52%, respectively. Unrelated HCT resulted in higher CR and lower relapse rates than related HCT, suggesting more effective graft-versus-leukemia activity. CONCLUSION: CLL is susceptible to graft-versus-leukemia effects, and allogeneic HCT after nonmyeloablative conditioning might prolong median survival for patients with advanced CLL.","['Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Maris, Michael B', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Storer, Barry E', 'Stuart, Monic J', 'Hegenbart, Ute', 'Agura, Edward', 'Chauncey, Thomas R', 'Leis, Jose', 'Pulsipher, Michael', 'McSweeney, Peter', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Bredeson, Christopher', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Langston, Amelia', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Al-Ali, Haifa', 'Blume, Karl G', 'Storb, Rainer', 'Maloney, David G']","['Sorror ML', 'Maris MB', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Storer BE', 'Stuart MJ', 'Hegenbart U', 'Agura E', 'Chauncey TR', 'Leis J', 'Pulsipher M', 'McSweeney P', 'Radich JP', 'Bredeson C', 'Bruno B', 'Langston A', 'Loken MR', 'Al-Ali H', 'Blume KG', 'Storb R', 'Maloney DG']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue N, D1-100, PO Box 19024, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*pathology', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2005/04/06 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/04/06 09:00'],"['2005/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.04.569 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.04.569 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun 1;23(16):3819-29. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.569.

These chimeric fusion oncoproteins, generated by reciprocal chromosomal translocations, are responsible for chromatin alterations on target genes whose expression is critical to stem cell development or lineage specification in haematopoiesis. Alterations in the 'histone code' or in the DNA methylation content occur as consequence of aberrant targeting of the corresponding enzymatic activities.

HIV-1 antagonizes their action through its vif gene product, which has been shown (at least in the case of APOBEC3G) to interact with the N-terminal domain of the deaminase, triggering its degradation. Here, we compare APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G to APOBEC3C, a single-domained deaminase that can also act on both HIV-1 and MLV. We find that whereas APOBEC3C contains all the information necessary for both Vif-binding and cytidine deaminase activity in a single domain, it is the C-terminal domain of APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G that confer their target site specificity for cytidine deamination. We have exploited the fact that APOBEC3C, whilst highly homologous to the C-terminal domain of APOBEC3F, exhibits a distinct target site specificity (preferring Y-C dinucleotides) in order to identify residues in APOBEC3F that might affect its target site specificity. We find that this specificity can be altered by single amino acid substitutions at several distinct positions, suggesting that the strong dependence of APOBEC3-mediated deoxycytidine deamination on the 5'-flanking nucleotide is sensitive to relatively subtle changes in the APOBEC3 structure. The approach has allowed the isolation of APOBEC3 DNA mutators that exhibit novel target site preferences.","['Langlois, Marc-Andre', 'Beale, Rupert C L', 'Conticello, Silvestro G', 'Neuberger, Michael S']","['Langlois MA', 'Beale RC', 'Conticello SG', 'Neuberger MS']","['Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (APOBEC3F protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3C protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Cytosine Deaminase/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/genetics', 'Nucleoside Deaminases', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Substrate Specificity']",2005/04/06 09:00,2005/04/26 09:00,['2005/04/06 09:00'],"['2005/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['33/6/1913 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gki343 [doi]']",epublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Apr 4;33(6):1913-23. doi: 10.1093/nar/gki343.

A possible model for the cooperation of myeloma cell growth factors.,57-64,"Primary myeloma cells rapidly apoptose as soon as they are removed from their bone-marrow environment. A likely explanation is that the tumor environment produces survival factors that may counteract a spontaneous activation of pro-apoptotic program. Additional factors may trigger cell cycling in surviving myeloma cells. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a well recognized myeloma cell growth factor produced mainly by the tumor environment. However, myeloma cells themselves may produce low levels of autocrine IL-6. The respective roles of paracrine versus autocrine IL-6 are a matter of debate. We investigated these roles using the XG-6 myeloma cell line whose growth is dependent on addition of exogenous IL-6, despite its weak IL-6 mRNA and protein expression. The apoptosis induced by exogenous IL-6 deprivation was blocked by transferring the Mcl-1 gene coding for an anti-apoptotic protein in XG-6 cells. An XG-6Mcl-1 cell line which can survive and grow without adding IL-6 was obtained. We show that anti-IL-6 or anti-gp130 antibodies abrogated cell cycling whereas they did not affect cell survival. These data indicate that the weak autocrine IL-6 produced by myeloma cells is sufficient to trigger cell cycling whereas their survival requires large exogenous IL-6 concentrations. This important role of autocrine IL-6 has to be considered when evaluating the mechanism of action of myeloma cell growth factors. These factors may actually block an activated pro-apoptotic program, making possible a weak production of autocrine IL-6 to promote cell cycling.","['Jourdan, Michel', 'Mahtouk, Karene', 'Veyrune, Jean-Luc', 'Couderc, Guilhem', 'Fiol, Genevieve', 'Redal, Nicole', 'Duperray, Christophe', 'De Vos, John', 'Klein, Bernard']","['Jourdan M', 'Mahtouk K', 'Veyrune JL', 'Couderc G', 'Fiol G', 'Redal N', 'Duperray C', 'De Vos J', 'Klein B']","['INSERM U475, 99 rue Puech Villa, 34197 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Autocrine Communication', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism']",2005/04/06 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/04/06 09:00'],"['2005/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 2005 Jan-Mar;16(1):57-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to compare the concentration of VEGF, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 in the serum of 83, never-treated B-CLL patients in different stage of disease according to Rai classification, and 20 healthy volunteers. Of all the cytokines only the serum concentration of VEGF was found to be significantly higher in the CLL group when compared to the control group (median 468.2 pg/mL and 246.9 pg/mL, respectively) (p = 0.01). In the group of CLL patients, the serum concentrations of VEGF and VEGFR-2 were significantly higher in patients in Rai stage III and IV (median 890.0 pg/mL and 4680.4 pg/mL respectively) than in patients in Rai stage 0-II (347.8 pg/mL and 2411.6 pg/mL respectively) (p<0.0001). In the entire group of CLL patients, we have found a strong, positive correlation between the serum level of VEGF and VEGFR-2 (p = 0.00001, R = 0.46).

We show here that PML(DeltaC-C)-RARalpha, which contains a deletion in its C-C domain, is neither localized as characteristic microspeckles nor modified by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO). The absence of sumoylation of the DeltaC-C mutant was due to the lack of binding to Ubc9, a SUMO conjugation enzyme. The integrity of RING finger domain was also needed for both sumoylation and microspeckle formation. In GAL4-DNA tethering assays, the DeltaC-C mutant completely lost the inhibitory effect on retinoic acid (RA)-mediated transactivation. Furthermore, the expression of CD14 in U937 cells expressing the DeltaC-C mutant in response to vitamin D3 was markedly higher than in cells expressing PML-RARalpha. However, the RA-mediated induction of C/EBPbeta in cells expressing the DeltaC-C mutant was comparable to that of control cells. Thus, our results suggest that the C-C domain-associated functions of sumoylation, localization as microspeckles, and the inhibition of monocyte differentiation all contribute to the oncogenic activity of PML-RARalpha.","['Kim, Young-Eui', 'Kim, Dong-Yeon', 'Lee, Jang-Mi', 'Kim, Seong-Tae', 'Han, Tae-Hee', 'Ahn, Jin-Hyun']","['Kim YE', 'Kim DY', 'Lee JM', 'Kim ST', 'Han TH', 'Ahn JH']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, Kyonggido 440-746, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism']",2005/04/06 09:00,2005/06/15 09:00,['2005/04/06 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(05)00548-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.03.052 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 May 13;330(3):746-54. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.03.052.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An endogenous path comprising a thiyl radical-catalyzed cis-trans isomerization of cis-unsaturated phospholipids was proposed. However, whether an isomerization process might be feasible in eukaryotic cells remained to be established. Here we report the presence of trans lipids in human monocytic leukemia cell membranes (THP-1) before and after treatment with a 10 mM series of thiols. Oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic acid residues of membrane phospholipids were analyzed and, unexpectedly, an initial trans lipid content was found in control cells. Then, incubation for 24 h with thiols under physiological conditions slightly increased trans lipid content. Formation of trans isomers was also evaluated in the presence of thiol and under free radical stress induced by gamma-irradiation or by thermal decomposition of azo-compounds. The similarity of isomer trends formed under incubation and stress conditions, together with the reactivity order of fatty acid residues (arachidonic > linoleic approximately oleic), indicated a common radical path and some mechanistic considerations are advanced. These results offer the first evidence that trans lipids are formed in eukaryotic cells and confirm that thiyl radicals are harmful to the integrity of cis lipid geometry. This work motivates further studies into the relationship between lipid isomerization outcome and thiyl radicals in cellular systems, as well as the formation of trans lipids and the metabolic response to such a perturbation introduced into biological membranes.","['Ferreri, Carla', 'Kratzsch, Susanne', 'Brede, Ortwin', 'Marciniak, Bronislaw', 'Chatgilialoglu, Chryssostomos']","['Ferreri C', 'Kratzsch S', 'Brede O', 'Marciniak B', 'Chatgilialoglu C']","['ISOF, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Via P.

Its cytotoxic action is dependent, at least in part, to its capacity to inhibit topoisomerase I. P388CPT5 murine leukemia cells resistant to the reference topoisomerase I poison camptothecin (CPT) are cross-resistant to LAM-D but the relative resistance index (RRI) is significantly reduced with LAM-D (RRI=21) compared to CPT (RRI=103). To comprehend further the mechanism of action of this novel marine antitumor agent, we have investigated the influence of the P glycoprotein (Pgp) on the cytotoxicity of LAM-D and the proapoptotic effects induced by the alkaloid. P388CPT5 cells, expressing a mutated top1 gene, display a functional Pgp, as judged from cytometry experiments performed with cells treated with rhodamine 123 or calcein-ester whereas no Pgp activity was detected with the parental P388 cells. P388CPT5 cells are also cross-resistant to the topoisomerase II poisons doxorubicin and etoposide but the resistance is abolished in the presence of verapamil or quinine (at non toxic concentrations) which reverse the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. In contrast, the RRI measured with LAM-D and CPT remain unchanged in the presence of the two MDR reversal agents. The effects of LAM-D on the cell cycle progression were different in the parental P388 cells compared with the CPT-resistant which were blocked in the S and subsequently G2-M phases of the cell cycle. Cytometry experiments with the JC-1 fluorescent marker revealed that LAM-D and CPT promoted apoptosis in parental P388 cells via an activation of the mitochondrial pathway. In contrast, a massive depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and a nuclear fragmentation were detected only with LAM-D on P388CPT5 cells. This in vitro work identifies LAM-D as a potent pro-apoptotic agent and its cytotoxic action is fully maintained in multidrug-resistant cells compared to the sensitive parental cell line.","['Vanhuyse, Marie', 'Kluza, Jerome', 'Tardy, Christele', 'Otero, Gabriel', 'Cuevas, Carmen', 'Bailly, Christian', 'Lansiaux, Amelie']","['Vanhuyse M', 'Kluza J', 'Tardy C', 'Otero G', 'Cuevas C', 'Bailly C', 'Lansiaux A']","['Centre Oscar Lambret and INSERM U-524, IRCL, Institute for Cancer Research, Place de Verdun, Lille cedex F-59045, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (lamellarin D)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Coumarins/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",2005/04/06 09:00,2005/06/01 09:00,['2005/04/06 09:00'],"['2004/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2004/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2004/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(04)00731-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2004.09.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2005 Apr 28;221(2):165-75. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2004.09.022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elutriated fractions were treated with sub-optimal cytotoxic concentrations of the pro-apoptotic, non-peptidic Bcl-2 pocket-binding agent HA14-1.

This work assesses the incidence of acute leukemias, between 1996 and 2000, in children from 0-14 years old who were attended at the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mexico City and in children from 0-11 years old in El Salvador. METHODS: DESIGN: Population-based data. Hospitals: In San Salvador, El Salvador, Hospital Nacional de Ninos ""Benjamin Bloom"", the only center in El Salvador which attends all children, younger than 12 years, with oncologic disease. The Pediatric Hospital and the General Hospital of the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mexico City, the only centers in Mexico City which attend all those children with acute leukemia who have a right to this service. DIAGNOSIS: All patients were diagnosed by bone marrow smear and were divided into acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and unspecified leukemias (UL). The annual incidence rate (AIR) and average annual incidence rate (AAIR) were calculated per million children. Cases were stratified by age and assigned to one of four age strata: 1) <1 year; 2) 1-4 years; 3) 5-9 years, or 4) 10-14 or 10-11 years, for Mexico City and El Salvador, respectively. RESULTS: The number of cases was 375 and 238 in El Salvador and Mexico City, respectively. AAIRs in Mexico City were 44.9, 10.6, 2.5, 0.5, and 58.4 per million children for ALL, AML, CML, UL, and total leukemias, respectively. The AAIRs in El Salvador could not be calculated because the fourth age stratum in El Salvador included children only from 0-11 years old. The incidence rates for the Salvadorian group of 0-11 year olds were 34.2, 7.1, 0.6, 0.2, and 43.2 per million children for ALL, AML, CML, UL, and total leukemias, respectively. CONCLUSION: Reported AIRs for each age group in El Salvador were similar to those from other American countries. The AAIR of ALL in Mexico City is one of the highest reported for North America.","['Mejia-Arangure, Juan Manuel', 'Bonilla, Miguel', 'Lorenzana, Rodolpho', 'Juarez-Ocana, Servando', 'de Reyes, Gladys', 'Perez-Saldivar, Maria Luisa', 'Gonzalez-Miranda, Guadalupe', 'Bernaldez-Rios, Roberto', 'Ortiz-Fernandez, Antonio', 'Ortega-Alvarez, Manuel', 'Martinez-Garcia, Maria del Carmen', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez, Arturo']","['Mejia-Arangure JM', 'Bonilla M', 'Lorenzana R', 'Juarez-Ocana S', 'de Reyes G', 'Perez-Saldivar ML', 'Gonzalez-Miranda G', 'Bernaldez-Rios R', 'Ortiz-Fernandez A', 'Ortega-Alvarez M', 'Martinez-Garcia Mdel C', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez A']","['Clinical Epidemiology, Pediatric Hospital, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Mexico City, Mexico. jmejiaa@cis.gob.mx']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'El Salvador', 'Hospital Records', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Mexico', 'Population', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Prevalence']",2005/04/06 09:00,2006/03/28 09:00,['2005/04/06 09:00'],"['2004/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-5-33 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-5-33 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2005 Apr 4;5:33. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-5-33.,20050404,PMC1090561,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Congenital abnormalities of the appendix are rare; the two most commonly reported are congenital absence and appendiceal duplication. Diverticular disease may be an incidental finding, but when inflamed, can be clinically confused with appendicitis. Endometriosis of the appendix, which usually occurs in the setting of generalized gastrointestinal endometriosis, often presents as acute appendicitis, but may present as intussusception, lower intestinal bleeding, and, particularly during pregnancy, perforation. Peritoneal endosalpingiosis often involves the appendiceal serosa and occasionally the wall but has no clinical manifestations in contrast to endometriosis. Vasculitis may be either isolated to the appendix or part of a systemic vasculitis, most often polyarteritis nodosa. Neural proliferations of the appendix include lesions associated with von Recklinghausen's disease, as well as mucosal and axial neuromas that are theorized to progress to fibrous obliteration of the appendix. Mesenchymal tumors of the appendix are most often of smooth muscle type, usually leiomyoma but rarely leiomyosarcoma; nonmyogenic neoplasms such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor, granular cell tumor, Kaposi's sarcoma, and miscellaneous other curiosities occur rarely. Lymphoma affects the appendix exceptionally; in children, Burkitt lymphoma is most common whereas in adults, large cell lymphomas and low grade B-cell lymphomas predominate. Secondary involvement of the appendix by leukemia has been reported. Secondary involvement of the appendix by carcinomas of the female genital tract, particularly ovary, and diverse other sites are in aggregate common but only rarely a clinical or pathological difficulty. Occasionally, however, appendiceal neoplasia that is secondary from another site may dominate the clinical picture and lead to potential pathologic misdiagnosis as primary appendiceal disease.","['Misdraji, Joseph', 'Graeme-Cook, Fiona M']","['Misdraji J', 'Graeme-Cook FM']","['James Homer Wright Pathology Laboratories, Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA. jmisdraji@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Diagn Pathol,Seminars in diagnostic pathology,8502262,,IM,"['Appendiceal Neoplasms/pathology', '*Appendix/abnormalities', 'Cecal Diseases/*pathology', 'Congenital Abnormalities/pathology', 'Humans']",2005/04/06 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/04/06 09:00'],"['2005/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0740-2570(04)00019-X [pii]', '10.1053/j.semdp.2004.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Diagn Pathol. 2004 May;21(2):151-63. doi: 10.1053/j.semdp.2004.11.006.,,,165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) gene is involved in the t(15;17) chromosomal translocation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). PML gene encodes a protein, which was shown to be concentrated in PML-nuclear bodies. Histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases, and chromatin-modifying proteins are accumulated in complexes with PML protein in these nuclear bodies giving the evidence of their role in transcription regulation. Physical interactions of PML protein with transcription factors, co-activators and co-repressors of transcription correspond with the role of PML in transcription regulation. PML plays an important role in apoptosis, proliferation and senescence of cells. PML gene is a tumour-suppressor gene and a product of its expression acts as a potent cell growth suppressor. All these activities of PML protein are ascribed to its nuclear functions. Cytoplasmic form of PML (cPML) is also very important and it is critical for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signalling. Cytoplasmic PML interacts with two TGF-beta receptors (TbetaBRI and TbetaRII) and acts as a bridging factor between protein called Smad anchor of receptor activation (SARA) and Smad proteins and it plays a role in the transport of whole complex into the early endosomes in TGF-beta signalling. The loss of functional cPML induces not only APL but it might influence behaviour of cancer cells and their resistance to TGF-beta.","['Fuchs, O', 'Provaznikova, D', 'Peslova, G']","['Fuchs O', 'Provaznikova D', 'Peslova G']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha. ota.fuchs@uhkt.cz']",['cze'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21- (ZFYVE16 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Smad Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2005/04/06 09:00,2005/05/04 09:00,['2005/04/06 09:00'],"['2005/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2005;144(2):90-4.,,,40,,Protein promyelocytarni leukemie a porucha signalni drahy transformacniho rustoveho faktoru-beta u akutni promyelocytarni leukemie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible children were treated without prophylactic G-CSF and presented with fever (temperature >38.3 degrees C) and neutropenia afterward. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome were excluded. Assignments were randomized between G-CSF (5 microg/kg/day) or none beginning within 24 hr of antibiotics. Subcutaneous administration was recommended, but intravenous G-CSF was allowed. Patients remained on study until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >500/microl and > or =48 hr without fever. RESULTS: One of 67 patients enrolled was ineligible, 59 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Thirty-four were assigned to antibiotics, 32 to G-CSF plus antibiotics. Adding G-CSF significantly reduced neutropenia and febrile neutropenia recovery times. Median days to febrile neutropenia resolution was nine earlier with G-CSF (4 vs. 13 days) (P < 0.0001). However, there was no difference in the resolution of fever between arms. Hospitalization median was shorter by 1 day with G-CSF (4 vs. 5 days) (P = 0.04). There was no difference in the duration of IV and oral antibiotic treatment, addition of antifungal therapy, and shock incidence. A trend for decreased incidence of late fever with G-CSF was noted (6.3 vs. 23.5%) (P = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Adding G-CSF to empiric antibiotic coverage accelerates chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia resolution by 9 days in pediatric patients, mainly with ALL, which results in a small but significant difference in the median length of hospitalization.","['Ozkaynak, M Fevzi', 'Krailo, Mark', 'Chen, Zhengjia', 'Feusner, James']","['Ozkaynak MF', 'Krailo M', 'Chen Z', 'Feusner J']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA. mehmet_ozcaynak@nymc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Time Factors']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/09/21 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20366 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Sep;45(3):274-80. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20366.,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Sep;45(3):242-3.

We evaluated the effects of chemotherapy on attentional function in survivors of ALL and examined whether possible deficits are related to treatment intensity. METHODS: In a multi-center study, we compared attentional function in 36 children at least 1 year after finishing treatment with chemotherapy only for ALL, with a cancer control group consisting of 39 Wilms tumor patients and with 110 healthy children. We differentiated between standard- and intensified ALL treatment. The role of previously reported risk factors for neuropsychological deficits was also assessed. RESULTS: After chemotherapy, attentional deficits were detected in patients with ALL, but not in Wilms tumor patients. Children treated according to standard ALL protocols performed worse than healthy controls on only 1 of 10 outcome measures (P = 0.004), while those who had received intensified treatment performed worse on four outcome measures (0.0001 < P < 0.004). Higher treatment intensity, young age at diagnosis, and female gender were associated with worse performance. CONCLUSIONS: CNS-directed chemotherapy, even in the absence of cranial irradiation, is associated with attentional dysfunction in survivors of childhood ALL, particularly in case of intensified treatment protocols. These sequelae stress the importance of reducing doses of neurotoxic chemotherapy as much as possible in the design of future treatment protocols for ALL.","['Buizer, Annemieke I', 'de Sonneville, Leo M J', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Veerman, Anjo J P']","['Buizer AI', 'de Sonneville LM', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, VU University Medical Center, PO Box 7057, 1007 MB Amsterdam, The Netherlands. ai.buizer@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Attention', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/09/21 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20397 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Sep;45(3):281-90. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20397.,,,,,,,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proliferations of human promyelotic leukemia HL-60 cells were inhibited as the concentrations of these flavonols were increased. The order of the extent of growth inhibition by the flavonols at a concentration of 20 microM is as follows: pentamethylquercetin > syringetin > isorhamnetin > quercetin > kaempherol > myricetin. Apoptotic morphological changes of the nucleus, including chromatin condensation were induced in the HL-60 cells treated with quercetin, kaempherol and myricetin, respectively, but not in the cells treated with the other flavonols. The fragmentations of DNA by quercetin, kaempherol and myricetin, respectively, to oligonucleosomal-sized fragments, a characteristic of apoptosis, were observed to be dose-dependent in the HL-60 cells. These findings suggest that growth inhibition by quercetin, kaempherol and myricetin, respectively, results from the induction of apoptosis by these flavonols. The other flavonols (pentamethylquercetin, syringetin and isorhamnetin) having methoxy (-OCH3) group inhibited more strongly than the above 3 flavonols without induction of apoptosis in the HL-60 cells. These findings suggest that mechanisms of growth inhibition by pentamethylquercetin, syringetin and isorhamnetin are different from the apoptosis caused by quercetin, kaempherol and myricetin.","['Hibasami, Hiroshige', 'Mitani, Akihiro', 'Katsuzaki, Hirotaka', 'Imai, Kunio', 'Yoshioka, Kazumi', 'Komiya, Takashi']","['Hibasami H', 'Mitani A', 'Katsuzaki H', 'Imai K', 'Yoshioka K', 'Komiya T']","['Faculty of Medicine, Mie University, Tsu-city, Mie 514-0001, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonols)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Flavonols/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hippophae/*chemistry', 'Humans']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/08/03 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2005 May;15(5):805-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strikingly, the nonrearranged ETV6 allele is often deleted or inactivated in cells harboring these translocations. Although ETV6 translocations are infrequent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mutations or deregulated expression of ETV6 may contribute to leukemogenesis. To investigate the involvement of ETV6 in AML, we analysed 300 newly diagnosed patients for mutations in the coding region of the gene. Furthermore, we studied protein expression in 77 patients using two ETV6-specific antibodies. Five somatic heterozygous mutations were detected, which affected either the homodimerization- or the DNA-binding domain of ETV6. The proteins translated from the cDNAs of these mutants were unable to repress transcription and showed dominant-negative effects. In addition, we demonstrate that one-third of AML patients have deficient ETV6 protein expression, which is not related to ETV6 mRNA expression levels. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ETV6 abnormalities are not restricted to translocations and occur more frequently in AML than previously thought. Additional comprehensive studies are required to define the clinical consequence of ETV6 loss of function in AML.","['Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn-Khosrovani, Sahar', 'Spensberger, Dominik', 'de Knegt, Yvonne', 'Tang, Michelle', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn-Khosrovani S', 'Spensberger D', 'de Knegt Y', 'Tang M', 'Lowenberg B', 'Delwel R']","['Department of Hematology, ErasmusMC, Dr Molewaterplein 50, Rotterdam 3015GE, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Frequency', '*Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/08/03 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208588 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208588 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Jun 9;24(25):4129-37. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208588.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined gene expression profiles of highly enriched CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from patients with CML in chronic phase using cDNA arrays covering 1.185 genes. Comparing CML CD34(+) cells with normal CD34(+) cells, we found 158 genes which were significantly differentially expressed. Gene expression patterns reflected BCR-ABL-induced functional alterations such as increased cell-cycle and proteasome activity. Detoxification enzymes and DNA repair proteins were downregulated in CML CD34(+) cells, which might contribute to genetic instability. Decreased expression of junction plakoglobulin and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR-4) might facilitate the release of immature precursors from bone marrow in CML. GATA-2 was upregulated in CML CD34(+) cells, suggesting an increased self-renewal in comparison with normal CD34(+) cells. Moreover, we found upregulation of the proto-oncogene SKI and of receptors for neuromediators such as opioid mu1 receptor, GABA B receptor, adenosine A1 receptor, orexin 1 and 2 receptors and corticotropine-releasing hormone receptor. Treatment of CML progenitor cells with the selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) resulted in a dose-dependent significant inhibition of clonogenic growth by 40% at a concentration of 10(-5) M, which could be reversed by the equimolar addition of the receptor agonist 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (P<0.05). The incubation of normal progenitor cells with DPCPX resulted in an inhibition of clonogenic growth to a significantly lesser extent in comparison with CML cells (P<0.05), suggesting that the adenosine A1 receptor is of functional relevance in CML hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Kronenwett, Ralf', 'Butterweck, Ulf', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Kliszewski, Slawomir', 'Neumann, Frank', 'Bork, Simone', 'Blanco, Elena Diaz', 'Roes, Nicole', 'Graf, Thorsten', 'Brors, Benedikt', 'Eils, Roland', 'Maercker, Christian', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Haas, Rainer']","['Kronenwett R', 'Butterweck U', 'Steidl U', 'Kliszewski S', 'Neumann F', 'Bork S', 'Blanco ED', 'Roes N', 'Graf T', 'Brors B', 'Eils R', 'Maercker C', 'Kobbe G', 'Gattermann N', 'Haas R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Moorenstr. 5, 40225 Duesseldorf, Germany. kronenwett@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208596 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208596 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Aug 11;24(34):5313-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208596.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DLK1 encodes an EGF-like homeotic transmembrane protein homologous to the notch/delta/serrate family.

We show that ectopically expressed DLK1 significantly inhibits differentiation and proliferation of human promyelocytic HL-60 cells. Unlike preadipocytes, where proteolytic processing of membrane-bound protein and release of a soluble form mediates differentiation inhibition, proteolytic release of the extracellular domain was not required for inhibition of hematopoietic cell differentiation. However, intracellular domain interactions were critical to this DLK1 function. We conclude that DLK1 overexpression in hematopoietic cells has important functional consequences. Our studies identify novel molecular mechanisms and indicate that DLK1 has activity both as a soluble and a transmembrane expressed protein. Our results support further investigation of the role of DLK1 in abnormal hematopoiesis in MDS.","['Li, Liang', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Li L', 'Forman SJ', 'Bhatia R']","['Division of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 E Duarte Road, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['0 (Glycoproteins)'],IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mutation/genetics']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/07/16 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208637 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208637 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Jun 23;24(27):4472-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208637.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined transcription factor occupancy and aspects of chromatin structure of the critical c-FMS regulatory element located within the second intron (FIRE - fms intonic regulatory element) during normal and leukaemic myelopoiesis. Granulocytic differentiation from normal and leukaemic precursors is accompanied by loss of transcription factors at FIRE and downregulated c-FMS expression.

In nonleukaemic cells, granulocytic differentiation is accompanied by reversal to a chromatin fine structure characteristic of c-FMS-nonexpressing cells.

Between July 1995 and August 1996, 15 patients, five males and 10 females, median age 50 (range 20-57) years, were enrolled in a protocol that consisted of different doses of cyclophosphamide (Cy), 50 mg/kg/day for 1, 2, 3 or 4 consecutive days in parallel with a fixed dose of rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (Fresenius) 10 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days. All patients, except one treated with a single dose of Cy, achieved full tri-lineage engraftment and no late graft failure was observed. Only three patients suffered from grade III-IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Three patients out of the 15 survived long term (follow-up >93 to >96 months). We concluded that lymphoablative conditioning with ATG and intermediate-to-high-dose Cy is well tolerated and can result in durable engraftment with acceptable GVHD in heavily pretreated patients with advanced malignancies. Hence, induction of tolerance to donor alloantigens by lymphoablative conditioning while avoiding myeloablative chemotherapy or radiation therapy may serve as a platform for subsequent cell therapy with donor lymphocytes.","['Bitan, M', 'Or, R', 'Shapira, M Y', 'Ackerstein, A', 'Samuel, S', 'Slavin, S']","['Bitan M', 'Or R', 'Shapira MY', 'Ackerstein A', 'Samuel S', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah University Hospital, Hebrew University - Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/07/22 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1704936 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1704936 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2005 May;35(10):953-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704936.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In multivariate analysis, the following factors were found to be associated with worse survival: (1) increased percentage of blasts in the bone marrow at the time of SCT, (2) presence of acute graft-versus-host disease, (3) mismatched donor, (4) Zubrod performance score of >/=2, and (5) age >/=45 years. We also found a trend towards improved outcome among patients in cytogenetic remission as compared to those who had residual cytogenetic abnormalities and those in overt relapse.

All patients received CAMPATH-1M 5-20 mg daily for 5 days. Grafts were T-cell depleted in 30 patients, 29 by CAMPATH antibodies and one by CD34 selection. Median follow-up was 3.8 years (0.3-9.3). Event-free survival (EFS) at 3 years was 35% (SE 8%); relapse rate and transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 3 years was 42 and 23%. Short first complete remission (CR1) <2.5 years was associated with lower EFS (P=0.001), higher TRM (P=0.019) and higher relapse rate (P=0.023). Short second complete remission (CR2) <2.5 years was associated with lower EFS (P=0.003) and higher TRM (0.009). Higher relapse rate and lower EFS were associated with isolated first extramedullary relapse (P=0.019, 0.012). There was no significant difference in outcome between mismatched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation (MMUD-SCT) and matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation (UD-SCT). We conclude that UD-SCT is an effective treatment of ALL in CR3. The outcome remains limited by TRM and a high relapse rate. Short duration of CR1 and of CR2 and extramedullary site at first relapse are particularly adverse. MMUD should also be considered in high-risk patients, since the outcome of MMUD appears similar to MUD.","['Afify, Z', 'Hunt, L', 'Green, A', 'Guttridge, M', 'Cornish, J', 'Oakhill, A']","['Afify Z', 'Hunt L', 'Green A', 'Guttridge M', 'Cornish J', 'Oakhill A']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Hematology Oncology Division, University of Utah, Primary Children's Medical Center, 100 N.

This study reports a retrospective analysis of 247 allogeneic HSCT recipients receiving anti-viral prophylaxis with low-dose oral aciclovir 400 mg/day, administered until immunosuppression was discontinued and the CD4(+) cell count exceeded 200/mm(3). Viral reactivation was successfully suppressed by aciclovir prophylaxis, with only one case of breakthrough infection. The cumulative incidence of zoster infection at 1 year post transplant was 2% and at 5 years 34%. In all, 64 patients discontinued prophylaxis. Zoster developed in 26 of these, giving a cumulative incidence of infection at 1 year after stopping aciclovir of 39% and at 3 years 44%. Infection occurred in a localised dermatomal distribution in 93% of cases. This supports previous findings that aciclovir prophylaxis prevents early VZV reactivation, although the long-term incidence is not affected as infection occurs once prophylaxis is discontinued. Such infection, however, is mild and localised. This study does not support the idea that use of such low-dose aciclovir regimens reduces the zoster incidence by permitting subclinical reactivation during prophylaxis, and therefore the re-establishment of protective anti-viral immunity.","['Thomson, K J', 'Hart, D P', 'Banerjee, L', 'Ward, K N', 'Peggs, K S', 'Mackinnon, S']","['Thomson KJ', 'Hart DP', 'Banerjee L', 'Ward KN', 'Peggs KS', 'Mackinnon S']","['Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals, 98 Chenies Mews, London WC1E 6HX, UK. kirsty.thomson@uclh.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)']",IM,"['Acyclovir/*therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Chickenpox/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Cohort Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Herpes Zoster/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/08/20 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1704959 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1704959 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2005 Jun;35(11):1065-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704959.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that IL-4, which activates Stat6 in normal human astrocytes and in a variety of other cells, induces an aberrant activation of Stat3 in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells but not in normal human astrocytes. Previously, we have shown that autocrine IL-6 signaling induces a persistent activation of Stat3. Now, we show that Stat3 is further activated by IL-4 stimulation of GBM cells. Expression of IL-13Ralpha2, a decoy receptor for IL-13 that partly blocks IL-4-mediated activation of Stat6 in GBM cells, up-regulates the activation of Stat3 as shown by a small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of IL-13Ralpha2 expression. In addition, transient expression of the IL-13Ralpha2 transgene in 293T cells increases the IL-4-mediated activation of Stat3 and subsequent expression of Stat3-targeted gene. Coimmunoprecipitation results reveal that IL-13Ralpha2-mediated activation of Stat3 does not require a direct physical interaction between Stat3 and IL-13Ralpha2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay employing anti-Stat3 antibody confirms the in vivo binding of activated Stat3 to the promoters of genes that encode antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Mcl-1. IL-4 significantly up-regulates of the steady-state levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Mcl-1 in GBM cells. These results indicate that IL-4/IL-13 receptor-mediated Stat3 signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of GBM cells by modulating the expression of the Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins.","['Rahaman, Shaik Ohidar', 'Vogelbaum, Michael A', 'Haque, S Jaharul']","['Rahaman SO', 'Vogelbaum MA', 'Haque SJ']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL13RA1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-13 Receptor alpha1 Subunit)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-13)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Astrocytes/cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glioblastoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-13 Receptor alpha1 Subunit', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-13', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-X Protein']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/7/2956 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3592 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 1;65(7):2956-63. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3592.,,,,"['R01-CA095006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM60533/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we showed that activated peripheral NK cells killed high-level BCR/ABL transfectant UT-7/9 derived from the pluripotent hematopoietic cell line UT-7 with a high efficiency. To further define the mechanisms controlling BCR/ABL target susceptibility to NK-mediated lysis, we studied the effect of IFNgamma, a key cytokine secreted by activated NK cells, on the lysis of these targets. Treatment of UT-7, UT-7/neo, and low BCR/ABL transfectant UT-7/E8 cells with IFNgamma resulted in a dramatic induction of human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules and subsequently in their reduced susceptibility to NK-mediated cytolysis likely as a consequence of inhibitory NK receptors engagement. In contrast, such treatment neither affected HLA-I expression on transfectants expressing high level of BCR/ABL (UT-7/9) nor modulated their lysis by NK cells. Our data further show that the high-level BCR/ABL in UT-7/9 cells display an altered IFNgamma signaling, as evidenced by a decrease in IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 induction and activation in response to IFNgamma, whereas this pathway is normal in UT-7 and UT-7/E8 cells. A decreased HLA-I induction and nuclear phospho-STAT1 nuclear translocation were also observed in blasts from most chronic myelogenous leukemia patients in response to IFNgamma. These results outline the crucial role of IFNgamma in the control of target cell susceptibility to lysis by activated NK cells and indicate that the altered response to IFNgamma in BCR/ABL targets may preserve these cells from the cytokine-induced negative regulatory effect on their susceptibility to NK-mediated lysis.","['Cebo, Christelle', 'Voutsadakis, Ioannis A', 'Da Rocha, Sylvie', 'Bourhis, Jean-Henri', 'Jalil, Abdelali', 'Azzarone, Bruno', 'Turhan, Ali G', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira', 'Chouaib, Salem', 'Caignard, Anne']","['Cebo C', 'Voutsadakis IA', 'Da Rocha S', 'Bourhis JH', 'Jalil A', 'Azzarone B', 'Turhan AG', 'Chelbi-Alix M', 'Chouaib S', 'Caignard A']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U487, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/7/2914 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1932 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 1;65(7):2914-20. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1932.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIM #34 inhibited AML cell growth via the induction of apoptosis and abrogated clonogenic growth of primary AML samples. Exposure to DIM #34 induced loss of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and caspase activation. Bcl-2-overexpressing, Bax knockout, and caspase-9-deficient cells were partially resistant to cell death, suggesting the involvement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, DIM #34 transiently inhibited the phosphorylation and activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and abrogated Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Because other methylene-substituted diindolylmethane analogues have been shown to transactivate the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), we studied the role of PPARgamma in apoptosis induction. Cotreatment of cells with a selective PPARgamma antagonist or with retinoid X receptor and retinoic acid receptor ligands partially modulated apoptosis when combined with DIM #34, suggesting PPARgamma receptor-dependent and receptor-independent cell death.

Most use telomerase, but 5% to 20% of tumors use alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), a telomerase-independent mechanism that seems to depend on recombination. ALT is characterized by amplification of telomere TTAGGG repeats to lengths beyond 50 kb, by elevated rates of telomere recombination, and by nuclear structures called ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, survivors of telomerase inactivation also use recombination to maintain telomeres. There are two types of survivors, which differ in telomere structure. The first possesses telomere repeats and the Y' subtelomeric element amplified together as a tandem array at chromosome termini (type I), and the other possesses amplification of telomeric repeats alone (type II), similar to previously described human ALT cells. Here, we describe the first human ALT cell line having ""tandem array"" telomeres with a structure similar to that of type I yeast survivors. The chromosome termini consist of a repeat unit containing approximately 2.5 kb of SV40 DNA and a variable amount of TTAGGG sequence repeated in tandem an average of 10 to 20 times. Similar to previously described ALT cells, they show evidence of telomere recombination, but unlike standard ALT cells, they lack ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies and their telomeres are transcribed.

Here we describe telomerase-negative human cells with telomeres that contain a substantial proportion of nontelomeric DNA sequences (like telomerase-null Saccharomyces cerevisiae survivor type I cells) and that are maintained in the absence of APBs. In other respects, they resemble typical ALT cell lines: the telomeres are highly heterogeneous in length (ranging from very short to very long) and undergo rapid changes in length.

We report here that the migratory response to SDF-1 was profoundly altered in blast crisis, whereas chronic-phase CD34(+) cells migrated normally to this chemokine. This migratory defect was associated with a low CXCR4 membrane expression. In vitro STI-571 treatment of CD34(+) cells from patients in blast crisis markedly increased the CXCR4 transcript and CXCR4 membrane expression. Because p210(BCR-ABL) frequently increases with disease progression, we determined the effects of high and low p210(BCR-ABL) expression on CXCR4 protein in the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-dependent human cell line MO7e. p210(BCR-ABL) expression distinctly alters CXCR4 protein through two different mechanisms depending on its expression level. At low expression, a signaling defect was detected with no modification of CXCR4 expression. However, higher p210(BCR-ABL) expression induced a marked down-regulation of CXCR4 that is related to its decreased transcription. The effect of p210(BCR-ABL) required its tyrosine kinase activity. Collectively, these data indicate that p210(BCR-ABL) could affect CXCR4 by more than one mechanism and suggest that down-regulation of CXCR4 may have important implications in chronic myelogenous leukemia pathogenesis.","['Geay, Jean-Francois', 'Buet, Dorothee', 'Zhang, Yanyan', 'Foudi, Adlen', 'Jarrier, Peggy', 'Berthebaud, Magali', 'Turhan, Ali G', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Louache, Fawzia']","['Geay JF', 'Buet D', 'Zhang Y', 'Foudi A', 'Jarrier P', 'Berthebaud M', 'Turhan AG', 'Vainchenker W', 'Louache F']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/7/2676 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2152 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 1;65(7):2676-83. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2152.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial fluorescence in situ hybridization studies of one patient indicated that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) at 9p24 was disrupted. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR identified the 8p22 partner gene as human autoantigen pericentriolar material (PCM1), a gene encoding a large centrosomal protein with multiple coiled-coil domains. Reverse transcription-PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the fusion in this case and also identified PCM1-JAK2 in the six other t(8;9) patients. The breakpoints were variable in both genes, but in all cases the chimeric mRNA is predicted to encode a protein that retains several of the predicted coiled-coil domains from PCM1 and the entire tyrosine kinase domain of JAK2. Reciprocal JAK2-PCM1 mRNA was not detected in any patient. We conclude that human autoantigen pericentriolar material (PCM1)-JAK2 is a novel, recurrent fusion gene in hematologic malignancies.

Mice heterozygous for a mismatch repair-null mutation generally do not have an increased risk of neoplasia. However, mice constitutively lacking mismatch repair are prone to tumor development from an early age, particularly thymic lymphomas. Mismatch repair-deficient mice crossed to Apc(+/-) mice develop an increased spontaneous intestinal tumor incidence, demonstrating that the tumor spectrum can be genetically influenced. Here, we bred Msh2- and Msh6-deficient mice to athymic nude mice, hypothesizing that a broader tumor spectrum may be observed if mice are able to survive longer without succumbing to thymic lymphomas. However, Msh2(-/-);Foxn1(nu/nu) and Msh6(-/-);Foxn1(nu/nu) mice developed primarily early-onset lymphoblastic lymphomas. Using B-cell-specific markers, we found these tumors to be predominately B-cell in origin. The development of hematologic malignancy in the mouse, even in the absence of a thymus, parallels the development of B- and T-cell lymphoma and leukemia in the few rare mismatch repair-null human patients that have been identified. The persistent development of hematologic malignancy both in the mouse and in human patients deficient in mismatch repair leads us to implicate mismatch repair as an important repair mechanism in normal B- and T-cell development. Thus, mismatch repair-deficient mice may prove to be a good model to study human hematologic malignancy.","['Campbell, Marcia R', 'Nation, Patrick N', 'Andrew, Susan E']","['Campbell MR', 'Nation PN', 'Andrew SE']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Msh6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Whn protein)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (Msh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Colon/pathology', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*deficiency/genetics', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microsatellite Repeats/genetics', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*deficiency/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/7/2626 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3158 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 1;65(7):2626-35. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3158.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported favorable effects of the potent histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid in combination with all-trans retinoic acid in patients with advanced acute myeloid leukemia leading to blast cell reduction and improvement of hemoglobin. These effects were accompanied by hypergranulocytosis most likely due to an enhancement of nonleukemic myelopoiesis and the suppression of malignant hematopoiesis rather than enforced differentiation of the leukemic cells. These data prompted us to investigate the effect of valproic acid on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Here we show that valproic acid increases both proliferation and self-renewal of HSC. It accelerates cell cycle progression of HSC accompanied by a down-regulation of p21(cip-1/waf-1). Furthermore, valproic acid inhibits GSK3beta by phosphorylation on Ser9 accompanied by an activation of the Wnt signaling pathway as well as by an up-regulation of HoxB4, a target gene of Wnt signaling. Both are known to directly stimulate the proliferation of HSC and to expand the HSC pool. In summary, we here show that valproic acid, known to induce differentiation or apoptosis in leukemic blasts, stimulates the proliferation of normal HSC, an effect with a potential effect on its future role in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Bug, Gesine', 'Gul, Hilal', 'Schwarz, Kerstin', 'Pfeifer, Heike', 'Kampfmann, Manuela', 'Zheng, Xiaomin', 'Beissert, Tim', 'Boehrer, Simone', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Ottmann, Oliver Gerhard', 'Ruthardt, Martin']","['Bug G', 'Gul H', 'Schwarz K', 'Pfeifer H', 'Kampfmann M', 'Zheng X', 'Beissert T', 'Boehrer S', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ottmann OG', 'Ruthardt M']","['Medizinische Klinik II/Abteilung Hamatologie, Klinikum der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/7/2537 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3011 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 1;65(7):2537-41. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The product of the Bloom syndrome mutated gene, designated BLM, is a member of the RecQ helicase family. BLM has been proposed to function at the interface of replication and recombination, and to facilitate the repair of DNA damage. Here, we report in vivo physical interaction and colocalization of BLM and a DNA structure-specific endonuclease, Mus81, at sites of stalled replication forks outside the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies during the S-phase arrest of the cell cycle. Amino acids 125 to 244 of Mus81 interact with the C-terminal region (amino acids 1,007-1,417) of BLM. Whereas Mus81 does not have any effect on the helicase activity of BLM, BLM can stimulate Mus81 endonuclease activity on the nicked Holliday junctions and 3' flap. This stimulation is due to enhanced binding of Mus81 to the DNA substrates. These data suggest a new function of BLM in cooperating with Mus81 during processing and restoration of stalled replication forks.","['Zhang, Ran', 'Sengupta, Sagar', 'Yang, Qin', 'Linke, Steven P', 'Yanaihara, Nozomu', 'Bradsher, John', 'Blais, Veronique', 'McGowan, Clare H', 'Harris, Curtis C']","['Zhang R', 'Sengupta S', 'Yang Q', 'Linke SP', 'Yanaihara N', 'Bradsher J', 'Blais V', 'McGowan CH', 'Harris CC']","['Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (MUS81 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Bloom syndrome protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Replication/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endonucleases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Peptide Mapping', 'RecQ Helicases', 'Transfection']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/05/27 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/7/2526 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2421 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Apr 1;65(7):2526-31. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2421.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 1956 to 1998, 429 children with a malignant solid tumor were treated at a single radiation oncology facility. The medical records and radiotherapy charts were reviewed to determine if the patient developed a secondary neoplasm after treatment for malignancy. Twenty-three (5.4%) patients developed a secondary neoplasm. There were 12 males and 11 females with a median age at RT of 6.6 years (range, 2 months to 20 years). There were 14 malignant neoplasms in 13 (3.0%) and 14 benign neoplasms in 11 patients (2.6%). The types of initial solid tumors treated with RT were Ewing sarcoma in 6, Wilms tumor in 6, medulloblastoma in 5, neuroblastoma in 3, and other in 3. Median RT dose was 45 Gy (range, 12.3 to 60 Gy) using 4 MV in 9, 1.25 MV in 8, 250 KV in 4, and 6 MV photons in 1 patient. One child was treated using 15-MeV electrons. Fourteen had chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 23.2 years (range, 5.3 to 44.4 years). For the 14 malignant neoplasms, the median time interval from initial tumor to second malignancy was 10.1 years. The 14 second malignant neoplasms (SMN) were osteosarcoma in 3, breast carcinoma in 2, melanoma in 2, malignant fibrous histiocytoma in 1, dermatofibrosarcoma in 1, leiomyosarcoma in 1, mucoepidermoid carcinoma in 1, colon cancer in 1, chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1, and basal cell carcinoma in 1. Ten of the 14 SMN (71%) were at the edge or inside the RT field. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rate after diagnosis of an SMN was 69.2%; it was 70% for children with a SMN at the edge or inside the RT field and 66.7% for those outside of the RT field. The 14 benign neoplasms appeared at a median time of 16.9 years and included cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in 3, osteochondroma in 3, thyroid adenoma in 1, duodenal adenoma in 1, lipoma in 1, cherry angioma in 1, uterine leiomyoma in 1, ovarian cystadenofibroma in 1, and giant cell tumor in 1. Only 5 (36%) of the 14 benign tumors occurred in the RT field, with osteochondroma being the most common. Of 189 deaths occurring in 429 patients, only 3 (1.6%) were secondary to radiation-induced malignancy. Not all SMN in children receiving RT occur in the irradiated field.

All electrical currents, including those running through power lines, generate electric and magnetic fields (EMFs). Electrical power lines, towers,and distribution poles are used by birds for perching, hunting, and nesting. Therefore, many bird species, like humans, are exposed to EMFs throughout their lives. EMFs have been implicated in adversely affecting multiple facets of human health,including increasing the risks of life-threatening illnesses such as leukemia, brain cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, clinical depression, suicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A great deal of research and controversy exists as to whether or not exposure to EMFs affects the cellular, endocrine, immune, and reproductive systems of vertebrates. Laboratory work has used mice, rats, and chickens as models for this EMF research in an effort to understand better the possible implications of EMF exposure for humans. However, EMF exposure of wild birds may also provide insight into the impacts of EMFs on human health. This review focuses on research examining the effects of EMFs on birds; most studies indicate that EMF exposure of birds generally changes, but not always consistently in effect or in direction, their behavior, reproductive success, growth and development, physiology and endocrinology, and oxidative stress under EMF conditions. Some of this work has involved birds under aviary conditions, while other research has focused on free-ranging birds exposed to EMFs. Finally, a number of future research directions are discussed that may help to provide a better understanding of EMF effects on vertebrate health and conservation.","['Fernie, Kim J', 'Reynolds, S James']","['Fernie KJ', 'Reynolds SJ']","['Canadian Wildlife Service, Environment Canada, Burlington, Ontario, Canada. kim.fernie.ec.gc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev,"Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

METHODS: This study involved a retrospective cohort analysis using linked data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute (SEER) and Medicare claims data. Study cohorts included patients aged 65 years and older who newly received a diagnosis of a selected cancer (acute myeloid leukemia [AML] or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [SCCHN]) in a SEER registry between 1991 and 1996 and who had a subsequent diagnosis of a serious fungal infection during an inpatient hospitalization, and hospitalized controls without a fungal infection matched 1:1 by age, geographic region, receipt of recent chemotherapy, concomitant bacterial infection, timing of the index hospitalization, and cancer stage at diagnosis (for SCCHN patients only). RESULTS: Eighty AML patients and 52 SCCHN patients experienced a serious fungal infection involving hospitalization. Relative to matched controls, SCCHN patients with fungal infections had significantly higher all-cause mortality (40% vs. 14%, P = 0.002), while mortality rates did not differ between AML cohorts. Patients with fungal infections had significantly longer index hospitalizations regardless of cancer type (mean: 30 days vs. 19 days for AML patients; 20 days vs. 9 days for SCCHN patients), and correspondingly higher Medicare payments (mean +/- SD: 34,268 dollars +/- 31,811 dollars vs. 21,416 dollars +/- 22,449 dollars among AML patients, P < 0.0001; 25,942 dollars +/- 29,122 dollars vs. 10,131 dollars +/- 10,686 dollars among SCCHN patients, P < 0.0001).

Our objectives were to combine distribution-based and two anchor-based approaches to identify minimally important differences (MIDs) for the 27-item Trial Outcome Index (TOI), the seven-item Social Well-Being (SWB) subscale, and the six-item Emotional Well-being (EWB) subscale from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Biological Response Modifiers (FACT-BRM) instrument. METHODS: Distribution-based MIDs were based on the standard error of measurement. Anchor-based approaches utilized patient-reported global rating of change (GRC) and change in physician-reported performance status rating (PSR). Correlations and weighted kappa statistics were used to assess association and agreement between the two anchors. FACT-BRM changes were evaluated for three time periods: baseline to month 1, month 2 to month 3, and month 5 to month 6. RESULTS: Association between GRC and change in PSR was poor. Correlation between the anchors and HRQL change scores was largest at month 1 and decreased through month 6. Combining results from all approaches, the MIDs identified were 5-8 points for the TOI, 2 points for the SWB subscale, and 2-3 points for the EWB subscale. CONCLUSIONS: We combined patient-reported estimates, physician-reported estimates, and distribution-based estimates to derive MIDs for HRQL outcomes from the FACT-BRM. These results will enable interpretation of treatment group effects in a clinical trial setting, and they can be used to estimate sample size or power when designing future studies.","['Yost, Kathleen J', 'Sorensen, Mark V', 'Hahn, Elizabeth A', 'Glendenning, G Alastair', 'Gnanasakthy, Ari', 'Cella, David']","['Yost KJ', 'Sorensen MV', 'Hahn EA', 'Glendenning GA', 'Gnanasakthy A', 'Cella D']","['Center on Outcomes, Research and Education (CORE), Evanston, IL 60201, USA. kyost@enh.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Value Health,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,100883818,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Psychometrics/*instrumentation', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', '*Quality of Life', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*Sickness Impact Profile', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2005/04/05 09:00,2005/05/26 09:00,['2005/04/05 09:00'],"['2005/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1098-3015(10)60254-9 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1524-4733.2005.08202.x [doi]']",ppublish,Value Health. 2005 Mar-Apr;8(2):117-27. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2005.08202.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL is generally described as a disease of failed apoptosis. Apoptosis resistance may stem from a combination of microenvironmental survival signals as well as from intrinsic alterations in the apoptotic machinery within the CLL cell. The molecular mechanism involved in controlling apoptosis in CLL is complex and is influenced by many factors, including Bcl-2 family proteins, which are critical regulators of cell death. Here we review the significance of apoptosis dysregulation in CLL, focusing on the role of Bcl-2 and related Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bax and Mcl-1. The differential properties of the newly described subsets of CLL are also highlighted.","['Packham, Graham', 'Stevenson, Freda K']","['Packham G', 'Stevenson FK']","['Cancer Research UK Oncology Unit, University of Southampton School of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK.

In addition to inhibition of DNA polymerases and DNA synthesis, clofarabine acts as a strong inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RnR), an enzyme involved in regulating intracellular deoxynucleotide pools, and has a high affinity to the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (dCyd), the rate-limiting step in nucleoside phosphorylation.A review of the English literature was performed that included original articles and related reviews from the MEDLINE (PubMed) data base and from abstracts based on the publication of meeting materials. Although it was synthesized early in the 1980s, the development of clofarabine was stalled until 1993, when, through efforts at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, animal toxicology studies were conducted, and the first Phase I study was initiated in patients with hematologic and solid malignancies. Since then, clofarabine has demonstrated single-agent antitumor activity in pediatric and adult acute leukemias. By way of its unique metabolic properties, clofarabine also has lent itself to biochemical modulation strategies with other nucleoside analogs, such as cytarabine. Combinations of clofarabine with cytarabine have been studied in acute leukemia and currently are being evaluated in untreated elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Novel schedules are being explored in lymphoproliferative disorders and solid tumors. Clofarabine is a new nucleoside analog with considerable activity and an acceptable safety profile in acute leukemias.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Plunkett, William', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Faderl S', 'Gandhi V', 'Keating MJ', 'Jeha S', 'Plunkett W', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Reactivation of genes silenced by methylation using inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases, and the potential application of PTPRO as a molecular target for cancer therapy have been discussed.","['Jacob, Samson T', 'Motiwala, Tasneem']","['Jacob ST', 'Motiwala T']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, College of Medicine, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. jacob.42@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRU protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2)']",IM,"['DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Silencing', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*therapy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2']",2005/04/02 09:00,2005/09/21 09:00,['2005/04/02 09:00'],"['2005/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['7700828 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cgt.7700828 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2005 Aug;12(8):665-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700828.,,PMC3028596,70,"['R01 CA086978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086978-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 10874/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081024-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 86978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES010874/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081024/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 81024/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS264715'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the cardiac safety of granisetron and ondansetron has been investigated in several adult studies, there is no report investigating the effects of those agents on electrocardiography (ECG) in children. The effects of intravenously infused (over 30 seconds) 0.1 mg/kg ondansetron and 40 microg/kg granisetron on ECG were assessed in 22 children receiving high-dose methotrexate therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The ECG recording was obtained at before and just after the infusion, and repeated at 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours of treatment. Granisetron administration resulted in a statistically significant decrease of mean heart rate at 1 and 3 hours, and significant prolongation of mean QT and QTc dispersions at 1 hour of infusion. In patients treated with ondansetron, no meaningful change was observed. In conclusion, intravenous granisetron but not ondansetron causes clinically asymptomatic and transient changes on ECG measurements in children receiving high-dose methotrexate therapy.","['Buyukavci, Mustafa', 'Olgun, Hasim', 'Ceviz, Naci']","['Buyukavci M', 'Olgun H', 'Ceviz N']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Ataturk University, Faculty of Medicine, Erzurum, Turkey. mbavci@atauni.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,"['0 (Antiemetics)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Serotonin Antagonists)', '4AF302ESOS (Ondansetron)', 'WZG3J2MCOL (Granisetron)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antiemetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Granisetron/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Heart Rate/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Nausea/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Ondansetron/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Serotonin Antagonists/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vomiting/chemically induced/prevention & control']",2005/04/02 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/04/02 09:00'],"['2005/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['00000421-200504000-00018 [pii]', '10.1097/01.coc.0000144849.41300.0a [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Apr;28(2):201-4. doi: 10.1097/01.coc.0000144849.41300.0a.,,,,,,,,,,['Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Dec;28(6):634-5.

In 23 of the 46 patients, all the coding regions of TRAIL-R2 were also examined. However, no mutation or loss of heterozygosity was found. Furthermore, no mutation in the death domains of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 genes, which causes amino acid change, was found in 18 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction using polymorphonuclear neutrophils of five new CML patients showed that the TRAIL mRNA expression was very low before in vitro IFN-alpha stimulation and markedly upregulated after IFN-alpha stimulation. FAS mRNA was also upregulated with IFN-alpha stimulation but the fold induction was far lower than that of TRAIL mRNA. In addition, RPA revealed that the ratio of (TRAIL-R1 plus TRAIL-R2) to TRAIL-R3 was also increased after IFN-alpha stimulation. Taken together, gene mutations of TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2 are infrequent in patients with CML and MDS. And so is the TRAIL promoter for CML. These mutations seem unrelated to tumorigenesis, disease progression, and response to IFN-alpha therapy in CML. A markedly high induction of TRAIL mRNA by IFN-alpha may have some relevance to IFN-alpha action in CML patients.","['Liu, Li-Gen', 'Tanaka, Hideo', 'Ito, Kinro', 'Ito, Takuo', 'Sultana, Tanvira A', 'Kyo, Taiichi', 'Kimura, Akiro']","['Liu LG', 'Tanaka H', 'Ito K', 'Ito T', 'Sultana TA', 'Kyo T', 'Kimura A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Kasumi, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Open Reading Frames/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",2005/04/02 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2005/04/02 09:00'],"['2004/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['83449 [pii]', '10.1159/000083449 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2005;113(2):113-23. doi: 10.1159/000083449.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2005 S.

In the present study, we investigated the involvement of caspase-3 in Py (1 microM)/Zn (25 microM)-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Pro-caspase-3 is an inactive form of caspase-3. The processing of pro-caspase-3, a sign of caspase-3 activation, occurred 6 h after treatment with Py/Zn. Proteolysis of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a substrate of caspase-3, was also observed 6 h after treatment with Py/Zn. We also confirmed the elevation of caspase-3 activity as an index of the cleavage of amino acid sequences recognized by activated caspase-3.

Expression of the survivin gene is related to tumorigenesis and inhibition of apoptosis in some malignant tumors. We investigated its expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in NB cell lines (SK-N-SH, NB-39, and IMR-32), two normal blood cell samples, and 13 clinical NB tumor samples. All three NB cell lines had high levels of mRNA expression for this gene, but normal blood cells had no expression. We detected expression of survivin mRNA in 7 of the 13 NB tumor samples (54%). Two NB patients were in stage I disease, 6 in stage II, and 5 in stage IV(A). Quantitative analysis by RT-PCR revealed that the ratio between survivin mRNA and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (h-GAPDH) mRNA was very low in stages I and II (0-0.017).

To assess the prognostic value of these genes, we quantified their expression by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a cohort of 127 patients with CLL and correlated this with clinical outcome, IGVH mutational status, and ZAP-70 protein expression. IGVH mutational status, ZAP-70, and the LPL and ADAM29 mRNA ratios (L/A ratio) were predictive of event-free survival for the whole cohort and for patients with stage A disease. In patients in stage B and C, the L/A ratio was an independent prognostic factor, whereas ZAP-70 did not predict survival. Simultaneous usage of the L/A ratio and ZAP-70 expression allowed an almost perfect (99%) assessment of the IGVH status in the 80% of patients with concordant results (L/A+, ZAP-70+ or L/A-, ZAP-70-). LPL and ADAM29 gene expression could also be determined by a simple competitive multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay. Overall, quantification of LPL and ADAM29 gene expression is a strong prognostic indicator in CLL, providing better prognostic assessment than ZAP-70 in advanced stages of the disease.","['Oppezzo, Pablo', 'Vasconcelos, Yuri', 'Settegrana, Catherine', 'Jeannel, Dominique', 'Vuillier, Francoise', 'Legarff-Tavernier, Magali', 'Kimura, Eliza Yuriko', 'Bechet, Stephane', 'Dumas, Gerard', 'Brissard, Martine', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Yamamoto, Mihoko', 'Dighiero, Guillaume', 'Davi, Frederic']","['Oppezzo P', 'Vasconcelos Y', 'Settegrana C', 'Jeannel D', 'Vuillier F', 'Legarff-Tavernier M', 'Kimura EY', 'Bechet S', 'Dumas G', 'Brissard M', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Yamamoto M', 'Dighiero G', 'Davi F']","[""Unite d'Immuno-Hematologie et d'Immunopathologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM29 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*genetics', 'Male', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2005/04/02 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/04/02 09:00'],"['2005/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53291-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-08-3344 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 15;106(2):650-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-08-3344.

Honokiol is a natural product known to possess potent antineoplastic and antiangiogenic properties. We examined whether honokiol can overcome apoptotic resistance in primary tumor cells derived from B-CLL patients. Honokiol induced caspase-dependent cell death in all of the B-CLL cells examined and was more toxic toward B-CLL cells than to normal mononuclear cells, suggesting greater susceptibility of the malignant cells. Honokiol-induced apoptosis was characterized by the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 and cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Exposure of B-CLL cells to honokiol resulted in up-regulation of Bcl2-associated protein (Bax) and down-regulation of the expression of the key survival protein myeloid-cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), which is associated with response to treatment in B-CLL patients. In addition, B-CLL cells pretreated with interleukin-4 (IL-4), a cytokine known to support B-CLL survival, underwent apoptosis when subsequently incubated with honokiol, indicating that honokiol could also overcome the prosurvival effects of IL-4. Furthermore, honokiol enhanced cytotoxicity induced by fludarabine, cladribine, or chlorambucil. These data indicate that honokiol is a potent inducer of apoptosis in B-CLL cells and should be examined for further clinical application either as a single agent or in combination with other anticancer agents.","['Battle, Traci E', 'Arbiser, Jack', 'Frank, David A']","['Battle TE', 'Arbiser J', 'Frank DA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Mayer 522B, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '11513CCO0N (honokiol)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Lignans/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Magnolia', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', '*Phytotherapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",2005/04/02 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/04/02 09:00'],"['2005/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53296-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-11-4273 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 15;106(2):690-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-11-4273.

Immunoblot analysis demonstrates that R-etodolac induces apoptosis characterized by caspase-8, -9, and -3 and PARP (poly-ADP [adenosine diphosphate]-ribose polymerase) cleavage and down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression. Subcytotoxic doses of R-etodolac up-regulate myeloid cell leukemia-1 proapoptotic variant (Mcl-1S), while enhancing dexamethasone (Dex)-induced caspase activation and apoptosis. The combination of R-etodolac with Dex results in a highly synergistic cytotoxic effect. R-etodolac also induces apoptosis against primary cells isolated from patients with MM refractory to chemotherapy. Although interleukin 6 (IL-6) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) abrogate Dex-induced MM cell cytotoxicity, neither IL-6 nor IGF-1 protects against R-etodolac-induced cytotoxicity in MM cells. R-etodolac also inhibits viability of MM cells adherent to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), thereby overcoming a mechanism of drug resistance commonly observed with other conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Our data, therefore, indicate that R-etodolac circumvents drug resistance in MM cells at clinically relevant concentrations, targets Mcl-1, and can be synergistically combined with Dex.","['Yasui, Hiroshi', 'Hideshima, Teru', 'Hamasaki, Makoto', 'Roccaro, Aldo M', 'Shiraishi, Norihiko', 'Kumar, Shaji', 'Tassone, Pierfrancesco', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji', 'Raje, Noopur', 'Tai, Yu-Tzu', 'Podar, Klaus', 'Chauhan, Dharminder', 'Leoni, Lorenzo M', 'Kanekal, Sarath', 'Elliott, Gary', 'Munshi, Nikhil C', 'Anderson, Kenneth C']","['Yasui H', 'Hideshima T', 'Hamasaki M', 'Roccaro AM', 'Shiraishi N', 'Kumar S', 'Tassone P', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Raje N', 'Tai YT', 'Podar K', 'Chauhan D', 'Leoni LM', 'Kanekal S', 'Elliott G', 'Munshi NC', 'Anderson KC']","['Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Mayer 557, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '2M36281008 (Etodolac)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etodolac/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Stereoisomerism']",2005/04/02 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/04/02 09:00'],"['2005/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53298-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-02-0838 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 15;106(2):706-12. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-02-0838.

However, the role of RASSF1A, SHP-1 and SOCS-1, negative regulators of RTK/RAS signalling, has not been extensively investigated in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). This study employed methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) to determine if aberrant promotor methylation of RASSF1A, SHP-1 and SOCS-1 is involved in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. Patients with MDS (n = 107), AML (n = 154) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML, n = 5) were investigated, together with 15 normal controls. Primers were located in the promotor region of each gene as well as within exon 2 of SOCS-1. Methylation of RASSF1A was found in five of 55 (9%) MDS cases, but not in any of 57 AML cases studied. RASSF1A methylation was present in one case (20%) of JMML. SHP-1 methylation was present in 13 of 121 (11%) AML cases but was not found in MDS or JMML. SOCS-1 promoter methylation was present in eight of 74 (11%) MDS patients but was not seen in JMML or AML. Importantly, RAS mutations and RASSF1A and SOCS-1 methylation were mutually exclusive indicating that approximately 30% of MDS cases had a defect of the RTK/RAS pathway and its negative regulation. Finally, SOCS-1 exon 2 methylation may not be pathogenetically relevant, since it was detected in samples from normal individuals and did not correlate with promotor methylation.","['Johan, M F', 'Bowen, D T', 'Frew, M E', 'Goodeve, A C', 'Reilly, J T']","['Johan MF', 'Bowen DT', 'Frew ME', 'Goodeve AC', 'Reilly JT']","['Academic Unit of Haematology, Division of Genomic Medicine, Henry Wellcome Laboratories for Medical Research, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RASSF1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2005/04/02 09:00,2005/10/01 09:00,['2005/04/02 09:00'],"['2005/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5412 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05412.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Apr;129(1):60-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05412.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have evaluated the rate of response to fludarabine as first-line therapy in 54 patients with advanced stage CLL, analysing the cytogenetic profile, aberrations in p53, including the methylation status of its promoter, and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (IGVH) mutation status. According to the advanced stage of the disease in this series, 75% of patients presented genetic aberrations associated with poor prognosis: del(17p) and/or del(11q), and no-mutated IGVH genes. Ten patients (18.5%) had methylation in the promoter region of p53. Eighty-three per cent of patients treated achieved a response, with a high rate of complete remission (47.6%). Although we found a significant correlation between failures and the presence of p53 aberrations (P = 0.0065), either with methylation (P = 0.018) or deletion (P = 0.015), 64% of the patients with aberrations in this gene responded to treatment (11/17), suggesting that fludarabine induces high remission rates, even in these patients. This is the first time that the significance of p53 promoter methylation status is described in this pathology, and our data support that this epigenetic phenomenon could be involved in the pathogenesis and clinical evolution of CLL.","['Valganon, Mikel', 'Giraldo, Pilar', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Larrayoz, Maria J', 'Rubio-Martinez, Araceli', 'Rubio-Felix, Daniel', 'Calasanz, Maria J', 'Odero, Maria D']","['Valganon M', 'Giraldo P', 'Agirre X', 'Larrayoz MJ', 'Rubio-Martinez A', 'Rubio-Felix D', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Odero MD']","['Department of Genetics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2005/04/02 09:00,2005/10/01 09:00,['2005/04/02 09:00'],"['2005/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5405 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05405.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Apr;129(1):53-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05405.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, no commercial dual-colour, double fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) strategies are available to detect this recurrent anomaly. Therefore, we have created a D-FISH assay to detect these translocations and monitor minimal residual disease. This probe set was created using four bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) corresponding to the PBX1 gene region at 1q23 and four BACs corresponding to the E2A gene region at 19p13.3. We analysed 30 negative bone marrow controls and 20 diagnostic and post-treatment specimens from 13 paediatric B-ALL patients with a cytogenetically defined 1;19 translocation. Once unblinded, the results demonstrated that our D-FISH method effectively identified all diagnostic samples as abnormal and identified disease in four post-treatment samples that were previously considered to be normal by conventional cytogenetic analysis. The development of this FISH strategy for the detection of der(19)t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) and t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) proved to be an effective technique, allowing both the detection of disease in diagnostic samples and in post-treatment samples.","['Shearer, Brandon M', 'Flynn, Heather C', 'Knudson, Ryan A', 'Ketterling, Rhett P']","['Shearer BM', 'Flynn HC', 'Knudson RA', 'Ketterling RP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Division of Laboratory Genetics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/04/02 09:00,2005/10/01 09:00,['2005/04/02 09:00'],"['2005/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5415 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05415.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Apr;129(1):45-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05415.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-two (2.3%) patients were Ph+. Nineteen (45%) had <25% blasts in bone marrow (BM) within the first 2 weeks of treatment and were defined as a good response group (GRG), the others as a poor response group (PRG). Thirty-six (86%) achieved first complete remission (CR1) at the end of induction, of which 28 underwent BM transplantation (BMT). The median follow-up was 42 months (range, 21-84). The 3-year event-free survival (EFS; 52%, 95% CI, 36-66%) was a considerable improvement on the previous MRC UKALL XI trial (27%). EFS for the GRG and PRG were 68% (43-84%) and 39% (18-59%), respectively (P = 0.03); presenting white cell count <50 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.02) was predictive for overall survival. Changes in the MRC ALL97 trial within the study period resulted in some Ph+ ALL receiving daunorubicin and either prednisolone or dexamethasone during induction. Though the use of daunorubicin during induction was not a prospective study question, EFS was significantly better for those whose induction included this drug (P = 0.02). Steroid randomization was not stratified for Ph+ ALL patients and was not predictive for EFS. BMT in CR1 appeared to reduce the risk of a subsequent BM relapse. These results show significant improvement on previous MRC trials; future therapeutic strategies should include early intensive therapy and BMT in CR1.","['Roy, Anindita', 'Bradburn, Mike', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Burrett, Julie', 'Love, Sharon', 'Kinsey, Sally E', 'Mitchell, Chris', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Eden, Tim', 'Lilleyman, John S', 'Hann, Ian', 'Saha, Vaskar']","['Roy A', 'Bradburn M', 'Moorman AV', 'Burrett J', 'Love S', 'Kinsey SE', 'Mitchell C', 'Vora A', 'Eden T', 'Lilleyman JS', 'Hann I', 'Saha V']","[""Cancer Research UK Children's Cancer Group, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/02 09:00,2005/10/01 09:00,['2005/04/02 09:00'],"['2005/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5425 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05425.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Apr;129(1):35-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05425.x.,,,,['14840/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,['Medical Research Council Childhood Leukaemia Working Party'],,,,,,,,,,

This reflects both the failure of current salvage regimens and the absence of effective strategies to secure long-term disease-free survival in those patients who achieve a second remission. Recent progress in understanding the pathogenesis of relapsed disease has enabled the identification of a variety of dysregulated molecular pathways and these now provide a rational basis for the design of novel targeted therapies. At the same time, advances in allogeneic stem-cell transplantation have permitted the extension of the curative potential of allografting to patients in whom it was previously contraindicated. As a result, a range of novel drug and transplant therapies has become available in patients with relapsed AML, and it is realistic to anticipate that a co-ordinated assessment of their clinical and biological impact will provide the basis for the design of future, more effective treatments in relapsed disease.","['Craddock, Charles', 'Tauro, Sudhir', 'Moss, Paul', 'Grimwade, David']","['Craddock C', 'Tauro S', 'Moss P', 'Grimwade D']","['Leukaemia Unit, Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK. charles.craddock@uhb.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Contraindications', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/02 09:00,2005/10/01 09:00,['2005/04/02 09:00'],"['2005/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5318 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05318.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Apr;129(1):18-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05318.x.,,,156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore conducted a population-based case-control study to examine the association between alcohol and NHL risk. METHODS: 613 NHL cases and 480 population controls in Sweden reported their average consumption of beer, wine, and liquor 2 years before the study. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between alcohol intake and NHL risk. RESULTS: Intake of total alcohol, beer, wine, or liquor was not associated with risk of overall NHL. There was no difference in risk of NHL among those who habitually consumed above 19.1 g of ethanol per day, compared to those who consumed on average 0-2.2 g of ethanol per day (OR = 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8, 1.7); Ptrend = 0.29). However, the association was significantly positive among males (OR = 1.8 (95% CI: 1.1, 2.9); Ptrend = 0.06). Total alcohol, beer, wine, or liquor intake was not associated with any major histopathologic subtype of NHL examined, apart from an association between high wine consumption and increased risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

The aim of this study was to compare the rate of cancer in people with ID with that found in the general population. METHODS: Information on 9409 individuals registered with the Disability Services Commission of Western Australia was linked to the State Cancer Registry, with 200 cases of cancer detected over 156,729 person-years. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for both sexes separately by 5-year age groups for the period 1982-2001. The same procedures were adopted in the estimation of SIRs for specific types of cancers. RESULTS: The age-standardised incidence of all cancers in people with ID was not significantly different from the general population. However, males with ID were observed to have a significantly increased risk of leukaemia, brain and stomach cancers, and a reduced risk of prostate cancer, while leukaemia, corpus uteri and colorectal cancers were significantly higher in females. CONCLUSIONS: Health practitioners need to be aware that with improvements in life expectancy the incidence of cancer in people with ID is likely to rise. More proactive health promotion campaigns may be needed for people with ID, who are likely to be poor users of screening services and whose symptoms may not be reported until they are in more advanced, less treatable stages of disease.","['Sullivan, Sheena G', 'Hussain, Rafat', 'Threlfall, Timothy', 'Bittles, Alan H']","['Sullivan SG', 'Hussain R', 'Threlfall T', 'Bittles AH']","['Centre for Human Genetics, Edith Cowan University, Perth, WA 6027, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intellectual Disability/*complications', '*Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology']",2005/04/02 09:00,2005/05/04 09:00,['2005/04/02 09:00'],"['2005/04/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10552-004-1256-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2004 Dec;15(10):1021-5. doi: 10.1007/s10552-004-1256-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these rats, not only PTHrP but also several other human proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, leukemia-inducing factor, IL-8, IL-5 and IL-11, were secreted to the bloodstream. Proinflammatory cytokines induce acute-phase reactions, as evidenced by a decrease of serum albumin and an increase in alpha1-acid glycoprotein. Tumor resection abolished the production of proinflammatory cytokines and improved acute-phase reactions, whereas anti-PTHrP antibody affected neither proinflammatory cytokine production nor acute-phase reactions. Nevertheless, tumor resection and administration of anti-PTHrP antibody similarly and markedly attenuated not only hypercalcemia but also loss of fat, muscle and body weight. Body weight gain by anti-PTHrP antibody was associated with increased food consumption; increased body weight from anti-PTHrP antibody was observed when animals were freely fed but not when they were given the same feeding as those that received only vehicle. Furthermore, nude rats bearing LC-6-JCK showed reduced locomotor activity, less eating and drinking and low blood phosphorus; and anti-PTHrP antibody restored them. Although alendronate, a bisphosphonate drug, decreased blood calcium, it affected neither locomotor activity nor serum phosphorus level. These results indicate that PTHrP represses physical activity and energy metabolism independently of hypercalcemia and proinflammatory cytokine actions and that deregulation of such physiologic activities and functions by PTHrP is at least in part involved in PTHrP-induced wasting syndrome.","['Onuma, Etsuro', 'Tsunenari, Toshiaki', 'Saito, Hidemi', 'Sato, Koh', 'Yamada-Okabe, Hisafumi', 'Ogata, Etsuro']","['Onuma E', 'Tsunenari T', 'Saito H', 'Sato K', 'Yamada-Okabe H', 'Ogata E']","['Pharmaceutical Research Department IV, Kamakura Research Laboratories, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*pathology/veterinary', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology/veterinary', 'Cytokines/blood/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/complications/physiopathology/veterinary', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*pathology/veterinary', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/*pathology/veterinary', 'Lung Neoplasms/*pathology/veterinary', '*Motor Activity', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*pathology/veterinary', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Nude', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Wasting Syndrome/*physiopathology/veterinary']",2005/04/01 09:00,2005/08/04 09:00,['2005/04/01 09:00'],"['2005/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21038 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2005 Sep 1;116(3):471-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21038.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several automated hematology analyzers that carry blast-detecting programs have been developed, they do not exert sufficient detection sensitivity to exceed the sensitivity of manual eye counting method. METHODS: We constructed a new blast-detecting program by combining the numerical information acquired from five cytometric parameters presented by XE-2100. The sensitivity and specificity of this blast multi-scoring program were assessed in comparison with the Blasts flag program equipped originally in XE-2100. RESULTS: The blast-detecting sensitivity was found to be highly improved in the blast multi-scoring program as compared with the Blasts flag program without much decreasing the specificity. A small number of leukemic myeloblasts was detected at the better sensitivity than the eye counting method in the clinical course of the patients with acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The daily practical use of this blast multi-scoring program will surely contribute to sensitive, objective, and real-time evaluation of the control of acute myeloid leukemia with a low cost.","['Tohyama, Kaoru', 'Shiga, Shuichi', 'Itose, Yuji', 'Uchihashi, Kinya', 'Ohkura, Mitsugi', 'Takahashi, Keiko', 'Itoh, Mitsuru', 'Ichiyama, Satoshi', 'Hamaguchi, Yukio']","['Tohyama K', 'Shiga S', 'Itose Y', 'Uchihashi K', 'Ohkura M', 'Takahashi K', 'Itoh M', 'Ichiyama S', 'Hamaguchi Y']","['Department of Clinical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan. ktohyama@med.kawasaki-m.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Bacterial translocation via intestinal mucosa is a significant mechanism of FN development. Competitive inhibition of bowel colonization by pathogenic microorganisms by lactic acid bacteria could be a useful prevention of FN. The aim of the study was the evaluation of dose and safety of probiotic strain Enterococcus faecium M-74 enriched with organic selenium in patients with solid and hematological malignancies. Eleven (9 M/2F) patients were included in the study. In the first phase six patients with germ cell tumors treated by chemotherapy were included. They received prophylaxis by nonpathogenic strain E. faecium M-74 during 2 cycles of chemotherapy. The planned daily dose was 6 x 10(9) bacteria. Regarding the insufficient colonization of the gut, the dose was further increased up to 18 x 10(9) tid. After safety evaluation, five patients were included with relapse of acute leukemia. In patients with germ cell cancer, severe neutropenia G3/4 was noted in 10 of 12 cycles of chemotherapy. The febrile episode was not observed in any of the patients. The gut colonization by enterococci reaches 10(6) CFU/g stool. In 5 patients with acute leukemia during 127 days of severe neutropenia 12 febrile episodes occurred. There was not noted any febrile episode or infection provoked by the tested strain. Tolerance of therapy was excellent without significant undesirable effects. Optimal dose was assessed and safety of probiotic strain was evaluated in neutropenic patients with solid, or hematological malignancies.

The expression of myeloid and non-lineage associated markers was detected by indirect immunofluorescence method. Correlation between bcl-2 and markers expression and patients characteristics was determined. More than 20% positivity for bcl-2 was found in 22 (31.4%) patients. Bcl-2 expression showed an association with M4 and M5 subtypes (p<0.01) and was correlated with clinical parameters including WBC and platelet count, extramedullary disease and Hb level. Bcl-2 expressing cells were significantly higher in CD15(+) and CD13(+) patients and lower in CD11b(+) and CD33(+) cases (p<0.001). Complete remission (CR) rate was significantly lower in cases with 20% or more bcl-2 positivity than others (24.4% v 75.6%). A shorter CR duration was observed in bcl-2+ patients when compared with bcl-2- ones (571+/-50 versus 850+/-17 days)(p=0.0001). The expression of bcl-2 was also associated with shorter survival (p=0.0001). Survival time for bcl-2+ patients was 831+/-44 days versus 1119+/-17 days for bcl-2- ones. CD11b and CD33 positivity was associated with longer survival whereas CD13 and CD15 positivity was correlated with lower survival (p<0.007). In multivariate analysis bcl-2 positivity was associated with poor survival. Bcl-2 expression showed a prognostic value in our patients indicating that even despite of some differences in treatment regimen, immunocytochemical analysis of this marker is still a simple and inexpensive method for evaluation of prognosis in AML patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate various morphometric characteristics of microvessels in lymph node sections of 286 patients with HL at diagnosis and investigate their relationship with clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis. Microvessel density (MVD), total vascular area (TVA) and several size- and shape-related microvascular parameters were quantitated--after anti-CD34 immunohistochemical staining--in the region of most intense vascularization, using image analysis. An increase in microvessel caliber parameters (area, perimeter, major and minor axis length) and a decrease in MVD were noted with increasing stage. An inverse relationship was recorded between MVD and the number of involved sites (NIS) and LDH. In univariate analysis, overall disease-specific survival was adversely affected by MVD and TVA, whereas inferior failure-free survival (FFS) was associated with the presence of more flattened vessel sections. Multivariate analysis disclosed that the extent of angiogenesis (MVD/TVA), age and the NIS independently affected overall survival. Accordingly, FFS was independently linked to the shape of microvessels and albumin levels or the NIS.

In all, 21 patients with JMML who received donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for either mixed chimerism (MC, n=7) or relapse (n=14) were studied. Six patients had been transplanted from an HLA-matched sibling and 15 from other donors. Six of the 21 patients (MC: 3/7 patients; relapse: 3/14 patients) responded to DLI. Response rate was significantly higher in patients receiving a higher total T-cell dose (> or =1 x 10(7)/kg) and in patients with an abnormal karyotype. None of the six patients receiving DLI from a matched sibling responded. Response was observed in five of six patients who did and in one of 15 children who did not develop acute graft-versus-host disease following DLI (P=0.01). The overall outcome was poor even for the responders. Only one of the responders is alive in remission, two relapsed, and three died of complications. In conclusion, this study shows that some cases of JMML may be sensitive to DLI, this providing evidence for a graft-versus-leukemia effect in JMML. Infusion of a high number of T cells, strategies to reduce toxicity, and cytoreduction prior to DLI may improve the results.","['Yoshimi, A', 'Bader, P', 'Matthes-Martin, S', 'Stary, J', 'Sedlacek, P', 'Duffner, U', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Dilloo, D', 'Holter, W', 'Zintl, F', 'Kremens, B', 'Sykora, K-W', 'Urban, C', 'Hasle, H', 'Korthof, E', 'Revesz, T', 'Fischer, A', 'Nollke, P', 'Locatelli, F', 'Niemeyer, C M']","['Yoshimi A', 'Bader P', 'Matthes-Martin S', 'Stary J', 'Sedlacek P', 'Duffner U', 'Klingebiel T', 'Dilloo D', 'Holter W', 'Zintl F', 'Kremens B', 'Sykora KW', 'Urban C', 'Hasle H', 'Korthof E', 'Revesz T', 'Fischer A', 'Nollke P', 'Locatelli F', 'Niemeyer CM']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg 79106, Germany. yoshimi@kikli.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/mortality/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/01 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/04/01 09:00'],"['2005/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403721 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403721 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jun;19(6):971-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403721.,,,,,,,,,,,['European Working Group of MDS in Childhood (EWOG-MDS)'],,,,,,,,,,

Recently, leukemic cells from some patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) were shown to express ZAP-70. Owing to the prognostic value of B-CLL ZAP-70 expression, this phenotype may reflect intrinsic biological differences between the two subsets of disease. However, it remains unclear whether CLL-B cells aberrantly acquire ZAP-70 expression during the transformation process or whether ZAP-70 may be expressed under certain conditions in normal human B-lymphocytes. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we assessed ZAP-70 expression in normal human B-lymphocytes. Our data demonstrate that ZAP-70 is expressed in a subpopulation of tonsillar and splenic normal B-lymphocytes that express an activated phenotype. Furthermore, ZAP-70 expression can be induced in vitro upon stimulation of blood and tonsillar B cells. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of ZAP-70 occurs in tonsillar B cells with stimulation through the B-cell receptor. These results provide new insight into normal human B-cell biology as well as provide clues about the transformed cell in B-CLL.","['Nolz, J C', 'Tschumper, R C', 'Pittner, B T', 'Darce, J R', 'Kay, N E', 'Jelinek, D F']","['Nolz JC', 'Tschumper RC', 'Pittner BT', 'Darce JR', 'Kay NE', 'Jelinek DF']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Mayo Graduate School, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*physiology', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Transfection', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2005/04/01 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/04/01 09:00'],"['2005/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403726 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403726 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jun;19(6):1018-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403726.,,,,['5-T32-HL67742/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain further insight into inherited susceptibility to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), we followed up the descendants of Videbaek's 'Pedigree 14' series of families. Using the Danish medical and pedigree databases, complete tracing of 222 descendants of the original 57 family members was achieved.

We analyzed mechanisms and consequences of p16(INK4A) reconstitution in T-ALL cells lacking this tumor suppressor. CCRF-CEM cells with tetracycline-regulated p16(INK4A) expression underwent stable G1-phase cell cycle arrest for 72 h followed by massive apoptosis. p16(INK4A) expression caused pRB hypophosphorylation and repression of certain E2F target genes. Interestingly, cyclin E and c-Myc were not affected, suggesting pRB/E2F-independent expression of these E2F targets. Cyclin E/CDK2, however, was inactive due to stabilization and redistribution of p27(Kip1) from CDK4/CDK6 to CDK2. Analyses of c-Myc target genes suggested that c-Myc was transcriptionally inactive, which correlated with hypophosphorylation of the c-Myc inhibitor p107. Thus, p16(INK4A), although unable to repress the expression of deregulated cyclin E and c-Myc, functionally inactivated these potential oncogenes. p16(INK4A)-arrested cells showed morphologic changes, induction of T-cell-specific surface markers and repression of telomerase activity, suggesting differentiation. Moreover, p16(INK4A) reconstitution was associated with increased cellular volume, normal protein synthesis rates and elevated ATP levels. Taken together, p16(INK4A) reconstitution in p16(INK4A)-deficient T-ALL cells induced cell cycle arrest in the presence of cyclin E and c-Myc expression, uncoupled growth from cell cycle progression and caused a sequential process of growth, differentiation and apoptosis.","['Ausserlechner, M J', 'Obexer, P', 'Geley, S', 'Kofler, R']","['Ausserlechner MJ', 'Obexer P', 'Geley S', 'Kofler R']","['Molecular Biology Research Laboratory, Department of Pediatrics, Medical University Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria. michael.j.ausserlechner@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RBL1 protein, human)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p107)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Child', 'Cyclin E/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, myc/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p107', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/physiology']",2005/04/01 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/04/01 09:00'],"['2005/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403729 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403729 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Jun;19(6):1051-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403729.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: The sample consisted of 20 ulcerative lesions from 15 children treated with chemotherapy in the Pediatric Service of the Regional Hospital of Concepcion, Chile. Two calibrated clinicians performed clinical diagnosis of the ulcers and registered general data from the patients (age, general diagnosis, absolute neutrophil count, and number of days after chemotherapy) and clinical characteristic of the ulcers: number, size, location, presence or absence of pain and inflammatory halo, edge characteristics, and exudate type. Additional to clinical diagnosis, culture for Candida albicans (C) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 was performed. RESULTS: Ten ulcers occurred in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, five in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia and five in patients with other neoplastic diseases. Eight ulcers were HSV (+) / C (-), 6 HSV (-) / C (-), 4 HSV (+) / C (+) and 2 HSV (-) / C (+). Preferential location was the hard palate. Most lesions were multiple, painful, with inflammatory halo, irregular edges and fibrinous exudate. The average size was 6,5 millimeters, and the mean number of days after chemotherapy was 7.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Oral ulcers in children with oncological diseases did not present a specific clinical pattern.

More recently, measurements of the variation in the response of malignant lymphoblasts to chemotherapy in vivo have further improved relapse prediction. It is unknown whether the variation in the response of nonmalignant hematologic cells after chemotherapy correlates with the response of lymphoblasts or risk of relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated myelosuppression during induction and consolidation chemotherapy in 227 children uniformly treated for ALL on consecutive Australian and New Zealand Children's Cancer Study Group protocols. The early response to treatment was assessed in a representative subset (n = 62) by determining minimal residual disease (MRD) level by molecular techniques on the end-of-induction bone marrow sample. RESULTS: We found that a slow rate of myeloid recovery at the end of induction chemotherapy, reflected in a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC), was highly predictive of relapse (P < .0001). Additionally, patients with a high end-of-induction MRD level had a high risk of relapse (P = .001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic significance of MRD and ANC at the end of induction chemotherapy (P < .05). There was no significant association between other measures of myelotoxicity and MRD or relapse. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the responses of normal myeloid cells and malignant lymphoblasts to chemotherapy predict outcome by distinct mechanisms. While these results are promising, their use in the clinical setting needs to be examined in a future randomized controlled trial.","['Laughton, Stephen J', 'Ashton, Lesley J', 'Kwan, Edward', 'Norris, Murray D', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Marshall, Glenn M']","['Laughton SJ', 'Ashton LJ', 'Kwan E', 'Norris MD', 'Haber M', 'Marshall GM']","[""Centre for Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders, Sydney Children's Hospital, High St, Randwick, Sydney, NSW 2031, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/04/01 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2005/04/01 09:00'],"['2005/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/10/2264 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.04.012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Apr 1;23(10):2264-71. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.012.,,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2005 Aug 1;23(22):5277'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Main member institutions of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) and its affiliates were randomly assigned to receive standard information (n = 73) or educational intervention (n = 53). Standard information included CALGB Web site access and periodic notification about existing trials. The geriatric educational intervention included standard information plus: (1) an educational seminar; (2) educational materials; (3) a list of available protocols for use on charts; (4) a monthly e-mail and mail reminders for 1 year; and (5) a case discussion seminar. The main outcome was percentage of accrual of older persons to phase II and III treatment protocols after study initiation compared with baseline. RESULTS: There were 3,032 patients entered onto trials in the baseline year, and 2,160 and 1,239 during the 2 years postintervention, respectively. Overall percentage of accrual of older patients was 37% at baseline, and 33% and 31% during the first and second years after intervention. There was no improvement in accrual in the intervention versus control arm: 36% v 32% in the first year and 31% v 31% in the second year. CONCLUSION: Accrual of older patients was not increased by this intervention. Reasons for lack of effect include low intervention intensity, high baseline accrual rates, and closure of several high-accruing protocols during the study. More intense and multifaceted approaches will be needed to change physician (and patient) behavior and to increase accrual of older persons to clinical trials.","['Kimmick, Gretchen G', 'Peterson, Bercedis L', 'Kornblith, Alice B', 'Mandelblatt, Jeanne', 'Johnson, Jeffrey L', 'Wheeler, Judith', 'Heinze, Robin', 'Cohen, Harvey J', 'Muss, Hyman B']","['Kimmick GG', 'Peterson BL', 'Kornblith AB', 'Mandelblatt J', 'Johnson JL', 'Wheeler J', 'Heinze R', 'Cohen HJ', 'Muss HB']","['Duke University Medical Center, Suite 3800 Duke S, Box 3204, Durham, NC 27710, USA. gretchen.kimmick@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', '*Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Patient Selection', ""Physician's Role"", '*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2005/04/01 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2005/04/01 09:00'],"['2005/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/10/2201 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.01.222 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Apr 1;23(10):2201-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.01.222.,,,,['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2005 Oct 20;23(30):7752; author reply 7752-3.

Additionally, integrins trigger multiple signaling pathways that are involved in cell migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation. We previously demonstrated that the activation of integrins containing the beta(1) subunit leads to a selective increase in potassium currents carried by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels in neuroblastoma and leukemia cells; this current activation modulates adhesion-dependent differentiation in these cells. We hypothesized that the cross-talk between integrins and hERG channels could be traced back to the assembly of a macromolecular signaling complex comprising the two proteins. We tested this hypothesis in both SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and in human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with hERG1 and, therefore, expressing only the full-length hERG1 protein on the plasma membrane. The beta(1) integrin and hERG1 coprecipitate in these cells and colocalize in both intracellular and surface membrane compartments. The two proteins also coprecipitate with caveolin-1, suggesting the localization of the complex in lipid rafts/caveolae. hERG1-transfected cells undergo an activation of hERG currents after beta(1) integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin; concomitant with this activation, the focal adhesion kinase associates with the hERG1 protein and becomes tyrosine phosphorylated. Using hERG1-specific inhibitors, we show that the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase is strictly dependent on hERG channel activity. Similarly, the activity of the small GTPase Rac1 turned out to be dependent on hERG currents. On the whole, these data indicate that the hERG1 protein associates with beta(1) integrins and modulates adhesion receptor signaling.","['Cherubini, Alessia', 'Hofmann, Giovanna', 'Pillozzi, Serena', 'Guasti, Leonardo', 'Crociani, Olivia', 'Cilia, Emanuele', 'Di Stefano, Paola', 'Degani, Simona', 'Balzi, Manuela', 'Olivotto, Massimo', 'Wanke, Enzo', 'Becchetti, Andrea', 'Defilippi, Paola', 'Wymore, Randy', 'Arcangeli, Annarosa']","['Cherubini A', 'Hofmann G', 'Pillozzi S', 'Guasti L', 'Crociani O', 'Cilia E', 'Di Stefano P', 'Degani S', 'Balzi M', 'Olivotto M', 'Wanke E', 'Becchetti A', 'Defilippi P', 'Wymore R', 'Arcangeli A']","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Firenze, 50134 Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin beta Chains)', '0 (KCNH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'ERG1 Potassium Channel', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/*metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta Chains/analysis/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Kidney/cytology/embryology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2005/04/01 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/04/01 09:00'],"['2005/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['E04-10-0940 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.e04-10-0940 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2005 Jun;16(6):2972-83. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e04-10-0940.

Here we report that suppression of a voltage-gated K(+) channel with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), barium, and tetraethylammonium inhibited both EGF- and insulin-stimulated myeloblastic leukemia ML-1 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Both MAPK/ERK and Akt pathways are known to mediate cell proliferative signals of a variety of growth factors including insulin. In serum-starved ML-1 cells, insulin rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt, and the phosphorylation levels peaked approximately 30 min after treatment. Pretreatment of ML-1 cells with 4-AP potently and dose-dependently prevented phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. However, insulin-induced activation of the Akt pathway also played a role in promoting ML-1 cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that although ML-1 cells were primarily arrested at G(1) phase by serum starvation for 36 h, they reentered the cell cycle after treatment with serum or insulin for 24 h.

However, the mechanisms by which TGHQ induces apoptosis are unclear, and they were the focus of the present investigation. TGHQ stimulated the rapid formation (30 min) of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HL-60 cells, and co-treatment with catalase or the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) completely blocked TGHQ-induced apoptosis, implicating a causative role for ROS in HL-60 cell death. Western blot analysis revealed the complete disappearance of pro-caspase 9 between 1 and 2 hours after exposure of HL-60 cells to TGHQ, concomitant with the appearance of cleaved caspase 9 and increases in caspase 9 activity. The appearance of two cleaved forms of caspase 3 occurred subsequent to increases in caspase 9 activity. Levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein remained constant during TGHQ-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells, but Bcl-2 S70 phosphorylation decreased. In contrast, changes in the subcellular localization of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax were observed, with a rapid (15-60 min) increase in the ratio of cytosolic to mitochondrial Bax. Cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol occurred after Bax translocation and the dephosphorylation of pS70 Bcl-2. However the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (deltapsi(m)) was maintained, even after cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria. Cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (PTP), did not completely rescue HL-60 cells from apoptosis. Taken together, we conclude that TGHQ facilitates ROS production, alters the post-translational modification of Bcl-2 and subcellular localization of Bax, culminating in the release of cytochrome c and caspase activation.","['Yang, Mi Young', 'Lau, Serrine S', 'Monks, Terrence J']","['Yang MY', 'Lau SS', 'Monks TJ']","['Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '119212-33-8 (2,3,5-(triglutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'Glutathione/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', '*Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/*enzymology/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/04/01 09:00,2005/10/12 09:00,['2005/04/01 09:00'],"['2005/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['kfi165 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfi165 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2005 Jul;86(1):92-100. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfi165.

Previously, we found that carnosic acid potentiates differentiation of human leukemia cells induced by low concentrations of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D(3)). In this study, we investigated if this effect is a general property of antioxidants, and whether there is a common mechanism whereby antioxidants potentiate monocytic differentiation. We found that all antioxidants tested enhanced differentiation-related cell cycle arrest induced by a low (1 nM) concentration of 1,25D(3). Addition of antioxidants to 1,25D(3) activated the JNK pathway as indicated by increased phosphorylation of c-jun and ATF-2, although each compound alone had a minimal effect. Antioxidants also enhanced the 1,25D(3)-induced AP-1 DNA binding and transactivation ability. Expression of Egr-1 and c-fos was increased by combinations of antioxidants and 1,25D(3), in parallel with the activation of the JNK pathway. The potentiation of differentiation by antioxidants was inhibited by JNK inhibitor SP600125 and a dominant negative JNK 1/2 construct, and Egr-1 and c-fos expression was proportionally decreased, suggesting that JNK pathway regulates these transcription factors. While potentiating the prodifferentiation effect of 1,25D(3), antioxidants did not promote the elevation of basal levels of intracellular calcium by 1,25D(3). The results indicate that JNK-AP1 pathway has an important role in the potentiation of 1,25D(3)-induced differentiation by antioxidants, and regulates expression of Egr-1 and c-fos. Combinations of antioxidants with 1,25D(3) should be further evaluated for use in cancer chemoprevention and therapy.","['Wang, Qing', 'Salman, Hagar', 'Danilenko, Michael', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Wang Q', 'Salman H', 'Danilenko M', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, 17103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Organoselenium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Plants/chemistry', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2005/03/31 09:00,2005/10/07 09:00,['2005/03/31 09:00'],"['2005/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.20355 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2005 Sep;204(3):964-74. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20355.,,,,['CA 44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the mechanisms of resistance to MX2, we established an MX2-resistant phenotype (K562/MX2) of the human myelogeneous leukaemia cell line (K562/P), by continuously exposing a suspension culture to increasing concentrations of MX2. K562/MX2 cells were more resistant to MX2 than the parent cells, and also showed cross-resistance to etoposide and doxorubicin. Topoisomerase (Topo) IIalpha protein levels in K562/MX2 cells were lower of those in K562/P cells on immunoblot analysis and decreased expression of Topo IIalpha mRNA was seen in K562/MX2 cells. Topoisomerase II catalytic activity was also reduced in the nuclear extracts from K562/MX2 cells when compared with K562/P cells. Aberrant methylated CpG of Topo IIalpha gene was observed in K562/MX2 cells when compared with the parent line on methylation-specific restriction enzyme analysis. To overcome the drug resistance to MX2 and etoposide, we investigated treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AZ), which is a demethylating agent, in K562/MX2 cells. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment increased Topo IIalpha mRNA expression in K562/MX2 cells, but not in K562/P cells, and increased the cytotoxicity of MX2 and etoposide. Methylated CpG was decreased in K562/MX2 cells after 5AZ treatment. We concluded that the mechanism of drug resistance to MX2 and etoposide in K562/MX2 cells might be the combination of decreased expression of Topo IIalpha gene and increased methylation, and that 5AZ could prove to be a novel treatment for etoposide-resistant cell lines, such as K562/MX2.","['Asano, T', 'Nakamura, K', 'Fujii, H', 'Horichi, N', 'Ohmori, T', 'Hasegawa, K', 'Isoe, T', 'Adachi, M', 'Otake, N', 'Fukunaga, Y']","['Asano T', 'Nakamura K', 'Fujii H', 'Horichi N', 'Ohmori T', 'Hasegawa K', 'Isoe T', 'Adachi M', 'Otake N', 'Fukunaga Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.

The extremely labile nature of the Mcl-1 protein itself and the fact that the Mcl-1 level is a critical determinant in various cell survival pathways suggest that cellular processes that regulate Mcl-1 stability are as important as those that regulate Mcl-1 synthesis. Although transcriptional stimulation of Mcl-1 synthesis in response to various stimuli has been well documented, regulation of Mcl-1 stability has been hardly explored. In this study, we identified that the translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) was one cellular factor that interacted with Mcl-1 and modulated Mcl-1 stability. While overexpression of TCTP augmented the protein stability of Mcl-1, knockdown expression of TCTP by RNA interference destabilized Mcl-1. Furthermore, TCTP stabilized Mcl-1 through interfering with Mcl-1's degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation pathway, and the TCTP binding-defective mutant of Mcl-1 (K257V) was much more susceptible to degradation and manifested a compromised antiapoptotic activity. Taken together, these results suggest that TCTP modulates Mcl-1's antiapoptotic activity by modulating its protein stability. The possible mechanism(s) involved in TCTP's modulation process is discussed.","['Liu, Hsuan', 'Peng, Hsien-Wei', 'Cheng, Yi-Sheng', 'Yuan, Hanna S', 'Yang-Yen, Hsin-Fang']","['Liu H', 'Peng HW', 'Cheng YS', 'Yuan HS', 'Yang-Yen HF']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, 128 Yen-Jiou Yuan Rd., Section 2, Nankang, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tpt1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Lysine/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2005/03/31 09:00,2005/05/25 09:00,['2005/03/31 09:00'],"['2005/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/8/3117 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.8.3117-3126.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Apr;25(8):3117-26. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.8.3117-3126.2005.,,PMC1069602,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate two novel nuclear localization signals (NLSs) within Fli-1: one (NLS1) is located at the N terminus, and another (NLS2) is within the Ets domain. Nuclear accumulation of Fli-1 reflected the combined functional effects of the two discrete NLSs. Each NLS can independently direct nuclear transport of a carrier protein, with mutations within the NLSs affecting nuclear accumulation. NLS1 has a bipartite motif, whereas the NLS2 region contains a nonclassical NLS. Both NLSs bind importin alpha (IMPalpha) and IMPbeta, with NLS1 and NLS2 being predominantly recognized by IMPalpha and IMPbeta, respectively. Fli-1 also contains one nuclear export signal. Leptomycin B abolished its cytoplasmic accumulation, showing CRM1 dependency. We demonstrate that Ets domain binding to specific target DNA effectively blocks IMP binding, indicating that the targeted DNA binding plays a role in localizing Fli-1 to its destination and releasing IMPs for recycling back to the cytoplasm. Finally, by analyzing full-length Fli-1 carrying NLS1, NLS2, and combined NLS1-NLS2 mutations, we conclude that two functional NLSs exist in Fli-1 and that each NLS is sufficient to target Fli-1 to the nucleus for activation of Mk-specific genes.","['Hu, Wei', 'Philips, Alana S', 'Kwok, Juliana C', 'Eisbacher, Michael', 'Chong, Beng H']","['Hu W', 'Philips AS', 'Kwok JC', 'Eisbacher M', 'Chong BH']","['Centre for Thrombosis and Vascular Research, Department of Medicine, SXt.

SREBP-1a homodimers localize diffusely in the nucleus, whereas SREBP-2 homodimers and the SREBP-1a/SREBP-2 heterodimer localize predominantly to nuclear speckles or foci, with some cells showing a diffuse pattern. We also used tethered SREBP dimers to demonstrate that both homo- and heterodimeric SREBPs activate transcription in vivo. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that the punctate foci containing SREBP-2 are electron-dense nuclear bodies, similar or identical to structures containing the promyelocyte (PML) protein. Immunofluorescence studies suggest that a dynamic interplay exists between PML, as well as another component of the PML-containing nuclear body, SUMO-1, and SREBP-2 within these nuclear structures.

These actions of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) are mediated through vitamin D receptor (VDR), which belongs to the superfamily of steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptors. Physiological and pharmacological actions of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) in various systems, along with the detection of VDR in target cells, have indicated potential therapeutic applications of VDR ligands in inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis), dermatological indications (psoriasis, actinic keratosis, seborrheic dermatitis, photoaging), osteoporosis (postmenopausal and steroid-induced osteoporosis), cancers (prostate, colon, breast, myelodysplasia, leukemia, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma), secondary hyperparathyroidism, and autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and organ transplantation). As a result, VDR ligands have been developed for the treatment of psoriasis, osteoporosis, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Furthermore, encouraging results have been obtained with VDR ligands in clinical trials of prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. This review deals with the molecular aspects of noncalcemic actions of vitamin D analogs that account for the efficacy of VDR ligands in the above-mentioned indications.","['Nagpal, Sunil', 'Na, Songqing', 'Rathnachalam, Radhakrishnan']","['Nagpal S', 'Na S', 'Rathnachalam R']","['Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, IN 46285, USA. nagpal_sunil@lilly.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Endocr Rev,Endocrine reviews,8006258,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Osteoporosis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Psoriasis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*metabolism', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2005/03/31 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/03/31 09:00'],"['2005/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['er.2004-0002 [pii]', '10.1210/er.2004-0002 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Rev. 2005 Aug;26(5):662-87. doi: 10.1210/er.2004-0002.

In this study, we sorted primary AML samples into stem cell-enriched CD34+/CD38- fractions and then analyzed the sorted and unsorted cells for the FLT3 mutant-wild-type ratio. In each case, the FLT3 mutant-wild-type ratio was not changed by selection of CD34+/CD38- cells, implying that the mutations are present in the leukemic stem cells. We used the stem cell-enriched fraction to engraft nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice and then confirmed that the FLT3/ITD mutation was present in the resultant engrafted marrow. As a final test of the importance of FLT3/ITD signaling in this engraftment model, we used a small molecule FLT3 inhibitor, CEP-701, to inhibit engraftment of FLT3/ITD stem cells.

The mechanism by which singlet oxygen damages cells is, however, not fully understood. To address this issue, we synthesized and used two types of endoperoxides, MNPE (1-methylnaphthalene-4-propionate endoperoxide) and NDPE (naphthalene-1,4-dipropionate endoperoxide), that generate defined amounts of singlet oxygen at 37 degrees C with similar half lives. MNPE, which is more hydrophobic than NDPE, induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol and exhibited cytotoxicity, but NDPE did not. RBL cells, a rat basophil leukaemia-derived line, that overexpress phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase in mitochondria were found to be highly resistant to the cytotoxic effect of MNPE. MNPE treatment induced much less DNA ladder formation and nuclear fragmentation in cells than etoposide treatment, even though these treatments induced a similar extent of cellular damage. Singlet oxygen inhibited caspase 9 and 3 activities directly and also suppressed the activation of the caspase cascade. Collectively, these data suggest that singlet oxygen triggers an apoptotic pathway by releasing cytochrome c from mitochondria via the peroxidation of mitochondrial components and results in cell death that is different from typical apoptosis, because of the abortive apoptotic pathway caused by impaired caspase activation.","['Otsu, Kaoru', 'Sato, Kazuaki', 'Ikeda, Yoshitaka', 'Imai, Hirotaka', 'Nakagawa, Yasuhito', 'Ohba, Yoshihiro', 'Fujii, Junichi']","['Otsu K', 'Sato K', 'Ikeda Y', 'Imai H', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Ohba Y', 'Fujii J']","['Department of Biomolecular Function, Graduate School of Medical Science, Yamagata University, 2-2-2 Iidanishi, Yamagata 990-9585, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"[""0 (3-(4'-methyl-1'-naphthyl)propionic acid 1',4'-endoperoxide)"", '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Naphthols)', '0 (Propionates)', '01YAE03M7J (beta Carotene)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', ""97860-59-8 (3,3'-(1,4-naphthylidene)diproprionate)"", 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)', 'R0ZB2556P8 (Tocopherols)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Lipid Peroxides/pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/enzymology/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Naphthols/pharmacology', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Selenium/metabolism', 'Singlet Oxygen/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tocopherols', 'Vitamin E/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'beta Carotene/metabolism']",2005/03/31 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/03/31 09:00'],"['2005/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20042067 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20042067 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2005 Jul 1;389(Pt 1):197-206. doi: 10.1042/BJ20042067.,,PMC1184552,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) has been shown to acetylate arylamine and contain NAT activity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not baicalein could affect N-acetylation of 2-aminofluorene (AF) in HL-60 cells. Acetylated and nonacetylated AF were determined by using high performance liquid chromatography. Baicalein displayed a dose-dependent inhibition of cytosolic and intact cells' NAT activity and reduced the number of viable cells. Time-course experiments showed that N-acetylation of AF, measured from intact HL-60 cells, was inhibited by baicalein for up to 48 h. Baicalein also decreased AF-DNA adduct formation in the examined cells.

Glycol-chitosan (G-Chi) was distributed mainly in the systemic circulation and the kidney after i.v. administration into normal mice, and retained long in the kidney. The therapeutic effect of the conjugates of mitomycin C (MMC) with G-Chi was not necessarily improved in comparison with that of the free drug, but toxic side-effects appeared to decrease with the conjugates. The conjugates of MMC with 6-O-carboxymethyl-chitin showed almost complete suppression of tumour growth at 10 mg eq. MMC/kg, though a lethal adverse effect was also observed. The conjugates of MMC with N-succinyl-chitosan showed good antitumour activities against various tumour models due to their predominant distribution into the tumour tissue and sustained-release characteristics, irrespective of water-insoluble and -soluble formulations.

In this study, we explored the biochemical influence of berberine-induced COX-2 reduction and apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KB cells were treated with berberine, and the apoptosis was measured by morphology and caspase-3 activity. The effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on berberine-mediated cell growth were also determined. The expression of COX-2, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Akt and phosphorylated Akt in berberine-treated KB cells, with or without PGE2, were assessed by Western blots. RESULTS: Berberine induced apoptosis in KB cells, and was partially reversed by incorporation of PGE2. Berberine treatment inhibited COX-2 and Mcl-1 expression dose-dependently, but not Bcl-2. PGE2 induced COX-2 and Mcl-1 expression and reversed the repressive effect of berberine on Mcl-1. In addition, PGE2 had no effect on total Akt, but slightly reversed the phosphorylated Akt, which was decreased by berberine. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that berberine-induced apoptosis might be COX-2-dependent and is related to decreased Akt phosphorylation and Mcl-1 expression.","['Kuo, Chi-Li', 'Chi, Chin-Wen', 'Liu, Tsung-Yun']","['Kuo CL', 'Chi CW', 'Liu TY']","['Institute of Pharmacology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0I8Y3P32UF (Berberine)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Berberine/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'KB Cells', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2005/03/31 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/31 09:00'],"['2005/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 2005 Jan-Feb;19(1):247-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the 6 compounds, SC-3, SC-4 and SC-5, which have one to three methoxy groups, showed higher tumor specificity and water solubility. The cytotoxic activity of SC-3 and SC-5 was slightly reduced by a lower concentration of NADH, a quinone reductase, but that of SC-3 was enhanced by higher concentrations of NADH, possibly due to demethylation of the methoxy groups. Agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated that SC-3 and SC-5 induced intemucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells and production of large DNA fragment in HSC-2 cells.

Factors significantly associated with higher incidence of cGVHD after alloPBSCT included CMV-positive donor, acute skin GVHD, and diagnoses other than lymphoma. Factors predictive for poor survival following cGVHD diagnosis included platelet count < 100,000/mm3 and history of acute liver GVHD. Acute liver GVHD and etoposide in the preparative regimen significantly increased risk of death due to cGVHD after alloPBSCT. All alloPBSCT multivariate models were fit to an independent cohort of comparable matched related donor alloBMT patients (n=75). After alloBMT, only acute skin GVHD and diagnoses other than lymphoma retained prognostic significance for predicting cGVHD. Low platelet count was the only variable predictive for poor survival in cGVHD patients after alloBMT.

We have previously shown that the expression of the BT-IgSF gene was highly restricted to brain and testis, and its transcript was detected in both neurons and glial cells. In this study, to explore its function, we generated cells overexpressing BT-IgSF proteins and analyzed their phenotypes. We found that the constitutive expression of BT-IgSF in the myeloid leukemia cell line TF-1-fms did not alter the growth rates, but caused the formation of large cell aggregates. The cell aggregates were also observed with mutant BT-IgSF lacking its cytoplasmic tail, the amino acid sequences of which were highly conserved among the BT-IgSF subgroup proteins. The neutralizing antibody to beta(1) integrin did not diminish the cell aggregate formation. These results indicate that BT-IgSF functions as a cell adhesion molecule, that its cytoplasmic tail is not essential for the function, and that beta(1) integrin is not involved in the function. We confirmed the cell adhesion function using NIH/3T3 fibroblastic cells expressing BT-IgSF in an inducible system. Flow cytometric analyses with the cells demonstrated that the cell aggregation mediated by BT-IgSF was through homophilic molecular interaction, and in a Ca(2+)/Mg(2+)-independent manner. Coupled with its restricted pattern of the expression, the cell adhesion-inducing function of BT-IgSF suggests a role of the cell surface molecule in the development/function of the central nervous system and spermatogenesis.","['Harada, Hideki', 'Suzu, Shinya', 'Hayashi, Yokichi', 'Okada, Seiji']","['Harada H', 'Suzu S', 'Hayashi Y', 'Okada S']","['Division of Hematopoiesis, Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto City, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (IGSF11 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Integrins)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*chemistry/classification/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Aggregation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*chemistry/classification/genetics/metabolism', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Mice']",2005/03/30 09:00,2005/10/07 09:00,['2005/03/30 09:00'],"['2005/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.20361 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2005 Sep;204(3):919-26. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20361.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present study was to estimate this absolute risk after CE. PROCEDURES: We report a study of 18 patients with refractory or recurrent tumors who received CE over 6 months or more between 1995 and 1997. It was administered either 3 days a week for 3/4 weeks (""3 x 3"", 14 patients) or 7 days a week for 3/4 weeks (""7 x 3"", four patients). RESULTS: Five patients developed secondary leukemia 10-25 months after the initiation of CE. All the others died of their first tumor. The cumulative incidence of leukemia at 30 months was 28% (95% CI, 10%-53%). A chromosome 11q23 rearrangement was found in 3/5 cases. All four patients who received the ""7 x 3"" CE schedule developed leukemia compared to 1/14 treated with the ""3 x 3"" CE schedule (P = 0.002).

Consistent with previous studies, we found that the major ND10 proteins PML, Sp100, and hDaxx are exchanged very rapidly between ND10 foci and the surrounding nucleoplasm in live cells. The dynamic nature of the individual protein molecule components of ND10 provides a mechanism by which ND10 proteins can be recruited to novel sites during virus infection.

Interaction between the N and C regions is believed to pull viral and target membranes together in a crucial step during membrane fusion. For several viruses with type I fusion proteins, C regions pack as alpha-helices in the grooves between N-helix monomers, and exogenously added N- and C-region peptides block fusion by inhibiting the formation of the six-helix bundle. For other viruses, including influenza virus and murine leukemia virus (MLV), there is no evidence for comparably extended C-region alpha-helices, although a short, non-alpha-helical interaction structure has been reported for influenza virus. We tested candidate N-helix and C-region peptides from MLV for their ability to inhibit cell fusion but found no inhibitory activity. In contrast, intracellular expression of the MLV N-helix inhibited fusion by efficiently blocking proteolytic processing and intracellular transport of the envelope protein. The results highlight another mechanism by which the N-helix peptides can inhibit fusion.","['Ou, Wu', 'Silver, Jonathan']","['Ou W', 'Silver J']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Building 4, Room 336, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid', 'Transfection']",2005/03/30 09:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2005/03/30 09:00'],"['2005/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/8/4782 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.8.4782-4792.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Apr;79(8):4782-92. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.8.4782-4792.2005.,,PMC1069576,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inbred mouse strains contain numerous endogenous proviruses that are potential donors of the env gene sequences of polytropic MuLVs; however, the precise identification of those proviruses that participate in recombination has been elusive. Three different structural groups of proviruses in NFS/N mice have been described and different ecotropic MuLVs preferentially recombine with different groups of proviruses. In contrast to other ecotropic MuLVs such as Friend MuLV or Akv that recombine predominantly with a single group of proviruses, Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV) recombines with at least two distinct groups. In this study, we determined that only three endogenous proviruses, two of one group and one of another group, are major participants in recombination with M-MuLV. Furthermore, the distinction between the polytropic MuLVs generated by M-MuLV and other ecotropic MuLVs is the result of recombination with a single endogenous provirus. This provirus exhibits a frameshift mutation in the 3' region of the surface glycoprotein-encoding sequences that is excluded in recombinants with M-MuLV. The sites of recombination between the env genes of M-MuLV and endogenous proviruses were confined to a short region exhibiting maximum homology between the ecotropic and polytropic env sequences and maximum stability of predicted RNA secondary structure. These observations suggest a possible mechanism for the specificity of recombination observed for different ecotropic MuLVs.","['Alamgir, A S M', 'Owens, Nick', 'Lavignon, Marc', 'Malik, Frank', 'Evans, Leonard H']","['Alamgir AS', 'Owens N', 'Lavignon M', 'Malik F', 'Evans LH']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 903 S. 4th St., Hamilton, MT 59840, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA Primers', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Thermodynamics']",2005/03/30 09:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2005/03/30 09:00'],"['2005/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['79/8/4664 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.8.4664-4671.2005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Apr;79(8):4664-71. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.8.4664-4671.2005.,,PMC1069548,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AY714500', 'GENBANK/AY714501', 'GENBANK/AY714502', 'GENBANK/AY714503', 'GENBANK/AY714504', 'GENBANK/AY714505', 'GENBANK/AY714506', 'GENBANK/AY714507', 'GENBANK/AY714508', 'GENBANK/AY714509', 'GENBANK/AY714510', 'GENBANK/AY714511', 'GENBANK/AY714512', 'GENBANK/AY714513', 'GENBANK/AY714514', 'GENBANK/AY714515', 'GENBANK/AY714516', 'GENBANK/AY714517', 'GENBANK/AY714518', 'GENBANK/AY714519', 'GENBANK/AY714520', 'GENBANK/AY714521', 'GENBANK/AY714522', 'GENBANK/AY714523', 'GENBANK/AY714524', 'GENBANK/AY714525']",,,,,,

However, the drug has been reported to be associated with adverse cutaneous drug eruptions with high frequency. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the characteristics of the cutaneous drug eruptions by STI571 were investigated. METHODS: The clinical records of 10 patients diagnosed with drug eruption by STI571 were reviewed. We obtained 10 skin biopsy specimens from patients with drug eruption by STI571, 6 from the antibiotics-induced drug eruption group, and 5 from normal skin (control). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect CD4, CD8, CD56, IL-18, IL-1beta and ICAM-1 expression in the cutaneous drug eruption. RESULTS: Seven out of 10 patients had maculopapular exanthema, 2/10 erythema multiforme, 1/10 urticaria. We analyzed the composition of T-lymphocyte subsets from the infiltrates at the STI571-induced drug eruption site in eight patients. Unlike other drug eruptions, the increase in the CD8 expression was statistically significant, especially in the dermoepidermal junction and the upper dermis (P < 0.01). The enhanced expression of IL-18 and IL-1beta was observed as well. In contrast, ICAM-1 was either weakly positive or negative. CONCLUSION: Drug eruption caused by STI571 was mostly expressed as a maculopapular exanthema. The histopathological findings were similar in drug eruption by antibiotics or STI571. Unlike the drug eruptions caused by antibiotics, where the expression of CD4 was dominant, CD8 was dominant in drug eruptions by STI571. The expression of IL-18 and IL-1beta was increased in both groups. This elevation of IL-18 and IL-1beta may assist in understanding the pathogenesis of cutaneous drug eruption.","['Park, Hyun Jeong', 'Kim, Hei Sung', 'Kim, Hee Jung', 'Lee, Jun Young', 'Cho, Baik Kee', 'Lee, Ah Won', 'Yoon, Do Young', 'Cho, Dae Ho']","['Park HJ', 'Kim HS', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee JY', 'Cho BK', 'Lee AW', 'Yoon DY', 'Cho DH']","[""Department of Dermatology, St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 62 Youido-dong, Seoul 150-713, South Korea. hjpark@catholic.ac.kr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Dermatol Sci,Journal of dermatological science,9011485,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Drug Eruptions/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Interleukin-18/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Skin/metabolism/pathology']",2005/03/30 09:00,2005/09/08 09:00,['2005/03/30 09:00'],"['2004/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2004/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-1811(04)00287-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jdermsci.2004.12.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dermatol Sci. 2005 Apr;38(1):9-15. doi: 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2004.12.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compounds 5'-azacytidine (AZC) and procainamide (PCA) belong to inhibitors of DNMT1, whose low activity correlates with increase in transcription of various genes. Using the reverse-transcription and real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) analysis, we indicated that AZC and PCA did not profoundly affect on CD3-zeta chain transcription in Jurkat T leukemia cells clone E6-1.

Small blood samples were found adequate for direct RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification followed by automated DNA sequencing. Alternatively, replication-competent viruses were recovered specifically by applying blood samples onto permissive cells; viral RNA is then extracted from tissue culture medium and similarly sequenced. Tissue samples were also used to amplify viral sequences from tumors DNA while small pieces of tumors tissues were applied onto permissive cells to isolate replicating viruses. The combined experimental approach was used to show sequence conservation using a mutant altered in the intracytoplasmic region of viral envelope glycoprotein.

Only one peak of activity was found at pH 7.0. Recently we described an inhibitory compound, C11AG which selectively suppresses nSMase activity. In dose-response assays using cellular extracts the pH 7.0 nSMase turned out to be almost 100-fold more sensitive to the inhibitor than the pH 8.0 nSMase. In Jurkat T-cell lymphoma cells lacking the pH 8.0 nSMase, treatment with C11AG enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis: the concentration of CD95-specific antibody anti-APO1 could be lowered by six-fold in order to induce cell death. Concomitantly the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein A1 was found to be down-regulated. In the joints of arthritic mice, apoptosis of T-cells was stimulated after application of C11AG.

This is a complex issue in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) as it is a disorder characterized by plasma cell differentiation and therefore target antigen expression may differ between the B-cell and plasma cell compartments of the disease. In order to assess this in the context of alemtuzumab therapy, the authors used multiparameter flow cytometry to determine CD52 expression in the B-cells and plasma cells of patients with WM. CD52 expression was demonstrable in the B-cells of all cases, with a median of 99% of cells (range, 81%-100%) expressing the antigen compared with the isotype control (n = 47). Antigen density was very similar to that seen in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (median mean fluorescence intensity [MFI], 1249; range, 175-3170). Antigen expression was, however, significantly lower in the plasma cells (median MFI, 235; range, 31-1814) in all but 1 of the cases assessed (n = 21). The clinical significance of this was assessed by examining serial bone marrow samples from patients receiving alemtuzumab as part of an ongoing clinical trial. In 4 of 5 patients, alemtuzumab therapy successfully eradicated clonal B-cells from the bone marrow, but residual plasma cells remained evident in 2 of these patients.

We studied 19 patients with type I cryoglobulinemias, 56 patients with type II cryoglobulinemias, 5 patients with peripheral neuropathies (PNs), and 3 patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpuras. Fourteen patients with cryoglobulinemias presented with mild to moderate hepatomegaly with or without splenomegaly. Fourteen patients with type II cryoglobulinemias had arthralgias and/or vascular purpura (12 receiving corticosteroids), and 7 presented with PN. These latter patients and those with PNs without cryoglobulinemia were treated with steroids, cyclophosphamide, or polychemotherapy with/without plasma-exchange. Cumulative probability of evolution to MLD at 5 years was 15% (95% CI; 5%-25%). At a median of 62 months (12-195 months), 8 cases of IgM-RDs (8.4%) evolved to overt Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (n = 6), 1 case to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 1 case to B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. At univariate analysis, male sex (P = 0.02), IgM level > or = 3 g/dL (P < 0.0001), detectable Bence Jones proteinuria (P = 0.0005), lymphocytosis (P = 0.049), and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P = 0.003) significantly correlated with the evolution risk. Age, blood cell counts, b2-microglobulin level, degree of marrow lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, type of cryoglobulinemia, and hepatitis C virus positivity did not correlate with transformation. Although IgM-RDs represent a distinct clinical entity frequently requiring treatment in view of the IgM-related symptoms, their evolution probability and prognostic factors for malignant transformation seem to widely overlap those described for asymptomatic IgM monoclonal gammopathies.","['Cesana, Clara', 'Barbarano, Luciana', 'Miqueleiz, Sara', 'Lucchesini, Camilla', 'Ricci, Francesca', 'Varettoni, Marzia', 'Filippini, Davide', 'Lazzarino, Mario', 'Morra, Enrica']","['Cesana C', 'Barbarano L', 'Miqueleiz S', 'Lucchesini C', 'Ricci F', 'Varettoni M', 'Filippini D', 'Lazzarino M', 'Morra E']","[""Department of Hematology, Niguarda Ca'Granda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20162 Milan, Italy. clara.cesana@aovimercate.org""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Lymphoma,Clinical lymphoma,100898741,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Sedimentation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cryoglobulinemia/complications/*pathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/complications/*pathology/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/etiology/pathology']",2005/03/30 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/03/30 09:00'],"['2005/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1526-9655(11)70095-1 [pii]', '10.3816/clm.2005.n.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma. 2005 Mar;5(4):261-4. doi: 10.3816/clm.2005.n.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differential diagnosis from other B-cell disorders (BCDs) is usually easy based on clinical, morphologic, histopathologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features. However, all BCDs potentially produce monoclonal IgM. In this study we reviewed the medical files of 130 patients with IgM-secreting BCDs. Eighty-four patients were diagnosed with WM, 5 with IgM-monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and 41 with other BCDs (9 with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 5 with small lymphocytic lymphoma, 14 with marginal zone lymphoma, 5 with mantle-cell lymphoma, 2 with follicular lymphoma, 2 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 2 with cryoglobulinemia, and 2 with low-grade lymphoma not otherwise specified). Median IgM levels were 3215 mg/dL in WM, 840 mg/dL in IgM-MGUS, and 285 mg/dL in other BCDs (5 had IgM levels > 1500 mg/dL). In 10% of non-WM BCDs, monoclonal IgM was found only when more sensitive immunofixation methods were used. Forty-four percent of patients with BCDs (splenic marginal zone lymphoma or small lymphocytic lymphoma) had diagnoses that corresponded to that of WM. Careful diagnosis requires the concomitant evaluation of all parameters of BCDs together. Marginal zone lymphoma is the most frequently overlapping entity. Special attention should be given to mantle cell lymphoma in its atypical forms. Research in this field should continue to further clarify the disease entities that overlap with WM. New technology such as gene-expression profile techniques may contribute to this purpose.","['Pangalis, Gerassimos A', 'Kyrtsonis, Maria-Christina', 'Kontopidou, Flora N', 'Siakantaris, Marina P', 'Dimopoulou, Maria N', 'Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros P', 'Tzenou, Tatiana', 'Kokoris, Styliani', 'Dimitriadou, Evangelia', 'Kalpadakis, Christina', 'Tsalimalma, Kaliroe', 'Tsaftaridis, Panagiotis', 'Panayiotidis, Panagiotis', 'Angelopoulou, Maria K']","['Pangalis GA', 'Kyrtsonis MC', 'Kontopidou FN', 'Siakantaris MP', 'Dimopoulou MN', 'Vassilakopoulos TP', 'Tzenou T', 'Kokoris S', 'Dimitriadou E', 'Kalpadakis C', 'Tsalimalma K', 'Tsaftaridis P', 'Panayiotidis P', 'Angelopoulou MK']","['First Department of Internal Medicine and Department of Hematology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, 16 Sevastoupoleos Street, Athens 11526, Greece. pangalis@med.uoa.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Lymphoma,Clinical lymphoma,100898741,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*diagnosis/immunology']",2005/03/30 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/03/30 09:00'],"['2005/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1526-9655(11)70089-6 [pii]', '10.3816/clm.2005.n.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma. 2005 Mar;5(4):235-40. doi: 10.3816/clm.2005.n.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some authors consider it a rare distinct lymphoproliferative disorder with primary bone marrow infiltration and IgM monoclonal gammopathy. As LPL shares important morphologic and immunophenotypic overlaps with marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZLs) in cases showing plasmacytic maturation, it remains unclear if they constitute unique or distinct entities. Both diseases are composed of lymphocytes, lymphoplasmacytoid cells, and tumoral plasma cells with a surface (s) IgM-positive sIgD+/ cytoplasmic IgMpositive CD19+ CD20+ CD27+/ CD5 CD10 CD23 phenotype, without a specific marker. Extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, nodal MZL (NMZL), and splenic MZL (SMZL) are distinct entities displaying common morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic characteristics. MALT lymphoma is clearly distinct from LPL, although bone marrow infiltration and IgM paraprotein are not rare. Splenic MZL and NMZL are incompletely characterized, but a plasmacytoid/plasmacytic differentiation, autoimmune manifestations, and monoclonal component are frequent in both diseases. Bone marrow involvement is constant in SMZL and present in 60% of NMZLs. Molecular IgVH gene analysis has confirmed this heterogeneity, particularly within SMZL, with mutated and unmutated cases. Further studies are needed to clarify the pathogenesis of these MZLs and their relationship with LPL.","['Berger, Francoise', 'Traverse-Glehen, Alexandra', 'Felman, Pascale', 'Callet-Bauchu, Evelyne', 'Baseggio, Lucille', 'Gazzo, Sophie', 'Thieblemont, Catherine', 'Ffrench, Martine', 'Magaud, Jean Pierre', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Coiffer, Bertrand']","['Berger F', 'Traverse-Glehen A', 'Felman P', 'Callet-Bauchu E', 'Baseggio L', 'Gazzo S', 'Thieblemont C', 'Ffrench M', 'Magaud JP', 'Salles G', 'Coiffer B']","[""Pathology Service, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Equipe d'Accueil 3737, Pathologie des Cellules Lymphoides, Universite Claude Bernard, Lyon, France. francoise.berger@chu-lyon.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Lymphoma,Clinical lymphoma,100898741,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Trisomy', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*classification/genetics/*immunology/pathology']",2005/03/30 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/03/30 09:00'],"['2005/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1526-9655(11)70086-0 [pii]', '10.3816/clm.2005.n.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma. 2005 Mar;5(4):220-4. doi: 10.3816/clm.2005.n.003.,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting abnormal cell signalling pathways should provide a more selective approach to cancer treatment than conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Tyrosine kinases play an essential role in the signalling pathways involved in the control of cellular proliferation and growth. Imatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the ABL fusion gene, platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) and KIT. This agent has demonstrated considerable activity in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) by inhibiting the BCR-ABL fusion protein and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), which are predominantly driven by activating mutations in KIT. A number of other rare conditions are also responsive, for example, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, which is driven by a chromosomal translocation involving PDGF-B and Col1A1, resulting in overexpression of PDGF-B, and hypereosinophillic syndrome, which can be caused by activating PDGFR mutations. The pivotal registration study for newly diagnosed CML was a large randomised trial comparing 400 mg/day of imatinib to a combination of IFN-alpha and cytarabine, which demonstrated a significantly higher complete haematological and cytogenetic response rate in the imatinib arm. In the case of GIST a randomised study in patients with inoperable or metastatic disease explored doses of 400 - 600mg and reported a response rate of > 50% in each arm plus disease stabilisation and an improvement in performance status. Large randomised trials have subsequently been performed, comparing 400 with 800mg/day. The first to report indicates that the larger dose is associated with improved progression-free survival, although it is not yet known whether or not this will translate into a difference in overall survival. The most common KIT mutation involves exon 11 and is associated with a statistically significant better response and prognosis compared with other mutations or no detectable mutations. Mutational analysis is likely to become increasingly important in the selection of patients for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment and in helping to understand the nature of acquired resistance.","['Jones, Robin L', 'Judson, Ian R']","['Jones RL', 'Judson IR']","['The Royal Marsden Hospital, Sarcoma Unit, Fulham Road, London, SW3 6JJ, UK.

Of these cytokines, OSM is closely related structually, genetically and functionally to leukemia inhibitory factor. However, OSM-specific biological activities have been reported in hematopoiesis and liver development. Recently, we have demonstrated OSM-specific activities in the nervous systems. In the adult central nervous system (CNS), OSM receptor (OSMR) beta was observed in meningeal cells of pia mater, epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and olfactory astrocyte-like glia surrounding the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. In the CNS of neonatal mice, OSMRbeta was also expressed in the ventral subnucleus of the hypoglossal nucleus, but disappeared at post-natal day (P) 14. In contrast with the CNS, OSMRbeta was strongly expressed in small-sized non-peptidergic neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia (TG). Interestingly, all OSMRbeta-positive neurons in these ganglia also expressed both TRPV1 (a vanilloid receptor) and P2X3 (a purinergic receptor). In OSM-deficient mice, TRPV1/P2X3/OSMRbeta triple-positive neurons were significantly decreased. Consistent with such histological findings, OSM-deficient mice exhibited a reduction in responses to various stimuli, including mechanical and thermal stimuli. These findings suggest an important role for OSM in the development of a subset of nociceptive neurons.","['Morikawa, Yoshihiro']",['Morikawa Y'],"['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan. yoshim@wakayama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Anat Sci Int,Anatomical science international,101154140,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Central Nervous System/*embryology/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nociceptors/embryology/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', '*Organogenesis', 'Peptides/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment']",2005/03/30 09:00,2005/04/15 09:00,['2005/03/30 09:00'],"['2005/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1447-073x.2005.00100.x [doi]'],ppublish,Anat Sci Int. 2005 Mar;80(1):53-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1447-073x.2005.00100.x.,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation of stem cells into these three types of neural cells is directed, in part, by cell-external cues, such as cytokines. We have examined the effects of astrocyte-inducing cytokines, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2 on mouse telencephalic neuroepithelial cells. We found that simultaneous treatment of neuroepithelial cells with LIF and BMP2 synergistically induced astrocytic differentiation. The synergistic effect of the two cytokines is brought about by a complex formation composed of downstream transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and Smad1, together with the transcriptional coactivator p300. Recent studies also clarified molecular interactions involving basic helix-loop-helix-type transcription factors that promote differentiation of neuronal or oligodendrocytic cell lineages. For instance, in fetal brain, it has been shown that the neurogenic transcription factor Neurogenin1 inhibits formation of a STAT3/p300/ Smad1 complex and that the oligodendrocytic transcription factor OLIG2 does the same. This suggests the presence of mutual negative interaction among the signaling pathways regulating the three neural cell lineages. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the developmental stage-dependent epigenetic regulation of cell type-specific gene promoters. DNA methylation, histone acetylation and modified-DNA binding proteins are thought to be involved in this process. In the present review, we discuss the cross-talk between transcription factors downstream of the cytokine-signaling pathways and their effects on cell fate determination. We also emphasize the importance of epigenetic modification of lineage-specific gene promoters and chromatin structure in transcription factor-mediated cell fate regulation.","['Fukuda, Shinji', 'Taga, Tetsuya']","['Fukuda S', 'Taga T']","['Department of Cell Fate Modulation, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics and Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Anat Sci Int,Anatomical science international,101154140,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Embryonic Induction', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epithelial Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Organogenesis', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Telencephalon/*cytology/embryology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",2005/03/30 09:00,2005/04/15 09:00,['2005/03/30 09:00'],"['2005/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1447-073x.2005.00097.x [doi]'],ppublish,Anat Sci Int. 2005 Mar;80(1):12-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1447-073x.2005.00097.x.,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with leukemia received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell grafts from HLA-matched or partially matched, but sex-mismatched donors. Chimeric status and MRD were detected by dual-color interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) using X/Y sex chromosome centromere DNA probe and bcr/abl dual fusion DNA probe, respectively, at different time points after transplantation. SPSS software was used to analyse the correlation between chimeric status, MRD and relapse. RESULTS: In comparison with karyotype analysis, I-FISH was of higher sensitivity in detecting sex chromosome and bcr/abl fusion gene. Chimeric status was negatively correlated with MRD (r=-0.9690, P<0.01). In the early times of transplantation (within 3 months), mixed chimerism had higher relapse rate than did complete chimerism. Chimeric status and MRD were correlated with leukemic relapse (r=-8240, P<0.01; r=-0.9040, P<0.01). The decrease in chimeric status occurred before leukemic relapse in hematology. CONCLUSION: I-FISH is a more specific and sensitive test for monitoring MRD after transplantation. The clinical value of sex chromosome is identical to that of the special tumor gene for monitoring MRD after transplantation. Chimeric status is negatively correlated with MRD. Chimeric status and MRD are associated with leukemic relapse. The decrease in chimeric status is considered a mark of leukemic relapse after transplantation.","['Liu, Qifa', 'Song, Lanlin', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Wei, Yongqiang', 'Xu, Dan', 'Sun, Jing', 'Liu, Xiaoli', 'Xu, Bing', 'Meng, Fanyi', 'Zhou, Shuyun']","['Liu Q', 'Song L', 'Zhang Y', 'Wei Y', 'Xu D', 'Sun J', 'Liu X', 'Xu B', 'Meng F', 'Zhou S']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, First Military Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong,510515 P.

METHODS: The subtracted HL-60/VCR cDNA library was generated through the suppression subtractive hybridization using the wild HL-60 cells' cDNA as target and HL-60/ ATRA cells' as driver. A novel expression sequence tag (EST) sequence, which differentially expressed in HL-60/ ATRA cell, was screened by cDNA chip. Then a novel human gene, HV126 was assembled by the EST assembly tools. Bioinformatical databases and softwares were used to analyze and predict its function. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of HV-126 gene in leukemia cells before and after chemotherapy. RESULTS: The full open reading frames (ORFs) of the novel EST assembled by overlapping dbEST sequences included a 1991 bp nucleic sequence, which was named HV126. The deduced amino acid sequence consisted of 365 amino acids. The sequence of the novel gene exhibited 43% homology to a known gene, which is a possible member of the death domain-flood family implicated in apoptosis and inflammation. The expression of HV126 was proved to be related to the drug sensitivity in leukemia cells by RT-PCR.

EBI3 is expressed at high levels in EBV-transformed B-cell lines and is induced in vitro by the EBV oncogene LMP1 in a nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent manner. We show here that EBI3 expression is up-regulated in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected cell lines and IL-2-dependent leukemic cells from adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) patients, compared to normal activated T cells. EBI3 expression was decreased in HTLV-1-transformed cells after treatment with the NF-kappaB inhibitor BAY11-7082 and was induced in Jurkat cells by expression of HTLV-1 wild-type Tax oncoprotein, but not by the Tax mutant M22, which is defective for NF-kappaB activation. In situ analysis of EBI3 and p28 expression in Hodgkin's lymphomas (HLs), in various EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) (including post-transplant LPDs and nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphomas), and in ATL showed that EBI3 was expressed by neoplastic cells in all cases of HL and of LMP1-positive EBV-associated LPD, at variable levels in ATL cases, but rarely in control T-cell lymphomas. In contrast, in all lymphomas tested, no or few tumoral cells expressed p28. Consistent with these data, no significant p28 or IL-27 expression was detected in HL-derived cell lines, or in EBV- or HTLV-1-transformed cell lines. This selective overexpression of EBI3 by transformed cells suggests that EBI3 may play a role, independently from its association to p28, in regulating anti-viral or anti-tumoral immune responses.","['Larousserie, Frederique', 'Bardel, Emilie', 'Pflanz, Stefan', 'Arnulf, Bertrand', 'Lome-Maldonado, Carmen', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Bregeaud, Laurence', 'Perennec, Monique', 'Brousse, Nicole', 'Kastelein, Rob', 'Devergne, Odile']","['Larousserie F', 'Bardel E', 'Pflanz S', 'Arnulf B', 'Lome-Maldonado C', 'Hermine O', 'Bregeaud L', 'Perennec M', 'Brousse N', 'Kastelein R', 'Devergne O']","['CNRS UMR 8147, Universite Paris V, Institut Federatif de Recherche Necker, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (MYDGF protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Deltaretrovirus/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interleukins/*biosynthesis', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/*virology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*metabolism']",2005/03/29 09:00,2005/05/18 09:00,['2005/03/29 09:00'],"['2005/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)62340-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62340-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2005 Apr;166(4):1217-28. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62340-1.,,PMC1602381,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comparison of the promoter sequences of the human, rat, and mouse renin genes has revealed a highly conserved sequence homologous to the DNA recognition sequence for CBF1 (CSL/RBP-Jkappa/Su(H)/LAG1/RBPSUH). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays document that As4.1 cell nuclear protein complex binding to the putative rat renin CBF1-binding site (-175 to -168 bp) contains CBF1. Transient transfection analyses in COS-7 cells further document that a CBF1-VP16 fusion protein and the intracellular domain of Notch1 robustly activate a promoter containing multiple copies of the rat renin CBF1-binding site. An Ets-binding site (-143 to -138 bp) has also been identified in the rat renin promoter by sequence comparisons and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Transcription factor Ets-1 is capable of activating the rat renin promoter through the Ets-binding site. Mutation of the CBF-binding site significantly increases transcriptional activity of the rat renin promoter in Calu-6 and COS-7 cells but not in As4.1 cells, whereas mutation of the Ets-binding site reduces promoter activity of the rat renin gene in all three cell lines. Finally, we show that the intracellular domain of Notch1, Ets-1, and HOXD10.PBX1b.PREP1 activate the rat renin promoter cooperatively in COS-7 cells.

In this report, we investigated the effect of helenalin on cellular differentiation in the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell culture system. Helenalin by itself markedly induced HL-60 cell differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner. Cytofluorometric analysis and cell morphologic studies indicated that helenalin induced cell differentiation predominantly into granulocytes. Protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitors significantly inhibited HL-60 cell differentiation induced by helenalin, while p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors did not. Moreover, helenalin enhanced PKC activity and protein level of PKC beta I and PKC beta II isoforms, and also increased the level of pERK in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the enhanced levels of cell differentiation closely correlated with the decreased levels of NF-kappa B binding activity by helenalin.

A better understanding of this symbiotic relationship will provide novel approaches and interventions for realizing anti-implantation strategies for effective fertility regulation and reproductive health care management. We have been using the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) as a nonhuman primate model to this end. In the present study, the process of progesterone-mediated regulation of endometrial receptivity for blastocyst implantation has been targeted by the use of mifepristone as an emergency contraceptive agent. Furthermore, based on cell-specific, temporal and spatial distribution of vasotropic cytokines and mediators in the ""receptive"" and periimplantation periods, the pregnancy interceptive potentials of (a) monoclonal antibody (MAb) to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF); (b) inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase [e.g., N6-nitro-l-arginine (l-NAME) and aminoguanidine]; and (c) MAb to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were examined. LIF is a progesterone-responsive pleiotropic cytokine that functions as a proinflammatory cytokine, together with interleukins 1 and 6, during the process of implantation-placentation in primates, and its immunoneutralization with MAb resulted in inhibition (p<.04) of pregnancy establishment in the rhesus monkey. However, timed administration of l-NAME or aminoguanidine failed to inhibit blastocyst implantation in a significant manner. Also, no synergistic antinidatory action of antiprogestin combined with l-NAME was detected in the rhesus monkey. The application of MAb to VEGF during the periimplantation period, on the other hand, led to significant (p<.04) prevention of pregnancy without influencing steroid hormone levels in the circulation. Our data lend support to the hypothesis that VEGF is essential for pregnancy establishment and that trophoblast-derived VEGF, acting via its specific receptors Flt-1 and KDR, is necessary for blastocyst implantation. The use of cDNA-based expression arrays followed by differential display analysis has provided preliminary understanding of the nature of gene cluster networks operative in the receptive endometrium of potential conception cycles in the rhesus monkey. This knowledge may, in the future, lead to further innovative anti-implantation strategies for targeted pregnancy interception.","['Ghosh, Debabrata', 'Sengupta, Jayasree']","['Ghosh D', 'Sengupta J']","['Department of Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 110029, India. dghosh@aiims.ac.in']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Contraception,Contraception,0234361,"['0 (Contraceptives, Postcoital, Synthetic)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Contraception', 'Contraceptives, Postcoital, Synthetic/pharmacology', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Female', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'Models, Animal', 'Pregnancy']",2005/03/29 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/03/29 09:00'],"['2004/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0010-7824(05)00021-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.contraception.2004.12.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Contraception. 2005 Apr;71(4):294-301. doi: 10.1016/j.contraception.2004.12.009.,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: The study area was characterized by examining the spatial distribution of waste disposal sites and toxic waste dumping grounds, using a geographic information system (GIS). Mortality (1986-2000) was studied in the three municipalities of Giugliano in Campania, Qualiano and Villaricca, encompassing a population of about 150,000 inhabitants. Mortality rates of the population resident in the Campania region were used in order to generate expected figures. OUTCOMES: Causes of death of a priori interest where those previously associated to residence in the neighbourhood of (toxic) waste sites, including lung cancer, bladder cancer, leukemia and liver cancer. RESULTS: Overall 39 waste sites, 27 of which characterized by the likely presence of toxic wastes, were identified in the area of interest. A good agreement was found between two independent surveys of the Regional Environmental Protection Agency and of the environmentalist association Legambiente. Cancer mortality was significantly increased, with special reference to malignant neoplasm of lung, pleura, larynx, bladder, liver and brain. Circulatory diseases were also significantly in excess and diabetes showed some increases. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality statistics provide preliminary evidence of the disease load in the area. Mapping waste dumping grounds provides information for defining high risk areas.

Phase III clinical trials in the treatment of patients with previously untreated AML and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) are ongoing in Japan (JALSG AML 201, APL 204). And continuous efforts are being made to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy. We discussed six topics in the treatment of AML. (1) To determine whether adding the MDR-1 modulator to chemotherapy provided clinical benefits to patients with AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a phase III randomized study was performed using PSC 833. CR rates and overall survival (OS) were not improved by using PSC 833 compared to chemotherapy alone. (2) A large randomized study selectively focused on the G-CSF priming was performed. Among patients in this study attaining CR, the probability of relapse was reduced when they had been assigned to treatment with G-CSF along with induction chemotherapy. The benefit of chemotherapy-sensitization by G-CSF was particularly evident among the intermediate-risk. (3) Fludarabine in addition to Ara-C increases the accumulation of Ara-CTP, which is responsible for the cytotoxic effect in leukemic blasts. In a randomized phase III trial, patients with high-risk MDS or patients with AML were randomized to receive 2 induction courses consisting of Ara-C and G-CSF during and after chemotherapy with or without fludarabine (FLAG versus AG). Although Ara-CTP accumulation in leukemic cells after FLAG was enhanced, the clinical outcome in terms of CR rate, OS, event-free survival, and disease-free survival was not significantly improved by combining fludarabine with Ara-C. (4) Calicheamicin-conjugated humanized anti-CD 33 mouse monoclonal antibody, mylotarg, has recently been introduced. In combined phase II studies of 277 patients with CD 33-positive AML in their first relapse, the overall response rate was 26%. (5) Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been established as a highly effective therapy for patients with APL, even for those with disease refractory to ATRA. ATO was recently approved in Japan.

RESULTS: After a 12-month baseline period of levofloxacin prophylaxis, a period of discontinuation of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was planned but was stopped prematurely after 9 neutropenic episodes over 3 weeks, because the mortality rate (33.3%) was higher than that with routine fluoroquinolone prophylaxis (2.9%) (odds ratio [OR], 16.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-77.2). Fewer patients had gram-negative bacteremia during the baseline period (4.8%; n=15) than during the discontinuation period (44.4%; n=4) (OR, 16.9; 95% CI, 4.1-70.0). After levofloxacin therapy was reintroduced, the incidence of gram-negative bacteremia and the mortality rate were comparable to those during the first period. Escherichia coli isolated during the discontinuation period was susceptible to levofloxacin in vitro, whereas all E. coli isolates isolated during both prophylaxis periods were resistant. Bloodstream infections were caused by a single agent when the patient had received levofloxacin prophylaxis, whereas most cases of gram-negative bacteremia were polymicrobial after discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that, despite increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance, levofloxacin prophylaxis during neutropenia may have a beneficial impact on morbidity and infection-related mortality. Continued monitoring of the rate of gram-negative bacteremia is warranted for timely detection of the loss of efficacy of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis.","['Reuter, Stefan', 'Kern, Winfried V', 'Sigge, Anja', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Marre, Reinhard', 'Kern, Peter', 'von Baum, Heike']","['Reuter S', 'Kern WV', 'Sigge A', 'Dohner H', 'Marre R', 'Kern P', 'von Baum H']","['Section of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Germany. stefan.reuter@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6GNT3Y5LMF (Levofloxacin)', 'A4P49JAZ9H (Ofloxacin)']",IM,"['Amyloidosis/complications', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Bacterial Infections/*mortality/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', '*Levofloxacin', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Ofloxacin/*therapeutic use']",2005/03/26 09:00,2006/10/07 09:00,['2005/03/26 09:00'],"['2004/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['CID34757 [pii]', '10.1086/428732 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2005 Apr 15;40(8):1087-93. doi: 10.1086/428732.

METHODS: In vitro proliferation assays, and in vivo model studies in metastatic pancreatic carcinoma and subcutaneous xenograft melanoma and small-cell lung carcinoma models. RESULTS: 17-DMAG emerged from screening studies as a potent geldanamycin analog, with the average concentration inhibiting the growth of the NCI anticancer cell line drug screen by 50% being 0.053 microM. ""Head to head"" comparison with 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG, NSC 330507) revealed 17-DMAG to possess potent activity against certain cell types, e.g., MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma and HL60-TB leukemia which were relatively insensitive to 17-AAG. Evidence of oral bioavailability of 17-DMAG in a saline-based formulation prompted more detailed examination of its antitumor efficacy in vivo. 17-DMAG inhibited the growth of the AsPC-1 pancreatic carcinoma xenografts growing as intrahepatic metastases at doses of 6.7-10 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days administered orally under conditions where 17-AAG was without activity. 17-DMAG in an aqueous vehicle at 7.5-15 mg/kg per day for 3 days on days 1-3, 8-10 and 13-17, or 1-5 and 8-12 showed evidence of antitumor activity by the parenteral and oral routes in the MEXF 276 and MEXF 989 melanomas and by the parenteral route in the LXFA 629 and LXFS 650 adenocarcinoma and small-cell carcinoma models. The latter activity was comparable to the historical activity of 17-AAG.

Adoptive transfer using tumor-specific Th1 and Tc1 cells is a promising therapeutic strategy for tumor immunotherapy. However, its clinical application has been hampered because of difficulties in generating tumor-specific Th1 cells from patients with tumors. To overcome this problem, we have developed an efficient method to prepare tumor-specific Th1 and Tc1 cells. T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta genes obtained from an HLA-A24-restricted, Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) peptide-specific Tc clone were lentivirally transduced to polyclonally activated Th1 and Tc1 cells. As expected, TCR gene-modified Tc1 cells showed cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production in response to peptide-loaded lymphoblastoid cell lines, WT1 gene-transduced cells, and freshly isolated leukemia cells expressing both WT1 and HLA-A24. Surprisingly, we further demonstrated that Th1 cells transduced with HLA-class I-restricted TCR genes also showed both cytotoxicity and cytokine production in an HLA-A24-restricted manner. In contrast to gene-modified Tc1 cells, Th1 cells produced high amounts of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in addition to IFN-gamma, which is beneficial for induction of antitumor cellular immunity. Thus, TCR gene-modified HLA-class I-restricted Th1 and Tc1 cells are a powerful strategy for the application to adoptive immunotherapy of human cancer.","['Tsuji, Takemasa', 'Yasukawa, Masaki', 'Matsuzaki, Junko', 'Ohkuri, Takayuki', 'Chamoto, Kenji', 'Wakita, Daiko', 'Azuma, Taichi', 'Niiya, Hironari', 'Miyoshi, Hiroyuki', 'Kuzushima, Kiyotaka', 'Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Sugiyama, Haruo', 'Ikeda, Hiroaki', 'Nishimura, Takashi']","['Tsuji T', 'Yasukawa M', 'Matsuzaki J', 'Ohkuri T', 'Chamoto K', 'Wakita D', 'Azuma T', 'Niiya H', 'Miyoshi H', 'Kuzushima K', 'Oka Y', 'Sugiyama H', 'Ikeda H', 'Nishimura T']","['Division of Immunoregulation, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0815, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A24 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'HLA-A Antigens/*metabolism', 'HLA-A24 Antigen', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/immunology']",2005/03/26 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/03/26 09:00'],"['2005/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53268-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3663 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 15;106(2):470-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3663.

We examined the effects of IFNs or imatinib mesylate on signaling pathways regulating initiation of mRNA translation in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. Treatment of IFN-sensitive KT-1 cells with IFNalpha resulted in phosphorylation/activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and downstream activation of p70 S6 kinase. The IFN-activated p70 S6 kinase was found to regulate phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein, which regulates translation of mRNAs with oligopyrimidine tracts in the 5'-untranslated region. In addition, IFNalpha treatment resulted in an mTOR- and/or phosphatidyl-inositol 3'(PI 3') kinase-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 repressor of mRNA translation on sites that are required for its deactivation and dissociation from the eukaryotic initiation factor-4E (eIF4E) complex. In contrast to the effects of IFNs, imatinib mesylate suppressed p70 S6 kinase activity, consistent with inhibition of BCR-ABL-mediated activation of the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway. Moreover, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin enhanced the suppressive effects of imatinib mesylate on primary leukemic granulocyte macrophage-colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Taken altogether, our data demonstrate that IFNs and imatinib mesylate differentially regulate PI 3' kinase/mTOR-dependent signaling cascades in BCR-ABL-transformed cells, consistent with distinct effects of these agents on pathways regulating mRNA translation. They also support the concept that combined use of imatinib mesylate with mTOR inhibitors may be an appropriate future therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CML.","['Parmar, Simrit', 'Smith, Jessica', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Uddin, Shahab', 'Katsoulidis, Efstratios', 'Majchrzak, Beata', 'Kambhampati, Suman', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Fish, Eleanor N', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Parmar S', 'Smith J', 'Sassano A', 'Uddin S', 'Katsoulidis E', 'Majchrzak B', 'Kambhampati S', 'Eklund EA', 'Tallman MS', 'Fish EN', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

CD36 is commonly expressed on blasts in acute monocytic leukemia, megakaryoblastic leukemia, and erythroleukemia. The role of CD36 in sickle cell crises and cerebral malaria is debatable. As a receptor for thrombospondin 1, CD36 plays a role in the regulation of angiogenesis, which may be a therapeutic strategy for controlling the dissemination of malignant neoplasms. The future challenge will be to further understand the mechanisms by which CD36 affects these diverse functions and to design therapeutic strategies that can alter the course of the diseases.","['Ge, Yimin', 'Elghetany, M Tarek']","['Ge Y', 'Elghetany MT']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Lab Hematol,Laboratory hematology : official publication of the International Society for Laboratory Hematology,9615688,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'CD36 Antigens/genetics/*physiology', 'Ethnicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Malaria/blood/immunology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic']",2005/03/26 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/03/26 09:00'],"['2005/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['TJKFUWTYLNY137E6 [pii]', '10.1532/LH96.04056 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Hematol. 2005;11(1):31-7. doi: 10.1532/LH96.04056.,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, Southern blot hybridization (SBH) and polymerase chain reaction analyses for antigen receptor genes and the retrovirus of HTLV-1 provide a diagnostic hallmark for the clonality of leukemic cells and the causative agent of the disease. We report here a case of an ATL cell line, designated as SO4 cells, established from primary ATL cells presenting with an irrational genetic abnormality of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH)-rearranged band in spite of harboring a clonally rearranged T-cell receptor gene and a clonally integrated provirus of HTLV-1 within their genomic DNA. Moreover, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using the IgH (14q32) dual-color break-apart probe revealed 3 pair-signals of colocalizing red and green spots, implying 2 intact and 1 amplified 14q32 regions without translocation, where the region contains the IgH gene locus. Although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, some alteration of a portion of the amplified 14q32 region seems to have a role in the false-positive band pattern in the SBH. The SO4 cells, in the hematology laboratory, will provide a lesson about the pitfalls of genetic tests for mature T-cell neoplasms and contribute to the genetic elucidation of leukomogenesis as an in vitro model.","['Uemura, Akiko', 'Sugahara, Kazuyuki', 'Nagai, Hiroshi', 'Murata, Kenn', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Hirakata, Yoichi', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Uemura A', 'Sugahara K', 'Nagai H', 'Murata K', 'Hasegawa H', 'Hirakata Y', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Hematol,Laboratory hematology : official publication of the International Society for Laboratory Hematology,9615688,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Southern/methods', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2005/03/26 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/03/26 09:00'],"['2005/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['WTW3FW343GMK1K2W [pii]', '10.1532/LH96.04061 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Hematol. 2005;11(1):8-13. doi: 10.1532/LH96.04061.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients entering this trial received paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2), 1 h IV infusion, day 1; carboplatin AUC 6.0 IV, day 1; etoposide 50 mg alternating with 100 mg orally, days 1-10. Patients received 6 courses of treatment, administered at 21-day intervals. All patients were assigned a response category using clinical restaging criteria. The primary endpoints for this trial were progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Between October 1996 and April 2001, 52 patients were treated. The overall objective response rate for the 48 evaluable patients was 75%, with 46% complete responses. Amongst the 36 patients with suboptimal disease, median progression-free and overall survivals were 12 and 24 months, respectively. After a median follow-up of 64 months, the median progression-free and overall survival has not been reached for the optimal patients; 5-year progression-free survival is 57% for this group. Treatment-related myelosuppression was common, but myelosuppression-related complications were uncommon, as was grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity. No episodes of acute myelogenous leukemia have developed. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and oral etoposide was feasible and effective in this patient population.

Detailed medical history, physical examination, non-invasive laboratory tests, and radiologic examinations compose the first level in the diagnostic approach to the FUO. When a diagnosis cannot be established with these procedures, some invasive diagnostic techniques and finally exploratory laparotomy are performed. Although advanced diagnostic measures and imaging-guided less invasive procedures have decreased the need, laparotomy remains as a final diagnostic method for FUO cases. In this study we evaluate the role and importance of laparotomy in the diagnosis of our FUO cases. In 17 out of 126 patients (8 male, 9 female, the median age 35.8 years) hospitalized in our clinic between 1982 and 2002 with the diagnosis of FUO, the diagnosis was established by laparotomy. The diagnosis was made directly in 13 patients, and indirectly (by excluding other diseases) in 2 patients. In several FUO series, the contribution of laparotomy to the diagnosis of FUO was reported as 27-100%. This rate was found to be 88% in the present study. During laparotomy on 17 cases, tissue samples were taken from spleen, liver, intra-abdominal and mesenteric lymph nodes. Pathologic examination of these tissue samples revealed miliary tuberculosis in 4; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 3; Hodgkin's lymphoma in 3; liver tumour in 1; hairy cell leukemia in 1; peritonitis carcinomatosis in 1. In the patients with miliary tuberculosis, the liver (3) and/or spleen (2), and/or lymph node (3) revealed caseating granulomas. Laparotomy diagnosed 3 of 5 cases whose abdominal ultrasonography and computerized tomography were normal. In conclusion, although advanced diagnostic methods decreased the need for laparotomy in FUO, if non-invasive and invasive diagnostic measures fail, laparotomy may contribute to the diagnosis. The selection of the patient and the timing are important for laparotomy.","['Ozaras, R', 'Celik, A D', 'Zengin, K', 'Mert, A', 'OzturkK, R', 'Cicek, Y', 'Tabak, E']","['Ozaras R', 'Celik AD', 'Zengin K', 'Mert A', 'OzturkK R', 'Cicek Y', 'Tabak E']","['Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey. rozaras@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Acta Chir Belg,Acta chirurgica Belgica,0370571,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Humans', '*Laparotomy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2005/03/26 09:00,2005/06/29 09:00,['2005/03/26 09:00'],"['2005/03/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Chir Belg. 2005 Feb;105(1):89-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL gene was proved to play the principal role in CML pathogenesis. It is a hallmark of CML used in diagnostics and monitoring of the response to the therapy. The most sensitive method of detecting BCR-ABL aberration is RT-PCR which is able to find a single in leukemic cell between 10(6) normal leukocytes. Monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript level by quantitative RT-PCR is of the high prognostic value. High or increasing BCR-ABL transcript number signalizes bad response to treatment and a bad prognosis. On the contrary RT-PCR negativity, low level, or decreasing BCR-ABL transcript number denotes good response to treatment and good prognosis. Q-RT-PCR can detect changes in disease status several weeks or even months earlier than other methods. In 1994 the Q-RT-PCR was introduced at the Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion in Prague and was used for early detection of relapse after transplantation.

We have already shown that DC can be successfully generated from AML and myeloplastic syndromes (MDS) cells in serum-free 'standard' medium (X-vivo + GM-CSF + IL-4 +TNFalpha + FL) in 10-14 days. In this study, we present that DC counts generated from mononuclear cells (MNC) varied between 20% (from 55 MDS samples), 34% (from 100 AML samples) and 25% (from 38 healthy MNC samples) medium. Between 53% and 58% of DC are mature CD83+ DC. DC harvests were highest in monocytoid FAB types (AML-M4/M5, MDS-CMML) and independent from cytogenetic risk groups, demonstrating that DC-based strategies can be applied for patients with all cytogenetic risk groups. Proof of the clonal derivation of DC generated was obtained in five AML and four MDS cases with a combined FISH/immunophenotype analysis (FISH-IPA): The clonal numerical chromosome aberrations of the diseases were regularly codetectable with DC markers; however, not with all clonal cells being convertible to leukemia-derived DC(leu) (on average, 53% of blasts in AML or MDS). To the contrary, not all DC generated carried the clonal aberration (on average, 51% of DC). In 41 AML and 13 MDS cases with a suitable antigen expression, we could confirm FISH-IPA data by Flow cytometry: although DC(leu) are regularly detectable, on average only 57% of blasts in AML and 64% of blasts in MDS were converted to DC(leu). After coculture with DC in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR), autologous T cells from AML and MDS patients proliferate and upregulate costimulatory receptors. The specific lysis of leukemic cells by autologous T cells could be demonstrated in three cases with AML in a Fluorolysis assay. In six cases with only few DC(leu) or few vital T cells available after the DC/MLR procedure, no lysis of allogeneic or autologous leukemic cells was seen, pointing to the crucial role of both partners in the lysis process. We conclude: (1) the generation of DC is regularly possible in AML and also in MDS under serum-free conditions.

Frame-shift mutations in the repetitive sequences in the coding region of MSH3, MSH6, BAX, TGFBRII and IGFRII were also investigated by using a fluorescent PCR-based assay. Methylation-specific PCR was used to determine the methylation status of hMLH1 in MSI+ cases. MSH3, MSH6 and MLH1 expression was also analyzed in 68 cases by means of real-time quantitative PCR. MSI was detected in 20 cases: 14 cases had MSI-high (instability of at least two microsatellite markers) and 6 cases corresponded to MSI-low (a single polymorphic marker with instability). Six MSI+ cases showed an associated MLL rearrangement (p=0.002). No single case showed a mutation in the repetitive sequences of the MSH3, MSH6, BAX, TGFBRII and IGFRII genes. Most samples displayed low mRNA levels of the repair genes. hMLH1 promoter was hypermethylated in five MSI+ cases. Overall survival analysis revealed no adverse effect of MSI positivity.

We first studied a cohort of 103 MDS patients as well as 46 pathological and healthy controls. Flow cytometry data were expressed as percentage of positive cells. Analysis of erythroid cells showed higher proportions of immature cells (P < 0.001) and decreased levels of CD71 expression on nucleated red cells (P = 0.02) in MDS. Analysis of myeloid cells showed lower proportions of CD10+ and higher proportions of CD56+ granulocytes (P < 0.001), and increased ratios of immature to mature cells (P = 0.007). Since no single immunophenotype could accurately differentiate MDS from other conditions, we used discriminant analysis for generating erythroid and myeloid classification functions using combinations of immunophenotypic parameters. These functions were prospectively validated in a testing cohort of 69 MDS patients and 46 pathological controls. A diagnosis of MDS was obtained in 60/69 cases (87%). No false-positive results were noticed among controls. Significant correlations between values of these functions and both degree of morphological dysplasia and the International Prognostic Scoring System were found.

Previous in vitro studies investigating the effect of CpG ODN on B-CLL cells used serum-low conditions and did not account for the longer-half life of CpG ODN in vitro. The present study was designed to explore how the presence of serum and exposure time affect CpG ODN-mediated changes on B-CLL cells. The optimal concentration for CpG ODN-mediated effects in the presence of 100% serum or plasma was higher (10-20 microg/ml) than for serum-low conditions. Maximal CpG ODN-mediated effects required the presence of ODN for no longer than 3 hours. The inhibition of CpG ODN-mediated effects by serum correlated with lower uptake of ODN into B-CLL cells in the presence of serum. A threshold effect on biologic response was observed, with a given amount of ODN internalized, resulting in phenotypic changes. In conclusion, systemic short-term application of CpG ODN appears to be sufficient to induce phenotypic changes, but higher doses of CpG ODN than previously thought may be necessary because of inhibition of their uptake by serum.","['Jahrsdorfer, Bernd', 'Blackwell, Sue E', 'Wooldridge, James E', 'Taylor, Christiana M', 'Weiner, George J']","['Jahrsdorfer B', 'Blackwell SE', 'Wooldridge JE', 'Taylor CM', 'Weiner GJ']","['The Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oligonucleotides,Oligonucleotides,101188415,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)']",IM,"['CpG Islands/*genetics', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotides/*chemistry', 'Phenotype', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/03/25 09:00,2005/07/12 09:00,['2005/03/25 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/oli.2005.15.51 [doi]'],ppublish,Oligonucleotides. 2005 Spring;15(1):51-9. doi: 10.1089/oli.2005.15.51.,,,,"['P50 CA97274-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA77764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incomplete chemotherapeutic eradication of leukemic CD34+38- stem cells is likely to result in disease relapse. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, member 2) in drug resistance of leukemic stem cells and the effect of its modulation on stem cell eradication in AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: BCRP expression (measured flow-cytometrically using the BXP21 monoclonal antibody) and the effect of its modulation (using the novel fumitremorgin C analogue KO143) on intracellular mitoxantrone accumulation and in vitro chemosensitivity were assessed in leukemic CD34+38- cells. RESULTS: BCRP was preferentially expressed in leukemic CD34+38- cells and blockage of BCRP-mediated drug extrusion by the novel fumitremorgin C analogue KO143 resulted in increased intracellular mitoxantrone accumulation in these cells in the majority of patients. This increase, however, was much lower than in the mitoxantrone-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF7-MR and significant drug extrusion occurred in the presence of BCRP blockage due to the presence of additional drug transport mechanisms, among which ABCB1 and multiple drug resistance protein. In line with these findings, selective blockage of BCRP by KO143 did not enhance in vitro chemosensitivity of leukemic CD34+38- cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that drug extrusion from leukemic stem cells is mediated by the promiscuous action of BCRP and additional transporters. Broad-spectrum inhibition, rather than modulation of single mechanisms, is therefore likely to be required to circumvent drug resistance and eradicate leukemic stem cells in AML.","['Raaijmakers, Marc H G P', 'de Grouw, Elke P L M', 'Heuver, Leonie H H', 'van der Reijden, Bert A', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Scheper, Rik J', 'Scheffer, George L', 'de Witte, Theo J M', 'Raymakers, Reinier A P']","['Raaijmakers MH', 'de Grouw EP', 'Heuver LH', 'van der Reijden BA', 'Jansen JH', 'Scheper RJ', 'Scheffer GL', 'de Witte TJ', 'Raymakers RA']","['Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, University Medical Center Nijmegen, St. Radboud, 6500 HB Nijmegen, the Netherlands. h.raajmakers@chl.umcn.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/immunology/*metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/03/25 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/03/25 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/6/2436 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0212 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Mar 15;11(6):2436-44. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0212.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tumor cells frequently infiltrate in the skin, lymph nodes and other organs and especially form prominent cutaneous masses. Recently, ATL cells have been shown to express Th2 chemokine receptor CCR4. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility that CCR4 ligands, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), are produced by CCR4(+) ATL cells per se. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CD4(+) or CD4(+)CD14(-) cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 11 ATL patients with cutaneous involvement and normal healthy volunteers. Tissue-infiltrating cells were isolated from skin tumors. The expression of chemokine receptors on these cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The production of chemokines and cytokines by the neoplastic cells was assessed by ELISA and reverse transcription-PCR after cultivation for 96 hours in the presence or absence of anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies. Finally, TARC and CCR4 expressions were examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: ATL cells highly expressed CCR4 but did not necessarily exhibit the Th2 cytokine profile. The cells also produced TARC and MDC. The production level of MDC was higher in the skin tumor formation group than that in the nontumor group. Immunohistochemically, both CCR4 and TARC were expressed by the tumor cells in the lesional skin. CONCLUSIONS: ATL cells not only express CCR4 but also produce TARC and MDC. The skin tumor formation as well as the monoclonal integration of proviral DNA are the factors that are associated with the high production of Th2 chemokines by ATL cells.","['Shimauchi, Takatoshi', 'Imai, Satoshi', 'Hino, Ryosuke', 'Tokura, Yoshiki']","['Shimauchi T', 'Imai S', 'Hino R', 'Tokura Y']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseogaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyusyu 807-8555, Japan. t-shima@med.uoeh-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CCL22 protein, human)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL22)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL22', '*Chemokines, CC/immunology/metabolism', '*Cytokines/immunology/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, CCR4', 'Receptors, Chemokine/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology/metabolism']",2005/03/25 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/03/25 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/6/2427 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0491 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Mar 15;11(6):2427-35. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0491.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Pgp modulator cyclosporin A has shown clinical efficacy in AML, whereas its analogue PSC-833 has not. Cyclosporin A is known to also modulate MRP-1, and we hypothesized that broad-spectrum multidrug resistance modulation might contribute to its clinical efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied the effects of cyclosporin A and PSC-833 on in vitro drug retention and cytotoxicity in resistant cell lines overexpressing Pgp, MRP-1, and BCRP and on nuclear-cytoplasmic drug distribution and cytotoxicity in cells overexpressing LRP. Cellular drug content was assessed by flow cytometry and nuclear-cytoplasmic drug distribution by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Cyclosporin A enhanced retention of the substrate drug mitoxantrone in cells overexpressing Pgp (HL60/VCR), MRP-1 (HL60/ADR), and BCRP (8226/MR20, HEK-293 482R) and increased cytotoxicity 6-, 4-, 4-, and 3-fold, respectively. Moreover, cyclosporin A enhanced nuclear distribution of doxorubicin in 8226/MR20 cells, which also express LRP, and increased doxorubicin cytotoxicity 12-fold without an effect on cellular doxorubicin content, consistent with expression of wild-type BCRP, which does not efflux doxorubicin. Cyclosporin A also enhanced nuclear doxorubicin distribution in a second cell line with LRP overexpression, HT1080/DR4. PSC-833 enhanced mitoxantrone retention and cytotoxicity in cells overexpressing Pgp, but had no effect in cells overexpressing MRP-1, BCRP, or LRP. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporin A modulates Pgp, MRP-1, BCRP, and LRP, and this broad-spectrum activity may contribute to its clinical efficacy.","['Qadir, Misbah', ""O'Loughlin, Kieran L"", 'Fricke, Stacy M', 'Williamson, Nicole A', 'Greco, William R', 'Minderman, Hans', 'Baer, Maria R']","['Qadir M', ""O'Loughlin KL"", 'Fricke SM', 'Williamson NA', 'Greco WR', 'Minderman H', 'Baer MR']","['Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm & Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitoxantrone/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/metabolism']",2005/03/25 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/03/25 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/6/2320 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1725 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Mar 15;11(6):2320-6. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1725.,,,,"['P30 CA 16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA 98457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA 09072-28/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPR-MET, a constitutively active oncogenic variant of MET, serves as excellent model for testing c-MET inhibitors. Here, we characterized a small molecule c-MET inhibitor, PHA665752, and tested its cooperation with the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor as potential targeted therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effect of PHA665752 treatment was determined on cell growth, motility and migration, apoptosis, and cell-cycle arrest of TPR-MET-transformed cells. Moreover, the effect of PHA665752 on the phosphorylation on MET, as well as its downstream effectors, p-AKT and p-S6K, was also determined. Finally, growth of TPR-MET-transformed cells was tested in the presence of PHA665752 and rapamycin. H441 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (with activated c-Met) were also tested against both PHA665752 and rapamycin. RESULTS: PHA665752 specifically inhibited cell growth in BaF3. TPR-MET cells (IC(50) < 0.06 micromol/L), induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Constitutive cell motility and migration of the BaF3. TPR-MET cells was also inhibited. PHA665752 inhibited specific phosphorylation of TPR-MET as well as phosphorylation of downstream targets of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. When combined with PHA665752, rapamycin showed cooperative inhibition to reduce growth of BaF3. TPR-MET- and c-MET-expressing H441 NSCLC cells. CONCLUSIONS: PHA665752 is a potent small molecule-selective c-MET inhibitor and is highly active against TPR-MET-transformed cells both biologically and biochemically. PHA665752 is also active against H441 NSCLC cells. The c-MET inhibitor can cooperate with rapamycin in therapeutic inhibition of NSCLC, and in vivo studies of this combination against c-MET expressing cancers would be merited.","['Ma, Patrick C', 'Schaefer, Erik', 'Christensen, James G', 'Salgia, Ravi']","['Ma PC', 'Schaefer E', 'Christensen JG', 'Salgia R']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, 5841 South Maryland Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0', '(5-((2,6-dichlorobenzyl)sulfonyl)-3-((3,5-dimethyl-4-((2-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)p', 'yrrolidin-1-yl)carbonyl)-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methylene)-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Sulfones)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/03/25 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/03/25 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['11/6/2312 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1708 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Mar 15;11(6):2312-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1708.,,,,['R01 CA 100750-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligible patients had unresectable pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, measurable disease, no prior therapy, and performance status 0-1 by Cancer and Leukemia Group B criteria. Gefitinib (500 mg p.o.) was administered once a day for 21 days. Patients underwent restaging after every two cycles. Therapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: The most common grade 3 toxicities were diarrhea (16%) and nausea (12%). Of 43 patients enrolled, 1 patient (2%) had a complete response, 1 patient (2%) had a partial response, 21 (49%) had stable disease lasting two to eight cycles, 15 (35%) had progressive disease, and 5 (12%) had early deaths. One-year survival was 32% [95% confidence interval (CI), 21-50%]. Median survival and failure-free survival were 6.8% (95% CI, 3.5-10.3) and 2.6 months (95% CI, 1.5-4.0), respectively. The 3-month failure-free survival was 40% (95% CI, 25-56%). EGFR expression score by immunohistochemistry done in 28 patients was categorized as low (EGFR 1+ or 2+) or high (EGFR 3+) expression: 97% had EGFR overexpression (2+ or 3+). The median and 3-month failure-free survival were 3.6 months and 40% for those patients with low EGFR expression compared with 8.1 and 40% for those with high EGFR expression.

Cytochrome c was released at 4 h. Apoptosis was detected at 6 h after exposure to EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and preceded the activation of caspase-3. Liberation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria and its translocation into the nucleus were observed at 4 h. A broad-specificity caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, failed to suppress the apoptosis, suggesting that EPA induced caspase-independent apoptosis. On other hand, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) inhibitor that blocks AIF translocation to the nucleus suppressed EPA-induced apoptosis. The level of hydroperoxide in the cells and mitochondria increased at the early phase of apoptosis within 2 h. On the contrary, elevation of hydroperoxide in mitochondria was not observed after treatment with LA. The EPA-induced apoptosis was abolished by prevention of the hydroperoxide elevation in mitochondria via overexpression of mitochondrial phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx). Neither cytochrome c nor AIF were released from mitochondria in the mitochondrial PHGPx-overexpressing cells. EPA also induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, but not in L929 or RAW264.7 cells. Enhancement of the hydroperoxide level in mitochondria was found in the EPA-sensitive HeLa cells after treatment with EPA, whereas no such enhancement was observed in the apoptosis-resistant L929 and RAW264.7 cells. These results suggest that the generation of hydroperoxide in mitochondria induced by EPA is associated with AIF release from mitochondria and the induction of apoptosis.","['Koumura, Tomoko', 'Nakamura, Chika', 'Nakagawa, Yasuhito']","['Koumura T', 'Nakamura C', 'Nakagawa Y']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kitasato University, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8641, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,"['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Aifm1 protein, rat)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Pdcd8 protein, mouse)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.12 (Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flavoproteins/metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Rats']",2005/03/25 09:00,2005/07/19 09:00,['2005/03/25 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['NMP8G8QG7LJAV6XP [pii]', '10.1080/10715760500043587 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2005 Mar;39(3):225-35. doi: 10.1080/10715760500043587.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the sake of illustrating the mechanisms of HHT in the treatment of leukemia, we assessed the effect of HHT on the apoptosis of human chronic myeloid leukemic cell line K562. METHODS: The apoptosis of K562 cells induced by HHT was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA, flow cytometry and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick labeling. RESULTS: Characteristic apoptosis-related features emerged in K562 cells after exposed to HHT at a concentration 0.05-100 microg/ml. Transmission electron microscopy of HHT treated K562 cells displayed chromatin condensation and aggregation under the nuclear membrane, nuclear fragmentation and apoptosis body formation. Typical DNA ladder in agarose gel electrophoresis was observed in the cells exposed to HHT. The cell cycle analysis measured by flow cytometry showed G1 phase cells decreased with the increase of S phase cells while apoptosis was induced by HHT in K562 cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells in K562 cells treated with 50 microg/ml of HHT decreased significantly when pretreated with 1 microg/ml of cycloheximide, 0.05 microg/ml of Actinomycin D respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HHT has apoptotic effects on K562 cells. The HHT induced apoptosis mainly of the cells in G1 phase and this process required RNA transcription and protein synthesis.","['Mai, Wen-yuan', 'Lin, Mao-fang']","['Mai WY', 'Lin MF']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China. maiwenyuan@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology']",2005/03/25 09:00,2005/05/05 09:00,['2005/03/25 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2005 Mar 20;118(6):487-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to explore the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) after nonmyeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplantations, while assessing the declines in treatment-associated morbidity, mortality, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). METHODS: A total of 615 (H-2k) mice were injected with L615 tumor cells and received 500 cGy (60Co gamma-ray) irradiation three days later, followed by an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). The allo-grafts consisted of 3 x 10(7) bone marrow cells and 1 x 10(7) spleen cells from BALB/C (H-2d) donor mice. Two days after the allo-BMT, the recipient mice were given 200 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide. Subsequently, recipient mice were infused with either donor spleen cells (2 x 10(7)) on day 14 or 21, or donor spleen cells (5 x 10(7)) pretreated with hydrocortisone and cyclosporin A (CsA) in vitro on day 14 post-BMT. RESULTS: The median survival time of mice that received DLI on day 21 and pretreated DLI on day 14 post-BMT was longer than that of controls and the day 14 DLI group (P < 0.01). No evidence of severe GVHD was observed in the day 21 DLI group nor in the day 14 treated DLI group. Mixed chimerism was confirmed in the day 14 DLI group, the day 14 treated DLI group, and the day 21 DLI group on the thirteenth day post-transplantation; full donor chimerism was observed two weeks after DLI. CONCLUSION: Donor lymphocyte infusion after nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplantation may reduce transplantation-associated morbidity and mortality while strengthening graft-versus-leukemia effects.","['Du, Bing', 'Li, De-peng', 'Xu, Kai-lin', 'Pan, Xiu-ying']","['Du B', 'Li DP', 'Xu KL', 'Pan XY']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou 221002, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/03/25 09:00,2005/05/05 09:00,['2005/03/25 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2005 Mar 20;118(6):474-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence in the literature suggests that araC may inhibit the growth of human colon carcinoma cell lines as well. Because araC action interferes with normal nucleoside metabolism, it is highly toxic to a number of normal cell types including bone marrow and intestinal mucosa cells. Here we investigate whether the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could selectively target araC toxicity toward colonic tumor cells while protecting the normal cells in vitro. RESULTS: Cultures of normal rat colonic epithelial cells (4D/WT) and those transformed by v-src (D/v-src) were supplemented with graded concentrations of DHA or arachidonic acid (AA) alone or in combination with araC. AraC was only 1.6 fold more toxic to D/v-src than 4D/WT in cultures without added fatty acids. Supplementing with as little as 3 muM of either AA or DHA increased araC toxicity by more than 30-fold in the tumorigenic cells. The toxic effect of araC on the normal cells was also increased by the fatty acid supplementation. IC50 values were decreased 1.7 fold by DHA in the 4D/WT cells but a more than 7-fold decrease was observed during AA supplementation. As a result, the therapeutic index of araC (IC50 normal/IC50 tumor) was more than 3-fold higher in the DHA than the AA supplemented cells. The expression of protein kinase C isoform epsilon was decreased in AA alone supplemented D/v-src cultures but in combination with araC decreased only in DHA supplemented 4D/WT cells. CONCLUSION: Low dose DHA supplementation may enhance araC chemotherapy in colon cancer while protecting normal tissues, possibly through control of PKC signalling pathways.","['Cha, Ming C', 'Lin, Angela', 'Meckling, Kelly A']","['Cha MC', 'Lin A', 'Meckling KA']","['Department of Human Biology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2W1, Canada. mcha@uoguelph.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Pharmacol,BMC pharmacology,100967806,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/03/25 09:00,2006/02/02 09:00,['2005/03/25 09:00'],"['2004/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2210-5-7 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2210-5-7 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Pharmacol. 2005 Mar 23;5:7. doi: 10.1186/1471-2210-5-7.,20050323,PMC1079882,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allergy histories were also assessed as part of a broader evaluation of the role of immune factors in ALL. Cases (n = 255) were diagnosed between 1980 and 1991 at one of four referral centres in a 31-county area of New York State; controls (n = 760) were a random sample of live births from the same region, frequency matched to cases by sex, race and birth year. Data were collected by mailed questionnaire, completed by case and control parents in 1995. Allergy and infectious histories before the age at leukaemia diagnosis for cases and an equivalent age for controls were evaluated. The adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval [CI] associated with a positive history of any allergy was 0.58 [95% CI 0.38, 0.88] compared with a negative allergy history. The occurrence of several common childhood illnesses before 25 months of age and ALL were assessed, with both weak positive and weak inverse associations observed. Overall, these analyses provide little support for the hypothesis that infection delay in early life is associated with an increased risk of ALL. Children with positive allergy histories reported significantly more infections than those with negative histories; however, effect modification of the infection-ALL associations by child allergy history was not observed. Nonetheless, these observations suggest the importance of assessing both allergy and infectious histories and their possible interactions when evaluating the association between these immune factors and childhood ALL.","['Rosenbaum, Paula F', 'Buck, Germaine M', 'Brecher, Martin L']","['Rosenbaum PF', 'Buck GM', 'Brecher ML']","['Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA. rosenbap@upstate.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,8709766,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Communicable Diseases/*complications/epidemiology', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/*complications/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'New York/epidemiology', 'Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/immunology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Virus Diseases/complications/epidemiology']",2005/03/25 09:00,2005/06/23 09:00,['2005/03/25 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['PPE634 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3016.2005.00634.x [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2005 Mar;19(2):152-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2005.00634.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible EMF health effects have been widely publicized in the popular press since that time. We consider here three possible mechanisms of action of EMF on childhood leukemia. We identify the first as ""magnetic fields"": this hypothesis relates the average level of magnetic field to the incidence of childhood leukemia. We identify a second, recently proposed, mechanism as ""contact current"": this hypothesis relates the low voltage and consequent current that occurs on the domestic water pipe, due to U.S. grounding practices, as a source for exposure of children. The third hypothesis is that the relationship observed is spurious. Using a modified example taken from the work of Von Winterfeldt and Keeney, we use Decision Analysis to estimate the value of information for distinguishing between the three hypotheses. We believe that this improves on the usual process for deciding on research budgets. Depending on which hypothesis we favor a priori, the value of being informed ranges from US 101 dollars to US 233 dollars per ""problem household."" Since there could be as many as 2 million such households, the value of information for resolving this issue could approach half a billion dollars! We find that there is no value of information for finding the odds ratio given the contact current hypothesis. In writing this article, we have consciously kept the computations as simple as possible so as to engage the reader's attention and interest. In a penultimate section, we suggest numerous possible extensions for a group interested in discussing and deciding on the value of research on the relationship between magnetic fields and cancer.","['Peck, Stephen C', 'Kavet, Robert']","['Peck SC', 'Kavet R']",['Fleche Inc.

In this study we compared five selected extraction methods for the lipid extraction from HL-60 cells with regard to their qualitative analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS): chloroform/methanol at volume ratios 2:1 and 1:2, isopropanol/ chloroform, isopropanol/hexane and butanol. In addition, the cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations in organic extracts were measured by colorimetric assays. Results can be summarized as follows: For the analysis of polar phospholipids obtained from HL-60 cells by MALDI-TOF MS, a chlorofom/methanol (1:2) or isopropanol/chloroform mixture or butanol can be applied as extraction systems On the other hand, if one would like to analyze changes in triacylglycerols, then chloroform/methanol (2:1) would be the method of choice.","['Petkovic, Marijana', 'Vocks, Andreas', 'Muller, Matthias', 'Schiller, Jurgen', 'Arnhold, Jurgen']","['Petkovic M', 'Vocks A', 'Muller M', 'Schiller J', 'Arnhold J']","['Institute of Medical Physics and Biophysics, Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Liebigstrasse 27, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany. petm@medizin.uni-leipzig.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Z Naturforsch C J Biosci,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

The IL-6 receptor has subunit called gp130. It was reported that Ser-782 of gp130 is phosphorylated by unidentified kinase(s) in cell extracts, and level of gp130 (S782A) transiently expressed on the cell surface of COS-7 is 6-times higher than that of the wild type. These results motivated us to analyze whether the phosphorylation of gp130 at Ser-782 is involved in its degradation or not. In this study, we demonstrated here that treatment of HepG2 cells with okadaic acid (OA), a potent inhibitor for PP2A, promotes phosphorylation of gp 130 at Ser-782 and degradation of gp 130. MG115, a proteasome inhibitor, suppressed this degradation. These effects of OA could not be replaced with tautomycetin (TC), an inhibitor for PP1. Purified PP2A dephosphorylated phospho-Ser-782 of gp130 in vitro. IL-6-induced activation of Stat3 was suppressed by preincubation of the cells with OA, suggesting that the IL-6 signaling pathway was blocked by OA through degradation of gp 130. Taken together, present results strongly suggest that degradation of gp 130 is regulated through a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism in which PP2A is crucially involved and that gp 130 is a potential therapeutic target in cancers.","['Mitsuhashi, Shinya', 'Shima, Hiroshi', 'Tanuma, Nobuhiro', 'Sasa, Sumie', 'Onoe, Kazunori', 'Ubukata, Makoto', 'Kikuchi, Kunimi']","['Mitsuhashi S', 'Shima H', 'Tanuma N', 'Sasa S', 'Onoe K', 'Ubukata M', 'Kikuchi K']","['Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita-15, Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (carbobenzoxy-leucyl-leucyl-norvalinal)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/03/25 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/03/25 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11010-005-3089-x [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2005 Jan;269(1-2):183-7. doi: 10.1007/s11010-005-3089-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we addressed that issue using two animal models of angiotensin II-dependent cardiac hypertrophy. Heterozygous transgenic TGR(mRen2)27 (TGR) with an overactive cardiac renin angiotensin system and the closely related spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were compared to their respective control rats. The mRNA levels of IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) as well as their receptor subunits, glycoprotein 130 (gp130), IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), LIFR, and CNTFR, were measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The protein levels of IL-6, LIF and CT-1 were investigated by western blot. TGR and SHR both displayed significant over expression of mRNA and protein levels for IL-6 and LIF. In TGR, the increased level of LIF was accompanied by a decrease in mRNA levels for LIFR and CNTFR. In SHR, a higher level of mRNA IL-6R was observed. By contrast, the mRNA and protein levels for CT-1 and the mRNA level for gp130 did not vary in these two models. These findings suggest that IL-6 and LIF, but not CT-1, contribute to angiotensin II-dependent left ventricular hypertrophy in the two hypertensive rat models, TGR(mRen2)27 and SHR.","['Kurdi, Mazen', 'Randon, Jacques', 'Cerutti, Catherine', 'Bricca, Giampiero']","['Kurdi M', 'Randon J', 'Cerutti C', 'Bricca G']","['EA 3740, Universite Claude Bernard-Lyon1, Faculte de Medecine RTH Laennec, Rue Guillaume Paradin, Lyon, France. mazen_kurdi@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'EC 3.4.23.15 (Renin)']",IM,"['Angiotensin II/genetics', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Biomarkers/analysis/metabolism', 'Blood Pressure/physiology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokines/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Heart Ventricles/chemistry/pathology', 'Hypertension/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Organ Size', 'Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred SHR', 'Renin/genetics', '*Up-Regulation']",2005/03/25 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/03/25 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11010-005-3085-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2005 Jan;269(1-2):95-101. doi: 10.1007/s11010-005-3085-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytochemical reaction for myeloperoxidase was negative in both cell types. Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed a normal karyotype (46 XY) in all metaphases studied, while gene rearrangement analysis by seminested PCR of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Ig-H) and T-cell-gamma chain (TCR-gamma) receptor, showed a germline configuration of the TCR and clonal rearrangement of Ig-H chain genes. Multicolour cytofluorimetric analysis showed that bone marrow and peripheral blood blasts expressed CD19, CD79alpha bright, CD22 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) as lymphoid markers, CD13, CD117, CD15 as myeloid markers, CD34, HLA-DR as stem cell markers. CD33 myeloid antigen was expressed by 50% of the blastic population. No differences in the immunophenotypic profile were detected in the two blast populations which were identified by morphology.

It was first demonstrated for the yeast MLL homolog complex, Set1/COMPASS, and now for the MLL complex itself, that these complexes are histone methyltransferases capable of methylating the fourth lysine of histone H3. The post-translational modifications of histones by methylation have emerged as a key regulatory mechanism for both repression and activation of gene expression. Studies from several laboratories during the past few years have brought about a watershed of information defining the molecular machinery and factors involved in the recognition and modification of nucleosomal histones by methylation.

METHODS: Patients with CML who had achieved >/= 35% Ph-negativity on imatinib were included. All patients had been treated with imatinib at >/= 400 mg/day for at least 2 years and had achieved a plateau in BCR-ABL transcripts defined by measuring BCR-ABL transcripts on at least 4 occasions over a minimum period of 1 year with the latest value not lower than the previous minimum value. Initially sHHT was given subcutaneously at a dose of 1.25 mg/m(2) twice daily for 1 day. Courses were repeated every 28 days. The dosage of sHHT was escalated by adding one day of treatment every two days. Efficacy was assessed by serial monitoring of blood levels of BCR-ABL transcripts. RESULTS: Of 10 evaluable patients, 7 had an appreciable decline in BCR-ABL transcript levels; in 5 cases the reduction was greater than 1 log. Asthenia (n = 10) and cytopenias (n = 3) were prominent side-effects, but the drug was generally well tolerated. Mutations in the P-loop of the BCR-ABL kinase domain were found in 2 of the patients who responded to the addition of sHHT.

Targeted treatment using radioimmunotherapy (RIT), radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies directed against tumor-specific antigens, is an attractive option for this patient population, combining the advantages of an active biologic therapy with low dose-rate irradiation of an inherently radiosensitive tumor. Two anti-CD20 RIT agents have now been approved for the treatment of refractory NHL: 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin; Biogen Idec Inc, San Diego, CA, and Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) is approved in both the United States and Europe, and 131I-tositumomab (Bexxar; Corixa Corp, Seattle, WA) is approved only in the United States. This article discusses the development of 131I-tositumomab. Because 131I-labeled antibody clearance varies significantly among patients, prescription of 131I-tositumomab activity must be based on a calculated total-body dose derived from quantitative whole-body imaging. The maximum tolerated total-body dose has been established at 75 cGy in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves and less than 25% bone marrow involvement by lymphoma (65 cGy in patients with mild thrombocytopenia; 45 cGy in patients who have received stem cell transplantation). In a phase III trial, overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rate were significantly higher following 131I-tositumomab than following the patient's last qualifying chemotherapy (ORR, 65% v 28%; P <.001; CR, 20% v 3%; P <.001). 131I-tositumomab has also been shown to be effective in patients who are refractory to rituximab (ORR, 70%; CR, 32%) and as first-line therapy in patients with NHL (ORR, 97%; CR, 63%). The major side effects of 131I-tositumomab are hematologic. In the phase III study, 20% of patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia and 22% experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia.

By analyzing unmanipulated whole spleen cell populations we have aimed to mimic this in vivo situation to identify critical signaling molecules in regulatory allo-tolerance. METHODS: We compared the kinetics of cytokine release and induction of signaling proteins in (BALB/c-tolerant)CBA, versus (BALB/c-rejected)CBA, spleen cells after challenge with BALB/c antigen. RESULTS: The distinguishing features of allo-tolerance were Foxp3 protein expression, LIF release, and increased levels of STAT3. Comparison of isogenic clones of Tr1, Th1, and Th2 cells revealed that only the regulatory Tr1 cells are characterized by both LIF and IL10 release. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings demonstrate that allo-antigen driven signaling events can be detected within a whole spleen cell population and identify a role for LIF in the regulation of transplantation tolerance in vivo.","['Metcalfe, Su M', 'Watson, Tracy J', 'Shurey, Sandra', 'Adams, Elizabeth', 'Green, Colin J']","['Metcalfe SM', 'Watson TJ', 'Shurey S', 'Adams E', 'Green CJ']","[""Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge, Box 202, Level E9, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, UK. smm1001@cam.ac.uk""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transplantation Tolerance/*immunology']",2005/03/24 09:00,2005/04/26 09:00,['2005/03/24 09:00'],"['2005/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['00007890-200503270-00020 [pii]', '10.1097/01.tp.0000149324.42994.38 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2005 Mar 27;79(6):726-30. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000149324.42994.38.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During that period, 4015 cases were registered by the French National Registry of Childhood Leukaemia and Lymphoma. Exposure assessment was based on a campaign of 13 240 measurements covering the whole country. The arithmetic mean radon concentration was 85 Bq/m (range, 15-387 Bq/m) and the geometric mean, 59 Bq/m (range: 13-228 Bq/m). A positive ecological association, on the borderline of statistical significance (P=0.053), was observed between indoor radon concentration and childhood leukaemia incidence. The association was highly significant for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (P=0.004) but not for acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) (P=0.49). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) increased by 7, 3 and 24% for all acute leukaemia, ALL and AML, respectively, when radon concentration increased by 100 Bq/m. In conclusion, the present ecological study supports the hypothesis of a moderate association between indoor radon concentration and childhood acute myeloid leukaemia. It is consistent with most previous ecological studies. Since the association is moderate, this result does not appear inconsistent with the five published case-control studies, most of which found no significant association.","['Evrard, A S', 'Hemon, D', 'Billon, S', 'Laurier, D', 'Jougla, E', 'Tirmarche, M', 'Clavel, J']","['Evrard AS', 'Hemon D', 'Billon S', 'Laurier D', 'Jougla E', 'Tirmarche M', 'Clavel J']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, INSERM, U170-IFR69 Paris, 16 Avenue Paul Vaillant-Couturier, F-94807 Villejuif Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,['Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Air Pollution, Indoor/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radon/*adverse effects', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/03/24 09:00,2005/07/30 09:00,['2005/03/24 09:00'],"['2005/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['00008469-200504000-00011 [pii]', '10.1097/00008469-200504000-00011 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 2005 Apr;14(2):147-57. doi: 10.1097/00008469-200504000-00011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is involved in the metabolism of mercaptopurine and subject to genetic polymorphism, with heterozygous individuals having intermediate and homozygous mutant individuals having very low TPMT activity. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of TPMT genotype with minimal residual disease load before and after treatment with mercaptopurine in the early treatment course of childhood ALL. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: TPMT genotyping of childhood ALL patients (n = 814) in Germany consecutively enrolled in the ALL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) 2000 study from October 1999 to September 2002. Minimal residual disease was analyzed on treatment days 33 and 78 for risk-adapted treatment stratification. A 4-week cycle of mercaptopurine was administered between these 2 minimal residual disease measurements. Patients (n = 4) homozygous for a mutant TPMT allele, and consequently deficient in TPMT activity, were treated with reduced doses of mercaptopurine and, therefore, not included in the analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Minimal residual disease load before (day 33) and after (day 78) mercaptopurine treatment. Loads smaller than 10(-4) were defined as negative. RESULTS: Patients (n = 55) heterozygous for allelic variants of TPMT conferring lower enzyme activity had a significantly lower rate of minimal residual disease positivity (9.1%) compared with patients (n = 755) with homozygous wild-type alleles (22.8%) on day 78 (P = .02). This translated into a 2.9-fold reduction in risk for patients with wild-type heterozygous alleles (relative risk, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.86). CONCLUSIONS: TPMT genotype has a substantial impact on minimal residual disease after administration of mercaptopurine in the early course of childhood ALL, most likely through modulation of mercaptopurine dose intensity. Our findings support a role for minimal residual disease analyses in the assessment of genotype-phenotype associations in multiagent chemotherapeutic trials.","['Stanulla, Martin', 'Schaeffeler, Elke', 'Flohr, Thomas', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Welte, Karl', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Bartram, Claus R', 'Zanger, Ulrich M', 'Eichelbaum, Michel', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Schwab, Matthias']","['Stanulla M', 'Schaeffeler E', 'Flohr T', 'Cario G', 'Schrauder A', 'Zimmermann M', 'Welte K', 'Ludwig WD', 'Bartram CR', 'Zanger UM', 'Eichelbaum M', 'Schrappe M', 'Schwab M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.

Recent results also demonstrated that Chk1 is depleted when cells are treated with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). The present study examined the effects of 17-AAG and its major metabolite, 17-aminogeldanamycin (17-AG), on Chk1 levels and cellular responses to cytarabine in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines and clinical isolates. Cytarabine, at concentrations as low as 30 nM, caused activating phosphorylation of Chk1, loss of the phosphatase Cdc25A, and S-phase slowing. Conversely, treatment with 100 to 300 nM 17-AAG for 24 hours caused Chk1 depletion that was accompanied by diminished cytarabine-induced S-phase accumulation, decreased Cdc25A degradation, and enhanced cytotoxicity as measured by inhibition of colony formation and induction of apoptosis. Additional studies demonstrated that small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) depletion of Chk1 also sensitized cells to cytarabine, whereas disruption of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3k) signaling pathway, which is also blocked by Hsp90 inhibition, did not. Collectively, these results suggest that treatment with 17-AAG might represent a means of reversing checkpoint-mediated cytarabine resistance in AML.","['Mesa, Ruben A', 'Loegering, David', 'Powell, Heather L', 'Flatten, Karen', 'Arlander, Sonnet J H', 'Dai, Nga T', 'Heldebrant, Michael P', 'Vroman, Benjamin T', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Eyck, Cynthia J Ten', 'Erlichman, Charles', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Karnitz, Larry M']","['Mesa RA', 'Loegering D', 'Powell HL', 'Flatten K', 'Arlander SJ', 'Dai NT', 'Heldebrant MP', 'Vroman BT', 'Smith BD', 'Karp JE', 'Eyck CJ', 'Erlichman C', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Karnitz LM']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Rifabutin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'S Phase/drug effects']",2005/03/24 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/24 09:00'],"['2005/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53358-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3523 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 1;106(1):318-27. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3523.

Here, we investigated potential antitumor action in an in vitro cell model for promyelocytic leukemia (NB4-LR1), resistant to retinoid maturation. Purified soluble TSP-1 added to cultures induced a strong dose-dependent growth inhibition and a slowly developing maturation-independent cell death. Recombinant fragments of TSP-1 allowed mapping of these activities to its type 3 repeat/C-terminal domain, features that are distinct from those of TSP-1 action on solid tumors, previously ascribed to the type 1 repeat domain. Cell death in leukemia was characterized as a caspase-independent mechanism, without DNA fragmentation, but phosphatidylserine externalization followed by membrane permeabilization. Mitochondria membrane depolarization was inherent to TSP-1 action but did not produce release of death-promoting proteins (eg, noncaspase apoptosis regulators, apoptosis-induced factor [AIF], endonuclease G, or Omi/HtrA2 or the caspase regulators, cytochrome c or second mitochondrial activator of caspase/direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein-binding protein with low isoelectric point [Smac/DIABLO]). Although detected, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was likely not involved in the death process. Finally, receptor agonist RFYVVM and RGD peptides indicated that TSP-1 death effects are mediated by membrane receptors CD47 and alphavbeta3. These results demonstrated a new domain-specific antitumoral activity of TSP-1 on a leukemia cell line, which extends TSP-1 therapeutic potential outside the area of vascularized solid tumors.","['Saumet, Anne', 'Slimane, Mouna Ben', 'Lanotte, Michel', 'Lawler, Jack', 'Dubernard, Veronique']","['Saumet A', 'Slimane MB', 'Lanotte M', 'Lawler J', 'Dubernard V']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, INSERM U-685, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (CD47 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alphaVbeta3)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Thrombospondin 1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'CD47 Antigen', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaVbeta3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'Thrombospondin 1/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2005/03/24 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/03/24 09:00'],"['2005/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53292-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3585 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 15;106(2):658-67. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3585.

Some t(4;14) patients have activating mutations of FGFR3, of which a minority are K650E (thanatophoric dysplasia type II [TDII]). To investigate the role of autophosphorylated tyrosine residues in FGFR3 signal transduction and transformation, we characterized a series of FGFR3 TDII mutants with single or multiple Y-->F substitutions. Phenylalanine substitution of Y760, essential for phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) binding and activation, significantly attenuated FGFR3 TDII-mediated PLCgamma activation, as well as transformation in Ba/F3 cells and a murine bone marrow transplant leukemia model. In contrast, single substitution of Y577, Y724, or Y770 had minimal to moderate effects on TDII-dependent transformation. Substitution of all 4 non-activation loop tyrosine residues significantly attenuated, but did not abolish, TDII transforming activity. Similar observations were obtained in the context of a constitutively activated fusion TEL-FGFR3 associated with t(4;12)(p16;p13) peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Moreover, 2 independent EmuSR-FGFR3 TDII transgenic mouse lines developed a pro-B-cell lymphoma, and PLCgamma was highly activated in primary lymphoma cells as assessed by tyrosine phosphorylation. These data indicate that engagement of multiple signaling pathways, including PLCgamma-dependent and PLCgamma-independent pathways, is required for full hematopoietic transformation by constitutively activated FGFR3 mutants.","['Chen, Jing', 'Williams, Ifor R', 'Lee, Benjamin H', 'Duclos, Nicole', 'Huntly, Brian J P', 'Donoghue, Daniel J', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Chen J', 'Williams IR', 'Lee BH', 'Duclos N', 'Huntly BJ', 'Donoghue DJ', 'Gilliland DG']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical Scgool, Boston, MA, USA. jchen@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Fgfr3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/genetics']",2005/03/24 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/24 09:00'],"['2005/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53359-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-09-3686 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 1;106(1):328-37. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3686.

We have recently shown that rapamycin down-regulates expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a mediator of leukemia-associated angiogenesis, in primary CML cells. In the present study, we analyzed growth-inhibitory in vitro and in vivo effects of rapamycin on primary CML cells and asked whether rapamycin-induced suppression of VEGF in leukemic cells is related to growth inhibition. Rapamycin dose dependently inhibited growth of primary CML cells obtained from patients with imatinib-responsive or imatinib-resistant disease as well as growth of Bcr-Abl-transformed imatinib-resistant cell lines. Moreover, we observed potent cytoreductive effects of rapamycin in a patient with imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl+ leukemia. The growth-inhibitory effects of rapamycin on CML cells were found to be associated with G1 cell cycle arrest and with induction of apoptosis. In all cell types tested, rapamycin was found to down-regulate expression of VEGF. However, exogenously added VEGF did not counteract the rapamycin-induced decrease in proliferation. In conclusion, rapamycin inhibits growth of CML cells in vitro and in vivo and, in addition, down-regulates expression of VEGF. Both effects may contribute to the antileukemic activity of the drug in CML.","['Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Aichberger, Karl J', 'Florian, Stefan', 'Krauth, Maria-Theresa', 'Hauswirth, Alexander W', 'Derdak, Sophia', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Esterbauer, Harald', 'Wagner, Oswald', 'Marosi, Christine', 'Pickl, Winfried F', 'Deininger, Michael', 'Weisberg, Ellen', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Griffin, James D', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Valent, Peter']","['Mayerhofer M', 'Aichberger KJ', 'Florian S', 'Krauth MT', 'Hauswirth AW', 'Derdak S', 'Sperr WR', 'Esterbauer H', 'Wagner O', 'Marosi C', 'Pickl WF', 'Deininger M', 'Weisberg E', 'Druker BJ', 'Griffin JD', 'Sillaber C', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria. matthias.mayerhofer@univie.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/genetics', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinases/analysis/*physiology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/pharmacology']",2005/03/24 09:00,2006/02/18 09:00,['2005/03/24 09:00'],"['2005/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['04-1973fje [pii]', '10.1096/fj.04-1973fje [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2005 Jun;19(8):960-2. doi: 10.1096/fj.04-1973fje.

In systemic mastocytosis (SM), neoplastic cells are driven by the RTK KIT, which is mutated at codon 816 in most patients. We examined expression of SIRPalpha, SIRPalpha ligand CD47, and Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), a tyrosine phosphatase-type, negative regulator of KIT-dependent signaling, in normal human lung mast cells (HLMC) and neoplastic MC obtained from nine patients with SM. As assessed by multicolor flow cytometry, normal LMC expressed SIRPalpha, CD47, and SHP-1. In patients with SM, MC also reacted with antibodies against SIRPalpha and CD47. By contrast, the levels of SHP-1 were low or undetectable in MC in most cases. Corresponding data were obtained from mRNA analysis. In fact, whereas SIRPalpha mRNA and CD47 mRNA were detected in all samples, the levels of SHP-1 mRNA varied among donors. To demonstrate adhesive functions for SIRPalpha and CD47 on neoplastic MC, an adhesion assay was applied using the MC leukemia cell line HMC-1, which was found to bind to immobilized extracellular domains of SIRPalpha1 (SIRPalpha1ex) and CD47 (CD47ex), and binding of these cells to CD47ex was inhibited by the CD172 antibody SE5A5. In summary, our data show that MC express functional SIRPalpha and CD47 in SM, whereas expression of SHP-1 varies among donors and is low compared with LMC. It is hypothesized that CD172 and CD47 contribute to MC clustering and that the ""lack"" of SHP-1 in MC may facilitate KIT-dependent signaling in a subgroup of patients.","['Florian, Stefan', 'Ghannadan, Minoo', 'Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Aichberger, Karl J', 'Hauswirth, Alexander W', 'Schernthaner, Gerit-Holger', 'Printz, Dieter', 'Fritsch, Gerhard', 'Bohm, Alexandra', 'Sonneck, Karoline', 'Krauth, Maria-Theresa', 'Muller, Michael R', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Buhring, Hans-Jorg', 'Valent, Peter']","['Florian S', 'Ghannadan M', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Aichberger KJ', 'Hauswirth AW', 'Schernthaner GH', 'Printz D', 'Fritsch G', 'Bohm A', 'Sonneck K', 'Krauth MT', 'Muller MR', 'Sillaber C', 'Sperr WR', 'Buhring HJ', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (CD47 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (SIRPA protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'CD47 Antigen', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic']",2005/03/24 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/24 09:00'],"['2005/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0604349 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0604349 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2005 Jun;77(6):984-92. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0604349.

However, in the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cell line, as well as in CHO cells, Syt IX is localized at the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). We show that targeting of Syt IX to the ERC involves constitutive trafficking to the plasma membrane followed by internalization and transport to the ERC. We further show that internalization from the plasma membrane and delivery to the ERC are dependent on phosphorylation by Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase Calpha or beta.

Clinically, the post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect may be associated with GVHD. Immune hyporesponsiveness induced by oral antigen administration has recently been shown to prevent the development of cGVHD in a murine model. To evaluate whether amelioration of cGVHD in mice by induction of oral immune regulation in donors toward recipient pretransplant lymphocyte antigens is associated with attenuation of the GVL effect donor B10.D2 mice were fed with Balb/c splenocytes, B10.D2 splenocytes, bovine serum albumin (BSA), or regular chow, every other day for 10 days. Subsequently, transplantation of 2 x 10(7) splenocytes from donor B10.D2 mice to recipient Balb/c mice was undertaken, followed by inoculation of 3 x 10(3) BCL-1 leukemia on the day of BMT. Control groups were fed identically without leukemia inoculation. Mice were followed for survival and leukemia progression. Induction of tolerance was assessed by a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Cutaneous GVHD was assessed macroscopically. To elucidate the mechanism of any observed effect, serum interferon (IFN), interleukin (IL-2), IL-12, IL-4, and IL-10 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry analysis for CD4+, CD8+, and NK1.1+ lymphocyte subpopulations was performed. There was no significant difference in leukemia progression manifested by survival or white blood cell counts of orally immune-regulated mice compared with control animals.

Overexpression of Bcl-2 protein results in an aberrant intrinsic apoptotic pathway that confers a protective effect on malignant cells against a death signal (e.g., chemotherapy or radiotherapy). Downregulation of this oncoprotein, thus, represents a possible new way to target clinically aggressive disease. Preclinical studies have shown that this oncoprotein can be effectively decreased by Bcl-2 antisense in malignant lymphoid cells and can reverse chemotherapy resistance, as well as enhance the anti-apoptotic potential of both chemotherapeutic and biologic agents. Ongoing clinical trials are exploring the role of Bcl-2 downregulation with oblimersen (Bcl-2 antisense) in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Early results from these studies are promising and support the proof of the principle. As these studies are completed and mature data emerges, the role of Bcl-2 antisense therapy in the treatment of B-cell malignancies will become clearer.","['Chanan-Khan, Asher']",['Chanan-Khan A'],"['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm & Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. asher.chanan-khan@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '85J5ZP6YSL (oblimersen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/*therapeutic use']",2005/03/24 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/03/24 09:00'],"['2005/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(04)00061-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2004.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2005 Jul;19(4):213-21. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2004.11.002.

One crucial step in the analysis of these data is to detect differentially expressed genes. Some parametric methods, including the two-sample t-test (T-test) and variations of it, have been used. Alternatively, a class of non-parametric algorithms, such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test (WRST), significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) of Tusher et al. (2001), the empirical Bayesian (EB) method of Efron et al. (2001), etc., have been proposed. Most available popular methods are based on t-statistic. Due to the quality of the statistic that they used to describe the difference between groups of data, there are situations when these methods are inefficient, especially when the data follows multi-modal distributions. For example, some genes may display different expression patterns in the same cell type, say, tumor or normal, to form some subtypes. Most available methods are likely to miss these genes. We developed a new non-parametric method for selecting differentially expressed genes by relative entropy, called SDEGRE, to detect differentially expressed genes by combining relative entropy and kernel density estimation, which can detect all types of differences between two groups of samples. The significance of whether a gene is differentially expressed or not can be estimated by resampling-based permutations. We illustrate our method on two data sets from Golub et al. (1999) and Alon et al. (1999). Comparing the results with those of the T-test, the WRST and the SAM, we identified novel differentially expressed genes which are of biological significance through previous biological studies while they were not detected by the other three methods. The results also show that the genes selected by SDEGRE have a better capability to distinguish the two cell types.","['Yan, Xiting', 'Deng, Minghua', 'Fung, Wing K', 'Qian, Minping']","['Yan X', 'Deng M', 'Fung WK', 'Qian M']","['LMAM, School of Mathematical Sciences and Center for Theoretical Biology, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Theor Biol,Journal of theoretical biology,0376342,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', '*Entropy', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', '*Models, Genetic', '*Models, Statistical', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2005/03/24 09:00,2005/06/10 09:00,['2005/03/24 09:00'],"['2004/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2004/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-5193(04)00599-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.11.039 [doi]']",ppublish,J Theor Biol. 2005 Jun 7;234(3):395-402. doi: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.11.039.

These hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), or better progenitor cells, are mostly expressed as the percentage of cells than react with CD34 antibodies or that form colonies in semi-solid medium (CFU-GM). Under steady-state conditions the number of HSC is much lower in peripheral blood than in bone marrow. Mobilization with chemotherapy and/or growth factors may lead to a concentration of HSC in the peripheral blood that equals or exceeds the concentration in bone marrow. Transplantation of HSC from the peripheral blood results in faster hematologic recovery than HSC from bone marrow. This decreases the risk of infection and the need for blood-product support. For autologous stem-cell transplantation (SCT), the use of peripheral blood cells has completely replaced the use of bone marrow. For allogeneic SCT, on the other hand, the situation is more complex. Since peripheral blood contains more T-lymphocytes than bone marrow, the use of HSC from the peripheral blood increases the risk of graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic SCT. For patients with goodrisk leukemia, bone marrow is still preferred, but for patients with high-risk disease, peripheral blood SCT has become the therapy of choice.","['Jansen, Jan', 'Hanks, Susan', 'Thompson, James M', 'Dugan, Michael J', 'Akard, Luke P']","['Jansen J', 'Hanks S', 'Thompson JM', 'Dugan MJ', 'Akard LP']","['Indiana Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Beech Grove, IN 46107, USA. jjansen@ibmtindy.com']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/history/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods']",2005/03/24 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2005/03/24 09:00'],"['2005/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['009.001.05 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2005.tb00335.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2005 Jan-Mar;9(1):37-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2005.tb00335.x.,,PMC6741412,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This technology has catalyzed biomedical research and development in recent years. As many important diseases can be traced down to the gene level, a long-standing research problem is to identify specific gene expression patterns linking to metabolic characteristics that contribute to disease development and progression. The microarray approach offers an expedited solution to this problem. However, it has posed a challenging issue to recognize disease-related genes expression patterns embedded in the microarray data. In selecting a small set of biologically significant genes for classifier design, the nature of high data dimensionality inherent in this problem creates substantial amount of uncertainty. RESULTS: Here we present a model for probability analysis of selected genes in order to determine their importance. Our contribution is that we show how to derive the P value of each selected gene in multiple gene selection trials based on different combinations of data samples and how to conduct a reliability analysis accordingly. The importance of a gene is indicated by its associated P value in that a smaller value implies higher information content from information theory. On the microarray data concerning the subtype classification of small round blue cell tumors, we demonstrate that the method is capable of finding the smallest set of genes (19 genes) with optimal classification performance, compared with results reported in the literature. CONCLUSION: In classifier design based on microarray data, the probability value derived from gene selection based on multiple combinations of data samples enables an effective mechanism for reducing the tendency of fitting local data particularities.","['Fu, Li M', 'Fu-Liu, Casey S']","['Fu LM', 'Fu-Liu CS']","['Pacific Tuberculosis and Cancer Research Organization, Pasadena, California, USA. lifu@patcar.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Databases, Protein', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Probability', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2005/03/24 09:00,2006/01/27 09:00,['2005/03/24 09:00'],"['2004/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-6-67 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-6-67 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2005 Mar 22;6:67. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-6-67.,20050322,PMC1274261,,"['R01 HL080311/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-080311/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study focused on the incidence and characteristics of preexisting, coexisting and subsequent malignancies in patients with ampullary carcinoma. METHODOLOGY: Sixty-four cases of ampullary carcinoma were retrospectively identified. Fifty-four patients underwent surgical resection, while in the other ten, histological diagnosis was reached after biopsy and/or autopsy. Other primary malignancies associated with ampullary carcinoma, occurring in the prediagnostic or postdiagnostic period, were investigated. The mean postdiagnostic follow-up period was 3.9 years (range, 0-23 years). RESULTS: Other malignancies occurred in 17 patients (27%), being found before (n=9), at (n=7), or after (n=5) diagnosis of ampullary carcinoma. The total number of associated lesions was 23, including one case of quadruple and four cases of triple carcinoma. The major associated malignancies were colonic carcinoma (n=9), gastric carcinoma (n=5), and uterine carcinoma (n=3). Twenty-one lesions were treated surgically or endoscopically. One patient died from synchronous extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma and one from leukemia, and one died from subsequent urinary bladder carcinoma. Development of other malignancies was related to age but not to gender, family history, adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy, or tumor pathology.

It is conceivable that appropriate manipulation of Notch signaling may become a useful tool in addressing a variety of human dysplastic condition and tissue regeneration.","['Vas, Virag', 'Kertesz, Zsuzsanna', 'Paloczi, Katalin', 'Uher, Ferenc']","['Vas V', 'Kertesz Z', 'Paloczi K', 'Uher F']","['Orszagos Gyogyintezeti Kozpont, Budapest.']",['hun'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', '*Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Notch', '*Signal Transduction']",2005/03/24 09:00,2005/04/06 09:00,['2005/03/24 09:00'],"['2005/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2005 Feb 13;146(7):309-16.,,,50,,A Notch-jeltovabbito rendszer szerepe a verkepzes szabalyozasaban.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, an attempt was made to clarify whether stem cell transplantation (SCT) had any advantages over chemotherapy. PROCEDURES: Of the 407 children with ALL diagnosed between 1984 and 1996, 117 suffered from a relapse before December 1999. The patients were treated differently according to the protocols of each institution. The potential prognostic factors examined were: the time of initial diagnosis, gender, immunophenotype of leukemic blasts and the NCI-risk classification at initial diagnosis, the site of relapse, the time of relapse (early: within 18 months after diagnosis, intermediate: other than either early or late relapse, late: later than 6 months after the discontinuation of front-line chemotherapy), and the treatment after relapse (chemotherapy alone and SCT). RESULTS: A second complete remission (CR2) was achieved in 90 patients (77%) and thirty of them maintained CR2, thus resulting in an event-free survival rate (EFS) of 25.1% and an overall survival rate of 26.1%. The significant prognostic factors identified by a multivariate analysis included the time of relapse (EFS: early 16.2%, intermediate 23.9%, late 35.1%, P = 0.012) and the treatment after relapse (EFS: SCT 30.3%, chemotherapy 22.0%, P = 0.049). When patients with an isolated bone marrow relapse and continuous CR2 for more than 3 months were analyzed, the treatment in CR2 was the only independent prognostic factor (EFS: SCT 60.2%, chemotherapy 25.7%, P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: In children with ALL and a first relapse, the time of relapse and the treatment after relapse were found to be independent prognostic factors. Allogeneic SCT in CR2 showed significantly better results than chemotherapy in patients with an isolated bone marrow relapse.","['Matsuzaki, Akinobu', 'Nagatoshi, Yoshihisa', 'Inada, Hiroko', 'Nakayama, Hideki', 'Yanai, Fumio', 'Ayukawa, Hiroshi', 'Kawakami, Kiyoshi', 'Moritake, Hiroshi', 'Suminoe, Aiko', 'Okamura, Jun']","['Matsuzaki A', 'Nagatoshi Y', 'Inada H', 'Nakayama H', 'Yanai F', 'Ayukawa H', 'Kawakami K', 'Moritake H', 'Suminoe A', 'Okamura J']","['Division of Child Health, School of Health Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. matsuzaki@shs.kyushu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/09/02 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20363 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Aug;45(2):111-20. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20363.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The patients and siblings were assessed prior to camp (Baseline), at the end of camp (Follow-up 1), and again 4-6 months later (Follow-up 2). Assessments included standardized tests for depressive affects, social competency, and a measure of pleasure and participation in camp activities. RESULTS: Sixty-six children were assessed, including 31 (47%) patients and 35 (53%) siblings. Ages ranged from 7 to 17 years. Of the patient campers 19 (61%) had leukemia or lymphoma and 12 (39%) had solid tumors. Results showed marked changes in affective symptoms for patient campers over time (improvements), not shown by sibling campers. For patient campers these affective changes were not present immediately after camp, but were quite significant when measured 4-6 months later. Both patient and sibling campers reflected the same positive memories and pleasure in camp activities over time. For neither group did memories or pleasure fade over time. The camping experience did not have differential impacts on first time versus returning campers. Twelve campers (18% of sample) indicated suicidal ideation on the measure of depressive affects. They did well at camp and presented no special management issues. CONCLUSION: Expectations appear substantially different for patient versus sibling campers. The camping experience appeared to impact these groups differently, with patient campers impacted in ways not experienced by sibling campers.","['Wellisch, David K', 'Crater, Brian', 'Wiley, Frances M', 'Belin, Thomas R', 'Weinstein, Karen']","['Wellisch DK', 'Crater B', 'Wiley FM', 'Belin TR', 'Weinstein K']","['Department of Psychiatry, UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles, 740 Westwood Plaza, Suite C8-849, Los Angeles, CA 90024, USA. dwellisch@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Camping/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychology', '*Sibling Relations', 'Suicide, Attempted/statistics & numerical data']",2005/03/23 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.922 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2006 Jan;15(1):56-65. doi: 10.1002/pon.922.,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective observational study in a 14-bed medical ICU at a tertiary university hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 172 consecutive patients with hematological malignancies admitted to the ICU for a life-threatening complication over a 4-year period were categorized into three main groups according to their admission diagnosis (documented bacterial infection, clinically suspected bacterial infection, nonbacterial complications) by an independent panel of three physicians blinded to the patient's outcome and C-reactive protein levels. RESULTS: In-hospital and 6-months mortality rates in documented bacterial infection (n=42), clinically suspected bacterial infection (n=40) vs. nonbacterial complications (n=90) were 50.0% and 42.5% vs. 65.6% (p=0.09 and 0.02) and 56.1% and 48.7% vs. 72.1% (p=0.11 and 0.02), respectively.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have previously been shown to induce hESC differentiation, in apparent contrast to mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, in which BMP4 synergizes with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to maintain self-renewal. Here we demonstrate that hESCs cultured in unconditioned medium (UM) are subjected to high levels of BMP signaling activity, which is reduced in CM. The BMP antagonist noggin synergizes with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to repress BMP signaling and sustain undifferentiated proliferation of hESCs in the absence of fibroblasts or CM. These findings suggest a basic difference in the self-renewal mechanism between mouse and human ES cells and simplify the culture of hESCs.","['Xu, Ren-He', 'Peck, Ruthann M', 'Li, Dong S', 'Feng, Xuezhu', 'Ludwig, Tenneille', 'Thomson, James A']","['Xu RH', 'Peck RM', 'Li DS', 'Feng X', 'Ludwig T', 'Thomson JA']","['WiCell Research Institute, Madison, Wisconsin 53707, USA. rxu@wicell.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Methods,Nature methods,101215604,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '148294-77-3 (noggin protein)']",IM,"['Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Combinations', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*administration & dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tissue Engineering/*methods']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/05/25 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['nmeth744 [pii]', '10.1038/nmeth744 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Methods. 2005 Mar;2(3):185-90. doi: 10.1038/nmeth744.

Two or more cooperating mechanisms, namely block in differentiation, enhanced proliferation and resistance to programmed cell death, underlie this neoplastic transformation. Nonrandom, complete and partial deletions of chromosome 5 are common anomalies in AML. Using positional cloning strategies, we characterized an evolutionarily conserved candidate myeloid leukemia suppressor gene encoding sequence-specific single-stranded DNA binding protein 2 (SSBP2) from chromosome 5q13.3, a locus that is frequently deleted in AML. Recent studies in Drosophila and Xenopus demonstrate a pivotal role for SSBPs in embryonic differentiation. In mammals, SSBP2 is one of three highly related and ubiquitously expressed genes. Here, we identify frequent loss of SSBP2 protein expression in human AML cell lines using highly specific antibodies. Furthermore, inducible expression of SSBP2 in the AML cell line U937 leads to loss of clonogenicity, G1 arrest and partial differentiation. Remarkably, inducible expression of SSBP2 is accompanied by downregulation of C-MYC expression. Our findings are consistent with human SSBP2 being a novel regulator of hematopoietic growth and differentiation, whose loss confers a block in differentiation advantage to myeloid leukemic cells.","['Liang, Hong', 'Samanta, Susmita', 'Nagarajan, Lalitha']","['Liang H', 'Samanta S', 'Nagarajan L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Box 45, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (SSBP2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/08/10 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208167 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208167 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Apr 14;24(16):2625-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208167.,,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL074449/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite significant advances, our understanding of its mechanisms of action remains incomplete. We have used a high-throughput proteomic immunoblotting approach to identify proteins whose expression levels are modulated by PTEN. Out of over 800 proteins screened, 22 proteins showed significant changes in expression. Five proteins that exhibited two-fold or greater changes in expression level were further characterized. AKAP121 and G3BP expression was reduced, while dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), Rap1 and RCC1 expression was elevated in response to PTEN expression in a PTEN-null T-cell leukemia line. The phosphatase activity of PTEN was required for these effects. However, direct inhibition of PI-3 Kinase could mimic PTEN in modulating expression of DHFR, G3BP, Rap1 and RCC1, but not AKAP121. Real-time PCR showed that the effects of PTEN were primarily post-transcriptional, and would not have been revealed by mRNA-based screens. We conclude from these data that PTEN can modulate the expression level of a number of different proteins. The identified proteins have the potential to serve as previously unrecognized effectors of PTEN, and suggest the existence of additional complexity in the modes by which PTEN can regulate cellular biology.","['Huang, Yanping', 'Wernyj, Roman P', 'Norton, Darrell D', 'Precht, Patricia', 'Seminario, Maria-Cristina', 'Wange, Ronald L']","['Huang Y', 'Wernyj RP', 'Norton DD', 'Precht P', 'Seminario MC', 'Wange RL']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Institute on Aging, IRP/NIH/DHHS, 5600 Nathan Shock Drive, MSC-12, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (A Kinase Anchor Proteins)', '0 (AKAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (RCC1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA Recognition Motif Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (G3BP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['A Kinase Anchor Proteins', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*analysis', 'Carrier Proteins/*analysis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*analysis', 'DNA Helicases', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/analysis', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*physiology', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Helicases', 'RNA Recognition Motif Proteins', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/06/10 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208527 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208527 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 May 26;24(23):3819-29. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208527.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these cells, enforced activation of Akt by a constitutively active myristolated Akt construct prevented 2ME-mediated mitochondrial injury, XIAP and Mcl-1 downregulation, JNK activation, and apoptosis, but not ROS generation. Conversely, 2ME lethality was potentiated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. Furthermore, in U937 cells, the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase and a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, TBAP, blocked these events, as well as Akt inactivation. Interruption of the JNK pathway by pharmacologic or genetic (e.g. siRNA) means attenuated 2ME-induced mitochondrial injury, XIAP and Mcl-1 downregulation, and apoptosis. Collectively, these findings suggest a hierarchical model of 2ME-related apoptosis induction in human leukemia cells in which 2ME-induced oxidative injury represents a primary event resulting in Akt inactivation, leading, in turn, to JNK activation, and culminating in XIAP and Mcl-1 downregulation, mitochondrial injury, and apoptosis. They also suggest that in human leukemia cells, the Akt pathway plays a critical role in mediating the response to oxidative stress induced by 2ME.","['Gao, Ning', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Gao N', 'Rahmani M', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '6I2QW73SR5 (2-Methoxyestradiol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['2-Methoxyestradiol', 'Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/06/10 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1208530 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208530 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 May 26;24(23):3797-809. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208530.,,PMC1679904,,"['R01 CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS3341'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBSERVATIONS: We screened 30 patients with erythroderma (20 patients with erythroderma of known etiology and 10 patients with idiopathic erythroderma) for the presence of circulating monoclonal T-lymphocyte populations using T-cell receptor (TCR)-gamma gene-specific polymerase chain reaction and automated capillary DNA electrophoresis. Moreover, the phenotypic analysis of peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocytes was performed using the following surface markers: CD3, CD7, CD8, CD25, CD26, CD27, CD28, CD29, CD30, CD45RO, CD45RA, CD56, CD134, HLA-DR, TCRalphabeta, TCRgammadelta, and cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA). In 5 patients with idiopathic erythroderma we detected T-cell clones in peripheral blood (in 1 case, associated with the presence of the same clone in the skin) and a 2-fold increase in the proportion of CD3+ CD4+ CD7- CD26- cells. Cell depletion studies indicated that the monoclonal T cells were present within the CD4+ CD7- cell population. Clinically, all patients had chronic, recalcitrant erythroderma but none developed any hematological malignancy during their lifetimes or fulfilled the criteria for cutaneous lymphoma or Sezary syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of patients with chronic erythroderma present with the monoclonal expansion of CD4+ CD7- CD26- lymphocytes in their blood. This condition represents a probably benign T-cell dyscrasia, or one of very low malignancy.

In this study, we explored if paricalcitol enhanced anticancer effects of other clinically useful drugs in vitro against a large variety of cancer cells. Paricalcitol, when combined with As2O3, showed a markedly enhanced antiproliferative effect against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. This combination induced monocytic differentiation of NB-4 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells and HL-60 AML cells and caused both to undergo apoptosis associated with down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L). Paricalcitol induced monocytic differentiation of U937 AML cells, which was partially blocked by inducing expression of APL-related PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) chimeric protein in the U937 cells containing a Zn2+-inducible expression vector coding for this fusion protein (PR9 cells). Exposure to As2O3 decreased levels of PML-RARalpha in PR9 cells, and the combination of paricalcitol and As2O3 enhanced their monocytic differentiation in parallel with the As2O3-mediated decrease of PML-RARalpha. Furthermore, As2O3 increased the transcriptional activity of paricalcitol probably by increasing intracellular levels of paricalcitol by decreasing the function of the mitochondrial enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase, which functions to metabolize the active vitamin D in cells. In summary, the combination of paricalcitol and As2O3 potently decreased growth and induced differentiation and apoptosis of AML cells. This probably occurred by As2O3 decreasing levels of both the repressive PML-RARalpha fusion protein and the vitamin D metabolizing protein, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase, resulting in increased activity of paricalcitol. The combination of both of these Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs should be considered for treatment of all-trans retinoic acid-resistant APL patients as well as those with other types of AML.","['Kumagai, Takashi', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Hughes, Susan V', 'Desmond, Julian C', ""O'Kelly, James"", 'Hewison, Martin', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Kumagai T', 'Shih LY', 'Hughes SV', 'Desmond JC', ""O'Kelly J"", 'Hewison M', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. kumamed1_2001@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '6702D36OG5 (paricalcitol)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.15.16 (Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ergocalciferols/administration & dosage', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/04/26 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/6/2488 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2800 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Mar 15;65(6):2488-97. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2800.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that common polymorphisms with moderate effect sizes and large attributive risks could explain an important fraction of ALL relapses. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is central to folate metabolism and has two common functional polymorphisms (C677T and A1298G). Methotrexate (MTX), which interrupts folate metabolism, is a mainstay of pediatric ALL therapy. MTX inhibits the synthesis of dTMP needed for DNA replication by blocking the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate by MTHFR. We hypothesized that a deactivating MTHFR allele would increase ALL relapse risk by potentially increasing 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and dTMP, enhancing DNA synthesis and thus opposing MTX. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 520 patients on the Children's Cancer Study Group ALL study, CCG-1891. The MTHFR C677T variant allele was statistically significantly associated with relapse (chi2 = 4.38, P = 0.036). This association remained significant (hazard ratio = 1.82, P = 0.008), controlling for important covariates, and was more predictive of relapse than other predictors, including day 7 bone marrow response. The MTHFR C677T variant allele was not associated with an increased risk of toxicity or infection. The MTHFR A1298G polymorphism was not associated with altered risks of relapse, toxicity, or infection. Haplotype analysis showed six common haplotypes that did not provide additional information predictive for relapse. These data provide evidence that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism is a common genetic variant conferring a moderate relative risk and a high attributable risk for relapse in pediatric ALL patients.","['Aplenc, Richard', 'Thompson, Jennifer', 'Han, Peggy', 'La, Mei', 'Zhao, Huaqing', 'Lange, Beverly', 'Rebbeck, Timothy']","['Aplenc R', 'Thompson J', 'Han P', 'La M', 'Zhao H', 'Lange B', 'Rebbeck T']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. raplenc@cceb.med.upenn.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/04/26 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/6/2482 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2606 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Mar 15;65(6):2482-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2606.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coadministration of sodium butyrate, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), or trichostatin with perifosine synergistically induced mitochondrial dysfunction (cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor release), caspase-3 and -8 activation, apoptosis, and a marked decrease in cell growth in U937 as well as HL-60 and Jurkat leukemia cells. These events were associated with inactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and Akt, p46 c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) activation, and a pronounced increase in generation of ceramide and reactive oxygen species (ROS). They were also associated with up-regulation of Bak and a marked conformational change in Bax accompanied by membrane translocation. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 delayed but was ultimately ineffective in preventing perifosine/HDACI-mediated apoptosis. Enforced expression of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1 or myristoylated Akt blocked HDACI/perifosine-mediated ceramide production and cell death, suggesting that MEK/ERK and Akt inactivation play a primary role in these phenomena. However, inhibition of JNK activation (e.g., by the JNK inhibitor SP600125) did not attenuate sodium butyrate/perifosine-induced apoptosis. In addition, the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine attenuated ROS generation and apoptosis mediated by combined treatment. Finally, the acidic sphingomyelinase inhibitor desipramine attenuated HDACI/perifosine-mediated ceramide and ROS production as well as cell death. Together, these findings indicate that coadministration of HDACIs with perifosine in human leukemia cells leads to Akt and MEK/ERK disruption, a marked increase in ceramide and ROS production, and a striking increase in mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. They also raise the possibility that combining these agents may represent a novel antileukemic strategy.","['Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Reese, Erin', 'Dai, Yun', 'Bauer, Cheryl', 'Payne, Shawn G', 'Dent, Paul', 'Spiegel, Sarah', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rahmani M', 'Reese E', 'Dai Y', 'Bauer C', 'Payne SG', 'Dent P', 'Spiegel S', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, School of Medicine, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '2GWV496552 (perifosine)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Butyrates/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphorylcholine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Vorinostat', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/04/26 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/6/2422 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2440 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Mar 15;65(6):2422-32. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2440.,,,,"['CA61774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data provide the first evidence that the prophylactic effect of green tea drinking on certain forms of cancer, suggested by epidemiologic studies, is due to the inhibition of DHFR by EGCG and could also explain why tea extracts have been traditionally used in ""alternative medicine"" as anticarcinogenic/antibiotic agents or in the treatment of conditions such as psoriasis. EGCG exhibited kinetics characteristic of a slow, tight-binding inhibitor of 7,8-dihydrofolate reduction with bovine liver DHFR (K(I) = 0.109 micromol/L), but of a classic, reversible, competitive inhibitor with chicken liver DHFR (K(I) = 10.3 micromol/L). Structural modeling showed that EGCG can bind to human DHFR at the same site and in a similar orientation to that observed for some structurally characterized DHFR inhibitor complexes. The responses of lymphoma cells to EGCG and known antifolates were similar, that is, a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth (IC50 = 20 micromol/L for EGCG), G0-G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle, and induction of apoptosis. Folate depletion increased the sensitivity of these cell lines to antifolates and EGCG. These effects were attenuated by growing the cells in a medium containing hypoxanthine-thymidine, consistent with DHFR being the site of action for EGCG.","['Navarro-Peran, Enma', 'Cabezas-Herrera, Juan', 'Garcia-Canovas, Francisco', 'Durrant, Marcus C', 'Thorneley, Roger N F', 'Rodriguez-Lopez, Jose Neptuno']","['Navarro-Peran E', 'Cabezas-Herrera J', 'Garcia-Canovas F', 'Durrant MC', 'Thorneley RN', 'Rodriguez-Lopez JN']","['Grupo de Investigacion de Enzimologia, Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular A, Facultad de Biologia, Universidad de Murcia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tea)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/*chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Quinazolines/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tea/*chemistry', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*chemistry/*metabolism']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/04/26 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/6/2059 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3469 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Mar 15;65(6):2059-64. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3469.,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 15;65(18):8573.

The fusion protein encoded by BCR-ABL possesses an aberrantly regulated tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI-571) is an inhibitor of ABL tyrosine kinase activity that has been remarkably effective in slowing disease progression in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, but the emergence of imatinib resistance underscores the need for additional therapies. Targeting signaling pathways activated by BCR-ABL is a promising approach for drug development. The study of signaling components downstream of BCR-ABL and the related murine oncogene v-Abl has revealed a complex web of signals that promote cell division and survival. Of these, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) has emerged as one of the essential signaling mechanisms in ABL leukemogenesis. This review describes molecular mechanisms by which PI3K is activated and the downstream PI3K effectors that propagate the signal to promote myeloid and lymphoid transformation. Of particular recent interest is the mammalian target of rapamycin, a PI3K-regulated kinase that regulates protein synthesis and contributes to leukemogenesis.","['Kharas, Michael G', 'Fruman, David A']","['Kharas MG', 'Fruman DA']","['Center for Immunology and Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697-3900, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genes, abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/04/26 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['65/6/2047 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3888 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Mar 15;65(6):2047-53. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3888.,,,100,"['AI50831/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA9054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, a BXH-2-specific recessive mutation causes a myeloproliferative syndrome. Second, retroviral insertions alter oncogenes or tumor suppressors, resulting in clonal expansion of leukemic cells. We have identified a recessive locus on chromosome 8 (Myls) that is responsible for myeloproliferation in BXH-2. This Myls interval has been narrowed down to 2 Mb and found to contain several positional candidates, including the interferon consensus sequence-binding protein 1 gene (Icsbp, also known as interferon regulatory factor 8 [IRF8]). We show that BXH-2 mice carry a mutation (915 C to T) resulting in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at position 294 within the predicted IRF association domain of the protein. Although expression of Icsbp1 mRNA transcripts is normal in BXH-2 splenocytes, these cells are unable to produce interleukin 12 and interferon-gamma in response to activating stimuli, confirming that R294C behaves as a loss-of-function mutation. Myeloproliferation in BXH-2 mice is concomitant to increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) despite the presence of resistance alleles at the Nramp1 locus. These results suggest a two-step model for chronic myeloid leukemia in BXH-2, in which inactivation of Icsbp1 predisposes to myeloproliferation and immunodeficiency. This event is required for retroviral replication, and subsequent insertional mutagenesis that causes leukemia in BXH-2 mice.","['Turcotte, Karine', 'Gauthier, Susan', 'Tuite, Ashleigh', 'Mullick, Alaka', 'Malo, Danielle', 'Gros, Philippe']","['Turcotte K', 'Gauthier S', 'Tuite A', 'Mullick A', 'Malo D', 'Gros P']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill Cancer Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3G 1Y6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Arginine/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian/genetics', 'Cysteine/genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/genetics/virology', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/physiopathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/genetics/physiology', '*Mycobacterium bovis', '*Point Mutation', 'Quantitative Trait Loci/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Retroviridae/physiology', 'Spleen/cytology/physiopathology', 'Tuberculosis/genetics/*veterinary/virology', 'Virus Replication/genetics/physiology']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/06/04 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20042170 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20042170 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2005 Mar 21;201(6):881-90. doi: 10.1084/jem.20042170.,,PMC2213093,,['12038-3/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the recovery characteristics of two anesthetic techniques: propofol with sevoflurane and nitrous oxide and a total IV technique using propofol and remifentanil. Twenty-one children, undergoing two similar painful procedures within 2 wk were studied in a single-blind manner within patient comparison. The order of the techniques was randomized. Propofol and remifentanil involved bolus doses of both propofol 3-5 mg/kg and remifentanil 1-4 microg/kg. Propofol with sevoflurane and nitrous oxide involved propofol 3-5 mg/kg with 2%-8% sevoflurane and 70% nitrous oxide. The primary outcome variable was the time taken to achieve recovery discharge criteria; other recovery characteristics were also noted. The mean age of the children was 6.5 yr (range, 2.5-9.8 yr). Nineteen had lymphoblastic leukemia and two had lymphoma. All children had intrathecal chemotherapy and one had bone marrow aspiration. Most procedures lasted <4 min. The mean time to achieve recovery discharge criteria was appreciably shorter after propofol and remifentanil than propofol with sevoflurane and nitrous oxide by nearly 19 min (P = 0.001). All other time comparisons had similar trends and statistical differences. Seven parents expressed a preference for the propofol and remifentanil technique compared with one preferring propofol with sevoflurane and nitrous oxide. Children are apneic during the procedure and require respiratory support from an anesthesiologist. Discharge readiness from the recovery ward was achieved on average 19 min earlier after propofol with remifentanil compared with the combination of propofol, sevoflurane and nitrous oxide. Parents more often preferred propofol with remifentanil.","['Glaisyer, Hilary R', 'Sury, Michael R J']","['Glaisyer HR', 'Sury MRJ']","['Department of Anaesthesia, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Anesth Analg,Anesthesia and analgesia,1310650,"['0 (Anesthetics, Inhalation)', '0 (Anesthetics, Intravenous)', '0 (Methyl Ethers)', '0 (Piperidines)', '38LVP0K73A (Sevoflurane)', 'K50XQU1029 (Nitrous Oxide)', 'P10582JYYK (Remifentanil)', 'YI7VU623SF (Propofol)']",IM,"['*Anesthesia Recovery Period', '*Anesthesia, Inhalation', '*Anesthesia, Intravenous', '*Anesthetics, Inhalation', '*Anesthetics, Intravenous', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hemodynamics/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Methyl Ethers', 'Neoplasms/*surgery', '*Nitrous Oxide', '*Piperidines', '*Propofol', 'Remifentanil', 'Sevoflurane', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/04/13 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['00000539-200504000-00010 [pii]', '10.1213/01.ANE.0000147667.06156.DF [doi]']",ppublish,Anesth Analg. 2005 Apr;100(4):959-963. doi: 10.1213/01.ANE.0000147667.06156.DF.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1213/01.ANE.0000147667.06156.DF [doi],

Activating mutations of Flt3 are the most common molecular abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and have an apparent role in leukemogenesis. However, signaling pathways mediating Flt3 effects are incompletely understood. The role of Src kinases is unknown, although some, such as Lyn, have also been linked to leukemogenesis. This study examines the role of Src kinases in Flt3 signaling and the oncogenic effects of leukemia-associated Flt3 mutations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the activation and functional roles of Src kinases in human leukemic myeloid cell lines expressing wild-type Flt3 or a constitutively active mutant, and in cells stably transduced with human wild-type or mutant Flt3. RESULTS: Flt3 ligand stimulation of wild-type Flt3 increased phosphorylation of Src kinase Lyn. Constitutive Lyn phosphorylation and activation was found in cells expressing constitutively active Flt3 mutants. Src kinases are implicated in downregulation of closely related receptors, but Src inhibitors had no effect on ligand-stimulated Flt3 degradation, or on the rapid degradation of an Flt3 mutant. However, growth-factor-independent proliferation resulting from mutant Flt3 expression did depend on the activity of Src kinases. CONCLUSION: Our studies reveal for the first time the involvement of Src kinases in Flt3 signaling, with activation of Lyn by constitutively active Flt3 mutants as well as ligand-stimulated wild-type receptor, and show that Src kinase inhibitors block proliferative effects of Flt3 mutants found in AML. Thus, Src kinases may represent targets for inhibitor therapy in Flt3-related AML.","['Robinson, Lisa J', 'Xue, Jia', 'Corey, Seth J']","['Robinson LJ', 'Xue J', 'Corey SJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical School, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA. robinsonlj@msx.upmc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/05/19 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2004/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2004/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2005/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00065-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2005 Apr;33(4):469-79. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.01.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At low levels of benzene exposure, urinary t,t-MA correlated strongly with benzene in air. Highest Olive tail moments were found in workers producing carbomer. Levels of breathzone benzene were found to be strongly correlated with Olive tail moment values in the lymphocytes of workers, but not with hematological data in the six workplaces types.

Chromosomal rearrangements involving these elements occur in somatic and germline cells and are causative for many diseases. To begin to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to these rearrangements in mammalian cells, we developed an intron-based system to specifically induce chromosomal translocations at Alu elements, the most numerous family of repetitive elements in humans. With this system, we found that when double-strand breaks (DSBs) were introduced adjacent to identical Alu elements, translocations occurred at high frequency and predominantly arose from repair by the single-strand annealing (SSA) pathway (85%).

Translation of the same RNA according to conventional translational rules produces Gag, the precursor of the structural proteins of the virus. The efficiency of the frameshift controls the ratio of Gag-Pol to Gag, which is critical for viral infectivity. The Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) uses a different strategy, the programmed readthrough of a stop codon, to synthesize Gag-Pol. In this study, we investigated whether different forms of the HIV-1 frameshift region can functionally replace the readthrough signal in MoMuLV. Chimeric proviral DNAs were obtained by inserting into the MoMuLV genome the HIV-1 frameshift region encompassing the slippery sequence where the frameshift occurs, followed by the frameshift stimulatory signal. The inserted signal was either a simple stem-loop, previously considered as the stimulatory signal, or a longer bulged helix, now shown to be the complete stimulatory signal, or a mutated version of the complete signal with a three-nucleotide deletion. Although the three chimeric viruses can propagate essentially as the wild-type virus in NIH 3T3 cells, single-round infectivity assays revealed that the infectivity of the chimeric virions is about three to fivefold lower than that of the wild-type virions, depending upon the nature of the frameshift signal. It was also observed that the Gag-Pol to Gag ratio was decreased about two to threefold in chimeric virions. Comparison of the readthrough efficiency of MoMuLV to the HIV-1 frameshift efficiency, by monitoring the expression of a luciferase reporter in cultured cells, revealed that the frameshift efficiencies were only 30-60% of the readthrough efficiency. Altogether, these observations indicate that replacement of the readthrough region of MoMuLV with the frameshift region of HIV-1 results in virions that are replication competent, although less infectious than wild-type MoMuLV. This type of chimera could provide an interesting tool for in vivo studies of novel drugs targeted against the HIV-1 frameshift event.","['Gendron, Karine', 'Dulude, Dominic', 'Lemay, Guy', 'Ferbeyre, Gerardo', 'Brakier-Gingras, Lea']","['Gendron K', 'Dulude D', 'Lemay G', 'Ferbeyre G', 'Brakier-Gingras L']","['Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, 2900, Boulevard Edouard-Montpetit, D-353, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1J4.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Frameshifting, Ribosomal', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, gag', 'Genes, pol', 'HIV-1/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism', 'Virion/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Virus Replication']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/06/14 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2004/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2005/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(05)00094-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2005.01.044 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2005 Apr 10;334(2):342-52. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2005.01.044.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, the possible roles of two distinct proviral enhancer nuclear factor 1 (NF1) binding sites in osteopetrosis and tumor induction by B-lymphomagenic Akv1-99 MLV were investigated. Akv1-99 and mutants either with NF1 site 1, NF1 site 2 or both sites disrupted induced tumors (plasma cell proliferations by histopathology) with remarkably similar incidence and mean latency in inbred NMRI mice. Clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement detection, by Southern analysis, confirmed approximately half of the tumors induced by each virus to be plasmacytomas while the remaining lacked detectable clonally rearranged Ig genes and were considered polyclonal; a demonstration that enhancer NF1 sites are dispensable for plasmacytoma induction by Akv1-99. In contrast, X-ray analysis revealed significant differences in osteopetrosis induction by the four viruses strongly indicating that NF1 site 2 is critical for viral bone pathogenicity, whereas NF1 site 1 is neutral or moderately inhibitory. In conclusion, enhancer NF1 sites are major determinants of osteopetrosis induction by Akv1-99 without significant influence on viral oncogenicity.","['Sorensen, Karina Dalsgaard', 'Sorensen, Annette Balle', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Kunder, Sandra', 'Schmidt, Jorg', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Sorensen KD', 'Sorensen AB', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Kunder S', 'Schmidt J', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, C.F.

Currently used cell lines are derived from hepatic tumours and have altered gene expression. AIMS: The generation and characterisation of novel human hepatocyte lines (HHLs) derived from healthy human liver, retaining the primary hepatocyte phenotype. RESULTS: Primary hepatocytes were immortalised with Moloney's mouse leukaemia virus expressing E6 and E7 proteins of human papillomavirus, and cultures propagated long-term. All HHLs contained markers of hepatocyte and biliary phenotype (cytokeratins 7, 8, 18 and 19), Cytochrome P450 and albumin. The HHLs did not express high levels of p53 or alpha-fetoprotein. When grown in a collagen sandwich culture, or at the air-liquid interface, HHLs were maintained as monolayer whereas Huh-7 and HepG2 formed thick layers. All HHLs showed increased capacity to bind recombinant hepatitis C virus-like particles in comparison with Huh-7 and HepG2. We also demonstrate that HHLs contained active gap junctions, and that the cells respond to stimulation with IFN-alpha by upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I and -II. CONCLUSIONS: These HHLs retain primary hepatocyte phenotype and should be useful for investigating mechanisms of entry and replication of hepatotropic viruses, and should also be valuable in the study of hepatocyte biology and pathology.","['Clayton, Reginald F', 'Rinaldi, Angela', 'Kandyba, Eve E', 'Edward, Mike', 'Willberg, Christian', 'Klenerman, Paul', 'Patel, Arvind H']","['Clayton RF', 'Rinaldi A', 'Kandyba EE', 'Edward M', 'Willberg C', 'Klenerman P', 'Patel AH']","['MRC Virology Unit, Institute of Virology, Glasgow G11 5JR, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Liver Int,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,101160857,['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gap Junctions', 'Hepatocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Reference Values', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['LIV1017 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1478-3231.2005.01017.x [doi]']",ppublish,Liver Int. 2005 Apr;25(2):389-402. doi: 10.1111/j.1478-3231.2005.01017.x.,,,,,,,['Copyright Blackwell Munksgaard 2005'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oral cancer ranks second in this population, in both genders. The incidence is the highest reported worldwide. Incident oral cancer cases received at the Karachi Cancer Registry during 1(st) January 1995 to 30(th) June 2004 were reviewed. To ensure maximally complete data, cases registered between 1(st) January 1995 and 31(st) December 2002 were considered for the present study. Cases of lymphoma, leukemia and melanoma were not included. Trends were studied by grouping cases into two periods, 1995-1997 and 1998-2002. A total of 2253 cases of oral cancer were registered in Karachi South for the 8 year study period accounting for 8.8% of all cancer cases. Overall, the most common site was the mucosa cheek (55.9%), followed by the tongue (28.4%), palate (6.8%), gum (4.4%), lip (3.1%) and floor of the mouth (1.4%). About 30% of cases occurred in patients 40 years and younger and 23% occurred in patients 65 years and older. Sub-categories of oral cancer showed variation in trends, but an earlier onset of disease in period two was evident for all categories. The incidence of lip cancer in men decreased, the rates remained level in females. An increased incidence was observed for tongue, but a more dramatic increase in the cheek was evident in both sexes, despite no improvement during the past decade in detection of early, localized lesions. A strong socio-economic factor with a poorer, low literacy profile of oral cancer was apparent in the entire study period. The evidence that the largest increase in incidence has occurred in this population may unfavorably affect the mortality rates. Oral cancer trends are an interplay of prevalent risk factors, the level of prevalence, preventive education and intervention. Cost effective and efficient cancer control focused around the target populations would be beneficial for Pakistan. Educational campaigns should include information on oral hygiene, awareness of risk factors and symptoms and the importance of seeking early professional help when any of these are recognized. Audio-visual media involvement is imperative in view of the literacy status of the target population. Capacity building is required by the Government to increase the availability and accessibility of professionals. Population screening would reduce the incidence of oral cancer, but requires careful planning, and extensive financial resources. Mobilization of general practitioners, health visitors, volunteer organizations and medical students for early detection of oral cancer is the essential need of today.","['Bhurgri, Yasmin']",['Bhurgri Y'],"['Karachi Cancer Registry, Sindh Medical College, Department of Pathology, Adjacent Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan. bhurgri@cyber.net.pk']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'History, 18th Century', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Pakistan/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",2005/03/23 09:00,2005/05/20 09:00,['2005/03/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2005 Jan-Mar;6(1):22-6.,,,,,,,,,,['Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2005 Jul-Sep;6(3):420.

A strong candidate to support oligodendrocyte survival after spinal cord injury is the pleiotropic cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In vitro, LIF potentiates the differentiation and survival of oligodendrocyte precursors. LIF can also prevent oligodendrocyte apoptosis in response to either growth factor removal or cytotoxic challenge. More recently, in vivo studies have demonstrated that LIF is effective in preventing oligodendrocyte death in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We therefore asked whether systemic delivery of LIF could ameliorate oligodendrocyte death in a mouse model of spinal cord injury. We have found that daily administration of LIF (25 microg/kg/day) promotes oligodendrocyte survival after spinal cord injury. Interestingly however, this effect does not appear to be mediated by a direct action of LIF on the oligodendrocyte but rather via an ancillary cell type, which results in augmented expression of another trophic factor capable of supporting oligodendrocyte survival, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).","['Kerr, Bradley J', 'Patterson, Paul H']","['Kerr BJ', 'Patterson PH']","['Biology Division, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA. bradley.kerr@mail.mcgill.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligodendroglia/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/*pathology']",2005/03/22 09:00,2005/07/28 09:00,['2005/03/22 09:00'],"['2005/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/glia.20177 [doi]'],ppublish,Glia. 2005 Jul;51(1):73-9. doi: 10.1002/glia.20177.,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['Glia. 2005 Nov 15;52(3):259'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors conducted a nested case-control study of the familial risk of 40 cancers based on a cohort of 662,515 individuals from the Utah Population Database. From 1 to 10 controls selected from the cohort were matched individually on gender, birth year, and birthplace to each cancer case; and familial standardized incidence ratios (FSIR) were calculated for both cases and controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate relative risks and population-attributable risks (PARs) of cancer in relation to FSIR. Relative risks of cancer in first-degree through fifth-degree relatives of cases, compared with controls, were calculated using the proportional hazards methods. All analyses were adjusted for spouse affection status and Latter Day Saints church affiliation. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 40 cancers exhibited positive associations between risk and FSIR, and 21 of those associations were statistically significant. PAR estimates were strikingly high for prostate carcinoma (57%), breast carcinoma (39%), colon carcinoma (32%), lip carcinoma (31%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (35%), and melanoma (32%). Both the proportion and the number of all cancers attributable to family history peaked at 32% in the group ages 65-84 years and remained high in the group age >/= 85 years. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial portion of cancer risk was attributable to familial factors. The patterns of familial cancer recurrence among distant relatives suggested that simple genetic mechanisms may explain much of the familiality of cancer.","['Kerber, Richard A', ""O'Brien, Elizabeth""]","['Kerber RA', ""O'Brien E""]","['Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112-5550, USA. rich.kerber@hci.utah.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Factual', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', '*Medical History Taking', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Population Surveillance', 'Risk Factors', 'Utah/epidemiology']",2005/03/22 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/03/22 09:00'],"['2005/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20989 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 May 1;103(9):1906-15. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20989.,,,,"['N01-PC-35141/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AG018712/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R03CA084560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29CA069421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['(c) 2005 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL is required for the proper maintenance of HOX gene expression during development and hematopoiesis. The exact regulatory mechanism of HOX gene expression by MLL is poorly understood, but it is believed that MLL functions at the level of chromatin organization. MLL was identified as a common target of chromosomal translocations associated with human acute leukemias. About 50 different MLL fusion partners have been isolated to date, and while similarities exist between groups of partners, there exists no unifying property shared by all the partners. MLL gene rearrangements are found in leukemias with both lymphoid and myeloid phenotypes and are often associated with infant and secondary leukemias. The immature phenotype of the leukemic blasts suggests an important role for MLL in the early stages of hematopoietic development. Mll homozygous mutant mice are embryonic lethal and exhibit deficiencies in yolk sac hematopoiesis. Recently, two different MLL-containing protein complexes have been isolated. These and other gain- and loss-of-function experiments have provided insight into normal MLL function and altered functions of MLL fusion proteins. This article reviews the progress made toward understanding the function of the wild-type MLL protein. While many advances in understanding this multifaceted protein have been made since its discovery, many challenging questions remain to be answered.","['Popovic, Relja', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J']","['Popovic R', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ']","['Molecular Biology Program, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology']",2005/03/22 09:00,2005/11/08 09:00,['2005/03/22 09:00'],"['2005/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20430 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2005 May 15;95(2):234-42. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20430.,,,49,['CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs) (nuclear domain 10s (ND10s)) are the primary localization site for the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein and the SP100 autoantigen. The observations that some PML and SP100 isoforms can function as transcriptional regulators, that both the size and number of PML bodies increase in response to interferon treatment, and that many mammalian viruses encode proteins that mediate disruption of PML bodies suggest that these sites suppress viral infection, perhaps by repressing viral gene expression. We hypothesized that a component of PML NBs functions as a repressor of gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the effect of PML or SP100 isoforms on expression of transfected reporter genes. PML-I, PML-VI, and SP100A did not repress reporter gene expression. In contrast, SP100B repressed reporter gene expression, especially under conditions in which the reporter gene expression was elevated by a viral transactivator or addition of trichostatin A to the culture medium. The SP100B DNA binding domain was required for repression. SP100B had no detectable effect on the amount, methylation pattern, or topological form of plasmid DNA in the nuclei of transfected cells. The demonstrated repressive activity of SP100B supports the hypothesis that SP100B is a component of an innate immune response that represses expression of ectopic DNA.","['Wilcox, Kent W', 'Sheriff, Scott', 'Isaac, Anne', 'Taylor, Jerry L']","['Wilcox KW', 'Sheriff S', 'Isaac A', 'Taylor JL']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/*physiology', 'Autoantigens/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Primers', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Vero Cells']",2005/03/22 09:00,2005/11/08 09:00,['2005/03/22 09:00'],"['2005/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20434 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2005 May 15;95(2):352-65. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20434.,,,,"['AI17246/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DE14137/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'EY13546/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients exposed to DNA inter-strand crosslinking (ICL) agents subsequently experience an elevated incidence of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and MDS related acute myeloid leukemia. Fanconi's anemia (FA) patients are deficient in the repair of crosslink DNA damage and they experience a high incidence of MDS. These observations indicate that hematopoietic cells are specific target for the transforming effects of DNA crosslinking damage. Changes in transcript levels were characterized in human hematopoietic cells occurring in response to the nitrogen mustard, mechlorethamine (HN2), but not in response to monofunctional analogs. Only modest changes in a few gene transcripts were detected in HL60 cells exposed to levels of HN2 tittered to maximal dose that caused growth suppression with minimal cell death and allowed eventual resumption of normal cell growth. Under conditions of transient growth suppression, a subset of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) isoenzyme genes was consistently upregulated three to fourfold by HN2, but not by monofunctional analogs. Subsequent efforts to confirm the changes detected by microarray analyses revealed an unexpected dependence on treatment conditions. The GST alpha class A2 subfamily member transcripts were upregulated 24 h after a 1 h exposure to HN2 that caused an extensive, but transient block in late S/G2 cell cycle phase, but were minimally altered with continuous exposure. The 1-h exposure to HN2 caused a transient late S/G2 cell cycle arrest in both the HL-60 cell line and the Colo 320HSR human colon cancer cell line. Overexpression of GSTA2 by transient transfection protected Colo 320HSR cells against both cycle arrest and apoptosis following exposure to HN2. Overexpression of GSTA2 in Colo 320HSR cells induced after exposure to HN2 did not alter cycle arrest or apoptosis. The results indicate that human GSTA2 facilitates the protection of cells from HN2 damage and not repair. Our results are consistent with the possibility that GSTA2 polymorphisms, variable isoenzyme expression, and variable induced expression may be factors in the pathogenesis of MDS.","['Xie, Jingping', 'Shults, Keith', 'Flye, Leanne', 'Jiang, Fen', 'Head, David R', 'Briggs, Robert C']","['Xie J', 'Shults K', 'Flye L', 'Jiang F', 'Head DR', 'Briggs RC']","['Department of Pathology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-5310, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mechlorethamine/*pharmacology', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transfection']",2005/03/22 09:00,2005/11/08 09:00,['2005/03/22 09:00'],"['2005/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20440 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2005 May 15;95(2):339-51. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20440.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, delays in immune reconstitution (IR) following HSCT significantly limit the success of transplantation and increase the risk for infection and disease relapse in the transplant recipient. Therefore, ways to measure and to manipulate immune recovery following HSCT are emerging and their success depends directly upon an enhanced understanding for the underlying mechanisms responsible for reconstituted immunity and hematopoiesis. Recent discoveries in the activation, function, and regulation of dendritic cell (DC), natural killer (NK) cell, and T-lymphocyte subtypes have been critical in developing immunotherapies used to prevent graft-versus-host disease and to enhance graft-versus-leukemia. For example, regulatory T cells that induce tolerance and NK receptor-tumor ligand disparities that result in tumor lysis are being used to minimize GVHD and tumor burden, respectively. Furthermore, expansion and modulation of immune effector cells are being used to augment hematopoietic and immune recovery and to decrease transplant-related toxicity in the transplant recipient. Specifically, DC expansion and incorporation into antitumor and anti-microbial vaccines is fast approaching application into clinical trials. This paper will review our current understanding for IR following HSCT and the novel ways in which to restore immune function and decrease transplant-related toxicity in the transplant recipient.","['Auletta, J J', 'Lazarus, H M']","['Auletta JJ', 'Lazarus HM']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University/University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH, USA. jeffery.auletta@case.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoiesis/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immune System', '*Immunotherapy', 'Recovery of Function/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/03/22 09:00,2005/08/19 09:00,['2005/03/22 09:00'],"['2005/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['1704966 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1704966 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2005 May;35(9):835-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704966.,,,298,['AI 57801/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-cell proliferation is critical for mounting an effective adaptive immune response. It is regulated by signals through the T-cell receptor, through co-stimulation and through cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) lies downstream of each of these pathways and has been directly implicated in the regulation of lymphocyte proliferation. 2. In this study, we have shown that PI3K regulates cyclin D2 and cyclin D3, the first cell cycle proteins induced in T-cell proliferation, transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. In T-lymphoblasts, LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, prevents the induction of both D-type cyclin mRNA and protein, while rapamycin inhibits the induction of protein. Rapamycin inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which lies downstream of PI3K. 3. Furthermore, our data show that the combination of LY294002 and rapamycin results in a co-operative inhibition of T-cell proliferation. This co-operation occurs in Kit225 cells stimulated with IL-2, and also in resting peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated with antibodies to the T-cell receptor in the presence and absence of antibodies to CD28. 4. These data indicate that PI3K regulates T-cell proliferation in response to diverse stimuli, and suggest that combinations of inhibitors, perhaps isoform-selective, may be useful as alternative immunosuppressive therapies.","['Breslin, Elaine M', 'White, Paul C', 'Shore, Angharad M', 'Clement, Mathew', 'Brennan, Paul']","['Breslin EM', 'White PC', 'Shore AM', 'Clement M', 'Brennan P']","['Infection and Immunity, Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff University, Henry Wellcome Research Building, Heath Park, Cardiff CF14 XX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromones/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",2005/03/22 09:00,2005/07/15 09:00,['2005/03/22 09:00'],"['2005/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['0706061 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjp.0706061 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2005 Mar;144(6):791-800. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0706061.,,PMC1576062,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TGF-beta, which has been shown to enhance transmission of HTLV-I in vitro, is found at high levels in breast milk and semen. In this study, the ability of TGF-beta to regulate expression of molecules involved in HTLV-I binding and entry was examined. Previous studies using a soluble form of the HTLV-I envelope protein SU have shown that quiescent human T cells do not express cell surface molecules that specifically bind SU. After T cell activation, HTLV SU binding proteins are rapidly induced. In this study, we report that TGF-beta induces expression of proteins that bind soluble HTLV SU and HTLV virions on naive CD4(+) T lymphocytes. The induction of these proteins occurred without cell cycle entry or expression of activation markers, involved TGF-beta-induced intracellular signaling, and required de novo transcription and translation. Treatment of naive CD4(+) T lymphocytes with TGF-beta induced expression of GLUT-1, which has recently been reported to function as a receptor for HTLV. Treatment of a TGF-beta-sensitive human myeloid cell line increased the titer of both HTLV-I- and HTLV-II-pseudotyped viruses. Although earlier studies suggested that HTLV SU binding proteins might be an early marker of T cell activation and/or cell proliferation, we report in this study that TGF-beta induces binding of HTLV virions and expression of glucose transporter type 1 in primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes that remain quiescent.","['Jones, Kathryn S', 'Akel, Salem', 'Petrow-Sadowski, Cari', 'Huang, Ying', 'Bertolette, Daniel C', 'Ruscetti, Francis W']","['Jones KS', 'Akel S', 'Petrow-Sadowski C', 'Huang Y', 'Bertolette DC', 'Ruscetti FW']","['Basic Research Program, Science Applications International Corporation-Frederick, Inc., National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA. jonesk@ncifcrf.gov <jonesk@ncifcrf.gov>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'Fetal Blood', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/03/22 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/03/22 09:00'],"['2005/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/7/4262 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.7.4262 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Apr 1;174(7):4262-70. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.7.4262.,,,,['N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify regulatory elements involved in KIR gene activation, upstream regions of KIR genes were functionally characterized in NK3.3 cells as well as in primary NK cells. Three kinds of KIR promoters were defined, controlling clonally expressed KIR genes, the constitutively active KIR2DL4, and the weakly expressed KIR3DL3. Upstream of a short core promoter common to all KIR genes, a region containing functionally divergent elements was characterized. Although this region had no impact on the activity of the KIR2DL3 promoter, an inhibitory element was identified in the KIR2DL4 promoter and an activating element was found in the KIR3DL3 promoter. Upon treatment with a methyltransferase inhibitor, KIR3DL3 expression could be readily induced showing that the low levels of KIR3DL3 expression in peripheral blood are due to sustained DNA methylation of an otherwise fully functional promoter. Analysis of transcription factor binding sites identified a functional acute myeloid leukemia (AML) site common to all three KIR promoters. Mutation of this site led to a substantial increase in activity of all KIR promoters. Among the different members of the AML family, AML-2 was identified as the predominant KIR binding factor. The present study suggests that AML-2 acts as a repressor of KIR expression in mature NK cells and opens the possibility that AML factors and associated cofactors are involved in regulation of KIR expression during NK cell development.","['Trompeter, Hans-Ingo', 'Gomez-Lozano, Natalia', 'Santourlidis, Simeon', 'Eisermann, Britta', 'Wernet, Peter', 'Vilches, Carlos', 'Uhrberg, Markus']","['Trompeter HI', 'Gomez-Lozano N', 'Santourlidis S', 'Eisermann B', 'Wernet P', 'Vilches C', 'Uhrberg M']","['Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KIR2DL3 protein, human)', '0 (KIR2DL4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL3)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL4)', '0 (Runx3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Receptors, KIR2DL3', 'Receptors, KIR2DL4', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2005/03/22 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/03/22 09:00'],"['2005/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['174/7/4135 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.174.7.4135 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Apr 1;174(7):4135-43. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.174.7.4135.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A cohort of 5514 workers who had been occupationally exposed to benzene in 1966/67 or earlier was assembled by the former Factory Inspectorate and the Medical Research Council from details provided by 233 employers in England and Wales. The cohort was followed up for mortality (1968-2002) and cancer registrations (1971-2001). National mortality rates and cancer registration (incidence) rates were used to calculate standardised mortality ratios and standardised registration ratios. RESULTS: Mortality was close to expectation for all causes and significantly increased for cancer of the lip, cancer of the lung and bronchus, secondary and unspecified cancers, acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL), and all neoplasms. Significant deficits were shown for three non-malignant categories (mental disorders, diseases of the digestive system, accidents). SMRs for other leukaemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma were close to or below expectation. There was some evidence of under-ascertainment of cancer registrations, although significantly increased SRRs were shown for lung cancer and cancer of the pleura (mesothelioma). CONCLUSIONS: Many study subjects would have been exposed to carcinogens other than benzene (for example, asbestos, rubber industry fumes, foundry fumes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), and the excesses of lung cancer and mesothelioma are likely to reflect exposures to these other carcinogens.

M1 cell, a mouse acute myeloid leukemia cell line, which underwent growth inhibition, terminal differentiation and apoptosis in response to IL-6, was selected as an experimental model to study on the molecular mechanisms of myeloid cell differentiation on a proteome-wide scale. Cell differentiation was evaluated by cell morphology and CD11b expression. With two-dimensional (2D) gel analyses, 17 protein spots showed obvious changes in quantity during the process of differentiation were found. With matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) or/and nano-electrospray ionization MS/MS (ESI-MS/MS) analysis, 15 protein spots were identified. The mRNA levels of these 15 proteins during differentiation were also examined using a semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Except two proteins, the mRNA levels demonstrated similar expression patterns to what the proteomic analysis revealed. The identified proteins were known to be involved in different cellular functions, including protein synthesis, transcription, signal transduction, cell cycle control, cell rescue and defense, cellular organization, and metabolism.

Over expression of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates (9-OAcSGs) on lymphoblasts and concomitant anti-9-OAcSGs was found to have a diagnostic and prognostic potential. However, the presence of circulatory immune-complexed antigens remains unknown. The present study was aimed to evaluate whether immune-complexed 9-OAcSGs can be harnessed for better disease management. Immune-complexed antigens were evaluated in ALL sera (n=262) by a Dot-blot using a 9-OAcSAalpha2-6GalNAc-specific lectin, Achatinin-H. Using three serum samples, the inter- and intra-assay imprecision was evaluated as 11-13% and 7-11%, respectively. The recovery of spiked 9-OAcSGs was 84.2-95.4%. The central 95% reference interval for immune-complexed 9-OAcSGs in normal human sera (NHS, n=144) was 2.9-3.4 mug/ml irrespective of sex and age. At disease presentation, the immune-complexed 9-OAcSGs were fivefold higher than NHS, decreased with remission induction and importantly, reappeared with clinical relapse. Sera from patients with other hematological disorders (n=86) showed negligible levels. The Dot-blot demonstrated the potential application of immune-complexed antigen as a disease-specific marker and its efficacy as a sensitive and specific method that could serve as an economical yet effective index for monitoring disease status.","['Bandyopadhyay, Suman', 'Mukherjee, Kankana', 'Chatterjee, Mitali', 'Bhattacharya, Dilip Kumar', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Bandyopadhyay S', 'Mukherjee K', 'Chatterjee M', 'Bhattacharya DK', 'Mandal C']","['Immunobiology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C.

This treatment induced a dose-dependent increase in the proliferation rate of all cell types, namely about 30% increase of cell proliferation after 72-h exposure to 1.0 mT. This was accompanied by increased percentage of cells in the S-phase after 12- and 48-h exposure. The ability of ELF-EMF to induce DNA damage was also investigated by measuring DNA strand breaks. A dose-dependent increase in DNA damage was observed in all cell lines, with two peaks occurring at 24 and 72 h. A similar pattern of DNA damage was observed by measuring formation of 8-OHdG adducts. The effects of ELF-EMF on cell proliferation and DNA damage were prevented by pretreatment of cells with an antioxidant like alpha-tocopherol, suggesting that redox reactions were involved. Accordingly, Rat-1 fibroblasts that had been exposed to ELF-EMF for 3 or 24 h exhibited a significant increase in dichlorofluorescein-detectable reactive oxygen species, which was blunted by alpha-tocopherol pretreatment. Cells exposed to ELF-EMF and examined as early as 6 h after treatment initiation also exhibited modifications of NF kappa B-related proteins (p65-p50 and I kappa B alpha), which were suggestive of increased formation of p65-p50 or p65-p65 active forms, a process usually attributed to redox reactions. These results suggest that ELF-EMF influence proliferation and DNA damage in both normal and tumor cells through the action of free radical species. This information may be of value for appraising the pathophysiologic consequences of an exposure to ELF-EMF.","['Wolf, Federica I', 'Torsello, Angela', 'Tedesco, Beatrice', 'Fasanella, Silvia', 'Boninsegna, Alma', ""D'Ascenzo, Marcello"", 'Grassi, Claudio', 'Azzena, Gian Battista', 'Cittadini, Achille']","['Wolf FI', 'Torsello A', 'Tedesco B', 'Fasanella S', 'Boninsegna A', ""D'Ascenzo M"", 'Grassi C', 'Azzena GB', 'Cittadini A']","['Institute of General Pathology and Giovanni XXIII Cancer Research Center, L.go F.

In this study, we observed cytoplasmic accumulation of relatively small RNAs of different size (150-600 nt) hybridized to alpha1 and beta(major) globin DNA probes in MEL cells blocked to differentiate by hypomethylating agents (neplanocin A, 3-deazaneplanocin A and cycloleucine). These RNAs lack poly(A) tail and appear to be quite stable. Search within the 3'-end flanking sequences of beta(major) globin gene revealed the presence of a B1 repeat element, several ATG initiation codons, a GATA-1 consensus sequence and sequences recognized by AP-1/NF-E2 and erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF) transcription factors. These data taken together indicate that exposure of MEL cells to hypomethylating agents promotes accumulation of relatively small discrete RNA transcripts lacking poly(A) tail regardless of the presence or absence of inducer dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). However, the relative steady-state level of small RNAs was comparatively higher in cells co-exposed to inducer and each one of the hypomethylating agents.

In this study, we report on the quality of life (QOL) of HCT-patients, who were alive at least at 5 yr after transplantation in comparison to an age- and sex-matched sample of healthy controls assessed in the same time-period and the same geographical region. DESIGN AND METHODS: The European Group of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QOL Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ C30) was sent by post to 39 HCT-survivors. Thirty-four patients answered the questionnaire. Patients were compared with 68 healthy controls from the same geographical region. Patients and controls completed the EORTC in the same time period. RESULTS: Mann-Whitney U-tests identified significantly lower QOL on the dimensions of physical and social functioning and on the financial impact symptom scale. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had survived their HCT for more than 5 yr did generally well in terms of global QOL. This is consistent with Kiss et al.

In an effort of reversing this side-effect, we studied the action on mobilisation and collection of PBSC of a low-dose regimen: 5-d Mini-ICE (oral idarubicin and etoposide; subcutaneous cytosine arabinoside) administered after fludarabine-based regimens in seven adult AML patients. Leukapheresis were started when the CD34+ cell count was more than 10/microL. The median number of harvested CD34+ cells was 8.1 x 10(6)/kg (range 3.08-15.2). All the patients were successfully submitted to PBSC transplantation. Median times to neutrophil and platelet recovery were rapid with a normal transfusional support. We suggest that the Mini-ICE programme is feasible, well tolerated and effective in terms of PBSC mobilisation and collection in low-yield AML patients previously treated with fludarabine. It is well known that a negative effect on stem cell mobilisation and harvest is observed not only after fludarabine administration in AML or low-grade lymphomas, but also after cycles based on different agents, such as thalidomide in multiple myeloma. This preliminary experience, if confirmed on larger series and/or other haematological malignancies, could open new opportunities to perform autologous PBSC transplantation in heavily pretreated cases, allowing a full source of therapeutic options before the start of the mobilisation process.","['Mele, Anna', 'Leopardi, Giuliana', 'Sparaventi, Giovanni', 'Nicolini, Giuseppina', ""D'Adamo, Francesca"", 'Guiducci, Barbara', 'Barulli, Sara', 'Malerba, Lara', 'Stramigioli, Stefania', 'Talevi, Nadia', 'Politi, Patrizia', 'Isidori, Alessandro', 'Malagola, Michele', 'Piccaluga, Pierpaolo', 'Visani, Giuseppe']","['Mele A', 'Leopardi G', 'Sparaventi G', 'Nicolini G', ""D'Adamo F"", 'Guiducci B', 'Barulli S', 'Malerba L', 'Stramigioli S', 'Talevi N', 'Politi P', 'Isidori A', 'Malagola M', 'Piccaluga P', 'Visani G']","['Department of Haematology, Hospital San Salvatore, Pesaro, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ICE protocol 4']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Vidarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives']",2005/03/22 09:00,2005/04/29 09:00,['2005/03/22 09:00'],"['2005/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH383 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00383.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Apr;74(4):277-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00383.x.,,,,,,,['Copyright 2005 Blackwell Munksgaard.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the discovery that the v-Src oncogene encoded a protein kinase in 1978, kinases have remained a focus of research for pharmaceutical laboratories and academic groups alike. Many have sought to develop orally available low molecular weight synthetic kinase modulators (predominantly inhibitors) and thus capitalize on the links between aberrant regulation and disease. This interest in kinases as drug targets was fueled in recent years by the success of several kinase inhibitors in the clinic, primarily Gleevec for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and Iressa for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This review focuses on the development of small molecule drugs, most of them binding in or close to the ATP binding pocket. After some general considerations regarding the selection of a particular kinase for drug discovery, we will discuss the encouraging lessons learned from some of the kinase inhibitors currently in various stages of development.

However they remain usually lethal instead of a great improvement of their prognosis in suitable therapeutic conditions. The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiologic and evolutionnal profile of these pathologies, and identify practical management problems in a reference public pediatric service in Senegal. We retrospectively analysed hospitals registers and records of all patients followed up in Albert Royer Children Hospital of Dakar from january 1989 to december 1998. During this ten years period 25 cases of malignant hemopathies were diagnosed among 32,789 hospitalised children, representing an hospital prevalence of 0.08 per cent. Mean age at the desease diagnosis was 9.5 years and sex ratio 2.57 (18 boys and 7 girls). The malignant type was acute leukemia (AL) in 11 cases (44%) including 9 cases of of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 2 cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML); chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in 2 cases (8%), Hodgkin's desease (HD) in 9 cases (36%) and non hodgkinian lymphoma (NHL) in 3 cases. NHLwere Burkitt type in 2casesand lymphoblastic type in 1 case. Their was no maxillary or facial localisation in Burkitt type lymphoma. The mean duration between the first clinical symptomes and the diagnosis of the disease was 4 months and delayed diagnosis was mainly due to delayed transfer from peripheral health services to hospital. Among 19 patients whose records were available, 17 were subjected to chemotherapy. However reference protocols were completely applyed in only 2 cases, one with HD and an other with lymphoblastic lymphoma. Transfusion managementwas not sufficient because of the lack of blood derived products (packed platelets or leucocytes) when needed. Thirteen patients died while followed up and mean survival after first hospitalisation in these cases was 120 days in ALL, 38 days in AML, 2.5 years in HD and 18 months in NHL The other patients were lost of sight and presumed to be dead at home. Eventually, this study showed that, in our hospital, children with malignant hemopathies did not derive benefit of therapeutic progress enregistered long time ago in developed countries, since they remain constantly lethal. The main factors of lethality could be delayed transfer to hospital because of lack of knowledge about these pathologies in the peripheral health services and poor therapeutic conditions in reference hospitals.

An excess of skeletal congenital anomalies has been reported among children with hematological malignancy and points towards involvement of developmental genes, like those belonging to the HOX gene family. In addition to their role in embryogenesis, HOX transcription factors are known to be regulators of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. We aimed to explore the possibility that germline alterations of HOX genes might be involved in childhood acute lymphoid malignancies. A cohort of 86 children diagnosed with acute lymphoid malignancy was studied, 20 of them concurrently presenting a congenital anomaly of the skeleton. First, we screened for nucleotide changes throughout the HOX genes of paralogous groups 4 to 13 in the 20 patients with skeletal defects, following a skeletal phenotype-based strategy. Subsequently, we extended the HOX mutation screening to the other 66 children having a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder, but without skeletal defects. In total, 16 germline mutations were identified. While 13 changes were also observed in healthy controls, three variants were exclusively found in acute lymphoid malignancy cases. These comprised the germline c.242A>T (p.Glu81Val) missense mutation of HOXD4, detected in two children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Furthermore, this mutation was found in association with other specific HOX variants of cluster D (2q31-q37), defining a unique haplotype. Functional analysis of the murine Hoxd4 homolog revealed that mutant Hoxd4 protein had lower transcriptional activity than wild-type protein in vitro. The p.Glu81Val mutation of HOXD4 thus results in a partial loss-of-function, which might be involved in childhood ALL.","['van Scherpenzeel Thim, Virginie', 'Remacle, Sophie', 'Picard, Jacques', 'Cornu, Guy', 'Gofflot, Francoise', 'Rezsohazy, Rene', 'Verellen-Dumoulin, Christine']","['van Scherpenzeel Thim V', 'Remacle S', 'Picard J', 'Cornu G', 'Gofflot F', 'Rezsohazy R', 'Verellen-Dumoulin C']","['Center for Human Genetics, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,"['0 (HOXD1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxd4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Haplotypes', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2005/03/19 09:00,2006/07/18 09:00,['2005/03/19 09:00'],"['2005/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/humu.20155 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 2005 Apr;25(4):384-95. doi: 10.1002/humu.20155.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['OMIM/142981', 'RefSeq/NM_014621']",,,,,,

METHODS: We performed prospective surveillance of patients with zygomycosis (group A; n = 27) and compared them with contemporaneous patients with invasive aspergillosis (group B; n = 54) and with matched contemporaneous high-risk patients without fungal infection (group C; n = 54). We also performed molecular typing and in vitro susceptibility testing of Zygomycetes isolates. RESULTS: Nearly all patients with zygomycosis either had leukemia (n = 14) or were allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients (n = 13). The Zygomycetes isolates (74% of which were of the genus Rhizopus) had different molecular fingerprinting profiles, and all were VRC resistant. In multivariate analysis of groups A and C, VRC prophylaxis (odds ratio [OR], 10.37 [95% confidence interval [CI]], 2.76-38.97]; P = .001), diabetes (OR, 8.39 [95% CI, 2.04-34.35]; P = .003), and malnutrition (OR, 3.70 [95% CI, 1.03-13.27]; P = .045) were found to be independent risk factors for zygomycosis. Between patients with zygomycosis (after excluding 6 patients with mixed mold infections) and patients with aspergillosis, VRC prophylaxis (OR, 20.30 [95% CI, 3.85-108.15]; P = .0001) and sinusitis (OR, 76.72 [95% CI, 6.48-908.15]; P = .001) were the only factors that favored the diagnosis of zygomycosis.

Culture media including inactivated serum is often recommended for in vitro culture of osteosarcoma cells, but the serum component then represents a nonstandardised parameter including a wide range of unidentified mediators. To improve the standardisation we have investigated whether serum-free culture media can be used in experimental in vitro studies of osteosarcoma cell lines. METHODS: The seven osteosarcoma cell lines Cal72, SJSA-1, Saos-2, SK-ES-1, U2OS, 143.98.2, and KHOS-32IH were cultured in vitro in various serum-free media and media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). RESULTS: Although proliferation often was relatively low in serum-free media (X-vivo 10, X-vivo 15, X-vivo 20, Stem Span SFEM), some cell lines (Cal72, KHOS-32IH, Saos-2) showed proliferation comparable with the recommended FCS-containing media even when using serum-free conditions. The optimal serum-free medium then varied between cell lines. We also compared 6 different FCS-containing media (including Stem Span with 10% FCS) and the optimal FCS-containing medium varied between cell lines. However, all cell lines proliferated well in Stem Span with FCS, and this medium was regarded as optimal for four of the lines. FCS could not be replaced by fatty acids or low density lipoprotein when testing the Stem Span medium. The release of a wide range of soluble mediators showed only minor differences when using serum-free and FCS-containing media (including Stem Span with and without FCS), and serum-free Stem Span could also be used for in vitro studies of mitogen-stimulated T cell activation in the presence of accessory osteosarcoma cells. The use of Stem Span with 10% FCS allowed the release of a wide range of chemokines by osteosarcoma cell lines (Cal72, SJSA-1), and the chemokine release profile was very similar to the fibroblast lines Hs27 and HFL1. CONCLUSIONS: Serum-free culture media can be used for in vitro studies of several osteosarcoma cell lines, but the optimal medium varies between cell lines and thus depends on: (i) the cell lines to be investigated/compared; (ii) the functional characteristic that is evaluated (proliferation, cytokine release); and (iii) whether coculture experiments are included.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Tronstad, Karl Johan', 'Berge, Rolf']","['Bruserud O', 'Tronstad KJ', 'Berge R']","['Section for Hematology, Institute of Medicine, The University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Mitogens)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/*pharmacology', 'Fetus', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Osteoblasts/cytology', 'Osteosarcoma/*pathology', 'Serum/chemistry', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",2005/03/19 09:00,2006/01/06 09:00,['2005/03/19 09:00'],"['2004/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00432-004-0650-z [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun;131(6):377-84. doi: 10.1007/s00432-004-0650-z.

HFE mutations have low penetrance with a mild effect on serum iron levels. Animal, twin, and population studies have shown that carrier state for C282Y can increase iron levels. A proportion of heterozygotes show slightly elevated serum iron levels. Increased serum iron has been suggested to increase the risk for oxidative damage to DNA. Epidemiologic studies established a correlation between iron levels and cancer risk. Case-control studies have reported associations between HFE mutations C282Y/H63D and several cancers, some of which in interaction with the transferrin receptor gene TFRC or dietary iron intake. Increased cancer risk in C282Y carriers is likely due to higher iron levels in a multifactorial setting. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), there is an association of C282Y with a gender effect in two British populations. No association has been found in acute myeloblastic leukemia and Hodgkin disease in adults. The childhood leukemia association possibly results from elevated intracellular iron in lymphoid cells increasing the vulnerability to DNA damage at a critical time window during lymphoid cell development. Interactions of HFE with environmental and genetic factors, most of which are recognized, may play a role in modification of susceptibility to leukemia conferred by C282Y. Given the population frequency of C282Y and the connection between iron and cancer, clarification of the mechanism of HFE associations in leukemia and cancer will have strong implications in public health.","['Dorak, M Tevfik', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Worwood, Mark']","['Dorak MT', 'Burnett AK', 'Worwood M']","['School of Clinical Medical Sciences, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Genet Med,Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,9815831,"['0 (HFE protein, human)', '0 (Hemochromatosis Protein)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hemochromatosis/*genetics', 'Hemochromatosis Protein', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', '*Mutation']",2005/03/19 09:00,2005/07/06 09:00,['2005/03/19 09:00'],"['2005/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['00125817-200503000-00002 [pii]', '10.1097/01.gim.0000156532.04648.81 [doi]']",ppublish,Genet Med. 2005 Mar;7(3):159-68. doi: 10.1097/01.gim.0000156532.04648.81.,,,174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach relied on graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects for control of malignancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed GVT effects in 322 patients given grafts from HLA-matched related (n = 192) or unrelated donors (n = 130). RESULTS: Of the 221 patients with measurable disease at HCT, 126 (57%) achieved complete (n = 98) or partial (n = 28) remissions. In multivariate analysis, there was a higher probability trend of achieving complete remissions in patients with chronic extensive graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; P = .07). One hundred eight patients (34%) relapsed or progressed. In multivariate analysis, achievement of full donor chimerism was associated with a decreased risk of relapse or progression (P = .002). Grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD had no significant impact on the risk of relapse or progression but was associated with increased risk of nonrelapse mortality and decreased probability of progression-free survival (PFS). Conversely, extensive chronic GVHD was associated with decreased risk of relapse or progression (P = .006) and increased probability of PFS (P = .003). CONCLUSION: New approaches aimed at reducing the incidence of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD might improve survival after allogeneic HCT after nonmyeloablative conditioning.","['Baron, Frederic', 'Maris, Michael B', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Storer, Barry E', 'Sorror, Mohamed', 'Diaconescu, Razvan', 'Woolfrey, Ann E', 'Chauncey, Thomas R', 'Flowers, Mary E D', 'Mielcarek, Marco', 'Maloney, David G', 'Storb, Rainer']","['Baron F', 'Maris MB', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Storer BE', 'Sorror M', 'Diaconescu R', 'Woolfrey AE', 'Chauncey TR', 'Flowers ME', 'Mielcarek M', 'Maloney DG', 'Storb R']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D1-100, PO Box 19024, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",2005/03/19 09:00,2005/04/06 09:00,['2005/03/19 09:00'],"['2005/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['23/9/1993 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.08.136 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Mar 20;23(9):1993-2003. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.08.136.,,,,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK064715/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inclusion of HOXA-translocated cases in a general molecular portrait of 92 T-ALLs based on large-scale expression analysis shows that this rearrangement defines a new homogeneous subgroup, which shares common biologic networks with the TLX1- and TLX3-related cases. Because T-ALLs derive from T-cell progenitors, expression profiles of the distinct T-ALL subgroups were analyzed with respect to those of normal human thymic subpopulations.

We hypothesized that transduction could be increased by the use of retroviral vectors pseudotyped with envelopes that recognize more abundant cellular receptors. The levels of mRNA encoding the receptors of the feline retroviruses, RD114 and feline leukemia virus type C (FeLV-C), were significantly higher than the level of gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) receptor mRNA in cells enriched for human HSCs (Lin- CD34+ CD38-). We cotransduced human peripheral blood CD34+ cells with equivalent numbers of FeLV-C and GALV or RD114 and GALV-pseudotyped retroviruses for injection into fetal sheep.

Analysis of individual myeloid colonies demonstrated that retrovirus vectors with FeLV-C and RD114 pseudotypes were present at 1.5 to 1.6 copies per cell and were preferentially integrated near known genes We conclude that the more efficient transduction of human HSCs with either FeLV-C- or RD114-pseudotyped retroviral particles may improve gene transfer in human clinical trials.","['Lucas, M Lee', 'Seidel, Nancy E', 'Porada, Christopher D', 'Quigley, John G', 'Anderson, Stacie M', 'Malech, Harry L', 'Abkowitz, Janis L', 'Zanjani, Esmail D', 'Bodine, David M']","['Lucas ML', 'Seidel NE', 'Porada CD', 'Quigley JG', 'Anderson SM', 'Malech HL', 'Abkowitz JL', 'Zanjani ED', 'Bodine DM']","['Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport System ASC)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (FLVCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SLC1A5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Transport System ASC/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/physiology', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematologic Diseases/therapy', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lac Operon', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sheep', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Virus Integration']",2005/03/19 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/19 09:00'],"['2005/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53324-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2004-11-4491 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 1;106(1):51-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-11-4491.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts with the t(9;11)(p22; q23) express MLL-AF9 and MLL wild-type (WT) transcripts, while normal karyotype AML blasts with the MLL(PTD/WT) genotype express MLL PTD but not the MLL WT. Silencing of MLL WT in MLL(PTD/WT) blasts was reversed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and MLL WT induction was associated with selective sensitivity to cell death. Reduction of MLL PTD expression induced MLL WT and reduced blast colony-forming units, supporting opposing functions for MLL PTD and MLL WT whereby the MLL PTD contributes to the leukemic phenotype via a recessive gain-of-function. The coincident suppression of the MLL WT allele with the expression of the MLL PTD allele, along with the functional data presented here, supports the hypothesis that loss of WT MLL function via monoallelic repression contributes to the leukemic phenotype by the remaining mutant allele. These data from primary AML and the pharmacologic reversal of MLL WT silencing associated with a favorable alteration in the threshold for apoptosis suggest that these patients with poor prognosis may benefit from demethylating or histone deacetylase inhibitor therapy, or both.","['Whitman, Susan P', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Vukosavljevic, Tamara', 'Rush, Laura J', 'Yu, Li', 'Liu, Chunhui', 'Klisovic, Marko I', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Guimond, Martin', 'Strout, Matthew P', 'Becknell, Brian', 'Dorrance, Adrienne', 'Klisovic, Rebecca B', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Caligiuri, Michael A']","['Whitman SP', 'Liu S', 'Vukosavljevic T', 'Rush LJ', 'Yu L', 'Liu C', 'Klisovic MI', 'Maharry K', 'Guimond M', 'Strout MP', 'Becknell B', 'Dorrance A', 'Klisovic RB', 'Plass C', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Marcucci G', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Death', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genotype', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/03/19 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/19 09:00'],"['2005/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)53361-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-01-0204 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Jul 1;106(1):345-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-01-0204.

Cryo-electron tomography allows 3D imaging of viruses in toto at a resolution sufficient to locate individual macromolecules, and local averaging of abundant complexes substantially improves the resolution. The averaging of repetitive features in electron tomograms is hampered by a low signal-to-noise ratio and anisotropic resolution, which results from the ""missing-wedge"" effect. We developed an iterative 3D averaging algorithm that compensates for this effect and used it to determine the trimeric structure of Env to a resolution of 2.7 nm, at which individual domains can be resolved. Strikingly, the 3D reconstruction is shaped like a tripod in which the trimer penetrates the membrane at three distinct locations approximately 4.5 nm apart from one another. The Env reconstruction allows tentative docking of the x-ray crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain. This study thus provides 3D structural information regarding the prefusion conformation of an intact unstained retrovirus surface protein.","['Forster, Friedrich', 'Medalia, Ohad', 'Zauberman, Nathan', 'Baumeister, Wolfgang', 'Fass, Deborah']","['Forster F', 'Medalia O', 'Zauberman N', 'Baumeister W', 'Fass D']","['Abteilung fur Molekulare Strukturbiologie, Max-Planck-Institut fur Biochemie, Am Klopferspitz 18, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany. foerster@biochem.mpg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy/*methods', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*ultrastructure', 'Protein Conformation', 'Tomography/methods', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*ultrastructure']",2005/03/19 09:00,2005/06/10 09:00,['2005/03/19 09:00'],"['2005/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['0409178102 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0409178102 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Mar 29;102(13):4729-34. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0409178102.

However, the precise expression pattern of PLD isoforms and their specific biological role(s) are not well understood. Neutrophil mRNA is intrinsically difficult to isolate as a result of the extremely high content of lytic enzymes in the cell's lysosomal granules. Reverse transcription coupled to polymerase chain reaction indicated that pure populations of human neutrophils had the CD16b(+)/CD115(-)/CD20(-)/CD3zeta(-)/interleukin-5 receptor alpha(-) phenotype. These cells expressed the following splice variants of the PLD1 isoform: PLD1a, PLD1b, PLD1a2, and PLD1b2. As for the PLD2 isoform, neutrophils expressed the PLD2a but not the PLD2b mRNA variant. The relative amount of PLD1/PLD2 transcripts exists in an approximate 4:1 ratio. The expression of PLD isoforms varies during granulocytic differentiation, as demonstrated in the promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell line. Further, the pattern of mRNA expression is dependent on the differentiation-inducing agent, 1.25% dimethyl sulfoxide causes a dramatic increase in PLD2a and PLD1b transcripts, and 300 nM all-trans-retinoic acid induced PLD1a expression. These results demonstrate for the first time that human neutrophils express five PLD transcripts and that the PLD genes undergo qualitative changes in transcription regulation during granulocytic differentiation.","['Di Fulvio, Mauricio', 'Gomez-Cambronero, Julian']","['Di Fulvio M', 'Gomez-Cambronero J']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Wright State University, Dayton, OH 45435, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (phospholipase D2)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (phospholipase D1)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/chemistry/*enzymology', 'Phospholipase D/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2005/03/19 09:00,2005/08/02 09:00,['2005/03/19 09:00'],"['2005/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1104684 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1104684 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2005 Jun;77(6):999-1007. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1104684.

Hodgkin's disease is one of the few malignant diseases that can be cured even in an advanced stage in the majority of cases. By employing a polychemotherapy containing anthracyclines, a long remission and recovery can be achieved in 60-70% of the patients. At present the standard treatment is ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) scheme for the following reasons: besides good treatment results early side effects are more favourable; sterility and secondary acute leukemia present themselves less often than by employing regimens containing alkylating agents. Unfortunately, some of the patients do not react properly to the treatment and about one third of the patients who are in remission following primary treatment will relapse at a later stage. The main goal is now to further improve treatment (recovery) results without an increase, or even a decrease of early or late side effects. Awareness of prognostic factors should lead to the employment of a less intensive but not toxic therapy in patients with good prognosis to prevent overtreatment, while in cases with bad prognosis a more effective regimen is needed (even for the price of expected complications). The latest meta-analysis on the subject has shown that--similarly to sequential high dose therapy--the addition of radiotherapy to an effective chemotherapy does not seem to prolong the survival of patients. Despite the excellent therapeutic results achieved by the many new ""intensive"" chemotherapies, there is unfortunately no optimal therapy or protocol available today. The multicentre analysis to confirm these results and to compare them with standard scheme is still under way.

We manufactured six products for CML patients and five for melanoma patients and administered them as vaccines in phase I clinical trials. METHODS: We isolated CD 14+ cells from apheresis products by immunomagnetic separation and incubated them in X-VIVO 15' medium supplemented with human AB serum, GM-CSF and IL-4 for 7 days, and with additional tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, IL-lIf, IL-6 and prostaglandin E2 for 3 days. Some cells were electroporated and transfected with mRNA isolated from melanoma tissue. DC were characterized by flow cytometry for the expression of CD83, CD86 andCD14. RESULTS: CD14+ cells constituted 14.4+/-6.2% (mean + SD) of nucleated cells in apheresis products and 98.3+/- 3.6% of isolated cells. Normal DC and CML DC were 77.4+/-7.3% CD83+ and 93.5+/- 7.0% CD86+. Corresponding values for electroporated DC from melanoma patients were 66.1 + 7.2% and 94.1 + 7.8%. The yield of CD83+ DC from isolated CD14+ cells was 18.1 + 7.2% for normal and CML patients and 9.8 + 3.7% for melanoma patients. DC viability was 92.7 + 5.8%; after cryopreservation and thawing it was 77+/-13.5%. DISCUSSION: Our method yielded viable and mature DC free of bacteria and mycoplasma. This robust and reproducible method provides cells of consistent phenotype and viability. Cryopreservation in single-dose aliquots allows multiple DC vaccine doses to be manufactured from a single apheresis product.","['Dietz, A B', 'Padley, D J', 'Butler, G W', 'Maas, M L', 'Greiner, C W', 'Gastineau, D A', 'Vuk-Pavlovic, S']","['Dietz AB', 'Padley DJ', 'Butler GW', 'Maas ML', 'Greiner CW', 'Gastineau DA', 'Vuk-Pavlovic S']","['Stem Cell Laboratory, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,['0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)'],IM,"['Blood Component Removal', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Survival', '*Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*immunology', 'Melanoma/immunology/pathology/*therapy']",2005/03/19 09:00,2005/09/17 09:00,['2005/03/19 09:00'],"['2005/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1465-3249(04)70769-0 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240410005357-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2004;6(6):563-70. doi: 10.1080/14653240410005357-1.,,,,"['CA-15083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA-84368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work on prostate carcinoma cells has shown that IL6 expression is activated therein by the homeodomain protein GBX2, which we found to be absent in HL cells. Instead, we observed expression of a closely related gene, HLXB9, albeit restricted to HL cells coexpressing IL6. Treatment of HL cell lines with antisense-oligonucleotides directed against HLXB9, forced expression of recombinant HLXB9, and analysis of reporter gene constructs containing IL6 promoter sequences all confirmed the potential of HLXB9 to drive expression of IL6. Chromosomal rearrangements of the HLXB9 locus at 7q36 were not detected in HL cells unlike AML subsets expressing HLXB9. However, inhibition of certain signal transduction pathways revealed that the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway contributes to HLXB9 expression. AKT/phospho-AKT analysis revealed constitutively active PI3K signalling in HL cell lines. Downstream analysis of PI3K revealed that E2F3 may mediate activation of HLXB9. Taken together, our data show that the PI3K signalling pathway in HL cells is constitutively activated and promotes HLXB9 expression, probably via E2F3, thereby enhancing malignant expression of IL6.","['Nagel, S', 'Scherr, M', 'Quentmeier, H', 'Kaufmann, M', 'Zaborski, M', 'Drexler, H G', 'MacLeod, R A F']","['Nagel S', 'Scherr M', 'Quentmeier H', 'Kaufmann M', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG', 'MacLeod RA']","['DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen), Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (E2F3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F3 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'E2F3 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hodgkin Disease/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/03/18 09:00,2005/06/11 09:00,['2005/03/18 09:00'],"['2005/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['2403716 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403716 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 May;19(5):841-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403716.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It follows that the nature of antigen drive in CLL could influence the clinical course and we were prompted to assess the impact, if any, of affinity maturation (an antigen-driven process) on prognosis. Statistical models for assessing affinity maturation status are typically applied to V(H) gene sequence data analysed using a web-based resource like IMGT or VBASE. Since these resources differ with respect to some key relevant features, we evaluated a cohort of CLL cases by applying statistical models to V(H) data derived from both IMGT and VBASE. Important differences between the resulting data sets became apparent. These resulted from database variance and because IMGT and VBASE define complementarity-determining and framework regions (CDRs, FRs) in different ways. Thus, the numbers of mutations identified and their distribution between CDRs/FRs varied between the data sets for the majority of clones. Consequently, two different but overlapping sets of cases with evidence of affinity maturation were defined.

And a lymphocytic variant, where hypereosinophilia is secondary to a primitive T lymphoid disorder demonstrated by the presence of a circulating T-cell clone. We performed molecular characterization of HES in 35 patients with normal karyotype by conventional cytogenetic analysis.

Here, we addressed the question of whether the size effects on apoptosis induction mainly contribute to the comparably higher concentration of easily soluble As2O3 present in realgar nanoparticles. Results revealed that treatment with realgar nanoparticles resulted in considerably low cell viability and produced characteristic apoptotic events in HL-60 cells, including morphological changes, DNA ladder formation, and increased number of cells with sub-G1-phase, whereas raw realgar particles with the same As2O3 concentration failed to induce apoptosis. On the other hand, the effects of realgar nanoparticles and raw realgar particles on cell membrane were examined. Realgar nanoparticles had acute toxicity to cell membrane, potentiating lipid peroxidation, increasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and reducing membrane fluidity, whereas raw realgar particles had little effect on cell membrane besides a similar reduction of membrane fluidity. These results suggest that the promotion of lipid peroxidation and membrane permeability might play an important role in the process of apoptotic induction by realgar nanoparticles. However, raw realgar particles are not sufficient to elicit apoptosis, although they can reduce membrane fluidity in HL-60 cells.","['Ye, Han-Qing', 'Gan, Lu', 'Yang, Xiang-Liang', 'Xu, Hui-Bi']","['Ye HQ', 'Gan L', 'Yang XL', 'Xu HB']","[""College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Sulfides)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '56320-22-0 (arsenic disulfide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenicals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', '*Nanostructures', 'Particle Size', 'Sulfides/*toxicity']",2005/03/18 09:00,2005/07/15 09:00,['2005/03/18 09:00'],"['2004/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['BTER:103:2:117 [pii]', '10.1385/BTER:103:2:117 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2005 Feb;103(2):117-32. doi: 10.1385/BTER:103:2:117.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: BMSCs isolated from the bone marrow of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) at the onset of disease were infected by rAAV-2-eGFP at different multiplicity of infection (MOI=10(2), 10(3), 10(4), 10(5), 10(6), and 10(7), respectively). Phase-contrast fluorescent microscope and flow cytometry were employed to evaluate the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). RESULTS: Ten to fourteen days after the transfection, eGFP expression began to be detected and the transfection efficiency ranged between 0.3% to 2%, which failed to be increased with the increase of MOI. The transduced eGFP could maintain a long-term stable expression in vitro in the 61 days of observation, and from 12 to 33 days after transfection, eGFP percentage underwent a decrease from the initial 1.16% to 0.5%-0.6% and maintained this expression level till 61 days after transfection. CONCLUSION: rAAV can be used with BMSCs for in vitro gene therapy, but the poor transfection efficiency of these cells remains a significant obstacle for its further application.","['Xie, Zheng-Jun', 'Zheng, Wei-Yang', 'Xu, Bing', 'Song, Llan-Lin', 'Yi, Zheng-Shan', 'Yin, Fang', 'Zhou, Shu-Yun']","['Xie ZJ', 'Zheng WY', 'Xu B', 'Song LL', 'Yi ZS', 'Yin F', 'Zhou SY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou510515, China. zhj_xie@hotmail.com']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao,Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,9426110,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Dependovirus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection']",2005/03/18 09:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2005/03/18 09:00'],"['2005/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao. 2005 Mar;25(3):281-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prognosis is related to clinical staging and cytogenetic findings. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of CLL reveals abnormalities in approximately one third of patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is analytically more sensitive than conventional cytogenetics for specific chromosomal abnormalities. To evaluate the usefulness of FISH in CLL, a study of 100 CLL patients comparing conventional cytogenetics and a commercially available multiprobe FISH kit was undertaken. One hundred consecutive CLL patients (67 males, 33 females) were studied. The male-female patient ratio was approximately 2.0 to 1. Twenty-eight percent (28/98) of patients had abnormal karyotypes by conventional cytogenetics (one patient had no specimen for conventional cytogenetics and one had an unanalyzable karyotype), and of those 19/100 (19%) had more than one chromosomal abnormality. Sixty-four percent (64/100) of the patients were positive for at least one abnormality by the FISH probes used. The following abnormalities were noted with FISH: 11q22 ATM, 23/100 (23%); trisomy 12, 11/100 (11%); 13q14.3, 40/100 (40%); 13q34.3, 4/100 (4%); 17p13.1, 12/100 (12%). Conventional karyotypes revealed 2 patients with abnormalities of chromosome 6 (which FISH did not address); 11 with abnormalities of 11 or 11q; 6 with trisomy 12; and 4 with abnormalities of 17. Aberrations of 11q and 17p are reported to have a poor prognosis in CLL. FISH can identify abnormalities missed with conventional cytogenetics and is helpful in diagnosis, prognosis, and evaluation of therapy for CLL. Additional chromosomal changes are identified with conventional cytogenetics that are not addressed by the multiprobe FISH kit.","['Glassman, Armand B', 'Hayes, Kimberly J']","['Glassman AB', 'Hayes KJ']","['Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Department of Hematopathology, Section of Cytogenetics, Unit 350, The University of Texas M.

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a technique that permits the detection of chromosomal imbalances within a ""one step"" analysis. In our study, we present 5 cases of MDS and 4 cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). By means of high-resolution CGH (HR-CGH) analysis, we were able to detect DNA copy number alterations in 8 out of 9 samples. The changes were as follows: -7, -Y, del(5)(q33q34), del(11)(q22q24), del(5p), del(9)(q21q31), nullisomy X, and +8. In 5/9 cases the HR-CGH data were highly comparable with conventional cytogenetics and interphase/metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization findings. Additionally, in 3 BM samples the HR-CGH revealed the presence of changes that had not been detected by conventional cytogenetics: del(5p), del(5)(q33q34), del(9)(q21q31), and nullisomy X. The high effectiveness, specificity, and sensitivity of this method are in concordance with the conventional cytogenetics and FISH findings and the ability to detect new changes.","['Babicz, Mariusz', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy R', 'Winnicka, Dorota', 'Gaworczyk, Anna', 'Lejman, Monika', 'Dmowski, Rafal', 'Kaczanowska, Katarzyna']","['Babicz M', 'Kowalczyk JR', 'Winnicka D', 'Gaworczyk A', 'Lejman M', 'Dmowski R', 'Kaczanowska K']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cytogenetic Laboratory, Children's University Hospital, Chodzki Street 2, 20 - 093 Lublin, Poland. mmbababicz@dsk.lublin.pl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",2005/03/18 09:00,2005/04/22 09:00,['2005/03/18 09:00'],"['2004/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2004/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(04)00339-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2004.08.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2005 Apr 1;158(1):49-54. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2004.08.020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Engagement of these receptors induces the activation of intracellular signaling proteins that transmit the receptor signals to distinct targets and control the cellular responses. The first signaling proteins to be discovered in higher organisms were the products of oncogenes. For example, the kinases Src and Abelson (Abl) were originally identified as oncogenes and were later characterized as important proteins for signal transduction in various cell types, including lymphocytes. Now, as many cellular signaling molecules have been discovered and ordered into certain pathways, we can better understand why particular signaling proteins are associated with tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss recent progress in unraveling the molecular mechanisms of signaling pathways that control the proliferation and differentiation of early B cells. We point out the concepts of auto-inhibition and subcellular localization as crucial aspects in the regulation of B cell signaling.","['Jumaa, Hassan', 'Hendriks, Rudolf W', 'Reth, Michael']","['Jumaa H', 'Hendriks RW', 'Reth M']","['Institute for Biology III, Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg and Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology, 79108 Freiburg, Germany. jumaa@immunbio.mpg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Immunol,Annual review of immunology,8309206,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Agammaglobulinemia/etiology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/etiology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*etiology', 'Lymphopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphoproteins/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'VDJ Recombinases/physiology']",2005/03/18 09:00,2005/07/01 09:00,['2005/03/18 09:00'],"['2005/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev.immunol.23.021704.115606 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Immunol. 2005;23:415-45. doi: 10.1146/annurev.immunol.23.021704.115606.,,,165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peripheral blood count at admittance was as follow: Hemoglobin 87 g/l, WBC 63 x 10(9)/l, and platelets 56 x 10(9)/l. The peripheral blood differential count showed: myeloblasts 4%, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) 20%, monocytes 60%, lymphocytes 16%. The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was confirmed by bone marrow aspirate, which presented an almost total infiltration by monocytoid blasts, AML type M5 according to FAB classification.

Although the study of a genetic predisposition to cancer in children remains in the early stages, congenital abnormalities could provide essential information for mapping predisposing lesions in children with cancer. METHODS: In the current study, 2 large cohorts of children with and without congenital abnormalities were followed for the occurrence of cancer and death up to 18 years. Through this study, the risk of developing cancer by age at diagnosis, effects of birth characteristics on cancer risk, and possible associations between specific anomalies and tumor types were examined. RESULTS: Based on the follow-up of 90,400 children, the risk of developing cancer during the first year of life was found to be nearly 6 times higher in children with anomalies (rate ratio [RR] of 5.8; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.7-9.1). Children with birth defects were found to be at a higher risk for developing leukemia (RR of 2.7; 95% CI, 2.1-3.6), tumors of the central nervous system (RR of 2.5; 95% CI, 1.8-3.4), sympathetic nervous system tumors (RR of 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3.4), and soft tissue sarcomas (RR of 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.5). Among children with birth defects, children with Down syndrome, nervous system anomalies, and anomalies of the urinary system had the highest incidence rates of cancer. In the presence of birth defects, other factors such as birth weight, gestational age, age of the mother, and birth order were not found to be associated significantly with the risk of cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The significant relative risks found in the current study provided evidence of links between the presence of abnormalities and the development of cancer. Some ""cancer-prone"" abnormalities were identified in the current study. Such anomalies may be markers of other exposures or processes that increase the risk of developing cancer.","['Agha, Mohammad M', 'Williams, Jack I', 'Marrett, Loraine', 'To, Teresa', 'Zipursky, Alvin', 'Dodds, Linda']","['Agha MM', 'Williams JI', 'Marrett L', 'To T', 'Zipursky A', 'Dodds L']","['Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. mohammad@ices.on.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Congenital Abnormalities/*pathology', 'Down Syndrome/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Risk Factors', 'Sarcoma/*etiology']",2005/03/17 09:00,2005/06/09 09:00,['2005/03/17 09:00'],"['2005/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20985 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2005 May 1;103(9):1939-48. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20985.,,,,,,,['(c) 2005 American Cancer Society.'],,,['Cancer. 2006 Mar 15;106(6):1418-9; author reply 1419.

In both cell lines, the cell cycle arrests in G(1)/G(0) phase within 24 h after the addition of 1 microM Imatinib. This is followed by a decrease of Ki-67 expression and the induction of apoptosis. In JURL-MK1 cells, the apoptosis is faster in comparison with K562 cells: the caspase-3 activity reaches the peak value (20 to 30 fold of the control) after about 40 h and the apoptosis proceeds to its culmination point, the DNA fragmentation, within 48 h following 1 microM Imatinib addition. Unlike K562 cells, JURL-MK1 cells possess a probably functional p53 protein inducible by TPA (tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate) or UV-B irradiation. However, no increase in p53 expression was observed in Imatinib-treated JURL-MK1 cells indicating that the difference in the apoptosis rate between the two cell lines is not due to the lack of p53 in K562 cells. Imatinib also triggers erythroid differentiation both in JURL-MK1 and K562 cells. Glycophorin A expression occurred simultaneously with the apoptosis, even at the single cell level. In K562 cells, but not in JURL-MK1 cells, the differentiation process involved increased hemoglobin synthesis. However, during spontaneous evolution of JURL-MK1 cells in culture, the effects produced by Imatinib progressively changed from the fast apoptosis to the more complete erythroid differentiation. We suggest that the apoptosis and the erythroid differentiation are parallel effects of Imatinib and their relative contributions, kinetics and completeness are related to the differentiation stage of the treated cells.","['Kuzelova, Katerina', 'Grebenova, Dana', 'Marinov, Iuri', 'Hrkal, Zbynek']","['Kuzelova K', 'Grebenova D', 'Marinov I', 'Hrkal Z']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic. kuzel@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Glycophorins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2005/03/17 09:00,2005/11/08 09:00,['2005/03/17 09:00'],"['2005/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20407 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2005 May 15;95(2):268-80. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20407.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to evaluate the in vitro contributory role of this glycotope (9-O-AcSAalpha2-6GalNAc) towards the survival of these 9-O-AcSA+ cells in ALL patients. For direct comparison, 9-O-AcSA- cells were generated by removing O-acetyl group of 9-O-AcSA present on PBMC(ALL) using O-acetyl esterase. An elevated level of serum interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in affected children led us to think that PBMC(ALL) are continuously exposed specifically to this cytokine. Accordingly, 9-O-AcSA+ and 9-O-AcSA- cells were exposed in vitro to IFN-gamma. A twofold increased NO release along with inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression by the 9-O-AcSA+ cells was observed as compared to the 9-O-AcSA- cells. The decreased viability of IFN-gamma exposed 9-O-AcSA- cells as compared to 9-O-AcSA+ cells were reflected from a 5.0-fold increased caspase-3-like activity and a 10.0-fold increased apoptosis in the 9-O-AcSA- cells when production of NO was lowered by adding competitive inhibitor of iNOS in reaction mixture. Therefore, it may be envisaged that a link exists between induction of this glycotope and their role in regulating viability of PBMC(ALL). Taken together, it is reasonable to hypothesise that O-acetylation of sialic acids on PBMC(ALL) may be an additional mechanism that promotes the survival of lymphoblasts by avoiding apoptosis via IFN-gamma-induced NO production.","['Ghosh, Shyamasree', 'Bandyopadhyay, Suman', 'Mallick, Asish', 'Pal, Santanu', 'Vlasak, Reinhard', 'Bhattacharya, Dilip K', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Ghosh S', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Mallick A', 'Pal S', 'Vlasak R', 'Bhattacharya DK', 'Mandal C']","['Immunobiology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C.

However, their function remains unclear. In this study, preformed angiotensin II (ANG II), a potent growth factor, was found to be contained in, and released by, human mast cells. METHODS: The human mast cell line (HMC-1) was incubated with 0 to 10(-6) M calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or culture medium. The expression of renin-angiotensin system mRNA was examined using RT-PCR analysis. ELISA and immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibody against human ANG II were performed to detect the presence of ANG II in HMC-1. The effect of CGRP on the expression of angiotensinogen mRNA was examined by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Preformed ANG II was detected in a human mast cell line (HMC-1) which is a neoplastic cell line of mast cells by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Presence of mRNA of angiotensinogen and renin was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction in HMC-1, while mRNA of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was undetectable. Since myocardial mast cells are interfaced with nerve fibers and functionally associated with CGRP, the effect of CGRP on ANG II release from HMC-1 was examined. CGRP induced the release of ANG II and increased angiotensinogen mRNA in HMC-1. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of preformed ANG II and gene expression of the renin-angiotensin system were detected in human mast cells. The release and synthesis of ANG II in mast cells was regulated by CGRP.","['Hara, Masatake', 'Ono, Koh', 'Wada, Hiromi', 'Sasayama, Shigetake', 'Matsumori, Akira']","['Hara M', 'Ono K', 'Wada H', 'Sasayama S', 'Matsumori A']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,8712220,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)', 'JHB2QIZ69Z (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide)']",IM,"['Angiotensin II/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*chemistry/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rabbits', 'Renin-Angiotensin System/genetics']",2005/03/17 09:00,2005/08/27 09:00,['2005/03/17 09:00'],"['2005/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10557-004-6218-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cardiovasc Drugs Ther. 2004 Nov;18(6):415-20. doi: 10.1007/s10557-004-6218-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data were collected in 44 patients with HM admitted to the MICU at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia within a 9-year period from 1993 to 2004. Demographic, physiological, clinical, laboratory and therapeutic data were collected on admission to MICU. RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of the patients had acute lymphocytic leukemia; 25% had acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) followed by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 20%, only 13.6% of these patients were in remission. The reasons for admission of these patients into MICU were shock (34.15%), respiratory failure (31.8%), cardiac arrest (20.4%), neurological causes (9.1%) and for other causes like small bowel perforation, hepatic failure, acute renal failure and metabolic disorders (4.5%). The overall in-hospital mortality was 72.7%, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality 61%, and the mean length of stay in the MICU was 5.4 +/- 4.8 days. A statistically significant association was demonstrated between both remission status and aspartate aminotransferase values on one side and patient's outcome on the other side. Patients with AML had poorer prognosis with mortality rate of 90.9%. CONCLUSION: Although mortality in patients with HM requiring ICU care is high, our results indicate that critical care support may be lifesaving. Apart from remission status and AML disease, no other prognostic factor could be identified.","['Bahammam, Ahmed S', 'Basha, Sayed J', 'Masood, Mohammed I', 'Shaik, Shafi A']","['Bahammam AS', 'Basha SJ', 'Masood MI', 'Shaik SA']","['Sleep Disorders Center, Respiratory Unit, College of Medicine, Department of Medicine 38, King Saud University, PO Box 2925, Riyadh 11461, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. ashammam@awalnet.net.sa']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Saudi Med J,Saudi medical journal,7909441,,IM,"['Adult', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology']",2005/03/17 09:00,2005/06/17 09:00,['2005/03/17 09:00'],"['2005/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']","[""20040465' [pii]""]",ppublish,Saudi Med J. 2005 Feb;26(2):246-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
