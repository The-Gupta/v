PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 864 breast cancer patients who underwent ABMT at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, from 1985 through 1996 who received the same preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide 1,875 mg/m2 for 3 days, cisplatin 55 mg/m2 for 3 days, and BCNU 600 mg/m2 for 1 day (CPB). Pretransplant cytogenetics were analyzed in all patients and posttransplant cytogenetics were evaluated in four of five patients who developed MDS/AL. RESULTS: Five of 864 patients developed MDS/AL after HDC with CPB and ABMT. The crude cumulative incidence of MDS/AL was 0.58%. The Kaplan-Meier curve shows a 4-year probability of developing MDS/AL of 1.6%. Pretransplant cytogenetics performed on these five patients were all normal. Posttransplant cytogenetics were performed on four of five patients and they were abnormal in all four, although only one patient had the most common cytogenetic abnormality associated with secondary MDS/AL (chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormality). CONCLUSION: Whereas MDS/AL is a potential complication of HDC with CPB and ABMT, the incidence in this series of patients with breast cancer was relatively low compared with that reported in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent ABMT. The cytogenetic abnormalities reported in this group of breast cancer patients were not typical of those seen in prior reports of secondary MDS/AL and appear to have occurred after HDC.","['Laughlin, M J', 'McGaughey, D S', 'Crews, J R', 'Chao, N J', 'Rizzieri, D', 'Ross, M', 'Gockerman, J', 'Cirrincione, C', 'Berry, D', 'Mills, L', 'Defusco, P', 'LeGrand, S', 'Peters, W P', 'Vredenburgh, J J']","['Laughlin MJ', 'McGaughey DS', 'Crews JR', 'Chao NJ', 'Rizzieri D', 'Ross M', 'Gockerman J', 'Cirrincione C', 'Berry D', 'Mills L', 'Defusco P', 'LeGrand S', 'Peters WP', 'Vredenburgh JJ']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.3.1008 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Mar;16(3):1008-12. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.3.1008.,,,,,,,,,,

Registry figures show that 38% of patients who have a matched-sibling bone marrow transplant (BMT) are disease-free 2 years after transplant, but the majority of patients lack a sibling donor. Most modern ALL protocols recommend unrelated donor (UD) BMT for patients with Ph-positive ALL in first complete remission (CR1), but the outcome of this is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the results of 15 children and adolescents who had a T-cell depleted UD-BMT for Ph-positive ALL. Thirteen of 15 had been previously treated on United Kingdom ALL protocols. Nine were in CR1 and six had more advanced disease. Eleven donor recipient pairs were matched at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ, and four were mismatched at one or two HLA loci. RESULTS: The incidence of greater than grade I acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was low (13% and 8%, respectively). Six patients have relapsed and seven patients survive at a median of 21 months post-BMT; six of seven are disease free. All seven survivors are in full-time education or work. The 2-year overall and disease-free survivals are 44% +/- 13% and 37% +/- 13% (+/- SE). None of four patients who had mismatched donors survived, but seven of 11 matched recipients survive (P < .05). CONCLUSION: UD-BMT can produce prolonged disease-free survival in young patients with Ph-positive ALL who otherwise would have an extremely poor outlook.","['Marks, D I', 'Bird, J M', 'Cornish, J M', 'Goulden, N J', 'Jones, C G', 'Knechtli, C J', 'Pamphilon, D H', 'Steward, C G', 'Oakhill, A']","['Marks DI', 'Bird JM', 'Cornish JM', 'Goulden NJ', 'Jones CG', 'Knechtli CJ', 'Pamphilon DH', 'Steward CG', 'Oakhill A']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Bristol Royal Hospital for Sick Children, England. dmarks@nildram.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation Immunology']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.3.931 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Mar;16(3):931-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.3.931.,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, high-risk ALL patients who achieved a rapid early response (RER) to induction chemotherapy were randomized to receive intensive systemic chemotherapy and presymptomatic CNS therapy that consisted of either i.t. methotrexate (MTX) and CRT or intensified i.t. MTX alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children (n = 636) with high-risk ALL (aged 1 to 9 years and WBC count > or = 50,000/microL or age > or = 10 years, excluding those with lymphomatous features) who achieved an RER (< or = 25% marrow blasts on day 7) to induction therapy and lacked CNS disease at diagnosis were randomized to receive systemic therapy with either i.t. MTX and CRT (regimen A, n = 317) or intensified i.t. MTX alone (regimen B, n = 319). RESULTS: Interim analysis in July 1993 revealed 3-year event-free survival (EFS) estimates of 82.1% +/- 4.0% (SD)and 70.4% +/- 4.2% for patients treated on regimens A and B, respectively (P = .004). As of January 1996, outcome had changed: 5-year EFS estimates were 69.1% +/- 3.4% and 75.0% +/- 2.7% for regimens A and B, respectively (P = 0.50). Marrow relapses comprised 57 events on regimen A and 43 events on regimen B. Fewer late events occurred on regimen B. CONCLUSION: For high-risk pediatric ALL patients who show an RER to induction therapy and are treated with systemic Children's Cancer Group (CCG)-modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) chemotherapy, presymptomatic CNS therapy that consists of either i.t. MTX plus CRT or intensified i.t. MTX alone results in a similar 5-year EFS outcome. Furthermore, intensified i.t. MTX may protect against late bone marrow relapse.","['Nachman, J', 'Sather, H N', 'Cherlow, J M', 'Sensel, M G', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Lukens, J N', 'Wolff, L', 'Trigg, M E']","['Nachman J', 'Sather HN', 'Cherlow JM', 'Sensel MG', 'Gaynon PS', 'Lukens JN', 'Wolff L', 'Trigg ME']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Chicago, IL, USA. jnachman@babies.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.3.920 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Mar;16(3):920-30. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.3.920.,,,,,,,,,,

Because interleukin-2 (IL-2) can induce remission in patients with overt evidence of AML, we hypothesized that IL-2 given to patients in first remission after intensive consolidation chemotherapy might prevent relapse. This study sought to determine whether such an approach was feasible. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients in complete remission received IL-2 after completion of treatment on Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocol 2941. Recombinant IL-2 9 x 10(6) IU/m2 daily by continuous intravenous infusion (c.i.v.) was given for 4 days. After 4 days rest, IL-2 1.6 x 10(6) IU/m2 daily c.i.v. was resumed for 10 days. We monitored patients for toxicity and measured absolute lymphocyte count, the absolute count of cells that express CD56 and CD3 antigen, and soluble IL-2 receptor alpha-chain (sIL-2R alpha) levels before the start of IL-2 and after completion of each of the two courses of IL-2. RESULTS: Observed toxicities included fever (57%), vascular leak (48%), hypotension (38%), tachycardia (14%), rash (29%), septicemia (5%), thrombocytopenia (29%), elevated transaminase (14%), electrolyte disturbance (29%), and hyperglycemia (10%). No patient required cardiac pressors or transfer to an intensive care unit. All patients studied developed an increase in lymphocyte count, CD56 count, CD3 count, and sIL-2R alpha levels after treatment with IL-2. CONCLUSION: This schedule of IL-2 was reasonably well tolerated by children with AML in first remission. After treatment, increased levels of sIL-2R alpha were observed. CCG is conducting a randomized prospective trial to assess the efficacy of IL-2 to prevent the relapse of AML (CCG-2961).","['Sievers, E L', 'Lange, B J', 'Sondel, P M', 'Krailo, M D', 'Gan, J', 'Liu-Mares, W', 'Feig, S A']","['Sievers EL', 'Lange BJ', 'Sondel PM', 'Krailo MD', 'Gan J', 'Liu-Mares W', 'Feig SA']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. esievers@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/blood', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.3.914 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Mar;16(3):914-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.3.914.,"['R25 CA092049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CCRC MO1-RR00240/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI CA 14489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were cultured on allogeneic bone marrow-derived stromal layers and exposed to various concentrations of docetaxel. After 7 days of culture, the number of viable leukemic cells were counted by flow cytometry and compared with that in parallel cultures without drugs. RESULTS: In 20 samples tested (15 B-lineage ALL, one T-lineage ALL, and four AML), the median cytotoxicity was 78% after a 7-day culture in the presence of 100 ng/mL docetaxel (range, 54% to 95%). The effects were dose-dependent and extended to all five ALL samples with the t(9;22)(q34;q11) (Philadelphia chromosome) or 11q23 abnormalities, karyotypes associated with an unfavorable outcome. Studies with continuously growing cell lines demonstrated that docetaxel exerted its cytotoxic effect by inducing apoptosis, and was consistently more effective than paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Wallingford, CT) (mean 50% cell kill [LC50], 6.93 v 12.86 ng/mL in six leukemic cell lines). The antileukemic activities of docetaxel and vincristine were synergistic. While the mean (+/- SD) cytotoxicity of vincristine (0.1 ng/mL) was 11.2% +/- 7.3% and that of docetaxel (10 ng/mL) was 19.3% +/- 17.5% in CEM-C7 cells after 24 hours, combining the two agents increased the cytotoxicity to 62.5% +/- 20.7% (P = .003). CONCLUSION: Docetaxel, at concentrations achievable in vivo, is cytotoxic to ALL and AML cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 274 patients treated from 1982 through 1990 with IFNalpha regimens were analyzed. A second group of 137 patients treated with IFNalpha and low-dose cytarabine (ara-C) between 1990 and 1994 was later used to confirm the guidelines derived from the original study group analysis. Patients' pretreatment factors and response to IFNalpha therapy at 3, 6, and 12 months were analyzed in relation to subsequent achievement of major cytogenetic response. After univariate analysis of prognostic factors, a multivariate analysis selected, at 6 months, independent pretreatment factors that added to the response status in predicting subsequent outcome. The results were then applied at the 3- and 12-month periods and confirmed in the subsequent population. RESULTS: Response to IFNalpha therapy at 3, 6, and 12 months was a significant predictor of later major cytogenetic response. The presence of splenomegaly > or = 5 cm below the costal margin (BCM) or thrombocytosis > or = 700 x 10(9)/L pretreatment added significant independent prediction to response. At 6 months, patients with a partial hematologic response (PHR) or resistant disease had a less than 10% chance of achieving a later major cytogenetic response, as were those in complete hematologic response (CHR) and who had pretreatment splenomegaly and thrombocytosis. Applying the model at 3 months showed that only patients with < or = PHR and pretreatment splenomegaly or thrombocytosis at 3 months had such a low major cytogenetic response rate. Finally, at 12 months, patients with CHR still had a 15% to 25% chance of having a major cytogenetic response later if they did not have pretreatment splenomegaly and thrombocytosis. CONCLUSION: This analysis allows better selection of patients with Ph-positive CML on IFNalpha therapy for continuation of IFNalpha versus changing therapy early in the course of CML. For treatment programs that choose to change patients to other investigational therapies (eg, intensive chemotherapy and/or autologous stem-cell transplantation [SCT]), baseline outcome expectations are provided for patients continued on IFNalpha therapy, against which the results of new approaches can be compared.","['Sacchi, S', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Smith, T L', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Pierce, S', 'Kornblau, S', 'Beran, M', 'Keating, M J', 'Talpaz, M']","['Sacchi S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Smith TL', ""O'Brien S"", 'Pierce S', 'Kornblau S', 'Beran M', 'Keating MJ', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Splenomegaly', 'Thrombocytosis']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.3.882 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Mar;16(3):882-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.3.882.,,,,,,,,,,

European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Hovon Group.",872-81,"PURPOSE AND METHODS: Optimization of remission-induction and postremission therapy in elderly individuals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was the subject of a randomized study in patients older than 60 years. Remission-induction chemotherapy was compared between daunomycin (DNR) 30 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3 versus mitoxantrone (MTZ) 8 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3, both plus cytarabine (Ara-C) 100 mg/m2 on days 1 to 7. Following complete remission (CR), patients received one additional cycle of DNR or MTZ chemotherapy and were then eligible for a second randomization between eight cycles of low-dose (LD)-Ara-C 10 mg/m2 subcutaneously every 12 hours for 1 2 days every 6 weeks or no further treatment. RESULTS: A total of 242 patients was randomized to DNR and 247 to MTZ. Median age of both study groups was 68 years. Secondary AML was documented in 26% and 25% of patients in either arm. The probability of attaining CR was greater (P = .069) with MTZ (47%) than with DNR (38%). Median duration of neutropenia was 19 (DNR) and 22 days (MTZ). The greater response rate to MTZ therapy correlated with reduced occurrence of chemotherapy resistance (32% v 47%, P = .001). With a median follow-up of 6 years, 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) is 8% in each arm. Overall survival estimates are not different between the groups (6% v 9% at 5 yrs). Poor performance status at diagnosis, high WBC count, older age, secondary AML, and presence of cytogenetic abnormalities all had an adverse impact on survival. Secondary AML and abnormal cytogenetics predicted for shorter duration of CR. Among complete responders, 74 assessable patients were assigned to Ara-C and 73 to no further therapy. Actuarial DFS was significantly longer (P = .006) for Ara-C-treated (13% [SE = 4.0%] at 5 years) versus nontreated patients (7% [SE = 3%]), but overall survival was similar (P = .29): 18% (SE = 4.6%) versus 15% (SE = 4.3%).

As an alternative, we evaluated the potential of BM-derived stromal cells which can be readily obtained and expanded in vitro. Human and murine BM stromal cells were transduced with an intron-based Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) retroviral vector expressing a B-domain-deleted human factor VIII cDNA (designated as MFG-FVIIIdeltaB). Transduction efficiencies were increased 10- to 15-fold by phosphate depletion and centrifugation, which obviated the need for selective enrichment of the transduced BM stromal cells. This resulted in high FVIII expression levels in transduced human (180 +/- 4 ng FVIII/10[6] cells per 24 hr) and mouse (900 +/- 130 ng FVIII/10[6] cells per 24 hr) BM stromal cells. Pseudotyping of the MFG-FVIIIdeltaB retroviral vectors with the gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope (GALV-env) resulted in significantly higher transduction efficiencies (100 +/- 20%) and FVIII expression levels (390 +/- 10 ng FVIII/10[6] cells per 24 hr) in transduced human BM stromal cells than with standard amphotropic vectors. This difference in transduction efficiency correlated with the higher titer of the GALV-env pseudotyped viral vectors and with the higher GALV receptor (GLVR-1) versus amphotropic receptor (GLVR-2) mRNA expression levels in human BM stromal cells. These findings demonstrate the potential of BM stromal cells for gene therapy in general and hemophilia A in particular.","['Chuah, M K', 'Brems, H', 'Vanslembrouck, V', 'Collen, D', 'VandenDriessche, T']","['Chuah MK', 'Brems H', 'Vanslembrouck V', 'Collen D', 'VandenDriessche T']","['Center for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology-University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Factor VIII/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, env', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hemophilia A/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/*metabolism']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1998.9.3-353 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1998 Feb 10;9(3):353-65. doi: 10.1089/hum.1998.9.3-353.,,,,,,,,,,

A successful hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC)-based gene therapy strategy for HIV-1 disease must protect Mo/Mphi as well as T cells from HIV-1-related pathology. In this report, we demonstrate that RevM10-transduced HSPCs isolated from cytokine-mobilized peripheral blood give rise to Mo/Mphi suppressing replication of Mphi-tropic HIV-1 isolates. A Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retroviral vector encoding a bicistronic mRNA co-expressing RevM10 and the murine CD8alpha' chain (Lyt2) was used to transduce HSPCs. Following transduction, these cells were expanded and differentiated by short-term culture in methylcellulose containing various cytokines. In vitro differentiated Mo/Mphi were enriched by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for the co-expressed transgene (Lyt2) and myelomonocytic (CD33, CD14) surface markers. HIV-1 replication of two Mphi-tropic isolates (JR-FL, BaL) was inhibited in Mo/Mphi expressing RevM10 and Lyt2 relative to control cells expressing only Lyt2 but no functional RevM10 gene product. Cell proliferation and expression of lineage-specific surface markers was not altered in transduced, in vitro differentiated Mo/Mphi cells. This study supports the feasibility of HSPC-based gene therapy as a future treatment for HIV-1 disease.","['Junker, U', 'Kalfoglou, C S', 'Moon, J J', 'Beck, M K', 'Kaneshima, H', 'Bohnlein, E']","['Junker U', 'Kalfoglou CS', 'Moon JJ', 'Beck MK', 'Kaneshima H', 'Bohnlein E']","['Systemix, Inc., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,,IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*virology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Macrophages/cytology/virology', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Monocytes/cytology/*virology', '*Virus Replication']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1998.9.3-333 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1998 Feb 10;9(3):333-40. doi: 10.1089/hum.1998.9.3-333.,,,,,,,,,,

The cytosolic 650 kDa 12(S)-HETE-binding complex was found to consist of subunits; raising the ATP concentration in cytosol led to conversion of the 650 kDa complex to a 50 kDa binding component, presumably the actual 12(S)-HETE binding polypeptide. Lowering of the cytosolic concentration of ATP had the opposite effect, i.e., the amount of the 650 kDa complex increased. Another subunit of the 650 kDa complex was identified as heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) by Western blot analyses and coimmunoprecipitation. Hsp70 was present in substoichiometric amounts, in an approximate 1:6 ratio. The multimeric nature of the binding complex and the identification of hsp70 as a subunit suggest that there are similarities between the 12(S)-HETE binding protein and receptors of the steroid/thyroid hormone superfamily.","['Herbertsson, H', 'Kuhme, T', 'Evertsson, U', 'Wigren, J', 'Hammarstrom, S']","['Herbertsson H', 'Kuhme T', 'Evertsson U', 'Wigren J', 'Hammarstrom S']","['Department of Biomedicine and Surgery, Linkoping University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid receptor)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Eicosanoid)', '59985-28-3 (12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic Acid)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic Acid/*metabolism', '3T3 Cells/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Eicosanoid/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-2275(20)33885-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Lipid Res. 1998 Feb;39(2):237-44.,,,,,,,,,,

Controversy exists regarding the value of sperm banking for these patients before therapy, whether the spermatozoa are viable after long-term storage and whether they can fertilize the ovum. We assess fertilization and pregnancy outcomes achieved with cryopreserved spermatozoa from cancer patients using assisted reproductive techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 10 cancer patients who transferred cryopreserved semen specimens from our sperm bank to outside in vitro fertilization programs for assisted reproductive technique. Of these patients 5 had Hodgkin's disease, 2 testicular cancer, 1 leukemia and 2 prostate cancer. The length of specimen storage ranged from 14 to 135 months (median 49, interquartile range 24 and 82). RESULTS: The median pre-freeze motility was 44% (interquartile range 36 and 55%) and the median total sperm count was 31.1 x 10(6) (interquartile range 6.3 and 53.9 x 10(6)). At 24 hours after banking the median post-thaw motility was 11% (interquartile range 6 and 35%) and the median total sperm count was 6.6 x 10(6) (1.2 and 17.1 x 10(6)). A total of 18 cycles of assisted reproductive technique were performed among 10 couples with an overall pregnancy rate of 50% per couple, with 2 deliveries, 1 ongoing pregnancy and 2 miscarriages. The pregnancy rate per cycle of in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection was 36.4% with an implantation rate of 13%. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that poor quality cryopreserved spermatozoa from cancer patients, irrespective of the length of storage, may provide successful results with the latest micromanipulative techniques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection.","['Hallak, J', 'Hendin, B N', 'Thomas, A J Jr', 'Agarwal, A']","['Hallak J', 'Hendin BN', 'Thomas AJ Jr', 'Agarwal A']","['Andrology Research and Clinical Laboratories, Department of Urology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplasms', 'Pregnancy/*statistics & numerical data', 'Reproductive Techniques', '*Spermatozoa', 'Time Factors']",1998/03/21 03:22,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/03/21 03:22'],"['1998/03/21 03:22 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 03:22 [entrez]']",['S0022-5347(01)63561-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Urol. 1998 Apr;159(4):1217-20.,,,,,,,,,,

Stathmin (oncoprotein 18) was identified in this way and the phosphorylation of this protein after treatment with bistratene A, was confirmed by Western blotting of 2D gels. Since stathmin has phosphorylation sites for mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases, cyclin dependent kinases and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinases, it is assumed that one of these enzymes, acting downstream from PKC delta, is responsible for the phosphorylation. Another approach to determining the role of PKC delta involves the identification of interacting proteins using the yeast two hybrid screen.

Leukaemia is a monoclonal disease which frequently displays clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma (TCR gamma) and/or immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene. Clone-specific junctional sequences arising as a result of these gene rearrangements provide potentially valuable targets for monitoring residual disease by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, existing strategies for PCR amplification of these clone-specific rearrangements frequently lack the necessary sensitivity or specificity, due either to the small size of the target junctional region, or to interference resulting from polyclonal IgH or TCR gamma rearrangements in normal lymphocytes. We have previously described a novel PCR strategy to overcome these obstacles which is based on the design of two overlapping clone-specific PCR primers which span the junctional region. We now describe a modification to this strategy which employs relatively short clone-specific primers which further increases the level of specificity. This new method should improve the detection of residual cells, particularly in those cases displaying small junctional regions. Unlike other strategies, specificity is generated from the initial round of amplification. This non-radioactive technique should thus prove effective in monitoring residual leukaemia in patients.","['Kwan, E', 'Zhu, L', 'Ferrara, D', 'Marshall, G M', 'Haber, M', 'Norris, M D']","['Kwan E', 'Zhu L', 'Ferrara D', 'Marshall GM', 'Haber M', 'Norris MD']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Biochem Biophys Methods,Journal of biochemical and biophysical methods,7907378,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-022X(97)00043-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-022x(97)00043-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem Biophys Methods. 1997 Dec 17;36(1):3-10. doi: 10.1016/s0165-022x(97)00043-2.,,,,,,,,,,

The use of such systems provides an inexpensive, quick and simple way to identify and test molecules that can be further studied in more complex in vivo experiments. Some cell lines such as embryonic stem cells can be induced to differentiate in vitro, however, the differentiation is difficult to control and most often leads to the generation of a wide variety of cell types. Cell lines derived from sources committed to a restricted cell fate provide an opportunity to examine cell growth and differentiation within a specific cell type (G.M. Keller, In vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 7 (1995) 862-869 [10]).

Here we examine whether SIRPalpha and SHP-2 are signaling molecules for the receptors for growth hormone (GH), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), or interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), cytokine receptor superfamily members that bind to and activate Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). In 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, GH rapidly stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of both SIRPalpha and SHP-2 and enhances association of SHP-2 with SIRPalpha. Consistent with JAK2 binding and phosphorylating SIRPalpha in response to GH, co-expression of SIRPalpha and JAK2 in COS cells results in tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPalpha and JAK2 association with SIRPalpha. LIF does not stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPalpha but stimulates greater tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2 than GH. Additionally, LIF enhances association of SHP-2 with the gp130 subunit of the LIF receptor signaling complex. IFNgamma, which stimulates JAK2 to a greater extent than LIF, is ineffective at stimulating tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPalpha or SHP-2. These results suggest that SIRPalpha is a signaling molecule for GH but not for LIF or IFNgamma.

Mechanism of inhibition.,7030-7,"The Tal1 oncogene is a class II basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, overexpressed in as much as 60% of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. Like other class II bHLH proteins, Tal1 can heterodimerize with the class I bHLH proteins, such as E47, and bind to a DNA recognition sequence termed E box. Therefore, it is believed that the oncogenic capacity of Tal1 lies in its ability, as a heterodimer with E47, to activate aberrantly a set of ""leukemogenic"" genes in T cells. However, compared with E47 homodimers, Tal1/E47 heterodimers are very poor transactivators. Thus the effect of Tal1 is actually to inhibit E47 homodimer activity. Here we propose that the transforming properties of Tal1 are the result of its ability to inhibit E47 activity. We address the mechanism of Tal1 inhibition and demonstrate that Tal1/E47 heterodimers cannot activate transcription because their respective activation domains are incompatible. Furthermore, we present data showing that Tal1 can inhibit E47-mediated activation of the CIP1 gene.

Many studies have focused on the ability of Tax to transform rodent fibroblasts; however, none has defined the molecular requirements for Tax transformation of human lymphoid cells. We show here that tax induces permanent growth of human primary T-lymphocytes by using a transformation/immortalization defective rhadinovirus vector. The cells phenotypically resemble HTLV-immortalized lymphocytes and contain episomally persisting recombinant rhadinoviral sequences, which stably express functional Tax protein. As Tax can activate major cellular signal transducing pathways including NF-kappaB and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), we asked for the relevance of these routes in the immortalization of human lymphocytes. By using Tax mutants that either activate exclusively CREB/activating transcription factor or are defective in activating this signaling pathway, we delineated that Tax can induce immortalization of primary human T-lymphocytes through a mechanism independent of NF-kappaB activation.","['Rosin, O', 'Koch, C', 'Schmitt, I', 'Semmes, O J', 'Jeang, K T', 'Grassmann, R']","['Rosin O', 'Koch C', 'Schmitt I', 'Semmes OJ', 'Jeang KT', 'Grassmann R']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, D-91054 Erlangen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism']",1998/04/18 00:00,1998/04/18 00:01,['1998/04/18 00:00'],"['1998/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.12.6698 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)63938-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Mar 20;273(12):6698-703. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.12.6698.,,,,,,,,,,

These findings may shed light on a novel mechanism for gene expression in complex retroviruses of the HTLV family.","['Ariumi, Y', 'Shimotohno, K', 'Noda, M', 'Hatanaka, M']","['Ariumi Y', 'Shimotohno K', 'Noda M', 'Hatanaka M']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, pX', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1998/03/20 00:00,1998/03/20 00:01,['1998/03/20 00:00'],"['1998/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(98)00051-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(98)00051-9 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1998 Feb 13;423(1):25-30. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(98)00051-9.,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Three previously described patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who underwent allogeneic BMT for therapy-related severe aplastic anemia and 1 new patient with psoriasis who received BMT for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were followed up. Molecular studies were performed to assess hemopoietic and immune reconstitution in 3 cases. RESULTS: In 2 of the RA patients, the RA remained in remission without treatment, with nonprogressive disease, 11 and 13 years after BMT. The third patient with RA had a relapse 2 years after BMT, although the previously aggressive disease subsequently ran an attenuated course with treatment-free remission for the last 11 years. Comparison with other cases of RA suggests that graft-versus-host disease may influence the long-term outcome, perhaps through ongoing inhibition of the immune system. In the patient with psoriasis, BMT was followed by remission, but the psoriatic rash recurred and arthropathy developed 12 months later. The psoriasis and arthropathy remained active 4.5 years post-BMT, although the CML remained in remission. Molecular studies in the 2 patients whose RA remained in continued remission and in the patient with psoriasis that relapsed confirmed complete donor hemopoietic reconstitution. CONCLUSION: Long-term followup of autoimmune disease after allogeneic transplantation confirmed cure of the autoimmune disease in some, but eventual relapse in others. The occurrence of relapse despite complete donor hemopoietic reconstitution is evidence for the development of de novo, as opposed to persistent, disease, and is possibly related to intrinsic susceptibility of the transplanted stem cells or to host factors. There may be a relationship between remission of autoimmune disease and graft-versus-host reaction. These findings have relevance for the evolving application of stem cell transplantation as a therapy for autoimmune diseases.","['Snowden, J A', 'Kearney, P', 'Kearney, A', 'Cooley, H M', 'Grigg, A', 'Jacobs, P', 'Bergman, J', 'Brooks, P M', 'Biggs, J C']","['Snowden JA', 'Kearney P', 'Kearney A', 'Cooley HM', 'Grigg A', 'Jacobs P', 'Bergman J', 'Brooks PM', 'Biggs JC']","[""St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/chemically induced/physiopathology/surgery', 'Antirheumatic Agents/adverse effects', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*surgery', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/physiopathology/surgery', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Middle Aged', 'Psoriasis/complications', 'Radiography', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/03/20 00:00,1998/03/20 00:01,['1998/03/20 00:00'],"['1998/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1529-0131(199803)41:3<453::AID-ART11>3.0.CO;2-# [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1998 Mar;41(3):453-9. doi: 10.1002/1529-0131(199803)41:3<453::AID-ART11>3.0.CO;2-#.,,,,,,,,,,

Why there are two distinct receptors for the same ligand and whether these receptors mediate their signal independently or synergistically is not known. We examined the role of these two receptors in the ligand-dependent activation of a transcriptional factor, NF-kappaB, an early response (5-15 min) to TNF in human myeloid ML-1a cells. By using receptor type-specific antibodies, these cells were found to express almost equal amounts of both receptors. TNF-dependent activation of NF-kappaB could be blocked partially by both anti-p60 and anti-p80, suggesting that TNF mediates its effect independently through the p60 and p80 receptors. In comparison, the activation of NF-kappaB by lymphotoxin (LT), which shares receptors with TNF, was completely blocked by anti-p60, whereas anti-p80 had no effect. Anti-p60 but not anti-p80 by itself was found to activate NF-kappaB in a dose-dependent manner, but on a molar basis anti-p60 was found to be 100 times less potent than TNF. Interestingly, even though anti-p80 by itself was inactive, it potentiated the effect of anti-p60 synergistically, suggesting an interaction between the two types of TNF receptor. Thus, overall these results demonstrate that the two forms of TNF receptors could mediate their signal in both an independent and synergistic manner and that TNF mediates its signal through both forms of receptors, whereas LT mediates its signal through the p60 receptor.","['Mukherjee, R', 'Singh, S', 'Chaturvedi, M M', 'Aggarwal, B B']","['Mukherjee R', 'Singh S', 'Chaturvedi MM', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, University of Texas M.

Information on newly diagnosed cancer cases is based on data collected by NCI, and information on cancer deaths is based on underlying causes of death as reported to NCHS. RESULTS: For all sites combined, cancer incidence rates decreased on average 0.7% per year during 1990-1995 (P > 0.05), in contrast to an increasing trend in earlier years. Among the ten leading cancer incidence sites, a similar reversal in trends was apparent for the cancers of the lung, prostate, colon/rectum, urinary bladder, and leukemia; female breast cancer incidence rates increased significantly during 1973-1990 but were level during 1990-1995.

METHODS: The authors evaluated the incidence of WM reported in 11 population-based cancer registries in the U.S. RESULTS: A total of 624 cases were diagnosed between January 1, 1988 (when WM became reportable) and December 31, 1994. Age-adjusted incidence rates for WM (per 1 million person-years at risk) were 3.4 among males and 1.7 among females. The rates increased sharply with age, from 0.1 at age < 45 years to 36.3 at age 75+ years (males) and from 0.1 at age < 45 years to 16.4 at age 75+ years (females). The rates for WM were comparable to those for hairy cell leukemia, but considerably lower than those for multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Some geographic variation was evident, with age-adjusted rates among white males ranging from 2.2-7.8 across registries. There was no significant change in rates over the 7-year study period (P > 0.05). The markedly higher rates for WM among whites than blacks stand in contrast to multiple myeloma, which occurs twice as often among blacks. CONCLUSIONS: This survey provides new data regarding the incidence patterns of WM in the U.S. However, further epidemiologic studies with biomarkers are needed to define the environmental, genetic, immunologic, and viral determinants of this rare but distinctive disorder.","['Groves, F D', 'Travis, L B', 'Devesa, S S', 'Ries, L A', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Groves FD', 'Travis LB', 'Devesa SS', 'Ries LA', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7368, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Racial Groups', '*Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'United States', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*epidemiology']",1998/03/20 03:11,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/03/20 03:11'],"['1998/03/20 03:11 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/03/20 03:11 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980315)82:6<1078::AID-CNCR10>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Mar 15;82(6):1078-81.,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: During first-remission induction therapy (mean, 71 days), the duration of neutropenia, various infections, and fevers were related to changes in body weight and serum albumin concentrations as well as total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in 52 patients receiving standardized anti-infectious treatment. RESULTS: Severe neutropenia prevailed for 27% and fever for 28% of the induction period. A mean weight loss of 5.1 kg, corresponding to a reduction of body mass index from 23.5 to 21.7, was correlated with the number of days that patients had fever (P = 0.026). Despite a normal serum albumin value at the time of admission, patients had severe hypoalbuminemia (<25 g/L) during 16% of the induction period. The drop in serum albumin was independently related to the weight loss (r = 0.37, P = 0.03). Moreover, the incidence and duration of hypoalbuminemia were significantly correlated with duration of fever (P < 0.0001), diarrhea (P = 0.03), and TPN administration (P = 0.00002).

Although named for its ability to inhibit proliferation of a myeloid leukemic cell line by inducing differentiation, it also regulates the growth and differentiation of embryonic stem cells, primordial germ cells, peripheral neurons, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells. LIF is crucial for successful implantation of the embryo in mice. Currently, there is an accumulation of data about the role of LIF in human reproduction. METHOD OF STUDY: This review of the literature and of our studies focuses on the expression, regulation, and effects of LIF in the human endometrium, fallopian tube, and ovarian follicle. RESULTS: Human endometrium expresses LIF in a menstrual cycle-dependent manner. Maximal expression is observed between days 19 and 25 of the menstrual cycle, coinciding with the time of implantation. Various cytokines and growth factors induce endometrial LIF expression in vitro. LIF receptor is expressed in endometrial tissue throughout the menstrual cycle and on human blastocysts in a stage-dependent manner. Affecting the trophoblast differentiation pathway toward the adhesive phenotype, LIF plays a role in implantation. LIF is also expressed and secreted by the epithelial cells of the fallopian tube. Its increased expression in the tubal stromal cell cultures by the inflammatory cytokines suggests a link between salpingitis and ectopic implantation in the tube. The rising follicular fluid LIF level around the time of ovulation indicates that LIF may play a role in ovulatory events, early embryonic development, and implantation. CONCLUSIONS: There is growing evidence that LIF may be one of the entities that plays a role in human reproduction.","['Senturk, L M', 'Arici, A']","['Senturk LM', 'Arici A']","['Yale University School of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New Haven, CT 06520-8063, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/immunology/physiology', 'Embryo Implantation/immunology/physiology', 'Endometrium/immunology/physiology', 'Fallopian Tubes/immunology/physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Ovarian Follicle/immunology/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproduction/immunology/*physiology']",1998/03/20 00:00,1998/03/20 00:01,['1998/03/20 00:00'],"['1998/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0897.1998.tb00346.x [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 1998 Feb;39(2):144-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0897.1998.tb00346.x.,,,94,,,,,,,

METHOD OF STUDY: By a specific and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the in vitro endometrial LIF secretion by explant cultures from women with unexplained infertility (n = 32) was examined. Endometrial samples were obtained on either days 8-11 of the proliferative phase or days 18-21 of the secretory phase. In some subjects (n = 11) an endometrial biopsy was performed twice, both in the proliferative and in the secretory phase of the cycle. The control group consisted of fertile women (n = 17). RESULTS: In fertile women the endometrial LIF secretion was 2.2 times higher in the secretory phase samples than in the proliferative phase samples (mean +/- SEM, 3259 +/- 314 pg in the proliferative phase vs. 7726 +/- 1192 in the secretory phase; P < 0.05). In contrast, infertile women exhibited no such elevation of cytokine production. Moreover, in infertile women with MFI the level of LIF in the secretory phase demonstrated the tendency to decrease (mean +/- SEM, 4953 +/- 1125 pg vs. 2162 +/- 541 pg; P > 0.05). When the amount of cytokine secretion was compared on the same day of the cycle between the two groups of women, the LIF production in fertile women on days 18-21 of the menstrual cycle was 3.5 times greater than in the infertile women with MFI and 2.2 times greater than in women without MFI (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). On days 8-11 of the cycle, the level of LIF in these groups did not differ significantly, however, in infertile women the range of distribution of cytokine was largely varied, demonstrating the highest amplitude of variations in subjects with MFI. Analyses of the data for women to whom LIF was examined in both phases of the cycle showed that some subjects (27%) exhibited an elevated amount of LIF in the secretory phase of the cycle. This suggests that in these cases the endometrial factor(s) may be irrelevant to infertility. CONCLUSION: In the majority of infertile women there is a deregulation of LIF production in the endometrium during both the proliferative and the secretory phases of the cycle. The dysfunction of cytokine production is more profound in patients with MFI. The deregulation of endometrial LIF secretion throughout the menstrual cycle may be a possible cause of unexplained infertility and repetitive failures of implantation.","['Hambartsoumian, E']",['Hambartsoumian E'],"['Service de Gynecologie/Obstetrique, Hopital Antoine Beclere, Clamart, France. ehambarts@aol.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Abortion, Habitual/*etiology/immunology', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Embryo Implantation/immunology', 'Endometrium/*immunology', 'Female', 'Follicular Phase/immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infertility, Female/*etiology/immunology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luteal Phase/immunology', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange/immunology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective Studies']",1998/03/20 00:00,1998/03/20 00:01,['1998/03/20 00:00'],"['1998/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0897.1998.tb00345.x [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 1998 Feb;39(2):137-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0897.1998.tb00345.x.,,,,,,,,,,

This makes it attractive for the treatment of leukaemia or lymphoma in remission. It is unlikely that hypoxia or repopulation will be a problem in TBI treatment of leukaemia, and clonal resistance to radiation occurs less readily than to drugs. Leukaemic cells are often radiosensitive with poor repair capacities but considerable variation is seen in laboratory studies and leukaemias may be highly individual. It is possible that programmed cell death (apoptosis) contributes to leukaemic cell killing and variability of apoptosis may give rise to biological individuality. Molecular methodologies may now be used to monitor leukaemic cell populations and may enable semi-quantitative predictive assays of radiosensitivity. When the malignant cell population is not uniformly distributed throughout the body, as in lymphoma, non-uniform TBI is appropriate, e.g. by addition of local boosts or by the combination of TBI with radiolabelled antibody treatment. Major side-effects mostly relate to critical organs with late-responding characteristics (low alpha/beta ratio, high sensitivity to fraction size or dose rate). The radiobiological basis of developmental effects in children is not well understood. In future, improved selectivity of TBI may come from molecular biological strategies to sensitize malignant cells and to protect normal tissues.","['Wheldon, T E']",['Wheldon TE'],"['Department of Radiation Oncology, CRC Beatson Laboratories and Beatson Oncology Centre, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,,IM,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma/radiotherapy', 'Radiation Tolerance', '*Radiobiology', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1998/03/20 00:00,1998/03/20 00:01,['1998/03/20 00:00'],"['1998/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1259/bjr.70.840.9505837 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Radiol. 1997 Dec;70(840):1204-7. doi: 10.1259/bjr.70.840.9505837.,,,17,,,['Br J Radiol. 1997 Dec;70(840):1201-3.

With the use of patch clamp technique, the activity of non-voltage-gated ionic channels in plasma membrane of human leukemia K562 cells was examined. We have identified two types of Na-permeable channels characterized by unitary conductance of 12 pS and differing in their selectivity among monovalent cations. A relative permeability value PNa/PK was estimated for both types referred to as channels of high (HS, PNa/PK = 10) and low (LS, PNa/PK = 3) selectivity, resp. Both the channels were impermeable to bivalent cations (Ca2+, Ba2+), not blocked by tetradotoxin. Their sensitivity to amiloride was extremely low. Cytochalasin D treatment of cells resulted in a significant increase in the activity of LS Na-conducting channels. Application of exogenous gelsolin to the cytoplasmic surface of inside-out membrane patch at free Ca2+ level of 1 mkM induced a similar effect of sodium channel activation; the subsequent addition of actin reduced the channel activity up to the background level. Our results show that the cortical F-actin network plays an important role in regulating the novel family of sodium channels in nonexcitable cells. It could be assumed that the actin disassembly causes a rise in LS channel activity, whereas the actin assembly induces inactivation of the channels.","['Vedernikova, E A', 'Maksimov, A V', 'Neguliaev, Iu A']","['Vedernikova EA', 'Maksimov AV', 'Neguliaev IuA']","['Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg.']",['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Tsitologiia,Tsitologiia,0417363,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (Sodium Channels)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)']",IM,"['Actins/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'Gelsolin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sodium Channels/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/03/20 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tsitologiia. 1997;39(12):1142-51.,,,,Funktsional'nye svoistva i tsitoskeletzavisimaia reguliatsiia natrievykh kanalov v plazmaticheskoi membrane leikoznykh kletok.,,,,,,

Circumvention of multidrug resistance represents a strategy that has been taken into account when conventional chemotherapy failed. In this work a group of 15 refractory, heavily pretreated, patients was enrolled in a circumvention protocol including etoposide (ETO) and cyclosporin A (CSA). All patients received etoposide prior to this schedule. Toxicity to circumvention protocol was acceptable and only one serious side-effect was observed. Two hematological clinical responses were seen, both of which were positive to P-glycoprotein immunostaining and exhibited in vitro modulation by CSA in cultures using the thymidine incorporation assay. Three out of four patients negative for P-glycoprotein achieved a minor response. Three out of six clinical failures were also negative for Pgp immunostaining one of which exhibited sinergistic effect between ETO and CSA. Our study suggests that hematological response to ETO and CSA association can be obtained in intensely pretreated leukemic patients. Several factors may affect the response such as clinical status before this therapy. Additionally, it also suggests that not all CSA effects on the combination ETO-CSA can be attributed to Pgp modulation.","['Maia, R C', 'Carrico, M K', 'Klumb, C E', 'Noronha, H', 'Coelho, A M', 'Vasconcelos, F C', 'Ruimanek, V M']","['Maia RC', 'Carrico MK', 'Klumb CE', 'Noronha H', 'Coelho AM', 'Vasconcelos FC', 'Ruimanek VM']","['Servico de Hematologia, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, INCA, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/20 00:00,1998/03/20 00:01,['1998/03/20 00:00'],"['1998/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Dec;16(4):419-24.,,,,,,,,,,

The data were plotted as the cumulative distribution of the numbers of subcolonies per erythroid burst then linearised by logarithmic transformation. Analysis of the data revealed that IL-3 increases the numbers of subcolonies in BFU-E whilst SCF increases the size of the subcolonies themselves.

The effect of combinations of interleukin 1 (IL-1), 6 (IL-6), and 11 (IL-11), interferon gamma (INF-gamma), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) on the expression of LPL in macrophages was studied using the murine J774.2 cell line. The suppression of heparin-releasable LPL activity produced by combinations of IL-1 and IL-11, IL-1 and TNF-alpha, IL-11 and TNF-alpha, and, IL-11 and INF-gamma was substantially lower than that expected from the additive action of the corresponding two cytokines. By contrast, co-exposure of cells to LIF and IFN-gamma, IL-6 and LIF, and INF-gamma and TNF-alpha resulted in a more than additive, synergistic, suppression of LPL activity with the maximum reduction and maximum degree of synergism produced by combinations of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The synergism between IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha was observed over a range of complementary dose combinations and also occurred when the cells were exposed first to INF-gamma (priming), washed, and then stimulated subsequently with TNF-alpha. The reduction in LPL activity by combinations of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha and the priming action of IFN-gamma were accompanied by a comparable decrease in LPL mRNA concentrations, thereby indicating that the major control responsible for the changes in LPL activity was being exerted at the level of mRNA metabolism (decreased transcription or RNA stability). These results suggest that the modulation of macrophage LPL function in atherosclerosis by cytokine combinations may be more important than the presence or absence of any given cytokine.","['Tengku-Muhammad, T S', 'Cryer, A', 'Ramji, D P']","['Tengku-Muhammad TS', 'Cryer A', 'Ramji DP']","['School of Molecular and Medical Biosciences, University of Wales Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1998/03/17 00:00,1998/03/17 00:01,['1998/03/17 00:00'],"['1998/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(97)90254-4 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1997.0254 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1998 Jan;10(1):38-48. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1997.0254.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,

There is geographic variation in the association of EBV with certain tumors and a lack of studies of PT-LPDs from developing countries, so we decided to study in detail a series of PT-LPDs from Mexico to identify similarities and differences between populations in Mexico and those in Europe and the United States. We used paraffin-embedded tissue from eight PT-LPDs (six from men, two from women) that arose after renal transplantation. Clinical data, morphologic features, and clonality on the basis of immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain restriction, as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Ig heavy chain genes, were studied. The presence of EBV was investigated with PCR, immunohistochemical analysis for latent membrane protein (LMP)-1, and in situ hybridization for EBV early RNA transcripts. In addition, the subtype of EBV based on the EBNA 2A and 2B genes and the presence of a 30-bp deletion in the LMP-1 gene were investigated by PCR. Seven (87.5%) of eight cases presented with gastrointestinal involvement; five patients died. Three cases were polymorphic PT-LPDs, four were monomorphic large cell lymphomas (one diffuse large cell, three immunoblastic), and one was unclassifiable. All showed a B-cell phenotype, with a clonal population demonstrated in seven of the eight cases. Tumor cells expressed EBERs in all of the cases and LMP-1 in six of seven evaluable cases. Seven of seven cases showed EBV subtype A. Two (25%) of eight cases had the 30-bp LMP-1 deletion. This study shows that PT-LPDs in Mexico are clonal disorders associated with EBV subtype A. In contrast to series from Europe and the United States, our cases showed a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal tract involvement (P < .001), and a lower incidence of the 30-bp LMP-1 deletion, although this was not statistically significant (P < .28).","['Quintanilla-Martinez, L', 'Lome-Maldonado, C', 'Schwarzmann, F', 'Gredler, E', 'Reyes, E', 'Angeles-Angeles, A', 'Fend, F']","['Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Lome-Maldonado C', 'Schwarzmann F', 'Gredler E', 'Reyes E', 'Angeles-Angeles A', 'Fend F']","['Department of Pathology, Instituto Nacional de la Nutricion, Mexico City, Mexico. leticiaq@box1.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Herpesviridae Infections/genetics/pathology/*virology', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*virology', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/pathology/virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification/genetics/pathology/*virology', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/virology', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/pathology/*virology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/genetics']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1998 Feb;11(2):200-8.,,,,,,,,,,

In 31 cases we concomitantly investigated MDR1 (multiple drug resistance 1 gene) expression (semi-quantitative competitive RT-PCR) of the leukaemic cells. Drug resistance towards Dau, Dox and Etop was correlated to the MDR1 expression of the AML cells (P<0.05) with high MDR1 expression being associated with high drug resistance towards these drugs. Although the data did not allow firm conclusions to be drawn on the correlation between MDR1 expression and drug resistance towards Ara-C and Mitox, the drug resistance towards Acla clearly was not correlated to, or dependent on, the MDR1 expression level of the AML blast cells. In addition, when examining the cross-activities among the six drugs distinct patterns emerged. Thus, high to very high degrees of cross-activity were found to exist between Dau, Dox, Etop and Mitox, whereas Ara-C had moderate cross-activity with the other drugs except Acla, which showed absent to moderate cross-activity with the other drugs. We conclude that MDR1 gene expression is of significance for cellular drug resistance towards specific (MDR1-related) drugs in AML, whereas it is not of significance regarding drug resistance towards other drugs, which is the case with the anthracycline Acla. We suggest that in the place of other more or less complicated ways to circumvent MDR1-mediated drug resistance, Acla may be used to replace Dau, Dox and other MDR1-related drugs if proven as potent as the drug it is to substitute.","['Norgaard, J M', 'Bukh, A', 'Langkjer, S T', 'Clausen, N', 'Palshof, T', 'Hokland, P']","['Norgaard JM', 'Bukh A', 'Langkjer ST', 'Clausen N', 'Palshof T', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Medicine and Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, MDR/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00593.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Mar;100(3):534-40. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00593.x.,,,,,,,,,,

A high proportion of CD57+ cells (66 +/- 10%) from these patients expelled Rh123. Functional PgP activity was associated with expression of MDR1 mRNA. By using immunocytochemistry, LRP expression was detected in 11/15 patients (73%). 7/10 LGL leukaemia patients presented a LRP+/Efflux+ phenotype and 5/7 had LRP+/Efflux+/MDR1 mRNA+ phenotype. These findings suggest that the PgP+/LRP+ phenotype is frequently observed in LDGL.

Mononuclear cells from 10 patients were cultured with staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) or toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), and their response was determined by MTT assay and 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. Cells from six patients showed a specific response to a single superantigen. In two cases the cells responded to TSST-1 and bore Vbeta2, the known target of TSST-1. In three cases the cells responded to SEA with one bearing Vbeta9, a target of SEA, and one bearing Vbeta16. In one case the cells responded to SEB. Most of the cells which proliferated in response to superantigens were determined genetically to be leukaemic. The response to TSST-1 was inhibited by anti-Vbeta2 antibody. The responding cells showed a strongly enhancement expression of interleukin-2 receptor. These findings indicate that leukaemic cells from a proportion of ATL patients have an ability to respond to T-cell receptor-dependent superantigens.

Mitogenic stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or PMA plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) resulted in a tremendous increase in TNF-alpha and IL-6 production in cells representing early stage (Binet A) disease. In contrast, very little, if any, production took place in cells from patients with advanced stage (Binet C) B-CLL. The results from stage B patients were intermediate. The most remarkable difference was recorded in PMA-stimulated (1 ng/ml) IL-6 production. In stimulated 72 h cultures, IL-6 concentrations were 1280 +/- 1080 pg/ml for Binet A (n = 11), 757 +/- 597 pg/ml for Binet B (n = 8) and 46.0 +/- 84.0 pg/ml for Binet C (n = 5). The differences in IL-6 production between stage C v B and stage C v A were both statistically significant (P=0.025). Similar effects, but to a lesser extent, were observed in TNF-alpha production.

UK Medical Research Council Adult and Children's Leukaemia Working Parties.,700-8,"BACKGROUND: Three strategies are used to prevent relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in first remission. Most of those with suitable donors are offered allogeneic haemopoietic-stem-cell transplant. Other patients may receive intensive chemotherapy or autologous transplantation; we undertook this randomised prospective trial to assess which is the better option. METHODS: After three courses of intensive chemotherapy, bone marrow was harvested from patients (<56 years of age) in remission who lacked an HLA-matched sibling donor. These patients were then randomised to receive, after one more course of chemotherapy, no further treatment (n=191) or an autologous bone-marrow transplant (BMT) after preparation with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation (n=190). Outcome comparisons were by intention to treat with adjustment for the most important risk factors for relapse. FINDINGS: 381 patients were randomised (38% of those eligible). Of the 190 patients allocated autologous BMT, 126 received it. On intention-to-treat analysis the number of relapses was substantially lower in the autologous BMT group than in the group assigned no further treatment (64/190 [37%] vs 101/191 [58%], p=0.0007), resulting in superior disease-free survival at 7 years (53 vs 40%; p=0.04). These benefits were observed in all risk groups and age-groups. There were more deaths in remission in the autologous BMT group than in the no further treatment group (22 [12%] vs 7 [4%], p=0008). In children (<15 years) and patients with good-risk disease, survival from relapse in the no further treatment group was 35% and 38% at 2 years. There was an overall survival advantage in the autologous BMT group at 7 years (57 vs 45%, p=0.2). INTERPRETATION: The addition of autologous BMT to four courses of intensive chemotherapy substantially reduces the risk of relapse in all risk groups, leading to improvement in long-term survival. The good chance of salvage for children or patients with good-risk disease who relapse from chemotherapy, and the mortality, morbidity, late effects, and expense of autologous BMT, suggest that delay of autograft until second remission in these two groups may be appropriate.","['Burnett, A K', 'Goldstone, A H', 'Stevens, R M', 'Hann, I M', 'Rees, J K', 'Gray, R G', 'Wheatley, K']","['Burnett AK', 'Goldstone AH', 'Stevens RM', 'Hann IM', 'Rees JK', 'Gray RG', 'Wheatley K']","['University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, Heath Park, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Compliance', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140673697092143 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(97)09214-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1998 Mar 7;351(9104):700-8. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(97)09214-3.,,,,,,,,,,

It has previously been shown that two low-molecular-weight lichen metabolites, lobaric acid isolated from Stereocaulon alpinum Laur. and protolichesterinic acid isolated from Cetraria islandica L. (Ach.), have in-vitro inhibitory effects on arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase. We have studied the effects of these compounds on cultured cells from man, including three malignant cell-lines (T-47D and ZR-75-1 from breast carcinomas and K-562 from erythro-leukaemia), as well as normal skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Both test substances caused a significant reduction in DNA synthesis, as measured by thymidine uptake, in all three malignant cell-lines; the dose inducing 50% of maximum inhibition (ED50) was between 1.1 and 24.6 microg mL(-1) for protolichesterinic acid and between 14.5 and 44.7 microg mL(-1) for lobaric acid. The breast-cancer cell-lines were more sensitive than K-562. The proliferative response of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes was inhibited with a mean ED50 of 8.4 microg mL(-1) and 24.5 microg mL(-1) for protolichesterinic acid and lobaric acid, respectively. These concentrations are of the same order of magnitude as the IC50 values in the 5-lipoxygenase assay. Significant cell death (assessed by the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-( 4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay and trypan blue exclusion) occurred in the three malignant cell-lines at protolichesterinic acid and lobaric acid concentrations above 20 and 30 microg mL(-1), respectively. In K-562 morphological changes consistent with apoptosis were detected. Up to 38% cell death was observed at 20 microg mL(-1) for protolichesterinic acid and 15 microg mL(-1) for lobaric acid in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes but unstimulated lymphocytes were clearly less sensitive. In contrast, the DNA synthesis, proliferation and survival of normal skin fibroblasts were not affected at doses up to 20 microg mL(-1) for protolichesterinic acid and 30 microg mL(-1) for lobaric acid. We conclude that the anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects observed might be related to the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity of protolichesterinic acid and lobaric acid.

The MEL cells were exposed to high pressures (0.1-130 MPa) and then cultured for 5 days at atmospheric pressure. The proliferation of MEL cells was unaffected up to 60 MPa, but was suppressed at 80-110 MPa. Above 120 MPa, the cells were fragmented. The cell cycle analysis of 80 MPa-treated MEL cells showed that the cells in S phase are most sensitive to high pressure and they arrest in G2 phase. Interestingly, G2-arrested cells reinitiated DNA synthesis, resulting in giant cells with high DNA contents. Furthermore, when such G2-arrested cells were exposed to caffeine, premature mitosis, characterized by chromosome pulverization, was observed. These results suggest that the suppression of proliferation in high-pressure-treated MEL cells is associated with G2 arrest following S phase delay. Thus, it seems valuable to apply high pressure to the investigation of the cell cycle.","['Matsumoto, M', 'Yamaguchi, T', 'Fukumaki, Y', 'Yasunaga, R', 'Terada, S']","['Matsumoto M', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Fukumaki Y', 'Yasunaga R', 'Terada S']","['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Fukuoka University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', '649SA4S2CV (N(6),N(6)-dimethyladenine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Caffeine/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Cell Division', '*G2 Phase', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mitotic Index', '*Pressure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021920 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1998 Jan;123(1):87-93. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021920.,,,,,,,,,,

To increase the yield of neuronal and glial cells from ES cells, we designed a differentiation procedure in which embryoid bodies were grown in medium containing retinoic acid (RA) and a low level (1%) of fetal calf serum. Using this procedure we were able to obtain neurofilament or glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells in 90% of outgrowths of embryonic bodies. Differentiation was dependent on the RA concentration, whereas depletion of RA favored the appearance of cardiac muscle cells. Differentiation of ES cells correlated with increased activity of Pax6, a transcription factor involved in central nervous system development. Pax6 was not expressed in undifferentiated ES cells, nor after differentiation by depletion of leukemia inhibitory factor or by overgrowth. After embryoid body formation and subsequent attachment, only infrequently did a few cells express Pax6. Addition of RA resulted in the appearance of Pax6-expressing cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with a peak at 100 nM RA. The presented differentiation procedure can be used for studying the molecular biology of neurogenesis in vitro.","['Gajovic, S', 'St-Onge, L', 'Yokota, Y', 'Gruss, P']","['Gajovic S', 'St-Onge L', 'Yokota Y', 'Gruss P']","['Max Planck Institute of Biophysical Chemistry, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Gottingen, Germany. sgajovi@mamef.mef.hr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (PAX6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Pax6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Eye Proteins', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/cytology', 'PAX6 Transcription Factor', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60621-6 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-0436.1998.6240187.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1997 Dec;62(4):187-92. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-0436.1998.6240187.x.,,,,,,,,,,

The role of the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in axotomy-induced sprouting of postganglionic sympathetic fibres into the dorsal root ganglia was examined in the adult rat. 2. Immunocytochemistry was used to study the distribution and density of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) fibres within the lumbar dorsal root ganglia and lumbar spinal nerves 14 days following continuous intrathecal infusion of LIF (0.33 mg ml-1), or 14 days following unilateral peripheral nerve axotomy. 3. In LIF-treated animals, numerous pericellular TH-IR basket-like structures were observed surrounding sensory neurones, which were absent from controls. 4. The number of TH-IR fibres within the L3, L4 and L5 spinal nerves was significantly higher in LIF-treated animals than in control or saline-treated animals (P < 0.01, Student's t test). 5. Unilateral ligation of the L4 spinal nerve or unilateral sciatic nerve ligation was also associated with the formation of TH-IR baskets around sensory neurons and a significant increase in the number of TH-IR fibres within the lumbar spinal nerves (P < 0.01, Student's t test). 6. The percentage of neurones surrounded by TH-IR baskets within the L3 and L4 dorsal root ganglia following sciatic axotomy was significantly reduced in animals treated continuously for 2 weeks with a monoclonal antibody against the LIF receptor motif, gp130 (0.833 mg ml-1) (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Antibody treatment did not reduce the axotomy-induced increase in TH-IR fibres within lumbar spinal nerves. 7. These results demonstrate that exogenous application of the axotomy-associated cytokine LIF is associated with sprouting of uninjured postganglionic sympathetic neurones around sensory neurones within the dorsal root ganglion. It is likely that increased LIF expression following peripheral axotomy plays an important role in the novel sympathetic sprouting observed within sensory ganglia following peripheral nerve injury.","['Thompson, S W', 'Majithia, A A']","['Thompson SW', 'Majithia AA']","[""Division of Physiology, UMDS, St Thomas' Hospital, London, UK.

Sequence analysis of a whole cosmid containing SLP-1 shows that SLP-1 is flanked upstream by a zinc finger gene and a fork-head-domain gene and downstream by a heme-oxygenase and a RING finger gene.","['Gottgens, B', 'Gilbert, J G', 'Barton, L M', 'Aparicio, S', 'Hawker, K', 'Mistry, S', 'Vaudin, M', 'King, A', 'Bentley, D', 'Elgar, G', 'Green, A R']","['Gottgens B', 'Gilbert JG', 'Barton LM', 'Aparicio S', 'Hawker K', 'Mistry S', 'Vaudin M', 'King A', 'Bentley D', 'Elgar G', 'Green AR']","['Department of Haematology, MRC Centre, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fish Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SLP-1 protein, Fugu rubripes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Fish Proteins', 'Fishes, Poisonous/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888-7543(97)95162-4 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1997.5162 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1998 Feb 15;48(1):52-62. doi: 10.1006/geno.1997.5162.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF022814'],,

METHODS: Survival and complications of 175 HCs in 115 patients were studied retrospectively. To describe the data the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test were used, using the date of HC removal due to HC-related infection as endpoint. A stratified Cox regression model was used to determine explanatory factors. RESULTS: Seventy (40%) HCs were removed prematurely because of proven or probable HC-related infections. The incidence of infection leading to HC removal was 4. 78 per 1000 catheter-days for proven HC infections. Univariate analysis revealed that acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, or treatment for these diseases, gender, each subsequent catheter in the same patient and insertion site increased the risk of premature removal of the catheter due to infection. CONCLUSION: Infection is a major problem in patients with HCs. Unfortunately, the factors associated with increased infection rates that were found in this study cannot be influenced. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of environmental conditions in a radiology suite in relation to the risk of developing a catheter-related infection.","['Bakker, J', 'van Overhagen, H', 'Wielenga, J', 'de Marie, S', 'Nouwen, J', 'de Ridder, M A', 'Lameris, J S']","['Bakker J', 'van Overhagen H', 'Wielenga J', 'de Marie S', 'Nouwen J', 'de Ridder MA', 'Lameris JS']","['Department of Radiology, University Hospital Rotterdam, Dr. Molewaterplein 40, NL-3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,8003538,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacterial Infections/*etiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Radiography, Interventional', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002709900226 [doi]'],ppublish,Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol. 1998 Mar-Apr;21(2):116-21. doi: 10.1007/s002709900226.,,,,,,,,,,

Although TI90 was a weak inducer of differentiation, it greatly enhanced the growth inhibition and differentiation of the leukemia cells previously induced by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). TI90 cooperated with VD3 much more effectively than with ATRA in inhibiting cell growth and inducing differentiation. It also decreased the effective concentration of VD3 to the 10(-10) M level. On the other hand, there was no significant synergy between VD3 and the other uracil analogs. TI90 did not affect VD3 metabolism or the number and affinity of VD3 receptors (VDR) in HL-60 cells. Signals from VD3 are predominantly mediated by VDR and the ligand-activated binding of VDR to vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE) as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). According to the results of a gel shift assay, TI90 enhanced the intensity of the retarded band with synthetic VDRE oligomer in the presence of VD3, suggesting that TI90 increases the number of phosphorylated receptors by inhibiting phosphatase activity, and also stimulates the formation of a functional complex of VDR with RXR.","['Kanatani, Y', 'Makishima, M', 'Ishikawa, I', 'Ogasawara, Y', 'Kawahara, N', 'Motoyoshi, K', 'Nagata, N', 'Honma, Y']","['Kanatani Y', 'Makishima M', 'Ishikawa I', 'Ogasawara Y', 'Kawahara N', 'Motoyoshi K', 'Nagata N', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (6-chloro-5-(2-propenyl)-uracil)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Calcitriol/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uracil/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 Mar;26(3):198-206.,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we generated transgenic mice expressing p210bcr/abl by the metallothionein enhancer/promoter (MT/p210bcr/abl) and observed that these mice reproducibly developed T cell leukemia. In this report, we describe the establishment, characterization, and chromosomal analysis of two novel leukemic cell lines derived from MT/p210bcr/abl leukemic mice. Both cell lines carried the transgene and showed the same gene rearrangement patterns as observed in the parental leukemic cells. Expression, tyrosine-phosphorylation, and enhanced kinase activity of the p210bcr/abl were also detected. RT-PCR/SSCP for p53 transcript revealed that one of the cell lines carried a mutation, in contrast to the normal pattern shown by the parental leukemic cells. In addition, the other cell line showed a karyotype of trisomy 15. These results suggest that the p53 mutation and chromosomal abnormality may confer a proliferative ability on leukemic cells in vitro. These new cell lines are considered to be a valuable model not only for examining the biologic properties of p210bcr/abl but also for investigating the malignant process that promotes the proliferation of the leukemic cells expressing p210bcr/abl. Furthermore, these cell lines could be used in therapeutic studies, including adoptive immunotherapy.","['Honda, H', 'Ohno, S', 'Takahashi, T', 'Takatoku, M', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Honda H', 'Ohno S', 'Takahashi T', 'Takatoku M', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Cd86 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Trisomy', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 Mar;26(3):188-97.,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to decrease post-transplant relapse rates, 67 patients under the age of 50 years with high-risk or advanced-stage hematological malignancies received an intensified regimen of FTBI and etoposide plus cyclophosphamide followed by BMT from a genotypically-matched related donor.

Fraction F3 was, therefore, further purified on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient, and the 3 resulting fractions were analyzed. The InsP3 binding sites were distributed over the gradient and did not co-migrate with the RNA. We examined the relative content of the three InsP3R isoforms, of both SERCA2b and 3, as well as that of the four Ca2+ binding proteins in fraction F3 and the sucrose density gradient fractions. InsP3R-1 and InsP3R-2 showed a similar distribution, with the highest level in the light and intermediate density fractions. InsP3R-3 distributed differently, with the highest level in the intermediate density fraction. Both SERCA isoforms distributed similarly to InsP3R-1 and InsP3R-2. SERCA3 was present at a very low level in the high density fraction. Calreticulin and BiP showed a pattern similar to that of InsP3R-1 and InsP3R-2 and the SERCAs. PDI was clearly enriched in the light density fraction while calnexin was broadly distributed.

Fluorescence quenching studies were used to establish binding constants for 1-24 within calf thymus DNA, within a single high affinity bis-intercalation binding site 5'-d(GCATGC)2, and to establish the preference for sandramycin binding to 5'-d(GCXXGC)2 where XX = AT, TA, GC, and CG. From the latter studies, sandramycin was found to exhibit a preference that follows the order: 5'-d(GCATGC)2 > 5'-d(GCGCGC)2, deltadeltaGo = 0.3kcal/mol > 5'-d(GCTAGC)2, 5'-d(GCCGGC)2, deltadeltaGo = 0.6 kcal/mol although it binds with high affinity to all four deoxyoligonucleotides. The two highest affinity sequences constitute repeating 5'-PuPy motifs with each intercalation event occurring at a 5'-PyPu step. The most effective sequence constitutes the less stable duplex, contains the sterically most accessible minor groove central to the bis-intercalation site, and the ability to accept two gly-NH/TC2 carbonyl H-bonds identified in prior NMR studies. Similarly, the contribution of the individual structural features of the chromophore were assessed with the high affinity duplex sequence 5'-d(GCATGC)2. To a first approximation, the cytotoxic properties were found to parallel trends established in the DNA binding affinities. The exception to this generalization was 4 which lacks the sandramycin chromophore phenol. Although typically 4-10x less potent than sandramycin against leukemia cell lines, it proved to be 1-10,000x more potent against melanomas, carcinomas, and adenocarcinomas exhibiting IC50 values of 1 pM-10 nM placing it among the most potent agents identified to date. Additionally, the first disclosure of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity of sandramycin (1) as well as that of its key analogs are described and define the chromophore structural features required for their exceptional potency. Two analogs, 18 and 3, roughly maintain the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory potency of 1 but exhibit substantially diminished cytotoxic activity (10(2)-10(3)x).","['Boger, D L', 'Chen, J H', 'Saionz, K W', 'Jin, Q']","['Boger DL', 'Chen JH', 'Saionz KW', 'Jin Q']","['Department of Chemistry and The Skaggs Institute of Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hydroxyquinolines)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '100940-65-6 (sandramycin)', '339NCG44TV (Phenol)', '75580-37-9 (BBM-928 A)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Cell Death', 'DNA/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyquinolines/pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides/metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phenol/chemistry', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0968089697100141 [pii]', '10.1016/s0968-0896(97)10014-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 1998 Jan;6(1):85-102. doi: 10.1016/s0968-0896(97)10014-1.,['CA 41101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

After confirming the cross-reactivity of the antibody in suppressing the IL-6-mediated proliferation of rat liver cells, GPX7 was injected once a week at doses of 1 (low dose) or 4 (high dose) mg/kg body weight (BW). In the lumbar body, bone mineral density values and the trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) were maintained in the GPX7 groups. The values of the trabecular osteoclast surface and number in the GPX7 high-dose group were significantly smaller than those in the OVX controls. The double-labeled surface and bone formation rates in the GPX7 high-dose group were significantly increased. In the proximal tibia, however, the bone mineral content and BV/ TV values in the GPX7 groups were smaller, but the trabecular thickness value in the GPX7 high-dose group was larger than in the OVX control. The single-labeled surface in the GPX7 high-dose group was significantly larger than that in the OVX control rats. Though the parameter values of trabecular osteoclasts were apparently smaller, the differences were not significant. 17-beta estradiol (0.125 mg/kg BW a week) administration prevented the bone loss by reducing the parameters of bone formation and resorption in both the lumbar and the proximal tibia. The antibody administration to the normal rats did not cause any significant changes in the parameters of bone mass and turnover. These data demonstrate that while GPX7 modulates the bone turnover after ovariectomy in rats, it does not compensate for the action of estrogen after ovariectomy in rats.","['Nishida, S', 'Okimoto, N', 'Okazaki, Y', 'Yamaguchi, A', 'Kumegawa, M', 'Yasukawa, K', 'Murayama, K', 'Nakamura, T']","['Nishida S', 'Okimoto N', 'Okazaki Y', 'Yamaguchi A', 'Kumegawa M', 'Yasukawa K', 'Murayama K', 'Nakamura T']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Calcif Tissue Int,Calcified tissue international,7905481,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Density/drug effects', 'Bone Remodeling/*drug effects', 'Calcium/blood', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Femur/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/drug effects/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Osteocalcin/blood', '*Ovariectomy', 'Phosphorus/blood', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tibia/drug effects/pathology']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002239900422 [doi]'],ppublish,Calcif Tissue Int. 1998 Mar;62(3):227-36. doi: 10.1007/s002239900422.,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed a shift of DNA polymerase alpha and beta activities. DNA polymerase alpha, which in controls was found to be the principal replicative enzyme driving DNA synthesis, underwent, upon apoptosis, a large decrease of its activity being replaced by DNA polymerase beta which is believed to be associated with DNA repair. Such a modulation was concomitant with a topographical redistribution of both DNA polymerase alpha and the incorporation of BrdUrd throughout the nucleus. Taken together, these results indicate the occurrence of a dramatic response of the DNA machinery, through a possible common or at least similar behaviour when different cell lines are triggered to apoptosis. Although this possibility requires further investigation, these findings suggest an extreme attempt of the cell undergoing apoptosis to preserve its nuclear environment by switching on a repair/defence mechanism during fragmentation and chromatin margination.","['Miscia, S', 'Di Baldassarre, A', 'Alba Rana, R', 'Di Pietro, R', 'Cataldi, A']","['Miscia S', 'Di Baldassarre A', 'Alba Rana R', 'Di Pietro R', 'Cataldi A']","[""Istituto di Morfologia Umana Normale, Universita G. d'Annunzio, Chieti, Italy. s.miscia@morpho.unich.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase beta)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA Polymerase I/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'DNA Polymerase beta/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/drug effects/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'HL-60 Cells/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Hypothermia/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/ultrastructure', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Prolif. 1997 Aug-Sep;30(8-9):325-40.,,,,,,,PMC6496848,,,

METHODS: Various survival factors were injected intravitreally into one eye of mice at or soon after the beginning of photoreceptor degeneration, with the opposite eye serving as the control, and the eyes were examined histologically at later ages. The survival factors included brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin-4, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), Axokine (a mutein of CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and nerve growth factor and insulin-like growth factor II, either alone or in various combinations. RESULTS: Photoreceptor degeneration was slowed in rd/rd and nr/nr mutant mice and in Q344ter mutant rhodopsin mice by certain forms of CNTF; the degeneration in Q344ter mice was slowed by Axokine and by leukemia inhibitory factor; and the degeneration in a few nr/nr mice was slowed by BDNF. The other agents were ineffective in these mice, and none of the agents were effective in the other mutants and other mutant rhodopsin transgenic mice. However, light damage experiments that compared agent effectiveness in albino mice versus rats suggested a significant delivery problem with the very small mouse eye, thereby making the interpretation of negative findings equivocal in mutant mice. Basic fibroblast growth factor failed to protect the mouse retina from the damaging effects of constant light, whereas it showed a strong protective effect in the rat, indicating an important species difference. CONCLUSIONS: The slowing of degeneration in the rd/rd and Q344ter mutant mice demonstrated that intraocularly injected survival factors can protect photoreceptors from degenerating in animal models with the same or similar genetic defects as those in human inherited retinal degenerations.","['LaVail, M M', 'Yasumura, D', 'Matthes, M T', 'Lau-Villacorta, C', 'Unoki, K', 'Sung, C H', 'Steinberg, R H']","['LaVail MM', 'Yasumura D', 'Matthes MT', 'Lau-Villacorta C', 'Unoki K', 'Sung CH', 'Steinberg RH']","['Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0730, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Combinations', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Injections', 'Light/adverse effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Photoreceptor Cells/*drug effects/pathology/radiation effects', 'Radiation Injuries, Experimental/etiology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Retinal Degeneration/etiology/genetics/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Vitreous Body']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1998 Mar;39(3):592-602.,"['R01 EY011307/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY01429/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY01919/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY06842/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We report a patient with small lymphocytic lymphoma (phenotypic CLL) who developed symptomatic anemia 3 weeks after her fifth cycle of fludarabine, a T cell immunosuppressant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An antibody screen and panel, direct antiglobulin test, rapid acid eluate, rabbit erythrocyte stroma (RESt) adsorption, and autoadsorption were performed. RESULTS: Warm and cold autoantibodies were detected. prompt treatment with corticosteroids and minimal blood transfusions led to marked improvement. CONCLUSION: Normally, T cells suppress polyclonal lymphocytes that produce autoantibodies. Suppression of T cells in this patient, in addition to the underlying disease process, may explain this mixed-type AIHA, the first reported case to occur following fludarabine treatment.","['Vick, D J', 'Byrd, J C', 'Beal, C L', 'Chaffin, D J']","['Vick DJ', 'Byrd JC', 'Beal CL', 'Chaffin DJ']","['Department of Pathology, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC 20307, USA. djvick615@POL.NET']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Vox Sang,Vox sanguinis,0413606,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/*complications', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Autoantibodies/analysis', 'Coombs Test', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Temperature', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1998/03/21 03:17,2000/10/06 11:01,['1998/03/21 03:17'],"['1998/03/21 03:17 [pubmed]', '2000/10/06 11:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 03:17 [entrez]']",['vox74122 [pii]'],ppublish,Vox Sang. 1998;74(2):122-6.,,,,,,,,,,

The strength of man-made EM field is often far above the natural level and this finding has encouraged a large group of researchers to investigate its possible health effect. Non-ionizing radiation and extremely low-frequency electric and magnetic fields have been the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental works since Adey published his observations concerning non-linear and non-thermal biological effects. At the same time an epidemiological material appeared suggesting that EM field generates various diseases including leukemia and brain tumors. Possible mechanisms of EM field interactions with living matter remain unknown although theoretical models have been proposed by many authors. In vitro and in vivo studies as well as epidemiological data have not provided the ground for decisive conclusions. Nevertheless, the relationship between EM fields and biological effects seems to be most likely. Any international standards for safety limits have not as yet been established and regulations in this regard vary in different countries. However, occupational and residential exposure to EM field can be efficiently measured using an appropriate equipment and such measurements should become a standard procedure wherever electrosmog is suspected to be a pathogenic factor.","['Fedorowski, A', 'Steciwko, A']","['Fedorowski A', 'Steciwko A']","['Zakladu Medycyny Rodzinnej, Akademii Medycznej we Wroclawiu.']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Med Pr,Medycyna pracy,0376642,['0 (Smog)'],IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Monitoring/methods/standards', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', '*Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Smog/*adverse effects/prevention & control']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Pr. 1997;48(5):507-19.,,,,"Elektrosmog jako czynnik zagrozenia zdrowia: zrodla sztucznych pol elektromagnetycznych, ocena ryzyka zdrowotnego, metody zapobiegania.",,,,,,

Although cultured rat sympathetic neurons respond very weakly to exogenous interleukin 6 (IL-6), we find that addition of soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and IL-6 enhances neuronal survival in the absence of nerve growth factor. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6 block these effects. Addition of IL-6 and sIL-6R also induces a subset of neuropeptide and transmitter synthetic enzyme mRNAs identical to that demonstrated for leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and oncostatin M. Both of these effects are duplicated by addition of a highly active fusion protein of sIL-6R and IL-6, covalently linked by a flexible peptide chain, which is designated H-IL-6. In addition, we show that sympathetic neurons produce IL-6. In situ hybridization indicates a neuronal localization of IL-6 mRNA in superior cervical ganglia, and bioactive IL-6 protein is detected in ganglion culture supernatants. Interestingly, the IL-6 produced by sympathetic neurons does not lead to survival of these cells in culture unless sIL-6R is added. Thus, sympathetic neurons can produce IL-6 and may respond to it in an autocrine/paracrine manner if sIL-6R is present. Moreover, the prior findings of sIL-6R in serum and inflammatory fluids now have added interest in the context of neuro-immune interactions.","['Marz, P', 'Cheng, J G', 'Gadient, R A', 'Patterson, P H', 'Stoyan, T', 'Otten, U', 'Rose-John, S']","['Marz P', 'Cheng JG', 'Gadient RA', 'Patterson PH', 'Stoyan T', 'Otten U', 'Rose-John S']","['Department of Medicine, Section Pathophysiology, Mainz University, Obere Zahlbacherstrasse 63, 55101 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Contactins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Contactins', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nerve Growth Factors/biosynthesis', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Neuropeptides/biosynthesis', 'PC12 Cells', 'RNA, Messenger/isolation & purification', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology/*metabolism']",1998/04/18 00:00,1998/04/18 00:01,['1998/04/18 00:00'],"['1998/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.6.3251 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Mar 17;95(6):3251-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.6.3251.,,,,,,,PMC19728,,,

We show here that neural precursors isolated from the developing forebrain of mice that are deficient in the gene for the low-affinity leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR-/-) fail to generate astrocytes expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) when cultured in vitro. Precursors from mice heterozygous for the null allele show normal levels of GFAP expression. These findings support the in vivo findings that show extremely low levels of GFAP mRNA in brains of embryonic day 19 LIFR-/- mice. In addition, monolayers of neural cells from LIFR-/- mice are far less able to support the neuronal differentiation of normal neural precursors than are monolayers from heterozygous or wild-type animals, indicating that endogenous signaling through the LIFR is required for the expression of both functional and phenotypic markers of astrocyte differentiation. LIFR-/- precursors are not irreversibly blocked from differentiating into astrocytes: they express GFAP after long-term passaging or stimulation with bone morphogenetic protein-2. These findings strongly implicate the LIF family of cytokines in the regulation of astrocyte differentiation and indeed the LIF-deficient animals show a significant reduction in the number of GFAP cells in the hippocampus. However, because this reduction is only partial it suggests that LIF may not be the predominant endogenous ligand signaling through the LIFR.","['Koblar, S A', 'Turnley, A M', 'Classon, B J', 'Reid, K L', 'Ware, C B', 'Cheema, S S', 'Murphy, M', 'Bartlett, P F']","['Koblar SA', 'Turnley AM', 'Classon BJ', 'Reid KL', 'Ware CB', 'Cheema SS', 'Murphy M', 'Bartlett PF']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, 3050 Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Bmp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/*deficiency/genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Hippocampus/cytology/metabolism', 'Homozygote', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*deficiency/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Prosencephalon/*cytology/embryology/growth & development', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*deficiency/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', '*Transforming Growth Factor beta']",1998/04/18 00:00,1998/04/18 00:01,['1998/04/18 00:00'],"['1998/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.6.3178 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Mar 17;95(6):3178-81. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.6.3178.,,,,,,,PMC19715,,,

Viral maturation requires proteolytic processing of the Gag polyprotein at the matrix-capsid junction, which liberates the capsid (CA) domain to condense from the spherical protein coat of the immature virus into the conical core of the mature virus. We propose that upon proteolysis, the amino-terminal end of the capsid refolds into a beta-hairpin/helix structure that is stabilized by formation of a salt bridge between the processed amino-terminus (Pro1) and a highly conserved aspartate residue (Asp51). The refolded amino-terminus then creates a new CA-CA interface that is essential for assembling the condensed conical core. Consistent with this model, we found that recombinant capsid proteins with as few as four matrix residues fused to their amino-termini formed spheres in vitro, but that removing these residues refolded the capsid amino-terminus and redirected protein assembly from spheres to cylinders. Moreover, point mutations throughout the putative CA-CA interface blocked capsid assembly in vitro, core assembly in vivo and viral infectivity. Disruption of the conserved amino-terminal capsid salt bridge also abolished the infectivity of Moloney murine leukemia viral particles, suggesting that lenti- and oncoviruses mature via analogous pathways.","['von Schwedler, U K', 'Stemmler, T L', 'Klishko, V Y', 'Li, S', 'Albertine, K H', 'Davis, D R', 'Sundquist, W I']","['von Schwedler UK', 'Stemmler TL', 'Klishko VY', 'Li S', 'Albertine KH', 'Davis DR', 'Sundquist WI']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Capsid/*chemistry/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry', 'HIV-1/chemistry/growth & development/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Point Mutation', '*Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/chemistry', 'Virion/ultrastructure', 'Virus Assembly/*physiology']",1998/05/02 00:00,1998/05/02 00:01,['1998/05/02 00:00'],"['1998/05/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/02 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/17.6.1555 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1998 Mar 16;17(6):1555-68. doi: 10.1093/emboj/17.6.1555.,"['R01 AI37524/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI40333/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR10489/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC1170503,,['EMBO J 2000 May 15;19(10):2391'],

When inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) into neonatal mice, Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV is attenuated for development of disease. Previous studies in mice infected with wild-type M-MuLV have revealed several important preleukemic events, including development of splenic hyperplasia, defects in bone marrow hematopoiesis, and in vivo generation of MCF viruses that arise by recombination in the uninfected mouse. Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV is defective in inducing these effects after s.c. inoculation. In the experiments reported here, a study of Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV infection in rats was carried out. Wild-type M-MuLV is leukemogenic in rats, but infected rats do not form MCF recombinants since they lack the necessary endogenous polytropic envelope sequences. Since Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV's leukemogenic defect is correlated with a failure to generate MCF recombinants, it seemed possible that wild-type M-MuLV might not have a leukemogenic advantage over Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV in rats, where MCF recombinants cannot form. Neonatal Fisher F344 rats were inoculated s.c. or intraperitoneally by wild-type and Mo + PyF101 M-MuLVs. Surprisingly, Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV was completely deficient in leukemogenesis in rats when inoculated by either route while wild-type M-MuLV induced lymphoma with the predicted time course. The leukemogenic defect for Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV resulted from a pronounced defect for establishing infection in rats.

These cells remained mitotically active (up to 8 months), were immunoreactive for the progenitor cell marker nestin, and were readily infected with the BAG alpha retrovirus. When incubated in complete media containing serum in poly-L-lysine-coated plates, these cells spontaneously converted to neurons and glia but rarely expressed the dopamine (DA) neuron phenotype. Nineteen different cytokines were screened for their ability to induce the DA phenotype and only interleukin (IL)-1 was found to induce the expression of the DA neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The addition of IL-1, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were found to further increase the number of TH immunoreactive (TH-ir) cells. The addition of mesencephalic membrane fragments and striatal culture-conditioned media along with the cytokine mixture induced the expression of morphologically mature TH-ir cells that were also immunoreactive for dopa-decarboxylase, the DA transporter, and DA itself. The DA neuron cell counts were approximately 20-25% of the overall cell population and 50% of the neurofilament population. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were also present. These data suggest that hematopoietic cytokines participate in the development of the DA neuron phenotype. Parallels between the function of hematopoietic cytokines in bone marrow and the central nervous system may exist and be useful in understanding the factors which regulate the differentiation of neurons in the brain.","['Ling, Z D', 'Potter, E D', 'Lipton, J W', 'Carvey, P M']","['Ling ZD', 'Potter ED', 'Lipton JW', 'Carvey PM']","[""Department of Pharmacology, Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Neurol,Experimental neurology,0370712,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Gdnf protein, rat)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'EC 4.1.1.- (Dopa Decarboxylase)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology', 'Biomarkers', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corpus Striatum/physiology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Dopa Decarboxylase/biosynthesis', 'Dopamine/*metabolism', 'Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mesencephalon/cytology/*embryology', '*Nerve Growth Factors', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology', 'Rats', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/biosynthesis']",1998/03/17 00:00,1998/03/17 00:01,['1998/03/17 00:00'],"['1998/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4886(98)96715-2 [pii]', '10.1006/exnr.1998.6715 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Neurol. 1998 Feb;149(2):411-23. doi: 10.1006/exnr.1998.6715.,['NS33174/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

This is particularly true for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Most patients with AML usually are able to achieve complete remission, but only a minority obtain long-term survival. In addition, much of the success achieved has been due to escalation of chemotherapeutic dosing and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. There is thus a great need for improved therapies which would ideally be able to circumvent drug resistance and more specifically target leukemic cells. Advances in immunobiology over the past century have led to new hope for the development of immune-mediated vaccine therapies for patients with cancer. This review focuses on the development of vaccine approaches for treatment of AML and some of the potential advantages and problems.","['Arceci, R J']",['Arceci RJ'],"[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Vaccination']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s001090050195 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 1998 Feb;76(2):80-93. doi: 10.1007/s001090050195.,,,180,,,,,,,

However, nucleolar accumulation of nucleophosmin-ALK may not be necessary for its oncogenic action, because an ALK protein expressed in a lymphoma carrying a variant (1;2) chromosomal translocation did not accumulate in nucleoli. Furthermore, an engineered hybrid TPR-ALK protein can transform rodent fibroblasts and produce lymphomas in mice while remaining confined to the cytoplasm.

No abnormalities in exons 1 and 2 of Ha-, Ki- and N-ras were detected in all leukemias. In the p53 gene, an A to C transition was found at the second base of codon 198 (Asn-Thr) in one leukemia, but others had no mutation.

To clarify the importance of RFC functions in the antifolate resistance, we have examined the expression of RFC1 and its phenotype as a folate transporter in human leukemia cell lines resistant to various antifolates. MOLT-3 cells resistant to ZD9331 (a thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor that utilizes the RFC for cell entry) (MOLT-3/ZD9331) showed decreased expression of RFC1 concomitant with diminished cellular uptake of [3H]methotrexate (MTX). K562 cells resistant to raltitrexed (ZD1694, another TS inhibitor that utilizes the RFC for cell entry) (K562/ ZD1694 x C) scarcely expressed RFC1, which is in accordance with the impaired uptake of folate analogs and the high degree of resistance to ZD1694 and MTX. On the other hand, no apparent decrease of RFCI1 expression was found in transport-deficient MTX-resistant MOLT-3 cells (MOLT-3/MTX10000) though its phenotype showed defective transport of MTX or ZD1694. In these cell lines with impaired RFC function, [3H]leucovorin (LV) uptake was only moderately decreased as compared to [3H]MTX or [3H]ZD1694 uptake. These cells grew with a minimal retardation in folate-free medium supplemented with 10 nM LV, suggesting that these cell lines with impaired RFC function had enough folate transporters to transport LV. In contrast to downregulation of RFC, the much greater uptake of [3H]MTX was observed in the MOLT-3/trimetrexate (TMQ)800-MTX10000 in parallel with increased RFC1 expression. These cell lines with the altered expression of RFC1 may serve as models useful for investigating the regulation of RFC1 expression and for understanding the molecular mechanism(s) behind the transport-mediated antifolate resistance.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Takemura, Y', 'Ohnuma, T']","['Kobayashi H', 'Takemura Y', 'Ohnuma T']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan. hkobayas@is.icc.u-tokai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Folic Acid/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Quinazolines/pharmacokinetics', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Thiophenes/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(97)00464-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(97)00464-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1998 Feb 27;124(2):135-42. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(97)00464-3.,,,,,,,,,,

The cytokine SDF-1/PBSF is a highly efficient chemoattractant for lymphocytes. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that among various human T-cell lines, those infected with HTLV-1 selectively expressed the SDF-1 gene. Expression of the viral protein Tax in a human T-cell line induced the expression of the SDF-1 gene, indicating that the constitutive expression of SDF-1 in virus-infected cell lines is at least in part mediated by Tax. HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines also expressed CXCR-4, a receptor for SDF-1. Moreover, chemotaxis assay showed that a HTLV-1-infected cell line migrated toward synthetic SDF-1. Thus, HTLV-1-infected cells are themselves responders for SDF-1. Our results suggest that SDF-1 induced by Tax may alter the distribution of HTLV-1-infected cells in vivo; hence it may contribute to their infiltration into affected tissues in HTLV-1-associated inflammatory diseases.","['Arai, M', 'Ohashi, T', 'Tsukahara, T', 'Murakami, T', 'Hori, T', 'Uchiyama, T', 'Yamamoto, N', 'Kannagi, M', 'Fujii, M']","['Arai M', 'Ohashi T', 'Tsukahara T', 'Murakami T', 'Hori T', 'Uchiyama T', 'Yamamoto N', 'Kannagi M', 'Fujii M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', '*Chemokines, CXC', 'Chemotactic Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Receptors, CXCR4/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(97)98968-6 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8968 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Feb 15;241(2):298-303. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8968.,,,,,,,,,,

Because of these similarities, which also include terminal B cell lymphoma formation, this syndrome has been called murine AIDS or MAIDS. Prompted by previous reports showing that the onset of MAIDS is dependent on the presence of both CD4+ T and B cells, we have previously shown that anti-gp39/CD40 ligand mAb (anti-CD40L mAb) treatment of LP-BM5-infected mice is effective in inhibiting the induction of MAIDS when a short course of anti-CD40L mAb treatment was started on the same day as LP-BM5 administration. The success of anti-CD40L mAb therapy, as indicated by a much reduced degree of splenomegaly, hypergammaglobulinemia, and mitogen and allogeneic CTL unresponsiveness, demonstrated that CD40L/CD40 interactions were critical to the establishment of MAIDS. Here we extend these findings through the use of delayed anti-CD40L mAb treatment of mice, beginning 3-4 weeks after LP-BM5 infection, by showing that interruption of CD40L/CD40 interactions also interferes with the progression of MAIDS. About 60% of LP-BM5-preinfected mice were affected by delayed anti-CD40L mAb treatment, with substantially reduced spleen weights and serum hypergammaglobulinemia and normal or greatly restored proliferative responses to Con A stimulation and CTL responses to allogeneic stimulation. The other LP-BM5-infected mice that did not respond to anti-CD40L therapy were found to have made antibodies to the anti-CD40L mAb. Thus, in a majority of mice anti-CD40L mAb therapy was very effective in interfering with MAIDS pathogenesis well after the establishment of the virus infection and MAIDS symptomatology, indicating that CD40L/CD40 interactions are crucial to the maintenance and progression of the disease, as well as its initiation.","['Green, K A', 'Noelle, R J', 'Green, W R']","['Green KA', 'Noelle RJ', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Disease Progression', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/*physiopathology/virology', 'Splenomegaly/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(97)98970-4 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8970 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Feb 15;241(2):260-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8970.,"['CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50157/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the use of lentiviruses for gene transfer because they infect nondividing cells. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been the lentivirus most often used for this purpose, but its genomic complexity and limited tropism present some challenges to the establishment of efficient gene transfer systems. In this paper we present data showing intrinsic differences between the infectivity of wild-type HIV and HIV particles pseudotyped with heterologous envelope glycoproteins. Interestingly, HIV pseudotypes with envelope glycoproteins from the amphotropic murine leukemia virus or the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) are 3 and 40 times more infectious than wild-type HIV, respectively. In addition, we show that the reliance on Nef expression for maximal infectivity of HIV particles is dependent on the path of virus entry. The dependence on Nef for higher infectivity is greater for amphotropic pseudotypes and wild-type HIV than for VSV-G pseudotypes. We conclude that VSV-G pseudotypes of HIV vectors are an excellent choice for gene transfer purposes and Nef-mediated viral infectivity enhancement is affected by virus entry pathway.","['Luo, T', 'Douglas, J L', 'Livingston, R L', 'Garcia, J V']","['Luo T', 'Douglas JL', 'Livingston RL', 'Garcia JV']","[""Department of Virology and Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Gene Products, nef)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '88899-55-2 (bafilomycin A1)', 'EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Endosomes', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Products, nef/genetics/*physiology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'HIV-1/drug effects/growth & development/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes', '*Macrolides', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(97)98966-2 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8966 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Feb 15;241(2):224-33. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8966.,"['AI-33331/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-39416/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

We have established and characterized an immortalized line of milk epithelial cells, HTLV-LEC, that are productively infected and transformed with HTLV-I. This is the first reported case of human cells, other than T cells, that are transformed with HTLV-I. Cultures of HTLV-LEC are distinctive because of the synthesis of an extensive extracellular matrix that appears to support in vitro morphogenesis.

Can we improve upon clinical parameters?,705-9,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cellular and molecular features including tumor cell proliferation, immunophenotype, adhesion molecule expression and release, and karyotypic abnormalities have been linked with survival in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Although information provided from these studies makes it possible to better appreciate the biological heterogeneity of the disease, it is not clear whether they may substitute clinical features in the prognostic assessment of CLL patients. The objective of this article is to analyze the performance of new prognostic variables, keeping in mind that clinicians should give priority to less expensive biological assays. INFORMATION SOURCES: In the present review, we examined personal papers in this field, and articles or abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. STATE OF ART: Clinico-prognostic staging systems do not provide criteria accurate enough to identify patients with progressive disease. Although several in vitro methods have been utilized to evaluate tumor cell proliferation and to correlate this parameter with long-term survival, it is difficult to translate the results of kinetic studies into prognosis. Interestingly, prognostic implications of kinetic parameters are exemplified by clinical studies based on lymphocyte doubling time (LDT). Attempts to correlate immunophenotype with prognosis have yielded inconclusive results. This is probably due to the absence of strict immunological criteria. The membrane instability of CD23, rapidly cleaved into a soluble form, provides a highly specific and reliable serum marker. Expression of myelomonocytic antigens (i.e., CD11b, CD13) appears to be restricted to patients with CD5- CLL. Both cellular expression and release in the serum of some adhesion molecules (i.e., CD54, CD44 standard) have been linked with prognosis. The increased use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques, which make it possible to identify karyotypic abnormalities even in cases with inadequate mytoses, has contributed to a better definition of incidence and clinical relevance of karyotypic abnormalities in CLL. Trisomy 12 is significantly associated with atypical morphological and/or immunological features, high proliferative activity and poor prognosis; the prognostic effect of 11q deletions is consistent in patients under 55 years of age. Usually, in absence of the rearrangement of the bcl-2 locus, B-CLL cells express bcl-2 gene product, whose intracellular levels do not correlate with clinical stages but do correlate with survival, thereby suggesting a possible independent prognostic value. Finally, p53 tumor suppressor gene has been associated with resistance to therapy with fludarabine. PERSPECTIVES: Even though prognostic assessment of CLL patients is generally based on clinical staging systems new biological parameters which reflect the clinical heterogeneity of the disease are under evaluation. Whether in the future clinicians will substitute biological variables for clinical features is matter of debate. The prognostic value of biological parameters is hampered, in some instances, by the small number of patients presenting these features (i.e., 11q deletions in 20%, p53 mutations in 15%). More likely, biological parameters might be incorporated into clinico-prognostic models thus leading to the formulation of a clinical-biological system for CLL.","['Molica, S']",['Molica S'],"['Divisione Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Cell Division/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Prognosis']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Nov-Dec;82(6):705-9.,,,76,,,,,,,

In an attempt to minimize the non-hematologic toxicity and obtain a potent antileukemic effect, MSKCC activated a pilot study in previously treated adult ALL, using HD-ARA-C combined with idarubicin administered as a single high-dose infusion. We herein report our experience with a series of pediatric and adult high risk ALL and NHL patients treated with the protocol above, which confirms its feasibility, response rate and individual compliance. METHODS: In a clinical phase II study, the combination of a single high dose (HD) of idarubicin and HD cytosine-arabinoside (ARA-C), as designed at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, was applied to 70 adults and children with refractory or early relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Therapy consisted of HD-ARA-C 3 g/m2/d on days 1-5, idarubicin 40 mg/m2 on day 3, prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate on days 1 and 4, and G-CSF 5 mg/kg/d s.c. from day 7 to hematopoietic reconstitution (PMN > 0.5 x 10(9)/L). RESULTS: Fifty-five of the 70 patients (78%) achieved complete remission (CR), four died in aplasia due to infection and 11 were non-responders. Recovery of blood counts occurred at a median of 21 days from the start of treatment. Non-hematologic side effects were extremely limited and consisted predominantly of infections. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In view of the highly unfavorable series of patients selected, this study confirms the feasibility and antileukemic activity of the HD-idarubicin + HD-ARA-C combination in patients with refractory and early relapse ALL and NHL. The excellent tolerance to this regimen does not preclude bone marrow transplantation as post-remission treatment.","['Testi, A M', 'Moleti, M L', 'Giona, F', 'Annino, L', 'Chiaretti, S', 'Del Giudice, I', 'Todisco, E', ""D'Elia, G"", 'Ferrari, A', 'Arcese, W', 'Mandelli, F']","['Testi AM', 'Moleti ML', 'Giona F', 'Annino L', 'Chiaretti S', 'Del Giudice I', 'Todisco E', ""D'Elia G"", 'Ferrari A', 'Arcese W', 'Mandelli F']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Rome']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Nov-Dec;82(6):664-7.,,,,,,,,,,

We set out to evaluate in a multicenter study the efficacy and tolerability of an intensive therapy with IDA and Ara-C in patients with RAEB and RAEB-t, the rate and duration of complete remission, and the overall survival in adults treated with full doses and in the elderly treated with lower doses; furthermore, we investigated the efficacy of low-dose maintenance chemotherapy. METHODS: Pretreated adult patients with de novo RAEB and RAEB-t, meeting at least one of the following criteria, were included: neutrophils < 0.5 x 10(9)/L or moderate neutropenia with infectious episodes, platelets < 30 x 10(9)/L or moderate thrombocytopenia with bleeding symptoms, transfusion > 4 red cell units/months, rapid increase of bone marrow blasts. Induction treatment consisted of a cycle with IDA and Ara-C. Adult patients less than 65 years old were treated with the following doses: Ara-C 1 g/m2/day i.v. 6-hour infusion, on days 1-4, IDA 10 mg/m2/day i.v., on days 1-3. Elderly patients (> or = 65 yrs) were treated with lower doses: Ara-C 1 g/m2/day 6 hours infusion, on days 1 and 2, IDA 10 mg/m2/day i.v., on days 1 and 2. Responders followed a consolidation course identical to induction. RESULTS: From February 1994 to February 1997, 25 patients were enrolled, 20 males and 5 females aged between 22 and 76, 10 were > or = 65 years old, 7 had RAEB and 18 had RAEB-t. Twelve cases (48%) achieved complete remission (CR), 7 cases (28%) achieved partial remission, 4 patients were resistant and two patients (8%) died during the aplastic phase. A significantly higher CR rate was found in younger patients (p = 0.036), while gender, FAB subtype, presence of Auer rods, cytogenetic findings, and the interval from diagnosis to treatment did not significantly influence CR achievement. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that in de novo RAEB and RAEB-t, treatment with IDA and Ara-C is associated with satisfactory frequency of response with acceptable toxicity.","['Invernizzi, R', 'Pecci, A', 'Rossi, G', 'Pelizzari, A M', 'Giusto, M', 'Tinelli, C', 'Ascari, E']","['Invernizzi R', 'Pecci A', 'Rossi G', 'Pelizzari AM', 'Giusto M', 'Tinelli C', 'Ascari E']","['Universita di Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Risk Factors']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Nov-Dec;82(6):660-3.,,,,,,,,,,

A reference laboratory was created in order to perform karyotype analysis on all cases of acute leukemia enrolled in the AIEOP (Associazione Italiana Emato-Oncologia Pediatrica) protocols. METHODS: From January 1990 to December 1995, 1115 samples of children with ALL or AML were sent in for cytogenetic analysis. The results of cell cultures were screened in the Reference Laboratory and then the fixed metaphases were sent to one of the six cytogenetic laboratories for analysis. RESULTS: The leukemic karyotypes of 556 patients were successfully analyzed. An abnormal clone was detected in 49% of cases of ALL and in 66% of AML. In ALL the most frequent abnormality was 9p rearrangement. Other recurrent abnormalities were t(9;22), t(4;11) and t(1;19). In AML t(8;21), t(15;17) and 11q23 rearrangement were the most frequent structural abnormalities. These findings are similar to the results obtained in other multicenter studies using a similar approach.

The molecular nature of spontaneous EMS- and UV-induced mutations in the coding region of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) was determined for wild-type FEL cells and two APRT-deficient mutant sub-clones which have significantly reduced ATP pool levels, and are mutagen-hypersensitive. Mis-sense base substitutions were the predominant type of spontaneous mutation. However, exon deletions, possibly involving aberrant splicing of HPRT mRNA, and a non-sense mutation were also observed. EMS-induced mutations in wild-type and APRT-deficient mutant sub-clones were GC-->AT transitions, which is consistent with O6-ethylguanine being the primary pre-mutagenic lesion. All UV-induced mutations in both cell types were targeted to dipyrimidine sites where the two most common classes of photoproducts (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and [6-4] photoproducts) are formed. The similarity in the mutations observed in both cell types indicates that the mutagen hypersensitivity of APRT-deficient cells may be the result of decreased efficiency in the excision repair processes due to reduced levels of ATP.","['Yadollahi-Farsani, M', 'McKenna, P G', 'McKelvey-Martin, V J']","['Yadollahi-Farsani M', 'McKenna PG', 'McKelvey-Martin VJ']","['School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulster, Coleraine, Co.

When HL-60 cells were exposed to ara-C (10 or 100 microM;6 h) followed by bryostatin 1 alone (10 nM; 24 h), no increase in apoptosis was noted. In contrast, subsequent exposure of ara-C-pretreated cells to A23187 (250 nM; 24 h) increased apoptosis by approximately 100%. When ara-C-pretreated cells were incubated with A23187 and bryostatin 1, no further potentiation of cell death (compared to cells exposed to A23187 alone) was observed. Nevertheless, the combination of bryostatin 1 and A23187 substantially increased inhibition of clonogenicity in cells preincubated with ara-C (e.g., by > or = 2 logs). This effect was associated with morphological and functional evidence (i.e., plastic adherence) of enhanced leukemic cell maturation. The differentiating capacity of the combination of bryostatin 1 and A23187 was significantly weaker than that of the phorbol diester, PMA (10 nM), and unaccompanied (at 24 h) by induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1. However, the extent of apoptosis was comparable in cells exposed to ara-C followed by PMA or bryostatin 1 + A23187, suggesting that differentiation per se is not solely responsible for enhancement of cell death in ara-C-pretreated cells. Coadministration of bryostatin 1 and the organotellurium compound AS101, which mimics the actions of A23187 in some systems, after ara-C also led to enhanced antiproliferative effects which were unaccompanied by an increase in apoptosis. Finally, exposure of cells to ara-C followed by other differentiation-inducing agents, including dimethylsulfoxide and sodium butyrate also resulted in increases in cell death in this cell line. These findings indicate that the inability of bryostatin 1 to potentiate apoptosis in ara-C-pretreated HL-60 cells may involve factors other than an inadequate differentiation stimulus. They also suggest that loss of leukemic self-renewal capacity following exposure to cytotoxic and differentiation-inducing agents may involve mechanisms other than, or in addition to, potentiation of apoptosis, particularly cellular maturation.","['Vrana, J A', 'Rao, A S', 'Wang, Z', 'Jarvis, W D', 'Grant, S']","['Vrana JA', 'Rao AS', 'Wang Z', 'Jarvis WD', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond VA, 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1998/04/29 00:00,1998/04/29 00:01,['1998/04/29 00:00'],"['1998/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.12.4.927 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1998 Apr;12(4):927-34. doi: 10.3892/ijo.12.4.927.,"['CA09564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The proliferation of normal cells such as bone marrow or fibroblasts was not inhibited but slightly stimulated following incubation with the LMF. Biochemical purification of this factor by several HPLC steps revealed that the inhibitory activity against tumor cells was concentrated within two definitive peaks. The LMF affects tumor cell growth by arresting them in the G0/G1 of the cell cycle and its activity is species and tumor non-specific. In vivo studies in melanoma- bearing mice revealed that the LMF inhibited melanoma growth when given either intraperitoneally or orally. Mononuclear cells from cancer patients with different malignancies (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, malignant melanoma, colon carcinoma and carcinoma of the rectum) secreted lower level of LMF in comparison to healthy subjects.

We also provide the first report of a novel, putative metal-binding motif, present as five tandem repeats in both RAMP and DXS6673E. RT-PCR detected only one of the two possible fusion transcripts, encoding a product in which the N-terminal 641 amino acids of RAMP become joined to the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1. Receptor tyrosine kinases are not commonly involved in the formation of tumour-specific fusion proteins.

Among them, the tax and rex genes, respectively, are involved in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of viral transcription. Two other genes, R3 and G4, were identified after cloning of the corresponding mRNAs from BLV-infected lymphocytes. Although the function of the two latter genes is still unknown, they appear to have important roles, since deletion of them restricts viral propagation in vivo. In order to assess the oncogenic potential of the R3 and G4 proteins, we first analyzed their ability to immortalize and/or transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts (Refs). In this assay, the G4 but not the R3 protein cooperated with the Ha-ras oncogene to induce tumors in nude mice. It thus appears that G4 exhibited oncogenic potential in vitro. To extend these observations in vivo, the pathology induced by recombinant viruses with mutations in G4 and in R3 and G4 was next evaluated with the sheep animal model. Viral propagation, as measured by semiquantitative PCR, appeared to be reduced when the R3 and G4 genes were deleted. These observations confirm and extend our previous data underlining the biological function of these genes. In addition, we present the results of a clinical survey that involves 39 sheep infected with six different BLV recombinants. Over a period of 40 months, 83% of the sheep infected with a wild-type virus developed leukemias and/or lymphosarcomas. In contrast, none out of 13 sheep infected with viruses with mutations in G4 or in R3 and G4 developed disease. We conclude that in addition to its oncogenic potential in vitro, G4 is required for pathogenesis in vivo. These observations should help us gain insight into the process of leukemogenesis induced by the related human T-cell leukemia virus type 1.","['Kerkhofs, P', 'Heremans, H', 'Burny, A', 'Kettmann, R', 'Willems, L']","['Kerkhofs P', 'Heremans H', 'Burny A', 'Kettmann R', 'Willems L']","['Department of Bovine Virology, Institut National de Recherches Veterinaires, Uccle, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*physiology']",1998/03/14 00:00,1998/03/14 00:01,['1998/03/14 00:00'],"['1998/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.3.2554-2559.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Mar;72(3):2554-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.3.2554-2559.1998.,,,,,,,PMC109563,,,

Watanabe, M. Nishi, Y. Ikawa, and H. Amanuma, J. Virol. 65:132-137, 1991) that the mutant Friend spleen focus-forming virus (F-SFFV(MS)), which encodes a mutant gp55 membrane glycoprotein with an ecotropic env gp70 sequence, was nonpathogenic. Here we injected the F-SFFV(MS)-Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) clone 57 complex into newborn DBA/2 mice. We obtained four groups of pathogenic variant F-SFFV complexes, each showing a different degree of pathogenicity in adult mice and a different gp55 profile. Of these, group 1 variant F-SFFV was particularly interesting, because it was the most frequently obtained and because it produced doublet bands of gp55 (59 and 57 kDa), neither of which reacted with the nonecotropic gp70-specific monoclonal antibody, and because its DNA intermediate did not hybridize with the nonecotropic env-specific probe. Cloning and DNA sequence analysis of the env region of one isolate of the group 1 variant F-SFFV revealed that this virus consisted of two distinct F-SFFV genomes; one (clone 117) differed from the other (clone 118) due to the presence of a 39-bp in-frame deletion. Reconstitution to full-length F-SFFV genomes and a pathogenicity assay showed that each reconstituted F-SFFV was pathogenic, with clone 117 showing a higher degree of pathogenicity than clone 118. Both reconstituted F-SFFVs caused activation of the mouse erythropoietin receptor in the factor-independent cell proliferation assay, although much less efficiently than the wild-type polycythemia-inducing isolate F-SFFVp. Clone 118 produced a gp55 of 59 kDa, while clone 117 produced one of 57 kDa. Clone 118 had a substitution by the F-MuLV clone 57 gp70 sequence, indicating that it was derived from the F-SFFV(MS) env gene by a homologous recombination with the F-MuLV clone 57 env gene. The site of the 39-bp deletion in clone 117 corresponded to the portion of the clone 118 sequence which was unique to the ecotropic env genes. These results indicated the importance for the biological activity of gp55 of the sequences in the gp70 differential region, which are contained in both polytropic and ecotropic env genes.","['Yugawa, T', 'Amanuma, H']","['Yugawa T', 'Amanuma H']","['Laboratory of Gene Technology and Safety, Tsukuba Life Science Center, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",1998/03/14 00:00,1998/03/14 00:01,['1998/03/14 00:00'],"['1998/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.3.2272-2279.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Mar;72(3):2272-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.3.2272-2279.1998.,,,,,,,PMC109525,,,

Following infection, it is possible to lyse cells and obtain preintegration complexes (PICs) capable of integrating the MoMuLV cDNA into an added target DNA in vitro (intermolecular integration). PICs can be stripped of required proteins by gel filtration in high-salt buffers (600 mM KCI), allowing the nature of the removed factors to be investigated by in vitro reconstitution. In a previous study of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) PICs, the host protein HMG I(Y) was found to be able to restore activity to salt-stripped PICs. In contrast, salt stripping and reconstitution of MoMuLV PICs led to the proposal that a host factor is important for a different activity, blocking integration into the cDNA itself (autointegration). In this report, we investigated reconstitution of salt-stripped MoMuLV PICs and found that addition of cellular extract from uninfected NIH 3T3 cells could block autointegration and also restore intermolecular integration. Isolation of the intermolecular integration-complementing activity yielded HMG I(Y), as in the HIV-1 case. However, HMG I(Y) could not block autointegration, implicating a different host factor in this process.

We have identified a fusion domain composed of the first 64 amino acids at the amino terminus of the HTLV-2 transmembrane protein, p21, the retention of which was required for syncytium induction. Construction of replication-competent HTLV genomic clones allowed us to correlate the ability of HTLV-2 to induce syncytia with the ability to replicate in BJAB cells. Differences in the ability to induce syncytia were not due to differences in the levels of total or cell membrane-associated envelope or in the formation of multimers.

Retroviral vectors expressing the antisense RNAs as part of the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR promoter-directed retroviral transcript were constructed. The CD4+ T-cell line CEM-SS was transduced with retroviral constructs, and Northern blot analyses showed high steady-state antisense RNA expression levels. The most efficient inhibition of HIV-1 replication was observed with the env antisense RNA, followed by the pol complementary sequence, leading to 2- to 3-log10 reductions in p24 antigen production even at high inoculation doses (4 x 10(4) 50% tissue culture infective doses) of the HIV-1 strain HXB3. The strong antiviral effect correlated with a reduction of HIV-1 steady-state RNA levels, and with intracellular Tat protein production, suggesting that antisense transcripts act at an early step of HIV-1 replication. A lower steady-state antisense RNA level was detected in transduced primary CD4+ lymphocytes than in CEM-SS cells. Nevertheless, replication of the HIV-1 JR-CSF isolate was reduced with both the pol and env antisense RNA.

These highly reactive chemicals (acrylonitrile; bis[chloromethyl]ether and chloromethyl methyl ether; 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide; formaldehyde; mustard gas; sulfuric acid; and vinyl chloride) vary in use and exposure. All are animal carcinogens that also have received considerable epidemiologic attention. Acrylonitrile is a chemical of current economic importance. The epidemiologic evidence is quite weak, but the available studies were very small. Epidemiologic studies clearly demonstrate that bis (chloromethyl) ether and chloromethyl methyl ether cause lung cancer. Continued follow-up of exposed workers is encouraged to provide information on risks for other cancers. Results from epidemiologic studies of butadiene-exposed workers are somewhat inconsistent, but the largest study with the best exposure assessment found the largest relative risk for leukemia. The failure of several larger studies to replicate the early Swedish findings of a very strong association between leukemia and ethylene oxide has not been adequately explained. Epidemiologic studies of formaldehyde provide limited evidence for an association with cancer of the nasopharynx and possibly with nasal cancer. These very rare tumors, however, are difficult to study epidemiologically. Mustard gas is a well-established lung carcinogen, but a recent follow-up of the English cohort suggests that other sites also may be affected. Sulfuric acid appears to cause laryngeal cancer. A suggested relationship with lung cancer in a few studies is of concern because of the widespread opportunity for exposure from ambient air pollution. Vinyl chloride causes angiosarcoma of the liver, but a large, multi-country study provided no clear evidence that other sites are affected.","['Blair, A', 'Kazerouni, N']","['Blair A', 'Kazerouni N']","['Occupational Studies Section at the National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD 20892-7364, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Methyl Ethers)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Sulfuric Acids)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', '334G5B96VG (chloromethyl methyl ether)', '77382IHE37 (Bis(Chloromethyl) Ether)', 'JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)', 'MP1U0D42PE (Acrylonitrile)', 'O40UQP6WCF (sulfuric acid)', 'T8KEC9FH9P (Mustard Gas)', 'WD06X94M2D (Vinyl Chloride)']",IM,"['Acrylonitrile/adverse effects', 'Air Pollutants/adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Bis(Chloromethyl) Ether/adverse effects', 'Butadienes/adverse effects', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'England/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Ethylene Oxide/adverse effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Formaldehyde/adverse effects', 'Hemangiosarcoma/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Liver Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Methyl Ethers/adverse effects', 'Mustard Gas/adverse effects', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Nose Neoplasms/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Organic Chemicals/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Sulfuric Acids/adverse effects', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Vinyl Chloride/adverse effects']",1997/05/01 00:00,1998/03/14 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1018417623867 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1997 May;8(3):473-90. doi: 10.1023/a:1018417623867.,,,129,,,,,,,

In animal studies, many pesticides are carcinogenic, (e.g., organochlorines, creosote, and sulfallate) while others (notably, the organochlorines DDT, chlordane, and lindane) are tumor promoters. Some contaminants in commercial pesticide formulations also may pose a carcinogenic risk. In humans, arsenic compounds and insecticides used occupationally have been classified as carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Human data, however, are limited by the small number of studies that evaluate individual pesticides. Epidemiologic studies, although sometimes contradictory, have linked phenoxy acid herbicides or contaminants in them with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and malignant lymphoma; organochlorine insecticides are linked with STS, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), leukemia, and, less consistently, with cancers of the lung and breast; organophosphorous compounds are linked with NHL and leukemia; and triazine herbicides with ovarian cancer. Few, if any, of these associations can be considered established and causal.

In the 1980s, more than a million persons were potentially exposed to some specific solvents in the United States; in Canada, 40 percent of male cancer patients in Montreal had experienced exposure to solvents; in the Finnish population, one percent was regularly exposed. There is evidence for increased risks of cancer following exposure to: trichloroethylene (for the liver and biliary tract and for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas); tetrachloroethylene (for the esophagus and cervix--although confounding by smoking, alcohol, and sexual habits cannot be excluded--and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma); and carbon tetrachloride (lymphohematopoietic malignancies). An excess risk of liver and biliary tract cancers was suggested in the cohort with the high exposure to methylene chloride, but not found in the other cohorts where an excess risk of pancreatic cancer was suggested. 1,1,1-trichloroethane has been used widely, but only a few studies have been done suggesting a risk of multiple myeloma. A causal association between exposure to benzene and an increased risk of leukemia is well-established, as well as a suggested risk of lung and nasopharynx cancer in a Chinese cohort. Increased risks of various gastrointestinal cancers have been suggested following exposure to toluene. Two informative studies indicated an increased risk of lung cancer, not supported by other studies. Increased risks of lymphohematopoietic malignancies have been reported in some studies of persons exposed to toluene or xylene, but not in the two most informative studies on toluene. Occupation as a painter has consistently been associated with a 40 percent increased risk of lung cancer. (With the mixed exposures, however, it is not possible to identify the specific causative agent[s].)

We have ectopically expressed each C/EBP protein in P388 lymphoblasts. The expression of any of these transcription factors is sufficient to confer the LPS-inducible expression of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 to lymphoblasts, which normally lack C/EBP factors and do not display LPS induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, the activities of C/EBP alpha, -beta, and -delta are redundant in regard to the expression of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Since C/EBP beta-deficient mice have been reported to be largely normal in their expression of proinflammatory cytokines, it is likely that the lack of C/EBP beta is compensated for by the induction of C/EBP delta upon LPS treatment.","['Hu, H M', 'Baer, M', 'Williams, S C', 'Johnson, P F', 'Schwartz, R C']","['Hu HM', 'Baer M', 'Williams SC', 'Johnson PF', 'Schwartz RC']","['Department of Microbiology, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/physiology', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia P388/immunology/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1998/03/14 00:00,1998/03/14 00:01,['1998/03/14 00:00'],"['1998/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Mar 1;160(5):2334-42.,,,,,,,,,,

CD38 internalization was followed using radioiodinated Abs in an acidic elution endocytosis assay to monitor the effects of cross-linking on internalization processes and to quantify the ratio of the internalized molecule. Second, conventional, confocal, and electron microscopies were used to evaluate the morphologic effects induced by ligation of the molecule with Abs mimicking the natural ligand(s). The results demonstrated that internalization is a reproducible phenomenon following CD38 ligation with both agonistic and nonagonistic specific Abs and involving only a fraction of the entire amount of the surface molecule. It is independent from signal transduction as can be inferred by the observation that 1) both agonistic and non agonistic Abs are effective and 2) the dynamic of internalization is much slower than that of cellular signaling. Morphologic studies demonstrated that endocytosis induced as a result of CD38 ligation presents a very specific pathway consisting of subcellular organelles fundamental to the processing of the complex. Our data indicate that down-regulation by endocytosis may be, in parallel with shedding, a regulatory element in activation and adhesion processes mediated by CD38. However, internalization seems not to be a key step in triggering intracellular signaling; more likely, it is a negative feedback control mechanism which interrupts signal transduction or cell-cell cross-talks mediated by membrane CD38.","['Funaro, A', 'Reinis, M', 'Trubiani, O', 'Santi, S', 'Di Primio, R', 'Malavasi, F']","['Funaro A', 'Reinis M', 'Trubiani O', 'Santi S', 'Di Primio R', 'Malavasi F']","['Department of Genetics, Biology and Biochemistry, University of Torino, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (Cd38 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology/*metabolism/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Endocytosis/*immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/immunology/*metabolism/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/14 00:00,1998/03/14 00:01,['1998/03/14 00:00'],"['1998/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Mar 1;160(5):2238-47.,['E.0662/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,,,,

However, the role of additional molecules in Fas signaling and FLICE activation is not clear. A chimeric Fas/FLICE (F/F) receptor, containing the extracellular/transmembrane portion of Fas and the caspase region of FLICE, mediated anti-Fas apoptosis. FLICE protease subunits were generated from the F/F precursor. Killing induced by Fas, but not F/F, was blocked by a dominant negative FADD. Apoptosis triggered through Fas and F/F was inhibited by coexpression of CrmA and p35, but not Bcl-xL. F/F bypassed Fas resistance in COS-7 cells and blocking by the death effector domain (DED)-containing viral protein MC159. These results show that: 1) F/F induces cell death, indicating that FLICE activation is sufficient for apoptosis and does not require additional Fas- or FADD-binding proteins; and 2) F/F bypasses proximal defects in Fas signaling that prevent FLICE recruitment or activation.","['Memon, S A', 'Hou, J', 'Moreno, M B', 'Zacharchuk, C M']","['Memon SA', 'Hou J', 'Moreno MB', 'Zacharchuk CM']","['Laboratory of Immune Cell Biology, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fadd protein, mouse)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (inhibitor of apoptosis, Nucleopolyhedrovirus)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*immunology', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', '*Caspases', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*genetics/physiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Genes, Dominant/immunology', 'Hybridomas', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemical synthesis/*immunology/physiology', 'Serpins/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Viral Proteins/physiology', 'bcl-X Protein', 'fas Receptor/*genetics/metabolism']",1998/03/14 00:00,1998/03/14 00:01,['1998/03/14 00:00'],"['1998/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Mar 1;160(5):2046-9.,,,,,,,,,,

The IL-2 independence of an HVS-transformed cell line correlated with constitutive activation of protein tyrosine kinases known to be induced following TCR engagement. Thus, in these cells we observed increased phosphotransferase activity of Lck as well as constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR-associated ZAP-70 kinase and expression of the related Syk protein tyrosine kinase. While Syk is generally not expressed in activated T cells, its introduction has been shown to enhance TCR responsiveness.

It is however not available to more than two-thirds of patients who lack a matched donor. Here, we review the outcome of 28 patients with high-risk ALL who were transplanted in France with alternative marrow sources such as HLA-phenoidentical unrelated volunteers and HLA-partially incompatible relatives. For these patients, we tested the possibility to prevent T-depleted marrow graft rejection by infusing in vivo two monoclonal antibodies directed against adhesion receptors i.e., LFA-1 and CD2. Two previous multicenter trials in children transplanted with partially incompatible bone marrow for inborn errors of metabolism showed their efficacy in this setting. Twenty eight patients were enrolled in this study and followed for a median of 4.4 years. Bone marrow engraftment occurred in 81% of the evaluable patients. Post-transplantation leukaemic relapse was the most frequent cause of death in this group of patients, and occurred in 39% of patients. The second most frequent complication was infectious disease, while an EBV-induced B-lymphocyte proliferative disorder occurred in four patients. In conclusion, T-cell-depletion combined with infusion of anti-LFA-1 and anti-CD2 antibodies is efficient in preventing graft failure and GVHD in this group of children with high-risk leukaemia undergoing partially incompatible BMT. The overall DFS is not improved in contrast to what has been previously observed in patients with immunodeficiencies transplanted with a similar rejection prophylaxis. Other approaches are therefore needed aiming either at preserving donor T-cell mediated immunity or accelerating immune reconstitution.","['Cavazzana-Calvo, M', 'Jabado, N', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Michel, G', 'Haddad, E', 'Mechinaud, F', 'Landman-Parker, J', 'Leblanc, T', 'Plouvier, E', 'Baruchel, A', 'Stephan, J L', 'Souillet, G', 'Vilmer, E', 'Wijdenes, J', 'Le Deist, F', 'Fischer, A']","['Cavazzana-Calvo M', 'Jabado N', 'Bordigoni P', 'Michel G', 'Haddad E', 'Mechinaud F', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Leblanc T', 'Plouvier E', 'Baruchel A', 'Stephan JL', 'Souillet G', 'Vilmer E', 'Wijdenes J', 'Le Deist F', 'Fischer A']","[""Etablissement de transfusion sanguine, Unite d'Immunologie et d'Hematologie and INSERM U429, Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, PARIS, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD2 Antigens/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/immunology/*prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/03/14 00:00,1998/03/14 00:01,['1998/03/14 00:00'],"['1998/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709058336 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Dec;28(1-2):103-12. doi: 10.3109/10428199709058336.,,,,,,,,,,

The t(12;21) is associated with a distinct subgroup of patients characterized by an age between 1 and 10 years, an early B immunophenotype, and a good prognosis. A high incidence of the deletion of non-translocated TEL is another characteristic of leukemic cells with this translocation. TEL-AML1 hybrid protein thought to be critical in leukemogenesis possesses the HLH domain of TEL fused to almost the entire AML1 protein, although the detailed mechanisms of leukemogenesis remain obscure.

The technique may detect submicroscopical chromosomal deletions which are not visible in the leukaemic karyotype.

Genistein has been found to inhibit the growth of carcinogen-induced cancers in rats and human leukemia cells transplanted into mice. The induction of stress proteins (e.g., glucose-related proteins and heat shock proteins) in tumor cells has been shown to protect them against programmed cell death; this stress response is inhibited by genistein. The mechanism(s) by which genistein affects certain stress response genes was explored in this study. METHODS: Mammalian cell cultures were treated with azetidine, a proline analog, which elicits a stress response that includes the induction of the expression of glucose-regulated protein GRP78 and heat shock protein HSP70. The effects of azetidine and/or genistein treatment on cellular levels of grp78 and hsp70 messenger RNAs and proteins were measured by northern blot hybridization and western blot analyses, respectively, and the binding of nuclear factors to sequence motifs in the upstream (promoter) regions of these two genes were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. RESULTS: Genistein antagonized the binding of a specific transcription factor, nuclear factor-Y/CCAAT binding factor (NF-Y/CBF), to the CCAAT sequence element most proximal to the transcription start sites in the hsp70 and grp78 promoters; this CCAAT element was previously shown to be necessary for full-stress inducibility of both genes. Treatment of cells with genistein converted NF-Y/CBF into a nonbinding, transcriptionally inactive form. IMPLICATION: The anticancer effects of genistein may be related to its ability to reduce the expression of stress response-related genes.","['Zhou, Y', 'Lee, A S']","['Zhou Y', 'Lee AS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Azetidines)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '37S883XDWR (azetidine)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azetidines/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*analysis/genetics', '*Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Lung/cytology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones/*analysis/genetics', 'Mutation']",1998/03/14 00:00,1998/03/14 00:01,['1998/03/14 00:00'],"['1998/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/90.5.381 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998 Mar 4;90(5):381-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/90.5.381.,['CA27607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

This should allow studies on clonality, loss of heterozygosity, mutation, or amplification of multiple loci from one single cell in haematological smears and possibly other clinical cytology specimens.","['Beltinger, C P', 'Klimek, F', 'Debatin, K M']","['Beltinger CP', 'Klimek F', 'Debatin KM']","['Universitats-Kinderklinik, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (German Cancer Research Center), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Pathol,Molecular pathology : MP,9706282,,IM,"['Blood Specimen Collection/methods', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Lasers', 'Lymphocytes', 'Needles', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics']",1998/03/14 00:00,1998/03/14 00:01,['1998/03/14 00:00'],"['1998/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/mp.50.5.272 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pathol. 1997 Oct;50(5):272-5. doi: 10.1136/mp.50.5.272.,,,,,,,PMC379646,,,

Second, amplification of the target (BCR-ABL chimaera) and control gene (ABL) is performed simultaneously in the same tube. RESULTS: On testing 40 chronic myelogenous leukaemia patients and 10 healthy donors there was a specificity for the newly developed technique.

Report of two cases.,327-30,"We report on two cases of central nervous system (CNS) relapse after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. A 55-year-old man received two courses of vincristin, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (VAD) as an induction treatment for stage IIIB IgG kappa multiple myeloma. Bone marrow stem cell collection was performed after a high-dose melphalan (HDM) course (140 mg/m2). Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) was performed with this cryo-preserved unpurged bone marrow sample after a second HDM course. Three months after ABMT, the patient presented with signs of central nervous involvement with plasma cells and monoclonal IgG kappa in the cerebral fluid. The patient died despite systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy. A 50-year-old man was initially treated with 3 courses of VAD for a stage IIIA IgD lambda multiple myeloma. Blood stem cell were collected after a course of high-dose etoposide and cyclophosphamide. ABMT was performed after total body irradiation (TBI) and HDM. Three months later, he presented with right leg palsy and a lumbar puncture showed numerous plasma cells and the presence of the IgG lambda. The patient died of neurological complications three months later. Extramedullary occurred prior to medullary relapse in the two cases, suggesting the presence of an extramedullary clone of plasma cells with a high degree of chemo-resistance. Although high-dose chemotherapy appears promising, this therapeutic approach could allow the occurrence of presently unobserved complications. Wether CNS prophylaxis is indicated in this context, as recommended in leukemia, remains an open question.","['Veinstein, A', 'Brizard, A', 'Randriamalala, E', 'Babin, P', ""Preud'homme, J L"", 'Guilhot, F']","['Veinstein A', 'Brizard A', 'Randriamalala E', 'Babin P', ""Preud'homme JL"", 'Guilhot F']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, CHU Jean BERNARD, Poitiers, France.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Diseases/*etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*surgery']",1998/03/14 00:00,1998/03/14 00:01,['1998/03/14 00:00'],"['1998/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-997-0327-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1997 Dec;39(6):327-30. doi: 10.1007/s00282-997-0327-6.,,,,,,,,,,

MDS provide a clinical model for studying the emergency and progression of malignancy. The initiating events leading to MDS remain almost unknown. Imbalance of proliferative and differentiating capabilities of progenitor hematopoietic cells along with abnormalities in the normal process of apoptosis are involved in both the pathogenesis of MDS and transformation into AML. Multiple genomic lesions, comprising oncogene activation and tumor-suppressor gene inactivation, are probably required. Alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs targeting topoisomerase II and benzene are the only clear etiological factors identified. Advanced age and great prognostic variability, not explained by the FAB subtype, complicates the design and analysis of clinical trials and therapy-planning. The use of recently developed prognostic scores for selecting the best treatment according to the expected risk is encouraged. In most patients therapy is unsatisfactory.

Histological diagnosis can be difficult in patients with poorly differentiated orbital tumours and no evidence of systemic leukaemia. The naphthol AS-D chloracetate esterase (Leder stain) and immunohistochemical stains for lysozyme and MAC387 were used to determine the staining characteristics of these tumours. A case series of seven patients with orbital granulocytic sarcoma is presented. METHODS: Seven patients with orbital granulocytic sarcoma were studied. Haematoxylin and eosin, Leder, and lysozyme stained sections were available in seven cases. Unstained formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections of seven cases were available for immunohistochemical evaluation using the avidin-biotin-complex technique for MAC387. RESULTS: The mean age of presentation of the orbital tumour was 8.8 years. Four patients presented with an orbital tumour before any systemic manifestations of leukaemia. In two cases the diagnosis of the orbital tumour and systemic leukaemia was made simultaneously. There was one case of established systemic myeloid leukaemia in remission with the subsequent development of orbital granulocytic sarcoma. Six of seven cases (86%) were positive for the Leder stain. Five of seven cases (71%) showed positive immunoreactivity with lysozyme. The immunohistochemical stain for MAC387 was positive in all seven cases (100%) including one case that was negative for both lysozyme and Leder stains. CONCLUSIONS: Orbital granulocytic sarcoma is a tumour that affects children and can present with rapidly progressive proptosis. This tumour may develop before, during, or after the occurrence of systemic leukaemia. The combination of Leder and lysozyme stains is useful in the diagnosis of orbital granulocytic sarcoma. MAC387 may be a more reliable marker for orbital granulocytic sarcoma.","['Stockl, F A', 'Dolmetsch, A M', 'Saornil, M A', 'Font, R L', 'Burnier, M N Jr']","['Stockl FA', 'Dolmetsch AM', 'Saornil MA', 'Font RL', 'Burnier MN Jr']","['Department of Ophthalmology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Ophthalmol,The British journal of ophthalmology,0421041,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Exophthalmos/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Orbital Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/pathology']",1998/03/14 03:16,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/03/14 03:16'],"['1998/03/14 03:16 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/03/14 03:16 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bjo.81.12.1084 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Ophthalmol. 1997 Dec;81(12):1084-8. doi: 10.1136/bjo.81.12.1084.,,,,,,,PMC1722070,,,

This region encompasses 559RGVHFIF565, implicated as a contact point for the cytosolic oxidase subunit p47phox during oxidase activation, and a carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine (Phe570), which corresponds in position to a highly conserved aromatic residue that interacts with the flavin group in the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase flavoenzyme family, of which gp91phox is a member. Mutant proteins were expressed in human myeloid leukemia cells which lack expression of endogenous gp91phox due to targeted disruption of the X-linked gp91phox gene. Although specific residues within 559RGVHFIF565 had previously been identified by alanine scanning as essential for peptide inhibition of oxidase activity in a cell-free assay, comparable substitutions in the gp91phox polypeptide had either no or only a modest effect on oxidase activity in whole cells. Replacement of nonpolar with polar or charged residues had greater effects on oxidase activity, but were also associated with decreased gp91phox expression, suggesting that overall protein structure was perturbed. No stable gp91phox protein was detected upon deletion of the terminal 11 amino acids. Alanine substitution or deletion of the carboxyl-terminal Phe570 in gp91phox resulted in a 2-fold reduction in superoxide production. This contrasts with a approximately 300-800-fold reduction reported for comparable mutations in pea ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, which suggests that structural or functional differences exist between the carboxyl terminus of gp91phox and other ferredoxin-NADP+ reductases.","['Zhen, L', 'Yu, L', 'Dinauer, M C']","['Zhen L', 'Yu L', 'Dinauer MC']","['Herman B.

A potential role for LIF in the pathogenesis of human breast cancer was recently indicated by the finding that LIF is produced by MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells and that it stimulates proliferation of the T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Despite its role as a possible therapeutic target in breast cancer, the transcriptional regulation of the LIF gene in breast cancer cells has not been investigated so far. In this context, we investigated the regulation of the human LIF promoter (human LIF666-luciferase) by ovarian steroids in transient transfection assays in MDA-MB 231 and T47D cells. Since the MDA-MB 231 cells are devoid of both estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors, these cells were co-transfected with the respective receptor expression vector. Estradiol induced no stimulation in either T47D or ER-transfected MDA-MB 231 cells. Treatment with the progesterone agonist MPA (medroxy-progesterone acetate) resulted in induction of LIF transcription in PR-transfectant MDA-MB 231 cells, while it had no effect in T47D cells. Both PR isoforms (PR-B and PR-A) were effective in inducing the LIF promoter in MDA-MB 231 cells, and this effect was inhibited by the progestin antagonist RU 486. The stimulatory effect of MPA was maintained on deletion constructs (h274LIF-Luc, h148LIF-Luc and h82LIF-Luc), indicating that 82 bp are sufficient to mediate this effect. Our results indicate that the LIF promoter is transcriptionally active in human breast cancer cells and its activity can be modulated by progestins and anti-progestins in cells expressing the LIF protein, which might have therapeutic implications.","['Bamberger, A M', 'Thuneke, I', 'Schulte, H M']","['Bamberger AM', 'Thuneke I', 'Schulte HM']","['IHF, Institute for Hormone and Fertility Research, University of Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Pregnadienes)', '0 (Progesterone Congeners)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '72648-88-5 (cymegesolate)', 'TJ2M0FR8ES (Megestrol Acetate)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Megestrol Acetate', 'Pregnadienes/*pharmacology', 'Progesterone Congeners/*pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/13 00:00,1998/03/13 00:01,['1998/03/13 00:00'],"['1998/03/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1005961403898 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 1998 Jan;47(2):153-61. doi: 10.1023/a:1005961403898.,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine if the natural history of Crohn's disease was altered by hematopoietic cell transplants from healthy allogeneic donors. METHODS: Between 1982 and 1992, 6 patients with Crohn's disease and leukemia underwent allogeneic marrow transplantation and were followed up clinically. RESULTS: Five patients had active Crohn's disease before transplantation, and 3 had clinical evidence of sclerosing cholangitis. Four marrow donors were HLA-identical siblings, 1 related donor was mismatched at the DR locus, and 1 unrelated donor was HLA-matched. One patient died of septicemia 97 days after transplantation; 5 patients were observed for 4.5, 5.8, 8.4, 9.9, and 15.3 years after transplantation. Four of 5 patients evaluated had no signs or symptoms of Crohn's disease after transplantation. One patient with mixed donor-host hematopoietic chimerism had a relapse of Crohn's disease 1.5 years after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Four of 5 patients followed up for 4.5 to 15.3 years after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation remained free of Crohn's disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Their median age was 65.5 yrs (range 60-81 years), the male/female ratio was 7:9, and molecular biology analysis showed a PML/RARa rearrangement in all patients. Seven patients had a concomitant cardiovascular disease. ATRA 45 mg/sqm/day was given to all patients, and in 11 was associated with idarubicin (AIDA protocol); in two patients ATRA was associated with mitoxantrone + ara-C, while the remaining three patients received ATRA alone. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (87.5%) achieved CR, and two patients (12.5%) died during induction. Despite the high CR rate, eight episodes of severe cardiovascular complication were observed in seven patients, three of whom had previously had cardiovascular disease; in addition, three patients had sepsis (two bacterial and one fungal). As of 31 March 1997, 9 of 14 patients were still in first CR after a 19-month (range 7-64 months) median follow-up since attainment of the CR. One patient died in CR of a fungal complication and four patients relapsed after 8, 9, 23 and 35 months following CR: two of them achieved a second CR lasting seven and +15 months with ATRA alone. Of the nine patients still in first CR, only three have received the planned consolidation therapy and five have been in CR for more than 24 months (+25, +33, +34, +38, +63). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that most of these patients received shorter consolidation treatments than do younger patients, the good results achieved in them might be considered an indication for modifying treatment schedules in order to reduce severe toxicity and improve protocol compliance.","['Latagliata, R', 'Avvisati, G', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Petti, M C', 'Diverio, D', 'Spadea, A', 'Fazi, P', 'Torromeo, C', 'Breccia, M', 'Malagnino, F', 'Mandelli, F']","['Latagliata R', 'Avvisati G', 'Lo Coco F', 'Petti MC', 'Diverio D', 'Spadea A', 'Fazi P', 'Torromeo C', 'Breccia M', 'Malagnino F', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1998/03/13 00:00,1998/03/13 00:01,['1998/03/13 00:00'],"['1998/03/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008272817839 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)64072-X [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1997 Dec;8(12):1273-5. doi: 10.1023/a:1008272817839.,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Nine patients with prostate cancer diagnosed by transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies were found to have hematolymphoid malignancies involving the prostate at the time of subsequent radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. The ultrasound images and prostate needle biopsy results are presented. RESULTS: Prospective analysis of transrectal ultrasound images revealed no abnormality other than hypoechogenicity typical of prostate cancer in 7 of the 9 patients (77.8%). In 2 patients, the ultrasound images were free of any abnormalities. In 2 of the 9 patients (22.2%), the prostate needle biopsies demonstrated suspicious lymphocytic infiltrate in addition to prostate cancer.

Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) have been studied extensively in this regard. That these proteins are important is no longer in doubt following the demonstration that the IL-1 receptor antagonist and neutralising antibodies directed against TNF alpha are clinically effective. Recent studies suggest that interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other members of the IL-6 cytokine subfamily are also potentially important cytokines in the pathogenesis of RA. The recognition of shared molecular subunits in the receptors for these cytokines raises the possibility that components of these receptors or their derivatives, either alone or in combination, may be useful for antagonising members of the IL-6 cytokine subfamily. Effective antagonism could be therapeutically beneficial in respect to attenuating inflammation and protecting critically important chondral and skeletal tissue. In this review the rationale and possible strategies for such antagonism are discussed.","['Carroll, G', 'Bell, M', 'Wang, H', 'Chapman, H', 'Mills, J']","['Carroll G', 'Bell M', 'Wang H', 'Chapman H', 'Mills J']","['Department of Rheumatology, Royal Perth Hospital, Shenton Park, WA, Australia. graeme.carroll@rph.health.wa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

The enzyme is also active towards the substrates MU-di-N-acetyl-beta-D-chitobioside (MU-DACB) and MU-N-acetyl-chitotrioside (MU-TRACT). MU-TACT hydrolase in plasma is very stable. It is inhibited by the substrate and the product of the reaction and by allosamidin and ethyleneglycolchitin. When the activity of plasma MU-TACT hydrolase was compared to Remazol Brilliant Violet carboxymethyl (RBV) chitin hydrolase (RBV chitinase), it appeared that another enzyme--lysozyme--is also active on RBV chitin and this enzyme represents about 50-60% of the total RBV chitinase activity. Highly increased activity of plasma MU-TACT hydrolase in plasma of Gaucher patients was reflected in a similar increase of RBV chitin hydrolase. In these patients, both MU-TACT hydrolase and RBV chitinase are totally inhibited by allosamidin indicating that specific chitinase is the increased enzyme. With the MU-TACT substrate, specific chitinase is measured and with RBV chitin as substrate the measured activity is a combination of specific chitinase (activity inhibited by allosamidin) as well as lysozyme (residual activity after allosamidin inhibition). For measurement of specific chitinase in human plasma and clinical applications, the di-, tri- or tetra-N-acetylglucosamine derivatives of MU are recommended.

We have previously shown that exogenous (added to the culture medium) leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) inhibits bone nodule formation and expression of osteoblast-associated genes in fetal rat calvaria (RC) cell cultures and that dexamethasone (Dex) increases the ID50 of LIF. To investigate the respective roles of IL-6-related cytokines and receptors in osteprogenitor differentiation, and their regulatory interplay with Dex, we used reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction, bioassay, and blocking antibody techniques to assess the time courses of LIF, IL-6, LIF transmembrane receptor, IL-6 receptor, and gp130 expression in RC cell cultures grown with and without Dex. The levels of the mRNAs for IL-6, LIF, and gp130 decreased concomitantly with the formation of bone nodules. Dex treatment, which stimulates bone nodule formation, reduced the expression of LIF and IL-6 mRNAs and IL-6 bioactivity in the culture medium. LIF treatment strongly stimulated the expression of IL-6. Incubation with anti-LIF antibodies increased the number of nodules, while an antibody blocking IL-6 activity had little or no effect on nodule numbers and did not antagonize the action of exogenous LIF, indicating that IL-6 does not mediate the action of LIF in this system. Moreover, although exogenously added IL-6 was active in the cultures as noted by a reduction of nodule mineralization, it had no effect on nodule numbers, i.e., on osteoprogenitor differentiation, in the presence or absence of Dex. In conclusion, IL-6, LIF, and their receptors are expressed throughout the time-course of osteogenesis in RC cell cultures. However, only LIF, but not IL-6, appears to play a significant role in autocrine regulation of osteoblastic differentiation in this system. The antagonist action of Dex on the effects of exogenously added LIF, as well as the bone-promoting action of Dex in RC cell cultures, could be exerted partly through the down-regulation of the expression of endogenous LIF.","['Malaval, L', 'Gupta, A K', 'Liu, F', 'Delmas, P D', 'Aubin, J E']","['Malaval L', 'Gupta AK', 'Liu F', 'Delmas PD', 'Aubin JE']","['INSERM U403, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skull/drug effects/embryology', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism']",1998/03/12 00:00,1998/03/12 00:01,['1998/03/12 00:00'],"['1998/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.2.175 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1998 Feb;13(2):175-84. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.2.175.,,,,,,,,,,

We report one such case, which appeared normal by routine banding techniques. The BCR/ABL rearrangement was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting analysis, which suggested a b3-a2 splice junction. Dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with BCR and ABL DNA probes showed that the chimeric fusion gene was localized on chromosome 9q34, rather than at the typical location on chromosome 22q11. The BCR/ABL rearrangement was detected in 75% of the patient's bone-marrow population, whereas the remaining 25% of the cells appeared normal. The use of dual color FISH in the diagnosis of CML is extremely valuable not only in identifying cases of Ph-negative CML, but also in quantifying the proportion of transformed cell populations.

An allelic fusion event involving the topoisomerase II alpha and the retinoic acid receptor a genes has been identified in these cells that probably contributes to the decreased topoisomerase II activity in P388/ADR/7 cells. However, this allelic mutation may be a minor contributor or even incidental to the resistance phenotype, since these cells display other candidate mechanisms of resistance, including increased P-glycoprotein, increased glutathione-S-transferase activity and an increased onset of DNA repair. To establish a role for topoisomerase II alpha in mediating the Adriamycin resistance phenotype, complementation of the mutant allele was attempted by transfecting the murine P388/ADR/7 cells with a human topoisomerase II alpha expression construct under the control of the human metallothionein IIA promoter. The majority of transfected cell lines that were obtained by selection in hygromycin B contained copies of the integrated expression construct that were rearranged. Only two of thirty-two transfected cell lines were found to contain a single, unrearranged copy of the human topoisomerase II alpha cDNA. P388/ADR/7 cell lines carrying an integrated, intact human topoisomerase II alpha expression vector were more sensitive to Adriamycin, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, and etoposide, but not to actinomycin D and vincristine compared to control cells transfected with vector alone or cell lines with rearranged topoisomerase II alpha expression constructs. These findings suggest that topoisomerase II alpha is a selective and significant contributor to multifactorial resistance.","['McPherson, J P', 'Deffie, A M', 'Jones, N R', 'Brown, G A', 'Deuchars, K L', 'Goldenberg, G J']","['McPherson JP', 'Deffie AM', 'Jones NR', 'Brown GA', 'Deuchars KL', 'Goldenberg GJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/*toxicity', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', '*Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1998/03/12 00:00,1998/03/12 00:01,['1998/03/12 00:00'],"['1998/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1997 Nov-Dec;17(6D):4243-52.,,,,,,,,,,

Ineffective hematopoiesis leads to haematologic failure in these syndromes. The MDS are a rare event during pregnancy although the exact incidence is unknown it is likely to be less than that for leukaemia. CLINICAL REPORT: The case, a 29 year old woman, presented during 23rd week of her first, triplet, pregnancy with symptoms of anemia and thrombocytopenia is described. DISCUSSION: The pathogenetic aspect and diagnostic management is discussed, underlined especially under the point of view of the triplet pregnancy. It is suggested that the association of myelodysplastic syndromes during pregnancy is coincidental and that acute leukemia evolves in a majority of these cases. Furthermore, refractory macrocytic anemias in pregnancy need to be carefully evaluated for a primary myelodysplastic state.","['Cerenzia, G', 'Carillo, C', 'Serrao, L', 'Caruso, M T']","['Cerenzia G', 'Carillo C', 'Serrao L', 'Caruso MT']","['I Istituto di Clinica Ostetrica e Ginecologica, Universita degli Studi di Roma, La Sapienza.']",['ita'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Clin Ter,La Clinica terapeutica,0372604,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Fetal Death/etiology', 'Humans', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Complications/diagnosis', '*Pregnancy, Multiple', '*Triplets']",1998/03/12 00:00,1998/03/12 00:01,['1998/03/12 00:00'],"['1998/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Ter. 1997 Nov;148(11):567-70.,,,,Mielodisplasia in gravidanza trigemina.,,,,,,

The number of entries of each nucleotide- and base-pair substitution-specific mutation was divided by the total number of tumors analyzed. For each organ pair, the difference of the mutation-specific frequency differences was calculated. Resulting values could range from 0 (full concordance) to 2 (full discordance). Skin, lung, and urinary bladder showed highly independent mutation spectra (maximum discordance value = 1.48 for skin versus brain), in agreement with the presence of specific factors responsible for a large number of the respective tumors (UV light, smoking, aromatic amines). The three organs with the smallest sum of discordance values were mammary gland (breast), colon and esophagus. The minimum organ-to-organ discordance value was 0.95, for stomach versus colon. For these organs, common, possibly also endogenous, cancer risk factors could be postulated as contributing to the observed mutation spectrum. The remaining cancers (ovary, sarcoma, leukemia/lymphoma, brain, head and neck, and stomach, in order or increasing discordance) were of intermediate range and showed a mix of values. Reasons for close relationship to some of the other organs and marked differences to others are discussed. Exclusion of the ""hot-spot"" mutations did not markedly alter the observed relationships, indicating that a putative selective growth advantage does not cover up the etiological basis for the observed mutation spectrum. It is expected that much more insight into carcinogenesis and cancer could be gained by further exploratory analyses of mutation databases.","['Lutz, W K', 'Fekete, T', 'Vamvakas, S']","['Lutz WK', 'Fekete T', 'Vamvakas S']","['Department of Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['0 (DNA Adducts)'],IM,"['Base Composition/*genetics', 'DNA Adducts/analysis/drug effects', 'Databases, Factual', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity']",1998/03/12 00:00,1998/03/12 00:01,['1998/03/12 00:00'],"['1998/03/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.98106207 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1998 Apr;106(4):207-11. doi: 10.1289/ehp.98106207.,,,,,,,PMC1532972,,,

Indeed, some nuclear proteins and enzymes are cleaved during apoptosis, in particular poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which is activated by DNA strand interruptions and is involved in DNA repair. PARP is cleaved into two fragments of 29 and 85 kDa (apparent molecular mass) in human promyelomonocytic leukemia cells, HL-60, treated with etoposide to induce apoptosis. These cells possess protease activities, caspases, that share many features with the ICE/CED-3 family. The cleavage occurs between Asp-214 and Gly-215, a site that is conserved in human, bovine, and chicken PARP. This cleavage has been shown to be an early marker of apoptosis. To monitor apoptosis, to understand the role of PARP cleavage by caspases, and to study the role of the two fragments in DNA repair, members of our laboratory have developed two polyclonal antipeptide antibodies directed against the two human PARP sequences: [196-214] for LP96-22 and [215-228] for LP96-24.

The formation of these products in cellular DNA may explain in part the preponderance of C to T transitions induced spontaneously and by H2O2 or ionizing radiation. Our studies have focused on the biological effects of two major 5,6-unsaturated oxidation products of cytosine: 5- hydroxycytosine and 5-hydroxyuracil. In the present work, we have attempted to study the repair of these two lesions by specifically incorporating them into cellular DNA upon incubation of cells with 5-hydroxy-2'deoxycytidine and 5-hydroxy-2'-deoxyuridine. Incubation of mouse L1210 cells with 250 M 5-hydroxy-2'-deoxycytidine led to the incorporation of this lesion to a level 20 times higher (43 lesions/10(5) cytosines) than base-line levels; however, there was no evidence for its repair following a 15-h chase. In contrast, we did not observe any significant incorporation of 5-hydroxy-2'-deoxyuridine into the DNA of L1210 cells but did observe an unidentified product, presumably an oxidation product. This unidentified pyrimidine was incorporated at a very high level (about 2000 lesions/10(5) cytosine residues) and then partially repaired in chase experiments.","['Wagner, J R', 'Tremblay, S', 'Gowans, B', 'Hunting, D J']","['Wagner JR', 'Tremblay S', 'Gowans B', 'Hunting DJ']","['Institut universitaire de geriatrie de Sherbrooke, QC, Canada. rwagner@courrier.usherb.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', ""5168-36-5 (5-hydroxy-2'-deoxyuridine)"", ""52278-77-0 (5-hydroxy-2'-deoxycytidine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Repair', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Deoxyuridine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/03/11 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 1997;75(4):377-81.,,,,,,,,,,

However, no difference in the kinetics of high molecular weight DNA fragmentation was observed between the two lines after camptothecin treatment. Similar delay and inhibition of the oligonucleosome-sized DNA fragmentation was observed in human B lymphoma Namalwa and monocytic-like leukemia U-937 cells coincubated in the presence of various concentrations of N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethylketone and camptothecin. The effect of N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethylketone was similar to that of CrmA and did not prevent the appearance of high molecular weight DNA fragments. Similar suppression of camptothecin-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was also observed in a cell-free system when cytosolic extracts obtained from camptothecin-treated Namalwa and U-937 cells were coincubated with untreated nuclei in the presence of N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethylketone. Furthermore, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethylketone had no significant effects on caspase-3-like activities in camptothecin-treated Namalwa and U-937 cells. Hydrolysis of Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-amino-4-methylcoumarin, a fluorogenic substrate with caspase-3-like activities, was detected in extracts prepared from camptothecin-treated Namalwa and U-937 cells with no apparent difference in the time courses of caspase-3-like activation in the absence or presence of N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethylketone. Similarly, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethylketone was a weak inhibitor of caspase-3-like activities in vitro. Taken together, these observations suggest that the pathway sensitive to N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethylketone is involved in camptothecin-induced oligonucleosome-sized DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, inhibition of this pathway had no effect on caspase-3-like activation and on the occurrence of high molecular weight DNA fragmentation.","['Sane, A T', 'Schmitt, E', 'Steyaert, A', 'Meyer, D', 'Bertrand, R']","['Sane AT', 'Schmitt E', 'Steyaert A', 'Meyer D', 'Bertrand R']","['Louis-Charles Simard Research Center, Montreal Cancer Institute, CHUM, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '402-71-1 (Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleosomes/*genetics/metabolism', 'Serpins/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/physiology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/03/11 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 1997;75(4):359-68.,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Studies were performed in 25 patients previously vaccinated against influenza (Group A) and in 20 children who had never been immunized before (Group B). In Autumn, 1996, they were vaccinated with subunit trivalent influenza vaccine containing 15 microg of hemagglutinin of A/Singapore/6/86, A/Wuhan/359/95 and B/Beijing(184/93. Antihemagglutinin (HI) and antineuraminidase antibody titers were determined before immunization and 3 weeks and 6 months after vaccination by the hemagglutinin inhibition test and the neuraminidase inhibition test. All results were presented as the geometric mean titer of antibodies, mean fold increase of antibody titer, protection rate and response rate. RESULTS: In Group A mean fold increase of HI antibodies ranged from 17.2 to 26.7 three weeks after vaccination and from 22.1 to 38.2 six months after vaccination, while in Group B it ranged from 15.7 to 22.6 and from 30.3 to 39.3, respectively. In the case of neuraminidase, mean fold increases for Group A varied from 9.2 to 13.2 three weeks after immunization and from 15.6 to 21.1 six months after vaccination, whereas for Group B they varied from 5.5 to 8.3 and from 14.4 to 23.4, respectively. Six months after vaccination the proportion of subjects with HI antibodies > or = 1:40, as well as those with at least 4-fold increase of HI antibody titers, ranged from 68 to 100% in Group A and from 90 to 100% in Group B. No vaccinated child was infected with the influenza virus; the vaccine was well-tolerated and did not cause any adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study indicate that influenza vaccine is immunogenic in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, despite their serious disease.","['Brydak, L B', 'Rokicka-Milewska, R', 'Machala, M', 'Jackowska, T', 'Sikorska-Fic, B']","['Brydak LB', 'Rokicka-Milewska R', 'Machala M', 'Jackowska T', 'Sikorska-Fic B']","['National Influenza Center WHO, Department of Virology, National Institute of Hygiene, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Influenza Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Antibody Formation', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/*immunology', 'Influenza B virus/*immunology', 'Influenza Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Serologic Tests', 'Vaccination']",1998/03/11 00:00,1998/03/11 00:01,['1998/03/11 00:00'],"['1998/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006454-199802000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 1998 Feb;17(2):125-9. doi: 10.1097/00006454-199802000-00009.,,,,,,,,,,

In polygynous species we hypothesize that such a pattern would lead to diverging selection pressure on body size between sexes and increased sexual size dimorphism. In polygynous mammals, male body size is considered to be an important factor for reproductive success. Thus, under the pressure of a virulent infection, males should be selected for rapid growth and/or higher body size to be able to compete successfully as soon as possible with opponents. In contrast, under the same selection pressure, females should be selected for lighter adult body size or rapid growth to reach sexual maturity earlier. We investigated this hypothesis in the domestic cat Felis catus. Orange cats have greater body size dimorphism than non-orange cats. Orange females are lighter than non-orange females, and orange males are heavier than non-orange males. Here, we report the extent to which orange and non-orange individuals differ in infection prevelance for two retroviruses, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). FIV is thought to be transmitted almost exclusively through aggressive contacts between individuals, whereas FeLV transmission occurs mainly through social contacts. The pattern of infection of both diseases is consistent with the higher aggressiveness of orange cats. In both sexes, orange cats are significantly more infected by FIV, and tend to be less infected by FeLV than other cats. The pattern of infection is also consistent with an earlier age at first reproduction in orange than in non-orange cats, at least for females. These results suggest that microparasitism may have played an important role in the evolution of sexual size dimorphism of domestic cats.","['Pontier, D', 'Fromont, E', 'Courchamp, F', 'Artois, M', 'Yoccoz, N G']","['Pontier D', 'Fromont E', 'Courchamp F', 'Artois M', 'Yoccoz NG']","[""UMR-CNRS 5558 'Biometrie, Genetique et Biologie des Populations, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France. dpontier@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Proc Biol Sci,Proceedings.

We prospectively determined the frequency and prognostic importance of minimal residual disease detected by a rapid immunological assay in bone-marrow aspirates of children with ALL. METHODS: 158 children with newly diagnosed ALL received 6 weeks of remission-induction chemotherapy. Once complete clinical remission was attained the patients received 2 weeks of consolidation therapy followed by continuation therapy. Bone-marrow aspirates were collected after induction therapy and during weeks 14, 32, and 56 of continuation therapy, and then at 120 weeks (end of therapy). Cells with leukaemia-associated immunophenotypes were investigated by multiparameter flowcytometry capable of detecting one leukaemic cell among 10,000 normal cells. FINDINGS: The proportion of patients with detectable leukaemic cells was 23% at remission induction and 17% at week 14 of continuation therapy, decreasing to 5% and 4% at weeks 32 and 56. None of the 65 samples examined at completion of therapy (week 120) showed evidence of disease. Detectable residual disease at the end of remission induction correlated with adverse genetic abnormalities--the Philadelphia chromosome and MLL gene rearrangements--but not with other presenting features. Detectable leukaemia was associated with subsequent relapse regardless of the time at which bone-marrow samples were examined (p < 0.002 for all comparisons). For example, 3-year cumulative incidence (SE) of relapse in patients with and without detectable leukaemia at remission induction was 32.5% (10.6) and 7.5% (4.0), respectively (p < 0.001); for tests done at week 14, it was 42.1% (14.6) and 6.6% (3.5), p < 0.001. These correlations remained significant after adjusting for adverse presenting features. A higher degree of marrow infiltration by leukaemic cells (> or = 0.1%) in week 14 samples identified a subset of patients with an especially poor prognosis. INTERPRETATION: Immunological detection of residual leukaemic cells at any point in the treatment course is a powerful predictor of relapse in children with ALL. Alternative treatment should be considered for cases with persistent disease beyond the first 3 months of continuation therapy.","['Coustan-Smith, E', 'Behm, F G', 'Sanchez, J', 'Boyett, J M', 'Hancock, M L', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Rubnitz, J E', 'Rivera, G K', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Pui, C H', 'Campana, D']","['Coustan-Smith E', 'Behm FG', 'Sanchez J', 'Boyett JM', 'Hancock ML', 'Raimondi SC', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Rivera GK', 'Sandlund JT', 'Pui CH', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",1998/03/11 00:00,1998/03/11 00:01,['1998/03/11 00:00'],"['1998/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(97)10295-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(97)10295-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1998 Feb 21;351(9102):550-4. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)10295-1.,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['Lancet. 1998 Apr 25;351(9111):1287.

Spectrum of diseases induced, their incidence and incubation periods to onset were examined. Fifteen chicks were inoculated with the culture fluid and 9 (60%) developed ascites [59-119 days post inoculation (dpi); geometric mean (GM) of dpi, GM: 89.6)], but LL was not induced in any chicks inoculated. Fifty-nine chicks were inoculated with the concentrated viral material and LL was recognized in 13 (22.0%) (27-74 dpi; GM: 48.4), ascites with LL in 11 (18.6%) (34-75 dpi; GM: 41.3), ascites alone in 21 (35.6%) (32-83 dpi; GM: 48.2), erythroblastosis in 2 (3.4%) (70-102 dpi; GM: 84.5), and other diseases in 12 (20.3%) (43-102 dpi; GM: 61.8). LL lesions were frequently observed in the liver, spleen, kidneys, bursa of Fabricius (bursa), bone marrow and gonads. Mild lymphocytic foci in some visceral organs and perivascular cuffing in the central nervous system were observed mainly in several chicks diagnosed as having complication of ascites with LL or other diseases. In addition to these lesions, atrophy of bursa and thymuses was recognized in them. No antibodies against Marek's disease virus (MDV) and reticuloendotheliosis virus were detected in 36 sera taken from the chicks inoculated with the concentrated viral material. Serotype 2 MDV was isolated from the buffy coat of some inoculated chicks. These results suggest that the properties of ALV inoculated and immunosuppression caused by inoculation with high doses of ALV are involved in rapid induction of LL and expression of pathogenicity of serotype 2 MDV released from the LL cell line and included in the viral inoculum.

One checkpoint arrests growth in G1, another inhibits replicon initiation in S phase cells, and the third delays progression from G2 into mitosis. Progression from G2 into M is controlled in part by a cyclin-dependent kinase (cyclin B/Cdk1) that is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Tyr15 on Cdk1 is inhibitory for kinase activity. Activation of cyclin B/Cdk1 at the onset of mitosis is accomplished by a phosphatase, Cdc25C, that interacts with cyclin B/Cdk1 in an autocatalytic feedback loop to remove the inhibitory phosphate at Tyr15 and activate kinase activity. DNA damage triggers G2 delay by inhibiting formation of the autocatalytic feedback loop so that dephosphorylation of Tyr15 does not occur. This suppression of activation of cyclin B/Cdk1 appears to account for the failure of damaged G2 cells to progress into mitosis. Once the damage to DNA is repaired, cells resume progression into mitosis as the cycle is re-engaged. The isoflavone genistein inhibits tyrosine kinases, including one that phosphorylates Cdk1 on Tyr15. This kinase, p56/p53lyn is rapidly induced by treatments that trigger cell cycle checkpoints (ionizing radiation, cytosine arabinoside), suggesting that this kinase may actively delay the onset of mitosis by phosphorylating Tyr15 on Cdk1. Genistein also inhibits type II DNA topoisomerase to produce a form of DNA damage that triggers all of the DNA damage-responsive cell cycle checkpoints. A brief 10 min incubation with the topoisomerase poison amsacrine was sufficient to trigger the S phase checkpoint response and inhibit replicon initiation. Inhibition of replicon initiation by 1 microM amsacrine was maximal 20-30 min after drug treatment and by 120 min, the checkpoint response had decayed to allow near control rates of replicon initiation. Topoisomerase II poisons also are powerful clastogens inducing lethal and carcinogenic chromosomal aberrations. Type II topoisomerase can break DNA in a region of chromosome 11q23 that contains the ataxia telangiectasia gene (ATM). The ATM gene controls all of the DNA damage-responsive cell cycle checkpoints. Chromosomal aberrations in 11q23 are frequently seen in acute myeloid leukemia that develops as a consequence of etoposide chemotherapy. Thus, topoisomerase poisons such as genistein may trigger chromatid breakage to inactivate AT gene function, disable cell cycle control, and induce genetic instability.","['Kaufmann, W K']",['Kaufmann WK'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 27599-7295, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

This paper examines the ability of exogenous cytokines, anti-Ig antibodies, or combinations of these, to enhance or replace the activation signal provided by PMA to different populations of leukaemic B cells. Proliferation induced by PMA was enhanced 2-20-fold when the cells were co-cultured with either anti-Ig, IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha. Moreover, the combination of anti-Ig, PMA and any one of the above cytokines further enhanced proliferation. Anti-Ig and exogenous cytokines were also capable of inducing proliferation in leukaemic B cells cultured with a non-mitogenic concentration of PMA. When taken together with the finding that IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha prevent in vitro apoptosis of leukaemic CD5+ B cells, the results presented here suggest that these cytokines, in conjunction with signals delivered via sIg, may play a role in the proliferation of leukaemic B cells in vivo and, consequently, the pathogenesis of B-CLL.","['Tangye, S G', 'Weston, K M', 'Raison, R L']","['Tangye SG', 'Weston KM', 'Raison RL']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Technology Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (secretory IgM)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Cytokines/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects/immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/10 00:00,1998/03/10 00:01,['1998/03/10 00:00'],"['1998/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/icb.1997.87 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1997 Dec;75(6):561-7. doi: 10.1038/icb.1997.87.,,,,,,,,,,

The cell lines resistant to apoptosis expressed the viral tax gene and/or the cellular FAP-1 (Fas-associated phosphatase) gene, both of which inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis in T cell lines. Although Tax is a transcriptional activator of a number of cellular genes, the expression of Tax in a T cell line did not induce the expression of FAP-1, suggesting that these two antiapoptotic proteins independently function in HTLV-I-infected cells.

At low plating densities, myoblast proliferation was inhibited, and myoblast differentiation was abolished in C2-BP4 cultures compared with C2-LNL6 cultures. At high plating densities in which nuclear numbers were equal in the two sets of cultures, C2-BP4 myoblast differentiation was inhibited completely. Differentiation was restored in C2-BP4 cells by treatment with high levels of exogenous IGF-I or with des(1-3)IGF-I, an analog of IGF-I with reduced affinity for IGFBPs. These findings confirm the hypothesis that positive differentiation signals from the IGFs are necessary for C2 myoblast differentiation, and they suggest that the present model of myogenic differentiation, which involves only negative external control of differentiation by mitogens, may be incomplete.","['Damon, S E', 'Haugk, K L', 'Birnbaum, R S', 'Quinn, L S']","['Damon SE', 'Haugk KL', 'Birnbaum RS', 'Quinn LS']","['Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Tacoma, Washington 98493, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 4)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '112603-35-7 (insulin-like growth factor 1, des-(1-3)-)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 4/*genetics', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/cytology/physiology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*cytology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats']",1998/03/10 03:04,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/03/10 03:04'],"['1998/03/10 03:04 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/03/10 03:04 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199804)175:1<109::AID-JCP12>3.0.CO;2-6 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199804)175:1<109::AID-JCP12>3.0.CO;2-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1998 Apr;175(1):109-20. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199804)175:1<109::AID-JCP12>3.0.CO;2-6.,['N01-HD-6-2915/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Long-term clinical remission occurs in some patients despite incomplete eradication of AML1/ETO as demonstrated by RT-PCR, thus limiting the usefulness of this assay. An important future goal will be to determine if there is a level of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients below which relapse is unlikely. For the detection of MRD, we have developed reagents for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) that identify both derivative 8 and 21 chromosomes with a high analytical sensitivity. In t(8;21) AML cells, two fused signals were detected in addition to the normal 8 and 21 alleles. The sensitivity and specificity of this probe mixture were analyzed in cell lines and patient bone marrows. One and two randomly juxtaposed signals were observed in 2.4 and 0.04% of normal cells, respectively. However, these were easily differentiated from t(8;21) cells by the absence of signals from the normal alleles. Using as criteria the presence of two fused signals plus the normal alleles, we observed no false positives among 5,000 normal cells. The probe correctly identified 20/20 patients with t(8;21) AML and 10/10 non-t(8;21) patients. In cell dilution experiments, the analytical sensitivity of this reagent was equal to that of the X chromosome and Y chromosome alpha-satellite probes.

The aim of our study was to evaluate interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (IPF) on peripheral blood (PB) smears as a rapid and reliable method to quantify Ph-positive myeloid cells. IPF analysis was performed on 49 PB samples from 36 patients in the chronic phase of CML and at different stages of cytogenetic remission. IPF results of 30 PB samples were compared with those from BM aspirates simultaneously obtained from the same patients to evaluate the correlation of Ph-positive cells. Further, the hypermetaphase FISH (HMF) technique was performed on cultured BM preparations of 31 patients for comparison with IPF results on PB. An excellent correlation was observed between the IPF results obtained on PB and BM samples (r = 0.98, y = x - 0.6, p < 0.0001). The mean difference between HMF from BM, on the one hand, and IPF from PB, on the other hand, was 3.2% (SD = +/- 8.4%). Seventy percent of samples were identically classified in one of the four subgroups of cytogenetic response. Thirty percent were classified in neighbouring response groups. We conclude that FISH performed on PB is a rapid and reliable method for assessing the cytogenetic response of CML patients on IFN-alpha based therapies, allowing more frequent and less invasive follow-up investigations although it is not able entirely to replace routine analysis of BM.","['Muhlmann, J', 'Thaler, J', 'Hilbe, W', 'Bechter, O', 'Erdel, M', 'Utermann, G', 'Duba, H C']","['Muhlmann J', 'Thaler J', 'Hilbe W', 'Bechter O', 'Erdel M', 'Utermann G', 'Duba HC']","['Institut fur Medizinische Biologie und Humangenetik, Universitat Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Interphase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results']",1998/03/10 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/03/10 03:03'],"['1998/03/10 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/03/10 03:03 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199802)21:2<90::AID-GCC3>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199802)21:2<90::aid-gcc3>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998 Feb;21(2):90-100. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199802)21:2<90::aid-gcc3>3.0.co;2-2.,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of genetic material from 20q may confer a proliferative advantage to myeloid cells, possibly through loss of function of a tumor suppressor gene. Previously, we analyzed leukemia cells from 19 patients with a del(20q) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and identified a segment that was deleted in 95% of all patients examined. The deleted interval extended from 20q11.2 to q12, spanned approximately 13 Mb, and was flanked proximally by RPN2 and distally by D20S17. To narrow the commonly deleted segment and facilitate the identification of candidate genes, we have employed molecular approaches in combination with FISH. By using 21 microsatellite markers positioned in a recently generated physical map of 20q, we performed allele loss studies in myeloid leukemia cells from 23 patients with a del(20q). The results of these studies allowed us to delineate a new proximal border, flanked by marker D20S206. By FISH analysis of additional leukemia samples from patients with a del(20q), we have also delineated a new distal boundary between markers D20S119 and UT654. As a result of the redesignation of both the proximal and distal boundaries, we have successfully narrowed the commonly deleted segment within 20q12 to a region spanning approximately 8 Mb.

An intraoperative diagnostic challenge for the Mohs surgeon.,269-72,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of chronic leukemia in the US. CLL patients have an increased risk of developing other malignant neoplasms, especially skin cancer. Lymphoma-associated squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) tend to behave more aggressively and therefore are often treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the potential difficulty of distinguishing perineural infiltrates as leukemic infiltrates versus inflammatory infiltrates associated with SCC on frozen tissue sections during MMS. METHODS: This is a case report illustrating a patient with CLL who develops a SCC on the posterior ear. MMS was employed to treat the patient. Special immunohistochemical stains were performed to help distinguish the type of perineural infiltrate present. RESULTS: The perineural infiltrate was shown by immunohistochemistry to be leukemic in origin. Special stains for keratin revealed no residual SCC hidden in the infiltrate. CONCLUSION: CLL is a malignancy that primarily effects the elderly population and markedly increases their risk of developing skin cancers, especially SCC. An intense infiltrate may be present surrounding the tumor. This case report demonstrates one of the potential challenges the Mohs surgeon may face in interpreting histologic frozen section. Immunohistochemistry may be helpful in providing a more definitive answer to this problem.","['Albregts, T', 'Orengo, I', 'Salasche, S', 'Duncan, L', 'Sillman, J', 'Hassoun, H']","['Albregts T', 'Orengo I', 'Salasche S', 'Duncan L', 'Sillman J', 'Hassoun H']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Dermatol Surg,Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.],9504371,,IM,"['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/complications/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Ear Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis/surgery', 'Ear, External', 'Frozen Sections', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*diagnosis', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', '*Mohs Surgery', 'Peripheral Nerves/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/surgery']",1998/03/10 00:00,1998/03/10 00:01,['1998/03/10 00:00'],"['1998/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1076051297002951 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1524-4725.1998.tb04147.x [doi]']",ppublish,Dermatol Surg. 1998 Feb;24(2):269-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4725.1998.tb04147.x.,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of minor H antigens that are expressed in hematopoietic cells, including leukemic cells, but not in fibroblasts and other tissue types has suggested that such tissue-restricted antigens could potentially serve as targets for T-cell immunotherapy to enhance GVL activity without inducing GVH disease (de Bueger et al, J Immunol 149:1788, 1992; van der Harst et al, Blood 83:1060, 1994; and Dolstra et al, J Immunol 158:560, 1997). To explore the feasibility of this strategy, donor CD3+CD8+ CTL clones specific for recipient minor H antigens were isolated and characterized from allogeneic BMT recipients. CTL clones were obtained from the majority of donor/recipient pairs. Seventeen distinct minor H antigens distinguishable by their MHC-restricting allele, population frequency, and/or distribution of tissue expression were defined by 56 CD3+CD8+ CTL clones isolated from these patients. The MHC-restricting alleles for these CTL clones included HLA-A2 and HLA-B7, which had previously been shown to present minor H antigens to CTL, as well as HLA-A3, -A11, -B8, -B53, and -Cw7, which had not previously been described to present minor H antigens to CTL. Estimated phenotype frequencies for these 17 distinct minor H antigens range from 0.17 to 0.92. In vitro cytotoxicity assays using hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts as target cells showed that 5 of the 17 minor H antigens were expressed in both hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts.

To obtain a significant debulking of unwanted cells from the leukapheresis, we developed a modified protocol of immune rosetting whereby human ABO-Rh- compatible red blood cells (RBCs) are treated with chromium chloride and then coated with murine monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against leukocyte antigens. When experiments were performed with leukaphereses obtained from normal donors or from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients, RBCs were coated with murine MoAbs against human mature myeloid cells (CD11b) and T cells (CD6); whereas, in the case of patients with B-precursor ALL, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL), or multiple myeloma (MM), RBCs were coated with anti-CD11b only. After incubation with CPC, rosetting cells (myeloid precursor cells, granulocytes, monocytes, and T cells) were removed by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation with a blood cell processor apparatus, COBE (Lakewood, CO) 2991. After this step, a significant reduction of the initial cellularity was consistently obtained (range, 72% to 97%), whereas the median absolute recovery of the CD34+ cells was above 85% (range, 64 to 100), with a 10-fold relative enrichment ranging from 3% to 41%. In a second step, CPC can be further purged of contaminating T or B cells by incubation with lymphoid-specific magnetic microbeads (anti-CD2 and -CD7 to remove T cells; anti-CD19 to remove B cells) and elution through a type-D depletion column (composed of ferromagnetic fiber) inserted within a SuperMACS separator device (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). By this approach, a highly effective (three to four logs) T-cell depletion was achieved in all experiments performed with normal donors or T-ALL patients (median loss of CD3+ cells: 99.8% [range 99.2 to 100]) and an equally efficient B-cell depletion was obtained from B-precursor ALL, B-NHL, or MM patients. At the end of the procedure the T- or B-cell depleted fraction retained a high proportion of the initial hematopoietic CD34+ stem cells, with a median recovery above 70% (range 48% to 100%) and an unmodified clonogenic potential. In five patients (two follicular NHL and three ALL) the purified fraction of stem cells was found disease free at the molecular level as assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the t(14;18) chromosome translocation or clono-specific DNA sequences of IgH or T-cell receptor gamma and delta chain genes. Purified autologous and allogeneic CPCs were transplanted in three and six patients, respectively, who showed a prompt and sustained hematologic engraftment. In conclusion, this method represents a simple and reproducible two-step procedure to obtain a highly efficient purging of T or B cells from G-CSF expanded and mobilized CPCs. This approach might lead to the eradication of the neoplastic clone in the autologous stem cell inoculum as well as for T-cell depletion during allogeneic transplantation.","['Rambaldi, A', 'Borleri, G', 'Dotti, G', 'Bellavita, P', 'Amaru, R', 'Biondi, A', 'Barbui, T']","['Rambaldi A', 'Borleri G', 'Dotti G', 'Bellavita P', 'Amaru R', 'Biondi A', 'Barbui T']","['Divisione di Ematologia e Centro Trasfusionale, Ospedali Riuniti Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD6 antigen)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Blood Component Removal/*methods', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Leukapheresis', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Rosette Formation', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54823-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 15;91(6):2189-96.,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated protein (MRP), and major vault protein/lung resistance protein (LRP) in 141 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 27 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by flow cytometry. The expression was compared between different types of leukemia and was studied in relation with clinical risk indicators and in vitro cytotoxicity of the MDR-related drugs daunorubicin (DNR), vincristine (VCR), and etoposide (VP16) and the non-MDR-related drugs prednisolone (PRD) and L-asparaginase (ASP). In ALL, P-gp, MRP, and LRP expression did not differ between 112 initial and 29 unrelated relapse samples nor between paired initial and relapse samples from 9 patients. In multiple relapse samples, LRP expression was 1.6-fold higher compared with both initial (P = .026) and first relapse samples (P = .050), which was not observed for P-gp and MRP. LRP expression was weakly but significantly related to in vitro resistance to DNR (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0.25, P = .016) but not to VCR, VP16, PRD, and ASP. No significant correlations were found between P-gp or MRP expression and in vitro drug resistance. Samples with a marked expression of two or three resistance proteins did not show increased resistance to the tested drugs compared with the remaining samples. The expression of P-gp, MRP, and LRP was not higher in initial ALL patients with prognostically unfavorable immunophenotype, white blood cell count, or age. The expression of P-gp and MRP in 20 initial AML samples did not differ or was even lower compared with 112 initial ALL samples. However, LRP expression was twofold higher in the AML samples (P < .001), which are more resistant to a variety of drugs compared with ALL samples. In conclusion, P-gp and MRP are unlikely to be involved in drug resistance in childhood leukemia. LRP might contribute to drug resistance but only in specific subsets of children with leukemia.","['den Boer, M L', 'Pieters, R', 'Kazemier, K M', 'Rottier, M M', 'Zwaan, C M', 'Kaspers, G J', 'Janka-Schaub, G', 'Henze, G', 'Creutzig, U', 'Scheper, R J', 'Veerman, A J']","['den Boer ML', 'Pieters R', 'Kazemier KM', 'Rottier MM', 'Zwaan CM', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Henze G', 'Creutzig U', 'Scheper RJ', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54810-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 15;91(6):2092-8.,,,,,,,,,,

Generation of p210bcr/abl, a chimeric protein with enhanced kinase activity, is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. To elucidate the biological properties of p210bcr/abl and to create an animal model for human Ph1-positive leukemias, we generated transgenic mice expressing p210bcr/abl driven by the promoter of the tec gene, a cytoplasmic tyrosine-kinase preferentially expressed in the hematopoietic lineage. The founder mice showed excessive proliferation of lymphoblasts shortly after birth and were diagnosed as suffering from ALL based on surface marker and Southern blot analyses. Expression and enhanced kinase activity of the p210bcr/abl transgene product were detected in the leukemic tissues. In contrast, transgenic progeny exhibited marked granulocyte hyperplasia with thrombocytosis after a long latent period and developed myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) closely resembling human CML. Expression of p210(bcr/abl) mRNA in the proliferating granulocytes was detected by RT-PCR. In particular, one MPD mouse showed remarkable proliferation of blast cells in the lung, which might represent an extramedullar blast crisis. The results demonstrate that the expression of p210bcr/abl in hematopoietic progenitor cells in transgenic mice can contribute to two clinically distinct hematopoietic malignancies, CML and ALL, indicating that this transgenic system provides a novel transgenic model for human Ph1-positive leukemias.","['Honda, H', 'Oda, H', 'Suzuki, T', 'Takahashi, T', 'Witte, O N', 'Ozawa, K', 'Ishikawa, T', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Honda H', 'Oda H', 'Suzuki T', 'Takahashi T', 'Witte ON', 'Ozawa K', 'Ishikawa T', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NR4A3 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nr4a3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Lung/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', '*Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Steroid', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Transgenes']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54807-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 15;91(6):2067-75.,,,,,,,,,,

The promoter elements that modulate the gene's expression have not been extensively studied. Because of c-kit's acknowledged importance in hematopoiesis, we sought to address this issue in more detail. To perform these studies we analyzed a human c-kit 5' flanking fragment approximately 1 kilobase in length. Deletion constructs showed a region approximately 139 nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation site that was critical for promoter activity. A region containing a potential silencing element was also identified. Sequence analysis indicated several potential Myb- and Ets-binding sites. The functional significance of these sites was explored by showing that both wild-type Myb and Ets-2 protein, but not a DNA binding-deficient Myb mutant protein, bound to distinct 5' flanking fragments that included these sites. Furthermore, binding of recombinant Myb and Ets-2 protein to these fragments could be competed with an excess of double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides containing canonical, but not mutated, Myb- or Ets-binding sites. We also showed that the 5' flanking region of c-kit exhibited promoter activity in nonhematopoietic cells only when the cells were transfected with c-myb or ets-2 expression vectors. Moreover, Myb and Ets-2 coexpression in such cells augmented transactivation of c-kit promoter constructs in comparison to that observed in cells transfected with either construct alone. Promoter constructs lacking various Myb and Ets sites deleted were much less effective in this same system. Finally, Myb and Ets-2 mRNA expression was detected in CD34+, Kit low as well as CD34+, Kit bright cells. In aggregate, these data further define the human c-kit promoter's functional anatomy and suggest that Myb and Ets proteins play an important, perhaps cooperative, role in regulating expression of this critical hematopoietic cell receptor.","['Ratajczak, M Z', 'Perrotti, D', 'Melotti, P', 'Powzaniuk, M', 'Calabretta, B', 'Onodera, K', 'Kregenow, D A', 'Machalinski, B', 'Gewirtz, A M']","['Ratajczak MZ', 'Perrotti D', 'Melotti P', 'Powzaniuk M', 'Calabretta B', 'Onodera K', 'Kregenow DA', 'Machalinski B', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERF protein, human)', '0 (ETS2 protein, human)', '0 (Ets2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CHO Cells', 'COS Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54791-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 15;91(6):1934-46.,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we studied the role of this gene in the regulation of human hematopoiesis by TGF-beta. TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 significantly inhibited myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocyte, and multilineage colony formation as assayed in semisolid culture systems. The levels of Smad5 mRNA in CD34+ cells were decreased by antisense but not sense oligonucleotides to Smad5. Preincubation of CD34+ marrow cells with two sense oligonucleotides to Smad5 did not reverse the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta on hematopoietic colony formation. However, preincubation with two antisense oligonucleotides to Smad5 reversed the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. These data show that the Smad5 gene is involved in the signaling pathway by which TGF-beta inhibits primitive human hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and that Smad5 antisense oligonucleotides can interrupt this signal.","['Bruno, E', 'Horrigan, S K', 'Van Den Berg, D', 'Rozler, E', 'Fitting, P R', 'Moss, S T', 'Westbrook, C', 'Hoffman, R']","['Bruno E', 'Horrigan SK', 'Van Den Berg D', 'Rozler E', 'Fitting PR', 'Moss ST', 'Westbrook C', 'Hoffman R']","['Hematology/Oncology Section, Department of Medicine of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SMAD5 protein, human)', '0 (Smad5 Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Depression, Chemical', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Smad5 Protein', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54789-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 15;91(6):1917-23.,['P01HL 53762-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques have been recently developed to detect the presence of several variants of the resultant CBFB-MYH11 fusion gene that encodes a CBFbeta-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) fusion protein. We have now determined the clinical use of a polyclonal antibody [anti-inv(16) Ab] directed against a junctional epitope of the most common type of CBFbeta-SMMHC fusion protein (type A), which is present in 90% of inv(16)/t(16;16) AML cases. Using flow cytometry, reproducible methods were developed for detection of CBFbeta-SMMHC proteins in permeabilized cells; flow cytometric results were then correlated with cytogenetics and RT-PCR detection methods. In an analysis of 42 leukemia cases with various cytogenetic abnormalities and several normal controls, the anti-inv(16) Ab specifically detected all 23 cases that were cytogenetically positive for inv(16) or t(16;16), including a single AML case that was RT-PCR-negative. In addition to detecting all type A fusions, the anti-inv(16) Ab also unexpectedly identified the type C and type D CBFbeta-SMMHC fusion proteins. Molecular characterization of one RT-PCR-positive and Ab-positive t(16;16) case with a non-type A product showed a novel previously unreported CBFB-MYH11 fusion (CBFB nt 455-MYH11 nt 1893).

The overall concordance between cytogenetics and RT-PCR was 97%, whereas the concordance between flow cytometry and cytogenetics was 100%. Thus, using the anti-inv(16) Ab, all cytogenetically positive and RT-PCR-positive AML cases with inv(16) or t(16;16) could be rapidly identified.

To identify the gene involved in this translocation, we have cloned both rearranged IGHJ alleles using long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction (LDI-PCR). Two IGHJ fragments were amplified from CEMO-1 DNA and sequenced. One allele showed novel sequences upstream of JH5 with no homology to either IGH or any other sequences on the databases. Using a single-copy Xho I fragment immediately 5' of JH5, PAC clones were isolated and mapped to chromosome 1q21 on normal metaphases by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), confirming that this allele represented the t(1;14)(q21;q32) breakpoint. Sequence analysis of the 1q21 Xho I fragment showed identity with an expressed sequence tag (EST), and this probe was therefore used to probe Northern blots. Two transcripts of 6.3 kb and 4.2 kb expressed at low level in mRNA from all tissues were detected: a third transcript of 1.6 kb was expressed only in thymus, spleen, and small intestine. Full-length BCL9 cDNA clones were obtained from a normal human fetal brain cDNA library supplemented by 5' and 3' RACE. Sequence analysis predicted a protein of 1394 amino acids containing 18% proline, 11% glycine, 11% serine, and 6% methionine, but no recognizable protein motifs or significant homologies to any other known proteins. The CEMO-1 1q21 breakpoint fell within the 3' UTR of the BCL9 gene. Low-level expression of BCL9 was detected in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed normal B cells by Northern blot; in contrast, abundant BCL9 expression was observed in CEMO-1, indicating that deregulated expression of this gene was one pathological consequence of the translocation. Screening of a panel of 39 B-cell malignancies with 1q abnormalities by Southern blot showed one additional case with a breakpoint in the 3' UTR of BCL9, indicating that this was a recurrent breakpoint. FISH analysis using an 850-kb YAC spanning BCL9 identified a further case with t(1;22)(q21;q11) causing juxtaposition of BCL9 to the IGlambda locus. Other breakpoints were heterogeneous, falling both centromeric (10 cases) and telomeric (10 cases) of the BCL9 gene. These data suggest that BCL9 may be the target of translocation in some B-cell malignancies with abnormalities of 1q21 and that deregulated BCL9 expression may be important in their pathogenesis.","['Willis, T G', 'Zalcberg, I R', 'Coignet, L J', 'Wlodarska, I', 'Stul, M', 'Jadayel, D M', 'Bastard, C', 'Treleaven, J G', 'Catovsky, D', 'Silva, M L', 'Dyer, M J']","['Willis TG', 'Zalcberg IR', 'Coignet LJ', 'Wlodarska I', 'Stul M', 'Jadayel DM', 'Bastard C', 'Treleaven JG', 'Catovsky D', 'Silva ML', 'Dyer MJ']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Institute of Cancer Research, Haddow Laboratories, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL9 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*ultrastructure', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54784-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 15;91(6):1873-81.,,,,,,,,,,

We recently reported that nm23 genes were overexpressed in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and a higher level of nm23-H1 expression was correlated with a poor prognosis in AML, especially in AML-M5 (acute monocytic leukemia). To evaluate the importance of nm23 expression as a prognostic factor in AML, we compared it with other putative prognostic factors in AML. An analysis of the correlation between nm23 expression and the clinical parameters of 110 patients with AML demonstrated that increased nm23-H1 mRNA levels were associated with resistance to initial chemotherapy and with reduced overall survival. Multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model also showed that elevated nm23-H1 mRNA levels significantly contributed to the prognosis of patients with AML. Especially in AML-M5, nm23-H1 status was the most important prognostic factor. Furthermore, to determine whether we can apply the results observed in AML to other hematologic malignancies, we investigated the relative levels of nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 transcripts in 149 patients with hematologic neoplasms, including 110 with de novo AML, 9 with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 14 with myelodysplastic syndrome, 16 with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and 5 normal subjects by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Expression of nm23-H1 was significantly higher in all the hematologic neoplasms, except CML in chronic phase, than in normal blood cells. nm23 may have a prognostic effect in these hematologic malignancies as well as in AML.","['Yokoyama, A', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Wakimoto, N', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Sakashita, A', 'Maseki, N', 'Nakamaki, T', 'Hino, K i', 'Tomoyasu, S', 'Tsuruoka, N', 'Motoyoshi, K', 'Nagata, N', 'Honma, Y']","['Yokoyama A', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Wakimoto N', 'Kobayashi H', 'Sakashita A', 'Maseki N', 'Nakamaki T', 'Hino Ki', 'Tomoyasu S', 'Tsuruoka N', 'Motoyoshi K', 'Nagata N', 'Honma Y']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Research Institute and Hematology Clinic, Hospital, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD7/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*mortality', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54780-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 15;91(6):1845-51.,,,,,,,,,,

Although cord-blood-derived eosinophils expressed easily detectable levels of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL, only traces or no expression of these three antiapoptotic proteins were found in peripheral blood eosinophils. Incubation of both eosinophil types for 1 to 3 days in a cytokine-deprived medium led to apoptosis, without changes in the expression of Bax, Mcl-1, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL. Although addition of interleukin-5 or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to the culture medium increased the survival of both eosinophil types, a rise in the levels of Mcl-1 was observed only in IFN-gamma-treated cord-blood eosinophils.

Unlike the previous small series which invariably showed poor BM granulocyte-macrophage colony and cluster formations, we found 3 growth patterns. A poor-growth pattern was seen in 101 patients. A low-growth pattern with BM colony and cluster formations in the lower range of the normal limits was observed in 6 patients. All 6 patients had low-risk ALL, and the in vitro growth may reflect the residual normal CFU-GM in BM. Thirdly an over-growth pattern was noted in one patient with refractory ALL. In 49 cases where liquid suspension cultures of BM were performed, 4 had a normal-growth pattern and 42 had apoptotic cells and/or few residual granulocytic/monocytic cells after 7 days of culture. However, in both B cell ALL cases and in 1 refractory T cell ALL case with hyperleukocytosis, repetitive liquid suspension cultures of BM and PB consistently revealed an extensive growth of lymphoblasts. Thus, an over-growth pattern in either the BM CFU-GM assay or liquid suspension culture of BM or PB in children with ALL at diagnosis may indicate a refractory or aggressive disease.

Treatment with neuraminidase increased detection by FC-2.15 in normal PMN, myeloid leukemia cells and T84 cells but not in MCF-7 cells.","['Capurro, M', 'Bover, L', 'Portela, P', 'Livingston, P', 'Mordoh, J']","['Capurro M', 'Bover L', 'Portela P', 'Livingston P', 'Mordoh J']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Bioquimicas Fundacion Campomar, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Breast Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Haptens', 'Humans', 'Lewis X Antigen/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/07 00:00,1998/03/07 00:01,['1998/03/07 00:00'],"['1998/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002620050451 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1998 Feb;45(6):334-9. doi: 10.1007/s002620050451.,['61422/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

For human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, cleavage of pro-caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama/apopain) into its proteolytically active subunits rapidly follows the photodynamic treatment of these cells with cytotoxic levels of the photosensitizer benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A and visible light. Cleavage of a recently identified cytosolic 45 kDa protein, DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), is required for endonuclease activation leading to DNA fragmentation. In the present study, DFF was rapidly processed following PDT. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-X(L) gene in HL-60 cells prevented PDT-induced caspase activation, DFF cleavage and DNA fragmentation.

We have studied the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of the peripherin gene by LIF. In particular, we have identified a 70-bp element [peripherin cytokine-responsive element (Pe-CyRE)] within the 5'-flanking sequences of the mouse peripherin gene (between -930 and -860) that enhances transcription in two neuroblastoma cell lines, NBFL and LA-N-2, in response to LIF treatment. We have also shown by DNA mobility shift assays that treatment of cells by LIF induces the binding of protein complexes composed of at least two members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factor family to a cis element (Pe-APRE2) within Pe-CyRE. Furthermore, the entire Pe-CyRE, as well as Pe-APRE2, conferred responsiveness onto a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. However, the response amplitude of the heterologous promoter to LIF was lower than that observed with the 5'-flanking sequences of the peripherin promoter, suggesting that cooperative interactions with surrounding sequences of the peripherin gene are required for a full transcriptional activation.","['Lecomte, M J', 'Basseville, M', 'Landon, F', 'Karpov, V', 'Fauquet, M']","['Lecomte MJ', 'Basseville M', 'Landon F', 'Karpov V', 'Fauquet M']","['CNRS, URA 2115 CHU Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (PRPH protein, human)', '0 (Peripherins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/physiology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Eye Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Peripherins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/physiology']",1998/03/07 00:00,1998/03/07 00:01,['1998/03/07 00:00'],"['1998/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Neurochem. 1998 Mar;70(3):971-82.,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.,255-61,"Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) offers a potential cure for younger patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). More than 600 patients from 50 European centers have now been reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). We retrospectively analyzed 131 patients reported to the Chronic Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT who underwent BMT from HLA-identical siblings without prior remission induction chemotherapy. At the time of BMT 46 patients had refractory anemia (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts, 67 patients had more advanced MDS subtypes and 18 patients had progressed to sAML. The 5-year disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for the entire group of patients was 34 and 41%, respectively. Fifty patients died from transplant-related complications, most commonly graft-versus-host disease and/or infections. Relapse occurred in 28 patients between 1 and 33 months after BMT, resulting in an actuarial probability of relapse of 39% at 5 years. DFS and OS were dependent on pretransplant bone marrow blast counts. Patients with RA/RARS, RAEB, RAEB/T and sAML had a 5-year DFS of 52, 34, 19 and 26%, respectively. The 5-year OS for the respective patient groups was 57, 42, 24 and 28%. In a multivariate analysis, younger age, shorter disease duration, and absence of excess of blasts were associated with improved outcome. From these data we conclude that patients with myelodysplasia who have appropriate marrow donors, especially those aged less than 40 years and those with low medullary blast cell count should be treated with BMT as the primary treatment early in the course of their disease. Transplantation early after establishing the diagnosis of MDS may improve prognosis due to a lower treatment-related mortality and a lower relapse risk.","['Runde, V', 'de Witte, T', 'Arnold, R', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Hermans, J', 'van Biezen, A', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Labopin, M', 'Walter-Noel, M P', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Jacobsen, N', 'Ljungman, P', 'Carreras, E', 'Kolb, H J', 'Aul, C', 'Apperley, J']","['Runde V', 'de Witte T', 'Arnold R', 'Gratwohl A', 'Hermans J', 'van Biezen A', 'Niederwieser D', 'Labopin M', 'Walter-Noel MP', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Jacobsen N', 'Ljungman P', 'Carreras E', 'Kolb HJ', 'Aul C', 'Apperley J']","['University Hospital of Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Refractory/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Nuclear Family', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/03/07 00:00,1998/03/07 00:01,['1998/03/07 00:00'],"['1998/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701084 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Feb;21(3):255-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701084.,,,,,,,,,,

An important issue regarding allo-PBPCT is the potential for long-term engraftment of human PBPC. A subset of bone marrow (BM) cells displaying the immunophenotype CD34+ HLA-DR- has functional properties associated with pluripotential stem cells. We studied the origin (donor vs recipient) of CD34+ HLA-DR- hematopoietic cells from patients having received allo-PBPCT and with a long follow-up (14+ to 21+ months). Chimeric status was determined after amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of short tandem repeat sequences (PCR-STR). Four patients (acute myeloid leukemia (n = 3), acute lymphoid leukemia (n = 1) were studied. CD34+ HLA-DR- cells from bone marrow aspirates were isolated by flow cytometry cell sorting. The mean percentage of CD34+ cells among the total nucleated BM cells from the four patients was 0.6+/-0.2% (mean +/- s.d.) (range, 0.31-1.27%). The CD34+ HLA-DR- cells accounted for 1.54+/-0.54 (range, 0.9-2.05%) of the CD34+ BM cells. The purity of the CD34+ HLA-DR- cells analyzed after sorting was higher than 94% in all sorted fractions. PCR-STR of these cells showed donor origin in all patients. The origin of CD34+ HLA-DR- bone marrow cells in patients treated with allo-PBPCT has not so far been analyzed.

In addition to the analysis of minimal residual disease (MRD), the chimerism status of patients after allogeneic transplant was studied by PCR. The CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion transcript was not detectable in six of seven patients who remained in remission after allogeneic BMT or PBPCT. Two of these patients in remission were monitored for 50 months and 64 months post-BMT. One patient in remission was PCR-positive for CBFbeta 3 months post-BMT in a single BM sample, but not in a simultaneously examined blood sample, suggesting that analyses from BM samples are more sensitive than those from blood samples. Sequential PCR assays performed 6 and 12 months post-BMT obtained from the same patient were negative. Another patient with a positive PCR assay 3 months post-allogeneic PBPCT, remained PCR positive for the CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion transcript when tested 6 months post-PBPCT. A chimerism analysis by PCR revealed a mixed chimerism status in this patient. He relapsed 7 months post-transplant. Before transplant, in all nine patients who were in complete remission of AML (eight patients in 1CR, one patient in 2CR), the CBFbeta/MYH11 transcript was detectable. In one patient in relapse, the fusion transcript was not only detectable in blood and bone marrow, but also in a cerebrospinal fluid sample prior to transplant. Two patients who received autologous BMT were monitored for CBFbeta/MYH11 transcripts 3 months after BMT. The CBFbeta/MYH11 was detected in these patients. Both patients subsequently relapsed 3 months and 23 months post-autologous BMT.

Acute and chronic GVHD were considered as time-dependent covariates. Patients transplanted in first and second remission were analyzed separately. GVHD decreased relapse risks to a similar extent in T and B lineage ALL. For first remission transplants, relative risks of relapse for patients with vs those without GVHD was 0.34 for T lineage ALL and 0.44 for B lineage ALL. Corresponding relative risks in second remission transplants were 0.54 and 0.61. This study confirms earlier findings of an antileukemia effect of GVHD in ALL.

Information on the characteristics of more recently diagnosed patients with IM is scarce. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The initial features, evolutive patterns and survival from 106 patients diagnosed with IM in a single institution between 1975 and 1996 were analyzed. RESULTS: Median age of the series was 64 years (range: 17-89); there were 61 males and 55 females. One third of the patients were asymptomatic at IM diagnosis. The most common presenting symptoms were related to hypermetabolism, anemia and splenomegaly. A palpable spleen was noted in 85% of patients, and 66% had hepatomegaly. Anemia was the most frequent hematologic abnormality (50% of cases). Bone marrow biopsy showed cellular phase IM in 50 patients, IM without osteosclerosis in 39, and osteosclerotic IM in the remaining 17. Evolution into acute leukemia was seen in 14 patients (actuarial probability at 7 years: 20%, 95% CI: 0-40%), 8 patients developed portal hypertension, 5 liver failure without portal hypertension and 14 heart failure. With 62 patients having died, the series' median survival was 59 months (95% CI: 41-75). CONCLUSION: IM is usually diagnosed in the old age.

These results indicate that PML is a critical component of the RA pathway and that disruption of its activity by the PML-RARalpha fusion protein may be important in APL pathogenesis.","['Wang, Z G', 'Delva, L', 'Gaboli, M', 'Rivi, R', 'Giorgio, M', 'Cordon-Cardo, C', 'Grosveld, F', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Wang ZG', 'Delva L', 'Gaboli M', 'Rivi R', 'Giorgio M', 'Cordon-Cardo C', 'Grosveld F', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Sloan-Kettering Division, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Gene Targeting', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.279.5356.1547 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1998 Mar 6;279(5356):1547-51. doi: 10.1126/science.279.5356.1547.,"['CA 71692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The HML cells possessed megakaryocytic features, as determined by cytochemical, electron microscopic and flow cytometric analysis. In the present study we examined the effects of retinoic acid (RA) on the development of HML cells. All-trans-RA, 13-cis-RA and 9-cis-RA at 10(-8) mol/l to 10(-5) mol/l inhibited the GM-CSF-dependent cell growth. Some of the RA-treated cells contained prominent azurophilic granules and were positive for peroxidase. They also reacted with Biebrich scarlet, Luxol fast blue and a monoclonal antibody against eosinophil peroxidase. In addition, exposure to RA increased the frequency and the intensity of major basic protein-positive cells. However, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin and eosinophil cationic protein were not detected or were only detected at a low level in the lysates of the HML cells treated with RA. Although IL-5 alone could not stimulate cell growth, the addition of IL-5 to the cultures containing stem cell factor + all-trans-RA was required for the expression of the eosinophilic phenotype. These results suggest that the HML cell line is a megakaryoblastic cell line with the potential to differentiate into the eosinophilic lineage.

Although sPLA2 protein has been described in human platelets, its presence in human megakaryocytes has not been yet established. We demonstrated in this study that the human erythroleukaemia (HEL) cell line, which has megakaryoblastic features, constitutively expresses sPLA2. Using an anti-rhsPLA2 monoclonal antibody (mAb BA11) and dot-blot detection, we showed that HEL cells and platelets release sPLA2 into incubation medium upon stimulation by thrombin. Similar results were obtained for sPLA2 activity detected by a spectrofluorescence assay. Enzymatic activity was abolished by mAb BA11 and by protamine. In both cell types, although released, the major part of sPLA2 remained in the cell pellet, and was probably adsorbed at non-specific membrane sites. Double labelling experiments using mAb BA11 and an anti-GPIIb antiserum revealed the presence of sPLA2 in human bone-marrow megakaryocytes. The use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction conjugated with hybridization analysis demonstrated the presence of mRNA encoding for sPLA2 in platelets and HEL cells. Expression of sPLA2 in platelets and megakaryocytes at both transcriptional and post-translational levels strongly argues in favour of a megakaryocytic origin of platelet sPLA2 and rules out a role for endocytosis of the enzyme from plasma by circulating platelets.","['Emadi, S', 'Mirshahi, M', 'Elalamy, I', 'Nicolas, C', 'Vargaftig, B B', 'Hatmi, M']","['Emadi S', 'Mirshahi M', 'Elalamy I', 'Nicolas C', 'Vargaftig BB', 'Hatmi M']","['Unite de Pharmacologie Cellulaire, Unite Associee Institut Pasteur-INSERM U285, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)']",IM,"['Blood Platelets/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/06 00:00,1998/03/06 00:01,['1998/03/06 00:00'],"['1998/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00580.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Feb;100(2):365-73. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00580.x.,,,,,,,,,,

MRC Working Party on Leukaemia in Adults.,317-25,"In patients with multiple myeloma, despite a major reduction of bone pain achieved with chemotherapy, skeletal disease continues to progress. The effects of clodronate, an inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption, are evaluated on the natural history of skeletal disease in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Within the framework of the VIth MRC Multiple Myeloma Trial, 536 patients (218 women, 318 men) with recently diagnosed multiple myeloma were randomized to receive either clodronate 1600 mg daily (n=264) or an outwardly identical placebo (n=272) in addition to chemotherapy. Treatment with clodronate was associated with a 50% decrease in the proportion of patients with severe hypercalcaemia (5.1% v 10.1%, P=0.06) and a similar reduction in reported non-vertebral fractures (6.8% v 13.2%, P=0.04). Fewer patients receiving clodronate sustained vertebral fractures after entry to the trial (38% v 55%, P=0.01) and patients also lost less height over 3 years compared to those receiving placebo (2.0 v 3.4 cm, P=0.01). Biochemical indices of bone turnover were significantly lower in patients receiving concomitant clodronate, both at plateau and at disease relapse. The frequencies of back pain and poor performance status were significantly lower at 24 months in clodronate than in placebo-treated patients (10.9% v 19.9%, P=0.05, and 18.3% v 30.5% P=0.03 respectively.) There was no statistically significant difference in survival between the clodronate and placebo treated patients. The study indicates that long-term oral clodronate slows the progression of skeletal disease in multiple myeloma and decreases the associated morbidity. Patients without overt skeletal disease at diagnosis were also found to benefit from clodronate, indicating that this treatment should be initiated as early in the course of the disease as possible.","['McCloskey, E V', 'MacLennan, I C', 'Drayson, M T', 'Chapman, C', 'Dunn, J', 'Kanis, J A']","['McCloskey EV', 'MacLennan IC', 'Drayson MT', 'Chapman C', 'Dunn J', 'Kanis JA']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Analgesics, Non-Narcotic)', '0813BZ6866 (Clodronic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Diseases/*prevention & control', 'Calcium/blood', 'Clodronic Acid/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fractures, Spontaneous/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/chemically induced', 'Hypocalcemia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Pain/prevention & control', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/03/06 00:00,1998/03/06 00:01,['1998/03/06 00:00'],"['1998/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00567.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Feb;100(2):317-25. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00567.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.,265-72,"While assessing the prognostic implications of immunophenotyping in 382 patients enrolled in treatment protocols of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) for de novo adult acute myeloid leukaemia, we identified 95 patients with a unique antigen profile characterized by high expression of the leucocyte integrin CD11b (CD11b+ AML). High expression of CD11b was defined as > or = 32% positive blasts based on the retrospectively established prognostic cut-off point for this antigen. Although CD11b is normally expressed by mature monocytes, natural killer cells and granulocytes, leukaemic blasts in CD11b+ AML lacked other immunologic monocytic features (e.g. CD14 and CD122, the interleukin-2 receptor beta chain) and demonstrated a high degree of immaturity, as reflected by a high incidence of blasts expressing the stem cell factor receptor, CD117, and few blasts positive for the myeloid differentiation antigen CD15. Furthermore, by FAB criteria, only 41% of CD11b+ AML cases were classified as M4/M5. Patients with CD11b+ AML had a low response rate (54%) when compared with acute monocytic leukaemia (AMOL; 82%, P = 0.006) or AML overall (68%, P = 0.031), independent of age, cytogenetic abnormalities and P-glycoprotein expression. Because of its poor prognosis, recognition of CD11b+ AML is clinically warranted and, given its morphologic and cytogenetic ambiguity, must be based on the unique antigen profile.","['Paietta, E', 'Andersen, J', 'Yunis, J', 'Rowe, J M', 'Cassileth, P A', 'Tallman, M S', 'Bennett, J M', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Paietta E', 'Andersen J', 'Yunis J', 'Rowe JM', 'Cassileth PA', 'Tallman MS', 'Bennett JM', 'Wiernik PH']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore and Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, New York 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1998/03/06 00:00,1998/03/06 00:01,['1998/03/06 00:00'],"['1998/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00561.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Feb;100(2):265-72. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.00561.x.,"['CA14958/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Cytotoxicity was determined using an XTT bioassay. Apoptosis was measured by either DNA fragmentation or immunolabelling techniques. Angiogenesis was measured using the in vivo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chick embryo. RESULTS: S-phosphonate was selectively cytotoxic towards the human leukemic cell lines, HL-60 and AML-14, whereas leukemic K-562 cells and the murine mast cell line, MC-9, were resistant to this agent at concentrations as high as 50 microM. This selectivity resulted from the induction of apoptosis (or programmed cell death) by s-phosphonate in HL-60 and AML-14 cells but not in resistant K-562 or MC-9 cells. S-phosphonate induced localized antiangiogenic effects and membrane thinning in the CAM. This concentration-dependent antiangiogenic effect was associated with apoptosis in the CAM as measured by DNA fragmentation in extracted CAM tissue. The localized areas of membrane thinning and antiangiogenesis on the CAM caused by s-phosphonate were also the only areas of the membrane in which apoptosis occurred. CONCLUSION: We conclude that s-phosphonate selectively induces apoptosis in human leukemic cells and exhibits antiangiogenic and apoptotic activity on the CAM.","['Jackson, J K', 'Burt, H M', 'Oktaba, A M', 'Hunter, W', 'Scheid, M P', 'Mouhajir, F', 'Lauener, R W', 'Shen, Y', 'Salari, H', 'Duronio, V']","['Jackson JK', 'Burt HM', 'Oktaba AM', 'Hunter W', 'Scheid MP', 'Mouhajir F', 'Lauener RW', 'Shen Y', 'Salari H', 'Duronio V']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Phospholipids)', ""146388-20-7 (2'-(trimethylammonio)ethyl-4-(hexadecyloxy)-3-methoxybutane"", 'phosphonate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chorion/*blood supply/cytology/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*pathology', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', '*Organophosphonates', 'Phospholipids/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/03/06 00:00,1998/03/06 00:01,['1998/03/06 00:00'],"['1998/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050746 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1998;41(4):326-32. doi: 10.1007/s002800050746.,,,,,,,,,,

The vitamin D analogs chosen for this investigation were 1,25-(OH)2-23-yne-cholecalciferol (23-D) and 1,25-(OH)2-delta16-23-yne-cholecalciferol (16-23-D) since they have the potential to be used clinically owing to their minimal action on calcium metabolism. METHODS: HL-60 and NB-4 leukemic cells were incubated with different concentrations of 5-AZA and either 23-D or 16-23-D and their antineoplastic action determined by inhibition of DNA synthesis and growth, induction of differentiation and colony assay. RESULTS: 5-AZA in combination with either vitamin D analog produced a greater growth inhibition and induction of differentiation than either agent alone. For HL-60 leukemic cells the combination of 5-AZA with either analog produced a synergistic loss of clonogenicity. These effects on clonogenicity correlated with the effects of the combination on inhibition of growth and DNA synthesis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that vitamin D analogs may enhance the antileukemic action of 5-AZA and that it may be interesting to test these agents in combination in patients with myeloid leukemia.","['Dore, B T', 'Chomienne, C', 'Momparler, R L']","['Dore BT', 'Chomienne C', 'Momparler RL']","['Departement de pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology']",1998/03/06 00:00,1998/03/06 00:01,['1998/03/06 00:00'],"['1998/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050740 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1998;41(4):275-80. doi: 10.1007/s002800050740.,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of the antitumor activity of MDL 101,731 against human carcinoma cells through investigating metabolism and the target enzyme of MDL 101,731. METHODS: In respect of the intracellular metabolism of MDL 101,731, the effect on enzymes in the pyrimidine salvage pathway and the intracellular metabolites of MDL 101,731 were investigated. In respect of the target enzyme, the effect on intracellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools and the inhibition of the enzyme activity were investigated. RESULTS: MDL 101,731 which shows antiproliferative activity against human cervical carcinoma HeLa S3 cells at nanomolar concentrations (IC50, 30-50 nM), was hardly metabolized to (E)-2'-deoxy-2'-(fluoromethylene)uridine (FMdU) which had no antiproliferative activity below 100 microM because of resistance to human cytidine deaminase. MDL 101,731 showed low activity against murine lymphocytic leukemia P388R cells (Ara-C-resistant cells) which contained lower deoxycytidine kinase activity than parental P388 cells. In addition, the antiproliferative activity of MDL 101,731 against HeLa S3 cells was reversed by deoxycytidine. Studies of the intracellular metabolism of 3H-MDL 101,731 demonstrated that it was rapidly metabolized to the diphosphate and the triphosphate forms without the other metabolites in HeLa S3 cells. A 3-h treatment with 0.1-10 microM MDL 101,731 decreased intracellular dNTP pools. The recovery of dNTP pools decreased by treatment with 2 microM MDL 101,731 was much slower than the recovery following treatment with 10 mM hydroxyurea, a reversible ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor. At a dose of 250 mg/kg, MDL 101,731 continuously inhibited ribonucleotide reductase activity up to 72 h in a HeLa S3 xenograft model.

We have hypothesized that IFN-alpha acts at least in part through restoration of beta1-integrin function on malignant hematopoietic progenitors that can promote adhesion of malignant progenitors to the marrow microenvironment. This may then restore microenvironmental inhibition of progenitor proliferation and induce tumor dormancy. We demonstrate that IFN-alpha administration to a patient suffering from a clinically severe bleeding diathesis reversed the defective collagen-mediated aggregation of platelets expressing normal numbers of functionally inactive collagen receptors. This is the first in vivo demonstration that IFN-alpha can up-regulate the function of adhesion receptors in CML and supports the premise that IFN-alpha induces remissions by restoring normal integrin-mediated interactions between progenitors and microenvironmental components.","['Verfaillie, C M', 'Bhatia, R', 'Browne, P', 'Key, N S']","['Verfaillie CM', 'Bhatia R', 'Browne P', 'Key NS']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,"['0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Collagen/*physiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Integrin beta1/*physiology', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/pathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Aggregation/*physiology']",1998/03/06 00:00,1998/03/06 00:01,['1998/03/06 00:00'],"['1998/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2143(98)90159-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-2143(98)90159-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1998 Feb;131(2):163-9. doi: 10.1016/s0022-2143(98)90159-7.,"['R01-HL-48738-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-49930-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

CAN, also called NUP214, is a nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein that contains multiple FG-peptide sequence motifs. It interacts at the NPC with at least two other proteins, the nucleoporin NUP88 and hCRM1 (exportin 1), which was recently shown to function as a nuclear export receptor. Depletion of CAN in knockout mouse embryonic cells results in cell cycle arrest in G2, followed by inhibition of nuclear protein import and a block of mRNA export. We overexpressed CAN and DEK-CAN in U937 myeloid precursor cells. DEK-CAN expression did not interfere with terminal myeloid differentiation of U937 cells, whereas CAN-overexpressing cells arrested in G0, accumulated mRNA in their nuclei, and died in an apoptotic manner. Interestingly, we found that hCRM1 and import factor p97/importin beta colocalized with the ectopically expressed CAN protein, resulting in depletion of both factors from the NPC. Overexpression of the C-terminal FG-repeat region of CAN, which contains the binding site for hCRM1, caused sequestering of hCRM1 in the nucleoplasm and was sufficient to inhibit cell growth and to induce apoptosis. These results confirm that CAN plays a crucial role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and imply an essential role for hCRM1 in cell growth and survival.","['Boer, J', 'Bonten-Surtel, J', 'Grosveld, G']","['Boer J', 'Bonten-Surtel J', 'Grosveld G']","[""Department of Genetics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DEK-CAN fusion protein, recombinant)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nup214 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', '*Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",1998/03/06 00:00,1998/03/06 00:01,['1998/03/06 00:00'],"['1998/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.3.1236 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Mar;18(3):1236-47. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.3.1236.,"['1S10RR08385/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC108836,,,

To further our knowledge of this process, the authors investigated the presence and function of the cytokines leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and oncostatin M (OSM) on meningioma cell proliferation. METHODS: Active transcription of LIF, IL-6, and OSM, their related receptors (LIF-R, IL-6-R, and gp130), and the consecutive signal-transducing molecules (STAT 1, STAT 3, and STAT 5a) were analyzed in reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments. The presence of endogenous LIF, IL-6, and OSM proteins was demonstrated in the supernatant of cultured meningioma cells using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot experiments, thus indicating an autocrine signaling pathway for all three cytokines. The biological function of all three cytokines was evaluated by studying their effects on meningioma cell growth. Recombinant LIF and IL-6 showed no significant growth modulating effects; however, recombinant OSM decreased meningioma cell growth by 66%. The antiproliferative potency of OSM was demonstrated by cell count experiments, the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, and cell cycle analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro data support the concept that growth of meningioma cells may be modulated by cytokines, and they also indicate that recombinant OSM may be one future candidate for use in the adjuvant treatment of inoperable and recurrent meningiomas.","['Schrell, U M', 'Koch, H U', 'Marschalek, R', 'Schrauzer, T', 'Anders, M', 'Adams, E', 'Fahlbusch, R']","['Schrell UM', 'Koch HU', 'Marschalek R', 'Schrauzer T', 'Anders M', 'Adams E', 'Fahlbusch R']","['Department of Neurosurgery, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosurg,Journal of neurosurgery,0253357,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Steroids)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Meningioma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Milk Proteins', 'Neuropeptides/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Steroids/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/06 00:00,1998/03/06 00:01,['1998/03/06 00:00'],"['1998/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3171/jns.1998.88.3.0541 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosurg. 1998 Mar;88(3):541-8. doi: 10.3171/jns.1998.88.3.0541.,,,,,,,,,,

ATM sequence mutations have been reported in 46% of T-PLL cases, but some cases also have karyotypic abnormalities at 11q, including 11q23. This led us to investigate the structure of the ATM locus in a panel of eight cases, two of which had 11q23 abnormalities. As expected, nucleotide changes were detected in some samples. Two remission samples were wild type. To test for structural lesions, DNA fibres were hybridized with a contig of four labelled cosmids spanning the ATM locus. In all samples there were structural lesions and in four samples both alleles were affected. This provides strong evidence for our suggestion that ATM acts as a tumour suppressor during T-PLL tumorigenesis. Some additional role for ATM during T-PLL tumorigenesis is possible since nucleotide changes were present in addition to structural lesions disrupting both alleles. The mechanism of inactivation appeared to be unusual because multiple structural lesions on one allele were often observed.","['Yuille, M A', 'Coignet, L J', 'Abraham, S M', 'Yaqub, F', 'Luo, L', 'Matutes, E', 'Brito-Babapulle, V', 'Vorechovsky, I', 'Dyer, M J', 'Catovsky, D']","['Yuille MA', 'Coignet LJ', 'Abraham SM', 'Yaqub F', 'Luo L', 'Matutes E', 'Brito-Babapulle V', 'Vorechovsky I', 'Dyer MJ', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Institute of Cancer Research-Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Trust, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/03/06 00:00,1998/03/06 00:01,['1998/03/06 00:00'],"['1998/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201603 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Feb 12;16(6):789-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201603.,,,,,,,,,['Oncogene 1998 Jun 4;16(22):2955'],

We report here the effect of bufalin on c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), a member of the MAPK family, and on the signaling pathway downstream of MAPKs in U937 cells. When U937 cells were treated with 10(-8) M bufalin, the activity of JNK1 was markedly elevated 3 h after the start of treatment and remained so for 9 h. This activation of JNK and the induction of apoptosis by bufalin were suppressed by expression of antisense mRNA for MAPK kinase-1. c-Jun was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after treatment of U937 cells with bufalin. The transcriptional activity of AP-1 was transiently enhanced by the treatment with bufalin and this activation was suppressed by the expression of antisense mRNA for MAPK kinase-1. Both curcumin (1,7-bis[4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl]-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione), an inhibitor of the biosynthesis of AP-1, and the expression of dominant negative c-Jun inhibited the activation of AP-1 and the induction of apoptosis by bufalin. Expression of a constitutively active mutant form of MAPK kinase-1 induced the activation of AP-1 and subsequent apoptosis in U937 cells. These results suggest that the activation of AP-1 via a MAPK cascade that includes JNK is required for the induction of apoptosis by bufalin in U937 cells.","['Watabe, M', 'Ito, K', 'Masuda, Y', 'Nakajo, S', 'Nakaya, K']","['Watabe M', 'Ito K', 'Masuda Y', 'Nakajo S', 'Nakaya K']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'U549S98QLW (bufalin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bufanolides/*pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/06 00:00,1998/03/06 00:01,['1998/03/06 00:00'],"['1998/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201592 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Feb 12;16(6):779-87. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201592.,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Female C57BL/6 mice at 12 weeks after inoculation with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus as well as age-matched control animals were dosed subcutaneously with 25 mg/kg of AZT twice a day for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8-wk treatment (20 weeks post inoculation), each animal received a final AZT dosing solution containing [3H]-AZT with a specific activity of 87 mCi/mmol. The levels of AZT and its phosphorylated metabolites were determined in tissues collected at different times after the last AZT administration using an analytical method coupling an ion-pair HPLC separation procedure with radioactivity detection following the separation. RESULTS: The tissue-to-plasma (T/P) AZT ratios in control mice could be ranked in the following order: kidneys > muscle approximately equal to spleen approximately equal to liver approximately equal to heart > lung approximately equal to thymus > lymph nodes >> brain. The distributions of AZT into lymph nodes, lung, and thymus tissues in infected mice increased significantly in comparison with those of control animals. Tissue AZT 5'-monophosphate (AZT-MP) profiles tended to parallel the AZT profiles in most tissues examined. Delays in the appearance of AZT 5'-diphosphate (AZT-DP) and AZT-TP were observed in all tissues tested. The conversion of AZT to AZT metabolites was found to be highest in the spleen and bone marrow samples from both control and infected animals. AZT-TP content was not detectable in any of the brain samples analyzed. The lymph nodes of the control animals showed poor ability to phosphorylate AZT to its active triphosphate moiety. This ability was significantly enhanced in infected animals. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing these findings with those of our previous study performed following a single dose administration of AZT, the chronic AZT regimen had minimal effect on the in vivo tissue disposition of the phosphorylated AZT metabolites. The therapeutic implications of inadequate maintenance of the level of active AZT metabolite in the lymph nodes and the brain following chronic AZT treatment need to be further explored.","['Chow, H H', 'Brookshier, G', 'Li, P']","['Chow HH', 'Brookshier G', 'Li P']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721, USA. chow@pharmacy.arizona.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retroviridae', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*metabolism', 'Zidovudine/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics']",1998/03/06 00:00,1998/03/06 00:01,['1998/03/06 00:00'],"['1998/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1011925525861 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Res. 1998 Jan;15(1):139-44. doi: 10.1023/a:1011925525861.,,,,,,,,,,
9487378,NLM,MEDLINE,19980317,20171213,0300-8916 (Print) 0300-8916 (Linking),83,4 Suppl 2,1997 Jul-Aug,"[Erythropoietin: biochemical characteristics, biologic effects, indications and results of use in hematology].",S3-15,"This review has two objects: a brief recapitulation of the biological background of erythropoietin (EPO), and a review of its clinical utilization in hematology. EPO, both in its naturally occurring and recombinant form (rH-EPO), is a single chain glycoprotein with an approximate molecular weight of 30.000 to 34.000 kD. Its heavy glycosilation is essential for its activity in vivo, since asialoEPO is readily cleared by the heptic asialoglycoprotein receptor. This impedes the recombinant molecule's synthesis in biologic cultures other than mammalian cells (Chinese hamster's ovary cells), and inevitably increases costs. If in vitro glycosilation of E. coli-derived rH-EPO could be achieved, the clinical utilization of the product would be considerably enhanced, most especially when very high doses are necessary, as discussed later. There is no antigenic diversity between natural and recombinant EPO, so that out of the enormous clinical experience only one single case of immunization has been recorded. Almost paradoxically there are however three published cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) caused by immunization against autologous EPO. It is now established that in adults EPO is synthetized in renal peritubular interstitial cells, although some residual activity remains in the liver. Hypoxia results in a rapid induction of EPO expression, although the role of the oxygen sensor system is still debated. Cellular targets are notoriously erythroid progenitors and precursors (BFU-E, CFU-E, early and intermediate erythroblasts). The global erythropoietic activity resulted in various effects (proliferation, differentiation, survival), but most probably each single effect is integrated with and complementary of the others. The utilization of rH-EPO in hematologic diseases came much later than its dramatic success in renal anemia. A variety of tools useful for assessing the possible beneficial effects of rH-EPO in clinical hematology has been proposed, among which a low level of endogenous EPO is a good predictor for therapeutic success. 'Hemopathic' anemia can be subdivided into three categories: patients with normal erythropoiesis due to inadequate EPO production (anemia of prematurity), patients with depressed but nonclonal erythropoiesis (chemotherapy, lymphoid malignancies such as multiple myeloma-MM and chronic lymphatic leukemia-CCL) and patients with at least partially clonal anemia, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), hemoglobinopaties, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and others. Results in the first category of patients are, as expected, prompt and satisfactory with physiologic doses. Although therapeutic strategy for MM is moving fast to curative intents, the utilization of rH-EPO is indicated for the control of anemia in conservatively-treated patients. In the third category the most important and controversial area is MDS. Significant erythropoietic results are generally obtained in about 20% of patients; however, the association with G-CSF has considerably enhanced the response rate. In the field of bone marrow transplantation there is an inadequate production of endogenous EPO in the allogeneic setting, and randomized studies have shown the benefits of rH-EPO in this situation. However, the most important results have been obtained in post-major-ABO incompatible PRCA, when the removal of the recipient's isohemagglutinins does not resolve the anemia. High and very high doses of rH-EPO (even over 500 UI/kg/day for 2-4 weeks) may resolve this occasionally quite refractory condition. Although extremely expensive, this treatment may be life-saving when an otherwise successful allogeneic transplant is at the risk of failure because of this relatively uncommon but severe immunohematologic complication.","['Marmont, A M']",['Marmont AM'],"['II Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Erythropoietin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/physiology/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1997/07/01 00:00,1998/03/06 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1997 Jul-Aug;83(4 Suppl 2):S3-15.,,,146,"Eritropoietina: profilo biochimico, ricordi biologici, indicazioni e risultati terapeutici in ematologia.",,,,,,

Results and prognostic factors in 326 consecutive patients.,92-104,"AIM: In order to assess the influence of total-body irradiation (TBI) on the outcome and incidence of complication after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we retrospectively analyzed our patients treated for acute leukemia and conditioned with TBI prior to BMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1980 and 1993, 326 patients referred to our department with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL, n = 182) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 144) in complete remission underwent TBI either in single dose (190 patients: 10 Gy administered to the midplane, and 8 Gy to the lungs [STBI]) or in 6 fractions (136 patients: 12 Gy on 3 consecutive days, and 9 Gy to the lungs [FTBI]) before BMT. The male-to-female ratio was 204/122 (1.67), and the median age was 30 years (mean: 30 +/- 11, range: 3 to 63). The patients were analyzed according to 3 instantaneous dose rate groups: 118 patients in the LOW group (< or = 0.048 Gy/min), 188 in the MEDIUM group (> 0.048 and < or = 0.09 Gy/min), and 20 in the HIGH group (> 0.09 cGy/min). Conditioning chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) alone in 250 patients, CY and other drugs in 54, and 22 patients were conditioned using combinations without CY. Following TBI, allogeneic and autologous BMT were realized respectively in 118 and 208 patients. Median follow-up period was 68 months (mean: 67 +/- 29, range: 24 to 130 months). RESULTS: Five-year survival, LFS, RI and TRM rates were 42%, 40%, 47%, and 24%, respectively. Five-year LFS was 36% in the STBI and 45% in the FTBI group (p = 0.17). It was 36% in the LOW group, 42% in the MEDIUM group, and 30% in the HIGH group (p > 0.05). Five-year RI was 50% in STBI, 43% in FTBI, 55% in LOW, 41% in MEDIUM, and 44% in HIGH groups (STBI vs. FTBI, p = 0.48; LOW vs. MEDIUM, p = 0.03; MEDIUM vs. HIGH, p = 0.68). TRM was not influenced significantly by the different TBI techniques. When analyzing separately the influence of fractionation and the instantaneous dose rate either in ANLL or ALL patients, no difference in terms of survival and LFS was observed. Fractionation did not influence the 5-year RI both in ANLL and ALL patients. However, among the patients with ANLL, 5-year RI was significantly higher (58%) in the LOW group than the MEDIUM group (31%, p = 0.001), whereas instantaneous dose rate did not significantly influence the RI in ALL patients. The 5-year TRM rate was significantly higher in allogeneic BMT group both in ANLL (37%) and ALL (37%) patients than those treated by autologous BMT (ANLL: 15%, ALL: 18%; p = 0.002 and 0.02, respectively). The 5-year estimated interstitial pneumonitis (IP) and cataract incidence rates were 22% and 19%, respectively, in all patients. IP incidence seemed to be higher in the HIGH group (46%) than the MEDIUM (19%, p = 0.05) or LOW (25%, p = 0.15) groups. Furthermore, cataract incidence was significantly influenced by fractionation (STBI vs. FTBI, 29% vs. 9%; p = 0.003) and instantaneous dose rate (LOW vs. MEDIUM vs. HIGH, 0% vs. 27% vs. 33%; p < 0.0001). Multivariate analyses revealed that the best factors influencing the survival were 1st CR (p = 0.0007), age < or = 40 years (p = 0.003), and BMT after 1985 (p = 0.008). The RI was influenced independently only by the remission status (p = 0.0002). On the other hand, the TRM rate was lower in patients who did not experience graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD, p < 0.0001), and in those treated after 1985 (p = 0.0005). GvHD was the only independent factor involved in the development of IP (p = 0.01). When considering the cataract incidence, the only independent factor was the instantaneous dose rate (p = 0.0008). CONCLUSION: The outcome of BMT patients conditioned with TBI for acute leukemia was not significantly influenced by the TBI technique, and TRM seemed to be lower in patients treated after 1985. On the other hand, cataract incidence was significantly influenced by the instantaneous dose rate.","['Belkacemi, Y', 'Pene, F', 'Touboul, E', 'Rio, B', 'Leblond, V', 'Gorin, N C', 'Laugier, A', 'Gemici, C', 'Housset, M', 'Ozsahin, M']","['Belkacemi Y', 'Pene F', 'Touboul E', 'Rio B', 'Leblond V', 'Gorin NC', 'Laugier A', 'Gemici C', 'Housset M', 'Ozsahin M']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Hopital Tenon, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Using an albumin back-exchange method, we measured the rates of binding and internalization of [3H]methyl-PAF by HL-60 and K562 cells. We found that methyl-PAF associated very rapidly and to similar extents with the two types of cells at low concentrations of extracellular bovine serum albumin, but that when bound to the cell surface, it was internalized into HL-60 cells faster than into K562 cells. The internalization of methyl-PAF by HL-60 cells was concentration-independent, intracellular ATP-independent and susceptible to thiol group-modifying reagents and cytochalasin B. Thus the inward transbilayer movement of methyl-PAF seems to occur by cytochalasin B-sensitive protein-mediated mechanism based on passive diffusion not requiring energy, in which SH-groups of protein play a critical role. We also found that the internalization of 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(4,4-difluoro-5,7- dimethyl-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Bodipy-C5-PC), whose structure resembles that of methyl-PAF, into HL-60 cells was faster than that into K562 cells. Using a combination of an albumin back-exchange method and observation by confocal laser scanning microscopy, we next examined the intracellular distribution of this fluorescent phospholipid probe after its internalization. Intracellular membranes, especially those peripheral to nuclei, were fluorescence-labeled in both HL-60 and K562 cells, but fluorescence of the nuclear membranes was weak, suggesting that this probe seems mainly to accumulate in intracellular granules, and may interact directly with several key enzymes for phospholipid metabolism, leading to cell injury. Because the difference between the internalization rates of methyl-PAF in HL-60 and K562 cells was correlated with their different susceptibilities to the cytotoxic effect of methyl-PAF, we suggest that the capacities for uptake of methyl-PAF and its accumulation in intracellular membranes are critical factor for its induction of apoptosis.

Using replication defective adenovirus encoding mouse CD154 (Ad-CD154), we modified human chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells to express a functional ligand for CD40. This not only induces expression of immune accessory molecules on the infected cell, but also allows it to trans-activate noninfected bystander leukemia B cells. Also, factors that impair the antigen-presenting capacity of leukemia B cells are downmodulated. Ad-CD154- infected leukemia cells are highly effective stimulators in mixed lymphocyte reactions and can induce generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for autologous nonmodified leukemia cells. As such, Ad-CD154 can induce a host antileukemia response that may have therapeutic potential.","['Kato, K', 'Cantwell, M J', 'Sharma, S', 'Kipps, T J']","['Kato K', 'Cantwell MJ', 'Sharma S', 'Kipps TJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and the UCSD Human Gene Therapy Program, UCSD School of Medicine, La Jolla, California 92093-0663, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Antigen Presentation/genetics', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Active/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI1472 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1998 Mar 1;101(5):1133-41. doi: 10.1172/JCI1472.,"['CA66000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-CA49870RO1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC508665,,,

Blood samples were taken from the start of therapy until day 22. Percentages of HCL cells, T cells, B cells, and NK cells were measured with PE-labeled monoclonal antibodies by flow cytometry (FCM). The absolute lymphocyte count dropped rapidly to almost zero in both patients within 7 days. The disappearance rate of lymphocyte subfractions did not show a specific pattern. The percentage of apoptosis in lymphocyte subfractions was measured in freshly prepared cell samples by FCM with FITC-labeled Annexin V in the propidium iodide-negative (non-necrotic) cell fraction. Percentages of PS-positive cells increased gradually till a nadir of Annexin V positivity was reached at 14 and 16 days. Because during the first week the absolute cell counts became almost zero, the absolute numbers of PS-positive cells were still extremely low, i.e., less than 0.1x10(9)/l. Nevertheless, we observed apoptotic cells in circulation after 2-CdA therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of apoptosis ex vivo in circulating blood cells after cytotoxic therapy.","['Idink-Mecking, C A', 'Richel, D J', 'Vermes, I', 'Schaafsma, M R', 'Reutelingsperger, C', 'Haanen, C']","['Idink-Mecking CA', 'Richel DJ', 'Vermes I', 'Schaafsma MR', 'Reutelingsperger C', 'Haanen C']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Medical Spectrum Twente, Hospital Group Enschede, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/analysis', '*Apoptosis', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry/drug effects/*pathology', 'Recurrence']",1998/03/05 00:00,1998/03/05 00:01,['1998/03/05 00:00'],"['1998/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050356 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1998 Jan;76(1):25-9. doi: 10.1007/s002770050356.,,,,,,,,,,

In adults, results yielded by 2-CdA alone or with ara-C were less encouraging. Here we report on the efficacy of 2-CdA with or without daunorubicin (DNR) in 19 relapsing or refractory adult AML patients, with a median age of 57 years. 2-CdA was administered as a continuous infusion to all patients at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg per day for 7 days. For 14 patients, DNR was added at a dose of 50 mg/m2 per day on days 5, 6, and 7. Antileukemic activity was observed in all the patients, but no single complete remission was achieved. One patient had a long-lasting partial response (response rate=5%). The remaining patients died of progressive AML (n=7), uncontrollable infection with persistent disease (n=10), and cerebral hemorrhage (n=1). Median survival from start of 2-CdA therapy was 56 days. Long-lasting neutropenia and transfusion-dependent thrombopenia were encountered in all 16 evaluable patients. Grade 4 hepatic toxicity occurred in one patient. Other side effects included nausea in six, mucositis in three, and mental disturbances in three patients. Compared with 2-CdA alone, the addition of DNR to 2-CdA changed neither the response rate nor the toxicities.

Seventy-seven cases (49 AML, 28 ALL) were studied prospectively for the presence of intraretinal hemorrhages (IRH), white-centered hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and macular hemorrhages. They were treated according to standard chemotherapy protocols, and then achievement of complete remission (CR) and the duration of overall survival (OS) were compared between the groups with and without these different retinal features. No association was found between the presence of any retinal abnormality and CR induction rate, although there was a trend to a lower CR rate among patients with IRH. The median OS of those with IRH was 72 days, compared with 345 days among those without IRH (p=0.002). A WBC at presentation greater than 50x10(9)/l and age greater than 40 years were also associated with shorter OS (p<0.0001 and p=0.0045, respectively).

As part of an age-matched, case-control study of childhood ALL in the United States, we investigated the association between the incidence of ALL in children under age 15 years and indoor radon exposure. METHODS: Radon detectors were placed in current and previous homes of subjects where they resided for 6 months or longer. Children were included in analyses if radon measurements covered 70% or more of the 5-year period prior to diagnosis for case subjects (or from birth for case subjects under age 5 years) and the corresponding reference dates for control subjects. Radon levels could be estimated for 97% of the exposure period for the eligible 505 case subjects and 443 control subjects. RESULTS: Mean radon concentration was lower for case subjects (65.4 becquerels per cubic meter [Bqm(-3)]) than for control subjects (79.1 Bqm(-3)). For categories less than 37, 37-73, 74-147, and 148 or more Bqm(-3) of radon exposure, relative risks based on matched case-control pairs were 1.00, 1.22, 0.82, and 1.02, respectively, and were similar to results from an unmatched analysis. There was no association between ALL and radon exposure within subgroups defined by categories of age, income, birth order, birth weight, sex, type of residence, magnetic field exposure, parental age at the subject's birth, parental occupation, or parental smoking habits. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to prior ecologic studies, the results from this analytic study provide no evidence for an association between indoor radon exposure and childhood ALL.","['Lubin, J H', 'Linet, M S', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Buckley, J', 'Conrath, S M', 'Hatch, E E', 'Kleinerman, R A', 'Tarone, R E', 'Wacholder, S', 'Robison, L L']","['Lubin JH', 'Linet MS', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Buckley J', 'Conrath SM', 'Hatch EE', 'Kleinerman RA', 'Tarone RE', 'Wacholder S', 'Robison LL']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['Carcinogens, Environmental/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Radon/*adverse effects', 'Risk']",1998/03/05 03:04,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/03/05 03:04'],"['1998/03/05 03:04 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/03/05 03:04 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/90.4.294 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998 Feb 18;90(4):294-300. doi: 10.1093/jnci/90.4.294.,"['CA02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20320/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

These proteins retain the RARalpha DNA- and retinoic acid (RA)-binding domains, and their ability to block haematopoietic differentiation depends on the RARalpha DNA-binding domain. Thus RA-target genes are downstream effectors. However, treatment with RA induces differentiation of leukaemic blast cells and disease remission in PML-RARalpha APLs, whereas PLZF-RARa APLs are resistant to RA. Transcriptional regulation by RARs involves modifications of chromatin by histone deacetylases, which are recruited to RA-target genes by nuclear co-repressors. Here we show that both PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha fusion proteins recruit the nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR)-histone deacetylase complex through the RARalpha CoR box. PLZF-RARalpha contains a second, RA-resistant binding site in the PLZF amino-terminal region. High doses of RA release histone deacetylase activity from PML-RARalpha, but not from PLZF-RARalpha. Mutation of the N-CoR binding site abolishes the ability of PML-RARalpha to block differentiation, whereas inhibition of histone deacetylase activity switches the transcriptional and biological effects of PLZF-RARalpha from being an inhibitor to an activator of the RA signalling pathway. Therefore, recruitment of histone deacetylase is crucial to the transforming potential of APL fusion proteins, and the different effects of RA on the stability of the PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha co-repressor complexes determines the differential response of APLs to RA.","['Grignani, F', 'De Matteis, S', 'Nervi, C', 'Tomassoni, L', 'Gelmetti, V', 'Cioce, M', 'Fanelli, M', 'Ruthardt, M', 'Ferrara, F F', 'Zamir, I', 'Seiser, C', 'Grignani, F', 'Lazar, M A', 'Minucci, S', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Grignani F', 'De Matteis S', 'Nervi C', 'Tomassoni L', 'Gelmetti V', 'Cioce M', 'Fanelli M', 'Ruthardt M', 'Ferrara FF', 'Zamir I', 'Seiser C', 'Grignani F', 'Lazar MA', 'Minucci S', 'Pelicci PG']","['Istituto di Medicina Interna e Scienze Oncologiche, Perugia University, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/*physiology', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/03/05 03:03,2001/03/23 10:01,['1998/03/05 03:03'],"['1998/03/05 03:03 [pubmed]', '2001/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '1998/03/05 03:03 [entrez]']",['10.1038/35901 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1998 Feb 19;391(6669):815-8. doi: 10.1038/35901.,,,,,,,,,,

Mutant forms of RARalpha, created by chromosomal translocations with either the PML (for promyelocytic leukaemia) or the PLZF (for promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger) locus, are oncogenic and result in human acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). PML-RARalpha APL patients achieve complete remission following treatments with pharmacological doses of retinoic acids (RA); in contrast, PLZF-RARalpha patients respond very poorly, if at all. Here we report that the association of these two chimaeric receptors with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex helps to determine both the development of APL and the ability of patients to respond to retinoids. Consistent with these observations, inhibitors of histone deacetylase dramatically potentiate retinoid-induced differentiation of RA-sensitive, and restore retinoid responses of RA-resistant, APL cell lines. Our findings suggest that oncogenic RARs mediate leukaemogenesis through aberrant chromatin acetylation, and that pharmacological manipulation of nuclear receptor co-factors may be a useful approach in the treatment of human disease.","['Lin, R J', 'Nagy, L', 'Inoue, S', 'Shao, W', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Evans, R M']","['Lin RJ', 'Nagy L', 'Inoue S', 'Shao W', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Evans RM']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (SIN3 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/03/05 03:03,2001/03/23 10:01,['1998/03/05 03:03'],"['1998/03/05 03:03 [pubmed]', '2001/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '1998/03/05 03:03 [entrez]']",['10.1038/35895 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1998 Feb 19;391(6669):811-4. doi: 10.1038/35895.,,,,,,,,,,

The two patients achieving CR have remained in CR for 46 and 38 months, respectively. Freedom from treatment failure at 24 months was 32%. Overall survival at 24 months was 59%. Three patients developed second malignancies: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome, and a cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorder. Fourteen patients have died after a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 3.9-49.2 months) due to progressive NHL (11 patients), infection (2 patients), and AML (1 patient). CONCLUSIONS: 2-CdA is an active agent for patients with previously treated, advanced, indolent NHL and may result in lasting remissions. Late complications following treatment may include delayed bacterial, fungal, or viral infection. Determination of whether the second malignancies that occurred in three patients reported herein were related to treatment with 2-CdA will require further study.","['Kong, L R', 'Huang, C F', 'Hakimian, D', 'Variakojis, D', 'Klein, L', 'Kuzel, T M', 'Gordon, L I', 'Zanzig, C', 'Wollins, E', 'Tallman, M S']","['Kong LR', 'Huang CF', 'Hakimian D', 'Variakojis D', 'Klein L', 'Kuzel TM', 'Gordon LI', 'Zanzig C', 'Wollins E', 'Tallman MS']","['Department of Medicine, Robert H.

One potential means of reducing this risk is to purge the autologous transplant in vitro by hyperthermia. We have demonstrated that after a hyperthermic treatment of 120 min at 43 degrees C, the leukemic progenitor cells (CFU-AML) are decreased by 5-log but the normal hematopoietic committed progenitor cells (CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-E) are reduced by only 1-log. Moreover, the hyperthermic sensitivity coincides with the stem cell hierarchy, ie CFU-GM are less heat sensitive than BFU-E, while CFU-E are the most sensitive. The impact of pretreatment with the tetrapeptide AcSDKP (Goralatide) on the proliferative activity and heat sensitivity of the normal and leukemic progenitor cells was determined. An incubation of 21 h at 37 degrees C with 10(-9) M Goralatide reduces the number of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells in S-phase and concomitantly decreases their hyperthermic sensitivity. This effect implies that the proliferative activity is the major determinant for the detected differences in hyperthermic sensitivity of the subsets in the normal hematopoietic stem cell compartment. In contrast, the cell cycle progression of leukemic progenitor cells is not affected and hence these cells are not protected from hyperthermia-induced cell killing after preincubation with Goralatide. Thus, the treatment with Goralatide increases the therapeutic window of hyperthermia and increases the potential value of this physical purging technique.","['Wierenga, P K', 'Brenner, M K', 'Konings, A W']","['Wierenga PK', 'Brenner MK', 'Konings AW']","['Department Radiobiology, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', 'H041538E9P (goralatide)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology']",1998/03/05 00:00,1998/03/05 00:01,['1998/03/05 00:00'],"['1998/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701045 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Jan;21(1):73-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701045.,,,,,,,,,,

This is one of the few occupational studies of primarily women (73 percent) exposed to radiation during their employment. More than 2.8 million person-years of follow-up were accrued through 1990, and 7,345 deaths were identified. A strong healthy-worker effect was observed (standardized mortality ratios [SMR] for all causes and all cancers were 0.69 and 0.79, respectively). Lung cancer (429 deaths) was not increased with available measures of radiation exposure and no significant associations were observed for acute, myelogenous, and monocytic leukemia (74 deaths). Relative to the general population, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for female breast cancer was 0.99 (based on 425 deaths); however, breast cancer was significantly elevated relative to all other cancers in a test of homogeneity of SMRs (ratio of SMRs = 1.3, P < 0.0001). Significant risks were correlated with employment before 1940 (SMR = 1.5; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-1.9), when radiation doses were likely highest, and among women certified for more than 30 years (SMR = 1.4, CI = 1.2-1.7) for whom the cumulative exposure was likely greatest. Using an internal referent group, risk increased with duration of certification among the 1,890 women certified before 1940 (P-trend < 0.001). While the findings for breast cancer are consistent with a radiation effect, possible misclassification in exposure (based on number of years certified) and potential confounding associated with reproductive histories preclude a causal conclusion.","['Doody, M M', 'Mandel, J S', 'Lubin, J H', 'Boice, J D Jr']","['Doody MM', 'Mandel JS', 'Lubin JH', 'Boice JD Jr']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Allied Health Personnel', 'Breast Neoplasms/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', '*Radiation, Ionizing', '*Radiology', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Workforce']",1998/03/05 03:03,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/03/05 03:03'],"['1998/03/05 03:03 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/03/05 03:03 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1008801404245 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1998 Jan;9(1):67-75. doi: 10.1023/a:1008801404245.,"['N01-CP-21015/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-61006/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-81058/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Our data show that in patients with RA, CD57+ T cell levels are elevated in peripheral blood, knee joint fluid, knee synovial membrane and bone marrow (BM), compared with peripheral blood of controls. CD57+ T cells are especially high in knee joint fluid and joint-adjacent BM, while CD56+ T cells show no such increase. CD57+ T cells contain a major population of CD8+ cells and higher proportions of CD4-8- cells and gammadelta T cells than do CD57- T cells. CD57+ T cells in peripheral blood and joint fluid increase with the duration of disease. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is inversely correlated with the proportion of CD57+ T cells in the joint fluid. Although RA frequently occurs in patients with CD3+57+ cell leukaemia, and some CD57+ T cells are likely to be involved in the onset of RA, we suggest that CD57+ T cells may rather suppress inflammation of RA, and other cellular components (e.g. granulocytes) may govern the severity of the inflammation of RA.

These basic epidemiological data imply that virus-host interactions, especially immunogenetic factors, influence the outcome of infection. Several studies showed that the HLA class II DR1 DQ5 haplotype is over-represented in HAM/TSP, but rare in ATL. Therefore, we selected four patients with HAM/TSP and one seronegative control who all carried the HLA DR1 DQ5 haplotype. We analysed the CD4+ T lymphocyte response against eight synthetic peptides of HTLV-1 envelope (env) glycoprotein gp21, a crucial target antigen in HAM/TSP. The first of two immunodominant epitopes corresponded to a domain of the HTLV-1 envelope protein which had previously been shown to be essential for HTLV-1 envelope function. The second immunodominant epitope overlapped a highly conserved sequence of the retroviral transmembrane envelope protein. DR1 (DRB1*0101)-restricted T lymphocytes were activated by the conserved peptide sequence in nanomolar concentrations. In contrast, this conserved sequence can also induce non-specific, cAMP-mediated immunosuppressive effects on T cells when added in micromolar concentrations to culture media, as shown by Haraguchi S, Good RA, James-Yarish M, Cianciolo GJ, Day NK, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1995; 92:5568-71.

Immune phenotyping, in some patients followed by lymph node or bone marrow biopsy, showed a different diagnosis in 11 (5%) of 222 patients: prolymphocytic leukemia, four patients (three B-cell and one T-cell); morbus Waldenstrom, one patient; T-cell CLL, one patient; hairy cell leukemia, one patient; mycosis fungoides, one patient; mantle cell lymphoma, one patient; monocytoid B-cell lymphoma, one patient and immunoblastic lymphoma one patient. In eight of these 11 patients, the clinical features or morphology, or both, were atypical for CLL, but this was not recognized at the time of diagnosis.

Despite high levels of V(D)J recombination in two human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines, the cytogenetic karyotype has remained essentially constant over several years of continuous cell culture. Silencing of recombination of chromosomal and minichromosomal targets has been strongly correlated with the replication of CpG methylated DNA in murine cells.

Expression of B7 molecules by antigen-presenting cells (APC) provides co-stimulatory signals to T lymphocytes via CD28 and CTLA-4 which prevent the induction of alloantigen-specific tolerance. Conversely, expression of CD40 ligand by stimulated T cells activates APC via CD40. In human hematological B cell malignancies (follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia), the defect in alloantigen presentation of tumoral cells can be repaired by up-regulation of B7 and other co-stimulatory molecules via CD40. We studied the role of B7 molecules in alloimmune recognition and the various ways to improve the antitumoral response on peripheral blood leukemic cells from 20 patients with a diagnosis of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We focused on myelo/monocytic M4/M5 French-American-British classification subtypes which are considered as the neoplastic counterpart of normal monocytes, a prototypic APC. In one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction of CD4+ T cells against leukemic cells, differences in B7-1, B7-2 or CD40 expression by AML cells did not induce specific cytokine secretion; interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma were detected but not IL-4, corresponding to a Th1 pattern. Blockade experiments showed that proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion only partially depended on B7 molecules, which in contrast had a pivotal role in IL-2 synthesis. In contrast with murine models which suggest a pivotal role for CD80/B7-1 in the immune response against AML, our data support a greater role for CD86/B7-2, in line with the baseline expression of CD86/B7-2 and lack of CD80/B7-1 on most M4/M5 AML cells. AML cell stimulation via CD40: (1) significantly improved IL-2 secretion but not proliferation of responding T lymphocytes, (2) increased CD54/ICAM-1 expression in three quarters of cases, (3) failed in most cases to induce CD40-specific CD80/B7-1 up-regulation, and (4) had a weak effect on CD86/B7-2 expression. These data contrast with the very efficient up-regulation of both B7 co-stimulatory molecule expression and tumoral cell alloimmune recognition following CD40 stimulation in B cell malignancy models. The role of the defective B7 molecule up-regulation by the CD40 pathway in inefficient tumor immunogenicity of primary AML cells has to be further investigated, in particular using transfection experiments of CD80/B7-1-deficient AML cell lines. From our in vitro data we conclude that B7 molecules play an important role in the alloimmune surveillance of AML as suggested by the high B7 molecule dependency of IL-2 secretion. Nonetheless, the contribution of B7 molecules to alloimmune T cell proliferation against primary AML cells in human and the way to improve it--regulation via CD40 in particular--differ from B cell malignancies and murine models, suggesting the requirement for specific strategies in the development of antitumor immunity.","['Costello, R T', 'Mallet, F', 'Sainty, D', 'Maraninchi, D', 'Gastaut, J A', 'Olive, D']","['Costello RT', 'Mallet F', 'Sainty D', 'Maraninchi D', 'Gastaut JA', 'Olive D']","[""Unite d'Immunologie des Tumeurs, Universite de la Mediterranee, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'B7-1 Antigen/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'CD40 Antigens/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/04 03:05,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/03/04 03:05'],"['1998/03/04 03:05 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/03/04 03:05 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199801)28:01<90::AID-IMMU90>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199801)28:01<90::AID-IMMU90>3.0.CO;2-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1998 Jan;28(1):90-103. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199801)28:01<90::AID-IMMU90>3.0.CO;2-5.,,,,,,,,,,

CD95 plays a physiological role in the regulation of the immune response; furthermore, alterations in CD95/CD95L function may contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases and viral infections. Many cells that express CD95, however, are not susceptible to CD95-mediated apoptosis. It is therefore important to identify the mechanisms that counteract the CD95 apoptotic process that are still poorly understood. Growth factors and lymphokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 that counteract CD95-mediated apoptosis may activate phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). We therefore used two different approaches to investigate the role of PI 3-kinase on CD95-mediated apoptosis. First we tested the effect of two pharmacological PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, on CD95 agonistic antibody-induced apoptosis in three different cell lines. Second, we co-expressed in COS7 cells CD95 with constitutively active PI 3-kinase. Results of both approaches indicate that active PI 3-kinase effectively protects against CD95-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore we extended our studies on the CD95 downstream mediator, FADD, and on the PI 3-kinase downstream mediator, the serine/threonine protein kinase PKB, using the co-expression approach in COS7 cells. We provide evidence that apoptosis induced by triggering the CD95 cell death receptor is counteracted by PI 3-kinase activation; moreover, PKB but not p70S6K represents the relevant downstream target of PI 3-kinase signaling.","['Hausler, P', 'Papoff, G', 'Eramo, A', 'Reif, K', 'Cantrell, D A', 'Ruberti, G']","['Hausler P', 'Papoff G', 'Eramo A', 'Reif K', 'Cantrell DA', 'Ruberti G']","['Department of Immunobiology, Institute of Cell Biology, National Research Council, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Arabidopsis Proteins)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Faslg protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 1.14.19.- (Fatty Acid Desaturases)', 'EC 1.14.99.- (Fad7 protein, Arabidopsis)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', '*Arabidopsis Proteins', 'COS Cells', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Plant Proteins/*physiology', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Rats', 'Transfection', 'Wortmannin', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",1998/03/04 03:05,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/03/04 03:05'],"['1998/03/04 03:05 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/03/04 03:05 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199801)28:01<57::AID-IMMU57>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199801)28:01<57::AID-IMMU57>3.0.CO;2-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1998 Jan;28(1):57-69. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199801)28:01<57::AID-IMMU57>3.0.CO;2-8.,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for a double TCR heterodimer model.,12-21,"The TCR/CD3 complex is composed of six subunits which are expressed on the cell surface in a coordinate fashion after assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The TCR/CD3 complex is assembled after a series of pairwise interactions involving the formation of dimers of CD3 epsilon with either CD3 gamma or CD3 delta. These dimers assemble with TCR alpha and TCR beta chains, and finally, the CD3 zeta homodimer is added to allow export of the full complex from the ER. A model has been proposed suggesting that during assembly the CD3 epsilon/CD3 gamma dimer interacts exclusively with TCR beta and the CD3 epsilon/CD3 delta dimer with TCR alpha to form a complex with a single TCR alpha/beta heterodimer. We show in this study, by immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, that in the human T cell line Jurkat as well as in total human thymocytes, this preferential interaction does not occur and instead, the CD3 epsilon/CD3 gamma and CD3 epsilon/CD3 delta dimers associate with both TCR chains simultaneously and indistinctly. These data are confirmed by the analysis of the TCR alpha-negative T cell line MOLT-4 in which TCR beta is found separately associated with CD3 epsilon/CD3 gamma and with CD3 epsilon/CD3 delta dimers. Indirectly, our results support a model of stoichiometry in which two TCR alpha/beta heterodimers are present in a TCR/CD3 complex. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation with anti-CD3 gamma and anti-CD3 delta antibodies from 1% NP40 and 1% Brij96 cell lysates showed that these subunits form independent partial complexes which are cross-linked through the CD3 zeta homodimer. This suggests that CD3 zeta mediates the interaction between both TCR alpha/beta heterodimers contained in the double TCR complex. Further proof for this hypothesis is obtained after analysis of a Jurkat cell transfectant containing a point mutation in the transmembrane domain of TCR beta that impairs the association of CD3 zeta. In this mutant cell line, unlike a control line with wild-type TCR beta, the CD3 gamma- and CD3 delta-containing complexes were found completely independent. Altogether, these results support a model of TCR/CD3 assembly and stoichiometry in which two TCR-alpha/beta heterodimers form two hemicomplexes containing either CD3 epsilon/gamma or CD3 epsilon/delta dimers which become associated via the CD3 zeta homodimer.","['San Jose, E', 'Sahuquillo, A G', 'Bragado, R', 'Alarcon, B']","['San Jose E', 'Sahuquillo AG', 'Bragado R', 'Alarcon B']","['Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Dimerization', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/04 03:05,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/03/04 03:05'],"['1998/03/04 03:05 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/03/04 03:05 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199801)28:01<12::AID-IMMU12>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199801)28:01<12::AID-IMMU12>3.0.CO;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1998 Jan;28(1):12-21. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199801)28:01<12::AID-IMMU12>3.0.CO;2-9.,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we show that in a variety (n = 17) of tumor cell lines of different species (human and murine) and distinct histogenesis (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, adenocarcinoma, lung microcytoma, pituitary tumors, insulinoma beta-cells, and monoblastic leukemia), a novel K+ inward-rectifier current (IIR), which is biophysically and pharmacologically similar to IHERG, can be recorded with the patch-clamp technique. Northern blot experiments with a human herg cDNA probe revealed that both in human and murine clones the very high expression of herg transcripts can be quantified in at least three clearly identifiable bands, suggesting an alternative splicing of HERG mRNA. Moreover, we cloned a cDNA encoding for IIR from the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma. The sequence of this cDNA result was practically identical to that already reported for herg, indicating a high conservation of this gene in tumors. Consistently, the expression of this clone in Xenopus oocytes showed that the encoded K+ channel had substantially all of the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the native IIR described for tumor cells. In addition, in the tumor clones studied, IIR governs the resting potential, whereas it could not be detected either by the patch clamp or the Northern blot techniques in cells obtained from primary cell cultures of parental tissues (sensory neurons and myotubes), whose resting potential is controlled by the classical K+ anomalous rectifier current. This current substitution had a profound impact on the resting potential, which was markedly depolarized in tumors as compared with normal cells. These results suggest that IIR is normally only expressed during the early stages of cell differentiation frozen by neoplastic transformation, playing an important pathophysiological role in the regulatory mechanisms of neoplastic cell survival. In fact, because of its biophysical features, IIR, besides keeping the resting potential within the depolarized values required for unlimited tumor growth, could also appear suitable to afford a selective advantage in an ischemic environment.","['Bianchi, L', 'Wible, B', 'Arcangeli, A', 'Taglialatela, M', 'Morra, F', 'Castaldo, P', 'Crociani, O', 'Rosati, B', 'Faravelli, L', 'Olivotto, M', 'Wanke, E']","['Bianchi L', 'Wible B', 'Arcangeli A', 'Taglialatela M', 'Morra F', 'Castaldo P', 'Crociani O', 'Rosati B', 'Faravelli L', 'Olivotto M', 'Wanke E']","['Dipartimento di Fisiologia e Biochimica Generali, Universita delgi Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (ERG1 Potassium Channel)', '0 (Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels)', '0 (KCNH2 protein, human)', '0 (KCNH6 protein, human)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', '*Cation Transport Proteins', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'ERG1 Potassium Channel', 'Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscles/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics', 'Neurons/physiology', 'Potassium Channels/*genetics', '*Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/04 00:00,1998/03/04 00:01,['1998/03/04 00:00'],"['1998/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Feb 15;58(4):815-22.,['HL36930/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The PTD of ALL1 is identified in leukemic blasts at the genomic level by ALL1 rearrangement upon Southern analysis and by genomic fusion following DNA PCR. The genomic defect encodes for a unique fusion transcript that is readily detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). To determine if the ALL1 fusion transcript is specific for leukemic blasts or instead can be found with any frequency in normal cells, we analyzed 52 bone marrow and 8 peripheral blood samples from 60 normal donors by nested RT-PCR. Ten of 60 samples (16%; 7 bone marrow and 3 peripheral blood) contained a unique transcript showing a fusion of two ALL1 exons that was consistent with the PTD of ALL1. However, a corresponding genomic rearrangement or a unique genomic fusion of ALL1 could not be demonstrated by Southern analysis or DNA PCR, respectively. Marked differences were observed in the size and sequence of the ALL1 fusion transcripts detected in normal donors, compared to those detected in leukemic patients with a PTD of ALL1. Moreover, although the ALL1 fusion transcripts seen in AML always maintain the open reading frame, the open reading frame was preserved in only 5 of 10 fusion transcripts from normal donors. Finally, in contrast to leukemic blasts with the PTD of ALL1, the fusion transcripts in normal cells could not be detected in the poly(A)+ RNA fraction by RT-PCR. In summary, the origin and the composition of the ALL1 fusion transcripts found in normal cells appear to be distinct from those found in the leukemic cells. The data accumulated thus far suggest that the ALL1 fusion product detected in normal tissue results from the process of differential mRNA splicing rather than true ALL1 gene rearrangement. These findings also suggest caution in the use of RT-PCR for detection of minimal residual disease in AML patients with the PTD of ALL1.","['Marcucci, G', 'Strout, M P', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Caligiuri, M A']","['Marcucci G', 'Strout MP', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', '*Multigene Family', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA/analysis', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Transcription Factors']",1998/03/04 00:00,1998/03/04 00:01,['1998/03/04 00:00'],"['1998/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Feb 15;58(4):790-3.,['CA-09338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

U937 human leukemic cells treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3; 10(-8) M] become resistant to TNF, an effect that is independent of cell cycle status and expression of TNF receptors or BCL-2. In this study, TNF produced a dose- and time-dependent enhancement of [3H]arachidonic acid release in U937 cells. The amount of [3H]arachidonic acid release was positively associated with TNF-induced apoptosis. Both immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting of cell subcompartments demonstrated translocation of cPLA2 from the cytosol to the cell membrane in response to TNF. In addition, TNF up-regulated expression of cPLA2 mRNA. An antisense oligonucleotide to cPLA2 and the cPLA2 inhibitor 4-bromophenacyl bromide significantly inhibited TNF-induced cytotoxicity. Prior incubation of cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly inhibited (a) TNF-induced [3H]arachidonic acid release and apoptosis, (b) TNF-induced translocation of cPLA2 to the membrane, and (c) the up-regulation of cPLA2 mRNA with TNF. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 was not reversed by inhibitors of transcription or translation. The data suggest that activation of cPLA2 is involved in TNF-induced apoptosis of leukemic cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 directly inhibits cPLA2 translocation and mRNA up-regulation induced by TNF. Disruption of cPLA2 activation may represent a possible mechanism whereby leukemic cells can become resistant to TNF-mediated killing.","['Wu, Y L', 'Jiang, X R', 'Lillington, D M', 'Allen, P D', 'Newland, A C', 'Kelsey, S M']","['Wu YL', 'Jiang XR', 'Lillington DM', 'Allen PD', 'Newland AC', 'Kelsey SM']","[""Department of Hematology, St. Bartholomew's and The Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1998/03/04 00:00,1998/03/04 00:01,['1998/03/04 00:00'],"['1998/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Feb 15;58(4):633-40.,,,,,,,,,,

High expression of WT1 has been detected in a range of acute leukemias. To elucidate a role for WT1 in leukemogenesis, we transfected the monoblastic cell line U937, which lacks detectable levels of endogenous WT1, with two isoforms of WT1. We showed that, in contrast to U937 control cells, cells constitutively expressing either of the isoforms, WT1(-KTS) or WT1(+KTS), did not respond to differentiation induction by retinoic acid or vitamin D3, as judged by the capacity to reduce nitro blue tetrazolium and morphology. Although U937 cells expressing WT1 were hampered in their ability to differentiate on incubation with retinoic acid and vitamin D3, the induced G1/G0-accumulation was similar to differentiating control cells treated with inducers. Furthermore, distinct effects on the maturation process were indicated by downregulation of the myeloid cell surface makers CD13 and CD15, while the upregulation of CD14 and CD11c on WT1 transfected cells was similar to control cells upon incubation with retinoic acid and vitamin D3. Taken together our results demonstrate that a constitutive expression of WT1 in the leukemic cell line U937 leads to impairment of differentiation responses, indicating that a high expression of WT1 can contribute to the differentiation block of acute leukemia.","['Svedberg, H', 'Chylicki, K', 'Baldetorp, B', 'Rauscher, F J 3rd', 'Gullberg, U']","['Svedberg H', 'Chylicki K', 'Baldetorp B', 'Rauscher FJ 3rd', 'Gullberg U']","['Department of Hematology, University of Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1998/03/04 03:04,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/03/04 03:04'],"['1998/03/04 03:04 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/03/04 03:04 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201613 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Feb 19;16(7):925-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201613.,,,,,,,,,,

The steady-state level of nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA decreased during the RA-induced differentiation. There was also decrease in the level of total cellular nucleophosmin/B23 protein during the RA-induced differentiation. Stabilization and nuclear run-on assays indicate that the decrease in nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA in RA-treated HL-60 cells was transcriptionally regulated. Unlike c-myc mRNA, there was virtually no decline of nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA during the growth arrest by serum-starvation. The decrease in nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA expression in HL-60 cells subsequent to retinoic acid treatment can thus be attributed to cellular differentiation rather than the growth arrest induced by RA. Nucleophosmin/B23 antisense oligomer treatment significantly potentiated RA-induced cellular differentiation. Results of this study suggest that nucleophosmin/B23 is one of the key elements in the down-regulation of nucleolar function for cellular differentiation.","['Hsu, C Y', 'Yung, B Y']","['Hsu CY', 'Yung BY']","['Graduate Institute of Pharmacology, National Yang Ming University, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Thionucleotides', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1998/03/04 00:00,1998/03/04 00:01,['1998/03/04 00:00'],"['1998/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201615 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Feb 19;16(7):915-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201615.,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen SJL mice with well-developed tumors were killed at a median age of 56 weeks. Autopsy samples were taken from various enlarged lymphoid organs, and the histologic appearance of lymphomas was recorded. Using rearrangements of immunoglobulin genes (heavy and kappa-light chain genes) and integration patterns of murine leukemia virus as clonal markers, 7 of the 13 informative mice showed complete clonal identity among the different sites selected from each mouse; 5 of 13 mice demonstrated at least one shared clonal band with one or more markers being different among the different sites. The histologic appearance of the lymphomas from the various sites was found to be heterogeneous, even when there was clonal identity. These findings suggest that SJL lymphomas in multiple sites within one mouse are usually derived from a single clone but may show development of subclones within a major clonal population, thus supporting the notion that clonal evolution is a common event in the course of development of lymphoid neoplasia.","['Tang, J C', 'Ho, F C', 'Chan, A C', 'Srivastava, G']","['Tang JC', 'Ho FC', 'Chan AC', 'Srivastava G']","['Department of Pathology, University of Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genome, Viral', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1998/03/04 00:00,1998/03/04 00:01,['1998/03/04 00:00'],"['1998/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1998 Feb;78(2):205-12.,,,49,,,,,,,

Seven men and 10 women with LM (10 solid tumors, 6 lymphoma, 1 leukemia) received 12 mg methotrexate and 0.5 mCi 111In-DTPA by intra-Ommaya injection; images were obtained immediately and after 4, 24, and 48 hours. Ventricular and lumbar CSF methotrexate and radioactivity levels were measured 6 hours after injection. Thirteen patients had abnormal CSF flow studies, 9 with multiple sites of obstruction. CSF flow obstruction was observed at ventricular outlets in 13 patients, cerebral convexities in 9 and in the spine in 2. With one exception, all obstructions were explicable by tumor deposits on MRIs. For all patients, ventricular and lumbar methotrexate and radioactivity levels correlated closely. Three patients with a normal CSF flow study are alive at 15+, 7.5+, and 3.9+ months from treatment. Of 12 with abnormal CSF flow studies, 11 are dead a median of 2 months from diagnosis. Two patients had diffusely delayed flow studies and both developed methotrexate leukoencephalopathy. CSF flow studies using 111In-DTPA reliably predict distribution of intrathecal methotrexate. Abnormal flow studies correlate with structural abnormalities, are an unfavorable prognostic factor, and may predict intrathecal chemotherapy toxicity.","['Mason, W P', 'Yeh, S D', 'DeAngelis, L M']","['Mason WP', 'Yeh SD', 'DeAngelis LM']","['Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '7A314HQM0I (Pentetic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indium Radioisotopes/administration & dosage/*cerebrospinal fluid/pharmacokinetics', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*secondary', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentetic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/administration & dosage/*cerebrospinal fluid/pharmacokinetics']",1998/03/04 00:00,1998/03/04 00:01,['1998/03/04 00:00'],"['1998/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1212/wnl.50.2.438 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurology. 1998 Feb;50(2):438-44. doi: 10.1212/wnl.50.2.438.,,,,,,['Neurology. 1999 Jan 1;52(1):216-7.

However, with the exception of some T cell lines, IL-15 transcript expression has not been described in T cells. Herein we demonstrate that IL-15 mRNA can be detected in freshly isolated normal T cells and T cell lines. Furthermore, its expression is 3- to 4-fold higher in human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected T cells. By using reporter constructs bearing the 5' regulatory region of the IL-15 gene, we observed a positive correlation between HTLV-I Tax protein expression and IL-15 promoter activity in HTLV-I-infected T cells. Additionally, by using a Jurkat T cell transfectant that expresses Tax under an inducible promoter, we demonstrated that the expression of IL-15 mRNA increased 3-fold as Tax was expressed, suggesting that the Tax protein activates IL-15 transcription. An NF-kappaB consensus sequence is located at the -75 and -65 region of the IL-15 5' regulatory region. Mutations in the NF-kappaB motif or deletion of this sequence abrogated the promoter activity in both HTLV-I-positive and Jurkat Tax-transfectant cells. These data represent evidence for trans-activation of the IL-15 gene by the HTLV-I Tax protein through an NF-kappaB motif and suggest a potential role for IL-15 in HTLV-I-associated diseases such as adult T cell leukemia and HTLV-I-associated myopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis.","['Azimi, N', 'Brown, K', 'Bamford, R N', 'Tagaya, Y', 'Siebenlist, U', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Azimi N', 'Brown K', 'Bamford RN', 'Tagaya Y', 'Siebenlist U', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, Division of Clinical Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. nazli@helix.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.5.2452 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Mar 3;95(5):2452-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.5.2452.,,,,,,,PMC19372,['GENBANK/AF038164'],,

The partial tandem duplication of the ALL1 (MLL) gene is found in patients with AML and trisomy 11 as a sole cytogenetic abnormality and in 11% of patients with AML and normal cytogenetics. This defect results from the genomic fusion of ALL1 intron 6 or intron 8 to ALL1 intron 1. Here, we examined the DNA sequence at the genomic fusion in nine cases of AML with a tandem duplication of ALL1 spanning exons 2-6. Each breakpoint occurred within intron 6 of the ALL1 breakpoint cluster region and within a discrete 3.8-kb region near the 3' end of intron 1. In seven cases, a distinct point of fusion of intron 6 with intron 1 could not be identified. Instead, the sequence gradually diverged from an Alu element in intron 6 to an Alu element in intron 1 through a heteroduplex fusion. Thus, these rearrangements appear to be the result of a recombination event between homologous Alu sequences in introns 6 and 1. In two cases, the genomic junction was distinct and involved the fusion of a portion of an Alu element in intron 6 with non-Alu sequence in intron 1. These data support the hypothesis that a recombination event between homologous Alu sequences is responsible for the partial tandem duplication of ALL1 in the majority of AML cases with this genetic defect. Although Alu element-mediated homologous recombination events in germline cells are thought to be responsible for partial gene duplications or deletions in many inherited diseases, this appears to be the first demonstration identifying Alu element-mediated recombination as a consistent mechanism for gene rearrangement in somatic tissue.","['Strout, M P', 'Marcucci, G', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Caligiuri, M A']","['Strout MP', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, 320 West 10th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription Factors', 'Zinc Fingers']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.5.2390 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Mar 3;95(5):2390-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.5.2390.,"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC19353,,,

However, little is known about the genes controlling gamete formation during the early stages of PGC development. Although several mutations are known to severely reduce the number of PGCs reaching and populating the genital ridges, the molecular identity of only two of these genes is known: the c-kit receptor protein tyrosine kinase and the c-kit ligand (the steel factor). Herein, we report that mutant mice lacking TIAR, an RNA recognition motif/ribonucleoprotein-type RNA-binding protein highly expressed in PGCs, fail to develop spermatogonia or oogonia. This developmental defect is a consequence of reduced survival of PGCs that migrate to the genital ridge around embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5). The numbers of PGCs populating the genital ridge in TIAR-deficient embryos are severely reduced compared to wild-type embryos by E11.5 and in the mutants PGCs are completely absent at E13.5. Furthermore, TIAR-deficient embryonic stem cells do not proliferate in the absence of exogenous leukemia inhibitory factor in an in vitro methylcellulose culture assay, supporting a role for TIAR in regulating cell proliferation. Because the development of PGCs relies on the action of several growth factors, these results are consistent with a role for TIAR in the expression of a survival factor or survival factor receptor that is essential for PGC development. TIAR-deficient mice thus provide a model system to study molecular mechanisms of PGC development and possibly the basis for some forms of idiopathic infertility.","['Beck, A R', 'Miller, I J', 'Anderson, P', 'Streuli, M']","['Beck AR', 'Miller IJ', 'Anderson P', 'Streuli M']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tial1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Germ Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Ovary/embryology/growth & development', 'Ovum/cytology/*physiology', 'Pseudopregnancy', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Testis/cytology/embryology/growth & development/*physiology']",1998/04/16 00:00,1998/04/16 00:01,['1998/04/16 00:00'],"['1998/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.5.2331 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Mar 3;95(5):2331-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.5.2331.,,,,,,,PMC19335,,,

GATA-1 participates in the transcription of virtually all erythroid-specific genes, blocks apoptosis of precursor cells, and controls the balance between proliferation and cell cycle arrest. Prior studies suggest that the function of GATA-1 is mediated in part through association with transcriptional cofactors. CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its close relative p300 serve as coactivators for a variety of transcription factors involved in growth control and differentiation. We report here that CBP markedly stimulates GATA-1's transcriptional activity in transient transfection experiments in nonhematopoietic cells. GATA-1 and CBP also coimmunoprecipitate from nuclear extracts of erythroid cells. Interaction mapping pinpoints contact sites to the zinc finger region of GATA-1 and to the E1A-binding region of CBP. Expression of a conditional form of adenovirus E1A in murine erythroleukemia cells blocks differentiation and expression of endogenous GATA-1 target genes, whereas mutant forms of E1A unable to bind CBP/p300 have no effect.

The Prep1-Pbx protein-protein interaction is essential for DNA-binding activity. Prep1-Pbx complexes are present in early mouse embryos at a time when Pbx is also interacting with Hox proteins. The use of different interaction surfaces could allow Pbx to interact with Prep1 and Hox proteins simultaneously. Indeed, we observe the formation of a ternary Prep1-Pbx1-HOXB1 complex on a HOXB1-responsive target in vitro. Interaction with Prep1 enhances the ability of the HOXB1-Pbx1 complex to activate transcription in a cooperative fashion from the same target.

In this paper we report the cloning of the cDNA of one of the subunits which encodes for a novel human homeodomain protein, which we have termed Prep1. The Prep1 homeodomain belongs to the TALE class of homeodomains, is most closely related to those of the TGIF and Meis1 proteins, and like these, recognizes a TGACAG motif. We further identify the other UEF3 subunit as a member of the Pbx protein family. Unlike other proteins known to interact with Pbx, Prep1 forms a stable complex with Pbx independent of DNA binding. Heterodimerization of Prep1 and Pbx results in a strong DNA binding affinity towards the TGACAG target site of the uPA promoter.

We describe experiments that define patterns of complementation between human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) Vif proteins and address the determinants that underlie functional specificity. Using human cells as virus producers, it was found that the HIV-1 Vif protein could modulate the infectivity of HIV-1 itself, HIV-2 and SIV isolated from African green monkeys (SIVAGM). In contrast, the Vif proteins of SIVAGM and SIV isolated from Sykes' monkeys (SIVSYK) were inactive for all HIV and SIV substrates in human cells even though, at least for the SIVAGM protein, robust activity could be demonstrated in cognate African green monkey cells. These observations suggest that species-specific interactions between Vif and virus-producing cells, as opposed to between Vif and virus components, may govern the functional consequences of Vif expression in terms of inducing virion infectivity. The finding that the replication of murine leukemia virus could also be stimulated by HIV-1 Vif expression in human cells further supported this notion.

As originally described, the term Richter's syndrome (RS) refers to the development of aggressive NHL during the course of CLL. The onset of RS is usually abrupt with clinical deterioration as manifested by worsening systemic symptoms, rapid tumor growth, and/or extranodal involvement. Diagnosis requires tissue biopsy. The NHL is usually diffuse large cell (LCL) or its immunoblastic variant. It is resistant to current therapies, and the median survival of patients who develop RS is approximately 6 months. The precise relationship between the cells of origin of CLL and LCL in RS patients is unknown with data suggesting either common (60%) or distinct (40%) clonal evolutions for these malignancies in different patients. Gene rearrangement studies and isotype analysis suggest that CLL and LCL in RS patients frequently share identical clonal origins. Purine analog therapy of CLL patients does not seem to affect the incidence or clinical behavior of RS. Despite increasing rates of achievement of complete remission in CLL associated with fludarabine-based regimens, RS still occurs, warranting continued surveillance of all CLL patients regardless of disease status.

AIHA occurs in 11% of advanced stage CLL patients. Prednisone is the first treatment of choice, with 90% responses and 65% complete responses. More than 60% of patients relapse when treatment is stopped. Intravenous immunoglobulin, the next line of treatment, causes responses in 40% of patients. While the data are very limited, cyclosporine A is a reasonable choice for third-line therapy. Alkylating agents, danazol, plasma exchange, immunoabsorption, vincristine-loaded platelets, splenectomy, and splenic irradiation are also reported to cause responses. The data on mechanisms of AIHA are most consistent with immune dysregulation leading to loss of tolerance to a self antigen which in turn leads to the immune-based hemolytic anemia. PRCA is underrecognized in CLL with 6% of CLL patients having PRCA when tested for it. Unlike AIHA, PRCA often occurs in early stage disease. Anemia, reticulocytopenia, and a marrow virtually devoid of red blood cell precursors are hallmarks of PRCA. Corticosteroid therapy is the first line of treatment. If a response is not obtained in 4 weeks, cyclosporine A should be added. Although the data on pathophysiology are very limited, PRCA appears to be the result of an abnormal T cell that both fails in its normal function to support growth and inhibits the growth of erythroid progenitor cells. ITP occurs in 2-3% of CLL patients, occurs in early stage disease and may be a presenting manifestation. Initial therapy for ITP mirrors the guidelines for primary ITP. Initial therapy should consist of prednisone. Seventy percent of patients respond. Splenectomy is a reasonable second-line treatment. Autoimmune phenomena, largely related to blood cells, are based in the immune dysregulation of CLL.

This autoreactive repertoire secretes the so-called natural autoantibodies characterized by their broad reactivity mainly directed against well-conserved public epitopes. Their germinal origin is suggested by their early appearance during ontogeny, their expression of cross-reactive idiotopes, and structural studies of their sequence. As for the physiological role of the repertoire, it may play a major role as a first barrier of defense. It is presently unknown whether these polyreactive B cells could constitute a pre-immune template which, through an antigen-driven process, may be involved in the production of immune high-affinity antibodies. This autoreactive B cell repertoire frequently undergoes malignant transformation, although there is controversy concerning the reasons accounting for this. It has been postulated that the continuous challenge of this autoreactive repertoire by self-antigens could create propitious conditions for malignant transformation to occur. However, this hypothesis still needs to be substantiated. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most frequent form of leukemia in western countries, is characterized by constant expression of the CD5 marker and low expression of surface membrane immunoglobulin (Ig) in B lymphocytes. CLL B lymphocyte is frequently committed for natural autoantibody secretion. Despite expressing the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) receptor CLL B cells cannot be infected by the EBV virus, they overexpress the bcl-2 protein and they are unable to adequately respond when stimulated through the B cell receptor pathway. Autoimmune-associated phenomena are frequently observed in B-cell CLL. These autotoxic manifestations are mainly directed against hematopoietic cells. In most cases, autoantibodies against red blood cells are warm reactive polyclonal IgG. Immune thrombocytopenia is observed in about 2% of cases, but higher frequencies of increased platelet associated Igs have been reported. Pure red cell aplasia and autoantibodies against neutrophils are only rarely observed. This pattern is similar to that observed in primary immunodeficiency syndromes, in which immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and pure red cell aplasia are frequently observed. The potential role of T cell defects in inducing autoimmune complications in B-cell CLL has been stressed by recent publications showing increased frequency of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in patients treated with purine nucleoside analogues.

The common interpretation indicating that trisomy 12 is a secondary abnormality is not valid, at least not during clinical disease, because trisomy 12 is never found to appear during the course of the disease.

In this article, I review some of the current knowledge about the molecular biology of CLL with a particular emphasis on cytogenetic abnormalities associated with these leukemias and the role of deregulated cell death in the pathogenesis of these neoplastic disorders of mature B and occasionally T lymphocytes.","['Reed, J C']",['Reed JC'],"['Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Genes, bcl-1', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology']",1998/03/03 00:00,1998/03/03 00:01,['1998/03/03 00:00'],"['1998/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1998 Feb;25(1):11-8.,['CA60421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,55,,,,,,,

The availability of specific therapies for certain of these tumors makes accurate diagnosis imperative. In most cases, detailed immunophenotypic analysis of the chronic lymphoid leukemias permits specific classification and initiation of the most appropriate therapy. For example, the characteristic immunophenotype of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): CD5+, CD23+, FMC7-, CD20 dim+, clonal surface immunoglobulin (sIg) dim+, distinguishes it from another CD5+ B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, mantle cell lymphoma, which typically displays the composite phenotype: CD5+, CD23-, FMC7+, CD20 bright+, clonal sIg bright+. Likewise, hairy cell leukemia has a characteristic immunophenotype: CD5-, CD11c bright+, CD25+, CD103+, which distinguishes it from other CD5- B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, including the morphologically similar splenic lymphoma with circulating villous lymphocytes. Immunophenotypic analysis by flow cytometry may also identify clinically relevant subsets of patients within a diagnostic category of leukemia. Thus, in patients with CLL, deviation from the typical immunophenotype is associated with trisomy 12 and mixed-cell morphology. In summary, careful immunophenotyping by flow cytometry facilitates accurate diagnosis in the chronic lymphoid leukemias, and in some settings, may also offer additional therapeutically relevant information.","['DiGiuseppe, J A', 'Borowitz, M J']","['DiGiuseppe JA', 'Borowitz MJ']","['Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,,IM,"['*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology']",1998/03/03 00:00,1998/03/03 00:01,['1998/03/03 00:00'],"['1998/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1998 Feb;25(1):6-10.,,,28,,,,,,,

A diagnostic bone marrow aspirate and subsequent bone marrow aspirates were investigated using conventional cytogenetic methods. RESULTS: Cytogenetic analysis of the diagnostic bone marrow aspirate showed a t(1;20)(p15;q11.2) translocation as the sole acquired abnormality. After one course of chemotherapy, the patient achieved hematopoietic and cytogenetic remission which has been sustained for 1 year after presentation.

C. parvum was identified in the gastrointestinal tract by biopsy and in the stool using modified acid fast staining. Improvement in the stool consistency was noted after 3 days of therapy with azithromycin, and, after 14 days of therapy, Cryptosporidium oocysts could no longer be identified in the stool. CONCLUSIONS: C. parvum should be considered in all immunocompromised patients with severe or prolonged diarrhea, especially if there is no blood or leukocytes in the stool. Because Cryptosporidium is not always tested for in a routine ova and parasite examination, the lab should be notified if it is in the differential diagnosis.

Reticulated platelets (RPs--young platelets characterized by a high RNA content--increase with increased platelet production and may be useful in the diagnosis of ITP. METHODS: To assess the role of RP counts in distinguishing ITP, we compared counts from 15 consecutive patients with ITP with counts from 20 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 10 with aplasia, and 27 healthy normal children. Whole blood in edetic acid (EDTA) was labelled with a platelet-specific monoclonal antibody and incubated with thiazole orange (TO). A standard gate was set to achieve a fluorescence value of 1.3 +/- 0.5% for control lyophilized platelets. RESULTS: Patients with ITP had a mean (+/- 1 standard deviation) RP level of 32.9 +/- 10.2%; patients with ALL, 6.6 +/- 3.1%; patients with aplasia, 3.4 +/- 2.0%; and normal patients, 7.9 +/- 2.9%. The difference in RPs between the ITP group and the ALL, aplasia, and normal groups was highly significant (p < 0.0001 each), with no significant difference between the non-ITP groups (p = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: Measuring RPs by this simple whole-blood cytometric technique discriminated very well between the acute ITP and non-ITP groups. This test has a strong positive predictive value and may prove very useful in the assessment of childhood acute ITP and the screening of candidates for bone marrow aspiration.","['Saxon, B R', 'Blanchette, V S', 'Butchart, S', 'Lim-Yin, J', 'Poon, A O']","['Saxon BR', 'Blanchette VS', 'Butchart S', 'Lim-Yin J', 'Poon AO']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Platelet Count', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/*diagnosis']",1998/03/03 00:00,1998/03/03 00:01,['1998/03/03 00:00'],"['1998/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199801000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Jan-Feb;20(1):44-8. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199801000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,

We then illustrate how these molecular alterations may be used to alter therapy. RESULTS: In childhood ALL, the TEL-AML1 fusion and hyperdiploidy are both associated with excellent treatment outcomes and therefore identify patients who may be candidates for less intensive therapy. In contrast, MLL gene rearrangements and the BCR-ABL fusion confer a poor prognosis; these patients may be best treated by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in first remission. CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical features are important prognostic indicators, genetic alterations of leukemic blasts may be better predictors of outcome for acute leukemia patients. We therefore favor risk-adapted therapy based on classification schemes that incorporate both genetic and clinical features.","['Rubnitz, J E', 'Look, A T']","['Rubnitz JE', 'Look AT']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1998/03/03 00:00,1998/03/03 00:01,['1998/03/03 00:00'],"['1998/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199801000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Jan-Feb;20(1):1-11. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199801000-00001.,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In contrast to HL60 cells, biotinylated dUTP could not be effectively incorporated into apoptotic CLL lymphocytes using exogenous TdT. This suggested that CLL lymphocytes possess a different type of endonuclease that cleaves DNA, leaving blunt or 3' recessed DNA breaks, which are poor substrates for TdT. This possibility was tested using lambda exonuclease, which can convert a blunt or 3' recessed DNA break into a 3' overhang. Apoptotic CLL lymphocytes pre-treated with lambda exonuclease demonstrated increased nucleotide incorporation with TdT. Single-strand DNA breaks are also present in apoptotic CLL lymphocytes, as labelled nucleotides could be incorporated using the in situ nick translation assay.

Induction of CsA-AI is obtained by total body irradiation in combination with syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and subsequent administration of CsA for 4 weeks; about 2 weeks after withdrawal of CsA disease develops. In CsA-AI, irradiation is thought to eliminate peripheral autoregulatory T-cells, whereas CsA interferes with selection in the thymus giving rise to putative autoreactive T-cells. MHC class II-self-peptide complexes have been thought to function as autoantigen(s). Moreover, induction of CsA-AI is used in humans to achieve a Graft-versus-Leukemia effect based on this anti-MHC class II reactivity. In this study we therefore have examined whether T-cells of CsA-AI rats respond to syngeneic dendritic cells (DC). Furthermore we determined the in vitro stimulatory capacity of the presumptive antigen presenting cell (APC) in the target organs, i.e. the keratinocytes. In contrast to keratinocytes of control rats the keratinocytes of CsA-AI rats show in situ a strong reactivity with anti-MHC class II specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) and therefore might induce local T-cell activation. Results reveal that T-cells of CsA-AI rats have no increased response to syngeneic DC. This indicates that MHC class II is not the autoantigen and that the autoantigen(s) are not presented by peripheral APC of control animals. With respect to possible APC in the target organ flow cytometry showed a strong induction of MHC class II and upregulation of MHC class I on keratinocytes of CsA-AI rats. However, these cells were unable to give any stimulatory signal to T-cells of control or diseased animals, indicating that the autoantigen(s) are not presented by keratinocytes of CsA-AI rats and that the MHC induction is probably secondary to the inflammatory reaction in the skin. The nature of the autoantigen(s) therefore remains to be determined.","['Damoiseaux, J G', 'van Breda Vriesman, P J']","['Damoiseaux JG', 'van Breda Vriesman PJ']","['Department of Immunology, Maastricht University, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Autoimmunity,Autoimmunity,8900070,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Mitogens)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Autoimmunity/*immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/biosynthesis', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Keratinocytes/immunology', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology']",1998/03/03 00:00,1998/03/03 00:01,['1998/03/03 00:00'],"['1998/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08916939809008036 [doi]'],ppublish,Autoimmunity. 1998;27(1):45-56. doi: 10.3109/08916939809008036.,,,,,,,,,,

Protection was also induced against sarcoma induction by acutely transforming retrovirus. In contrast, no protective immunity was induced by vaccination with an unrelated T helper epitope. By cytokine pattern analysis, the induced CD4+ T cells were of the T helper cell 1 type. The peptide-specific CD4+ T cells did not directly recognize the tumor cells, indicating involvement of cross-priming by tumor-associated antigen-presenting cells. The main effector cells responsible for tumor eradication were identified as CD8+ cytotoxic T cells that were found to recognize a recently described immunodominant viral gag-encoded cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope, which is unrelated to the viral env-encoded T helper peptide sequence. Simultaneous vaccination with the tumor-specific T helper and CTL epitopes resulted in strong synergistic protection. These results indicate the crucial role of T helper cells for optimal induction of protective immunity against MHC class II negative tumor cells. Protection is dependent on tumor-specific CTLs in this model system and requires cross-priming of tumor antigens by specialized antigen-presenting cells. Thus, tumor-specific T helper epitopes have to be included in the design of epitope-based vaccines.","['Ossendorp, F', 'Mengede, E', 'Camps, M', 'Filius, R', 'Melief, C J']","['Ossendorp F', 'Mengede E', 'Camps M', 'Filius R', 'Melief CJ']","['Department of Immunohematology and Bloodbank, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands. ossendorp@rullf2.medfac.leidenuniv.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'Vaccination', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology', 'Viral Proteins/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.187.5.693 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1998 Mar 2;187(5):693-702. doi: 10.1084/jem.187.5.693.,,,,,,,PMC2212165,,,

Evidence for specific primer-template interactions in addition to this standard interaction has recently been demonstrated for several retroviruses. Here, we used chemical and enzymatic probing to investigate the interactions between Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) RNA and its natural primer tRNAPro. The existence of extended interactions was further tested by comparing the viral RNA/tRNAPro complex with simplified complexes in which viral RNA or tRNA were reduced to the 18 nt of the PBS or to the complementary tRNA sequence. These data, combined with computer modeling provide important clues on the secondary structure and three-dimensional folding of the M-MuLV RNA/tRNAPro complex. In contrast with other retroviruses, we found that the interaction between tRNAPro and the M-MuLV RNA template is restricted to the standard PBS interaction. In this binary complex, the viral RNA is highly constrained and the rest of tRNAPro is rearranged, with the exception of the anticodon arm, leading to a very compact structure. Unexpectedly, when a synthetic tRNAPro lacking the post-transcriptional modifications is substituted for the natural tRNAPro primer, the interactions between the primer and the viral RNA are extended. Hence, our data suggest that the post-transcriptional modifications of natural tRNAPro prevent additional contacts between tRNAPro and the U5 region of M-MuLV RNA.","['Fosse, P', 'Mougel, M', 'Keith, G', 'Westhof, E', 'Ehresmann, B', 'Ehresmann, C']","['Fosse P', 'Mougel M', 'Keith G', 'Westhof E', 'Ehresmann B', 'Ehresmann C']","['Institut de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, 15 rue Descartes, Strasbourg cedex, 67084, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Pro)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Models, Molecular', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/metabolism', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Nucleotides/chemistry', 'RNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer, Pro/*chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S002228369791487X [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1997.1487 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1998 Feb 6;275(5):731-46. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1997.1487.,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press Limited.'],,,,,,,,

To study AQP1 gene regulation, human cell lines were screened for inducible AQP1 expression. Human erythroleukemia HEL cells showed AQP1 transcript expression on RNase protection assay. After butyrate-induced erythroid differentiation, AQP1 transcript expression increased strongly, producing water-permeable cells with plasma membrane localization of immunoreactive AQP1. In addition, a clonal subline of K562 cells [K562(S)] showed strong butyrate-induced expression of functional AQP1. A 1.8-kb DNA fragment of the 5' flanking region of the human AQP1 gene was isolated, sequenced, and analyzed functionally by the CAT reporter assay. The AQP1 promoter contained TATA and CCAAT boxes; Sp1, AP1, AP2, and E-box elements; and erythrocyte-specific CACCC and Kruppel-like (CCCCACCCA) elements. AQP1 promoter activity was more than 24-fold higher in HEL and K562(S) cells than in nonerythroid (HeLa) cells, indicating the presence of erythroid-specific factors. In K562(S) cells, CAT activities for promoter fragments to bp +23 [relative to beta-gal and normalized to 100% for the plasmid CP-282 (bp -282 to +23)] were 22 (-1779), 73 (-1402), 61 (-1129), 31 (-789), 87 (-487), 100 (-282), 73 (-229), 52 (-152), and 60% (-79).

This gene spans approximately 14 kb and encodes a 1.8-kb mRNA detected at the highest levels in peripheral blood leukocytes and breast cancer cell lines. The open reading frame predicts a 248-amino-acid protein with the hydropathic characteristics of a type 1a membrane protein. Western blots show that the K12 protein exists as a cluster of bands around 27 kDa, and extractions using nonionic detergents or high pH conditions demonstrate that it behaves as an integral membrane protein. Immunofluorescence localization studies reveal that K12 is not detectable on the cell surface, but instead is found in a perinuclear Golgi-like pattern and colocalizes with a well-known Golgi marker. In addition, an approximately 20-kDa soluble form of the K12 protein derived from the N-terminal domain is specifically secreted by cells into the culture medium. Immunohistochemical analysis of peripheral blood cells shows that K12 is found in leukocytes of the myeloid lineage, with the strongest staining observed in granulocytes and no detectable expression in lymphocytes.

Of the seven patients, four progressed to accelerated phase (AP) in 83-248 weeks after onset and three patients entered blastic crisis (BC) in 84-171 weeks after onset. All patients received high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by infusion with 11.3 +/- 12.1 x 10(7) (average +/- S.D.) of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs)/kg IFN-alpha was resumed shortly after platelet recovery. Of the four patients in AP, one developed a recurrence of blastoma in 7 weeks, one progressed to second AP in 138 weeks after ABMT and two patients have survived the second CP for 159 and 330 weeks since ABMT, respectively. One of them achieved the complete disappearance of Ph1-positive metaphases for 33 weeks after ABMT. Of patients who received AMBT in BC, three relapsed within 8 weeks and died in 9, 17 and 58 weeks after ABMT, respectively. Hematological recovery was delayed in four patients. Therefore, we retrospectively re-evaluated the number of BM-MNCs collected through 50 procedures from 40 patients with CML-CP. The total MNCs obtained from 30 collections under IFN-alpha treatment was 27.4 +/- 30.9 x 10(8) cells (average +/- S.D.), being significantly lower than that obtained from 20 collections in pre-treatment state or with single chemotherapy other than IFN-alpha treatment (81.8 +/- 68.2 x 10(8) cells) (P < 0.005). The total number of MNCs correlated to white blood cell (WBC) count at BM collection (P < 0.01), which was also lower in the IFN-alpha(+) group than in the IFN-alpha(-) group (7.2 +/- 5.7 and 25.6 +/- 32.3 x 10(9)/l; P < 0.005). Our findings suggested that ABMT with the use of a sufficient number of progenitor cells might be helpful to CML patients in early AP and reach in extended periods of second CP. In addition, we suggest that BM collection is required before the start of IFN-alpha therapy because the total number of BM-MNCs correlated to the WBC count, which might be lower in IFN-alpha treatment.","['Nagamura-Inoue, T', 'Tojo, A', 'Ikebuchi, K', 'Takahashi, S', 'Ogura, H', 'Shindoh, E', 'Nagamura, F', 'Uemura, N', 'Watari, K', 'Irie, S', 'Setoyama, M', 'Tajika, K', 'Nakayama, M', 'Nagayama, H', 'Kobayashi, Y', 'Shirafuji, N', 'Sato, N', 'Okamoto, S', 'Ozawa, K', 'Tani, K', 'Asano, S']","['Nagamura-Inoue T', 'Tojo A', 'Ikebuchi K', 'Takahashi S', 'Ogura H', 'Shindoh E', 'Nagamura F', 'Uemura N', 'Watari K', 'Irie S', 'Setoyama M', 'Tajika K', 'Nakayama M', 'Nagayama H', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Shirafuji N', 'Sato N', 'Okamoto S', 'Ozawa K', 'Tani K', 'Asano S']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1998/02/28 00:00,1998/02/28 00:01,['1998/02/28 00:00'],"['1998/02/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0925571097000674 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-5710(97)00067-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1997 Dec;66(4):493-503. doi: 10.1016/s0925-5710(97)00067-4.,,,,,,,,,,

Recent development of newer classes of antifolate drugs is based on the extensive understanding of the relationship between chemical structures and biological properties and of analogue interactions with target enzymes, transport proteins and folate metabolizing enzyme, folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS). Tumor cells may develop resistance to an antifolate drug by virtue of, (1) amplified activity in its target enzyme, (2) impaired function of drug transport protein, e.g. reduced folate carrier (RFC), (3) induction of mutated target enzyme with low affinity for antifolate(s), and (4) defective polyglutamation of drug(s) in the cells. Recent studies have elucidated in part the molecular events involved in the resistance to antifolates. These include amplification and/or mutation of the gene encoding a target enzyme, reduced or altered gene expression of the RFC, and mutated expression of the FPGS gene. To overcome or circumvent the resistance mechanisms, new antifolates with diverse structures and different biological properties have been designed and developed for clinical use. Trimetrexate (TMQ), a lipophilic DHFR inhibitor which is not a substrate for RFC and FPGS, could overcome the MTX-resistance through impaired RFC and diminished polyglutamation, and partially through amplified DHFR. Selective inhibitors of TS with a folate structure such as raltitrexed could circumvent the resistance by virtue of DHFR overproduction, and this class of compounds which have higher substrate activities for FPGS than MTX may be of value for the treatment of myeloid leukemias in addition to lymphocytic malignancies resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Several strategies to overcome antifolate resistance by using gene therapy are currently under investigation.","['Takemura, Y', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Miyachi, H']","['Takemura Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Miyachi H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/28 00:00,1998/02/28 00:01,['1998/02/28 00:00'],"['1998/02/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0925571097000583 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-5710(97)00058-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1997 Dec;66(4):459-77. doi: 10.1016/s0925-5710(97)00058-3.,,,124,,,,,,['Int J Hematol 1998 Apr;67(3):333'],

We therefore examined the effect of IL-10 on AML cells obtained from 10 patients. Although granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and/or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was able to stimulate the growth of AML progenitor cells to form leukemic blast colonies, IL-10 itself demonstrated no leukemic blast colony-forming activity and no synergistic stimulating activity with other cytokines. However, leukemic blast colonies were formed without the addition of exogenous cytokines in four cases and IL-10 suppressed these spontaneous colony formations in two of the four cases. Since the production of G-CSF and GM-CSF was observed in these two cases, the presence of an autocrine growth mechanism mediated by these cytokines was suggested. When serial concentrations of IL-10 were added, the production of G-CSF and GM-CSF was dramatically inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggested that IL-10 could suppress the autocrine growth of AML cells by inhibiting their production of G-CSF and/or GM-CSF. In addition, the administration of IL-10 may be harmless to normal hematopoiesis because IL-10 did not suppress the growth of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells.

However, recent studies have shown that clonal hematopoiesis in aplastic anemia or remission of leukemia is rarer than previously thought when skewed X-inactivation was extensively ruled out by comparison with T-lymphocytes as an internal control. However, a polyclonal pattern obtained by X-inactivation cannot exclude the possibility of a small clonal cell population presenting in aplastic anemia.

For example, certain oxidants are known to activate the nuclear transcription factor kappa B, which regulates the expression of a variety of different adhesion molecules, cytokines, and enzymes. Oxidants are also known to activate another transcription factor, activator protein-1. This transcription factor is composed of products from the fos and jun proto-oncogene family and is believed to be important in regulating cell growth and proliferation. Finally, oxidants are believed to promote intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis, and the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene product is believed to inhibit this phenomenon in an antioxidant-dependent manner. Taken together, these observations suggest that nontoxic concentrations of reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen play an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response and in modulating apoptosis.","[""Jourd'heuil, D"", 'Morise, Z', 'Conner, E M', 'Grisham, M B']","[""Jourd'heuil D"", 'Morise Z', 'Conner EM', 'Grisham MB']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Louisiana State University Medical Center, Shreveport 71130, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Gastroenterol,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,7910017,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Free Radicals', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*biosynthesis']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/02/28 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004836-199700001-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Gastroenterol. 1997;25 Suppl 1:S61-72. doi: 10.1097/00004836-199700001-00011.,"['CA 63641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 47663/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,117,,,,,,,

These tumors do not have consistent cytogenetic or molecular genetic alterations, and so we have concentrated on their response to and production of various regulatory cytokines. Although B-CLL cells show variable proliferative responses when exposed to transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), these cells have consistently shown resistance to the pro-apoptotic effects of this cytokine. Also, interleukin 4 (IL4), IL5, and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) all show a consistently increased protective effect against apoptosis in B-CLL cells as compared to normal human B cells. Thus, a defect in apoptosis appears to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of CLL. By contrast, the neoplastic T cells of Sezary syndrome show a consistent resistance to the antiproliferative effects of TGF beta, suggesting that aberrant proliferation is more important than apoptosis in this disorder. In both neoplasms, we have shown that the defective responses to cytokines are in some instances related to alterations in receptor expression, but this has not been true in all circumstances, and other stages in the signaling pathways are being investigated. As we define more precisely the specific defects that contribute to the clonal expansion of these neoplasms, the findings may ultimately lead to improved clinical control of these disorders.","['Nowell, P C', 'Moore, J S']","['Nowell PC', 'Moore JS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA. nowell@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Immunol Res,Immunologic research,8611087,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Sezary Syndrome/*immunology/pathology']",1998/02/28 00:00,1998/02/28 00:01,['1998/02/28 00:00'],"['1998/02/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02786442 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Res. 1998;17(1-2):171-7. doi: 10.1007/BF02786442.,,,38,,,,,,,

We show here that dimethyl sulfoxide treatment of wild-type murine erythroleukemia cells, but not a mutant clone of dimethyl sulfoxide-resistant cells, increases NF-E2 activity significantly, which involves both up-regulation of DNA binding and transactivation activities. Both activities were reduced markedly by treatment of cells with 2-aminopurine but not by genistein. Activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase signaling cascade increased NF-E2 activity significantly, but this was suppressed when MafK was overexpressed. Domain analysis revealed an activation domain in the NH2-terminal region of p45 and a suppression domain in the basic region-leucine zipper of MafK. These findings indicate that induction of NF-E2 activity is essential for erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells, and serine/threonine phosphorylation may be involved in this process. In addition, they also suggest that a MafK homodimer can suppress transcription, not only by competition for the DNA binding site, but also by direct inhibition of transcription. Hence, MafK may function as an active transcription repressor.","['Nagai, T', 'Igarashi, K', 'Akasaka, J', 'Furuyama, K', 'Fujita, H', 'Hayashi, N', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Sassa, S']","['Nagai T', 'Igarashi K', 'Akasaka J', 'Furuyama K', 'Fujita H', 'Hayashi N', 'Yamamoto M', 'Sassa S']","['Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (MafK Transcription Factor)', '0 (Mafk protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Globins/biosynthesis', 'Heme/analysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'MafK Transcription Factor', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Zinc Fingers', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.9.5358 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)47120-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Feb 27;273(9):5358-65. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.9.5358.,['DK32890/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The first step in the salvage pathway is transport across the plasma membrane. Several transport activities, including equilibrative and concentrative mechanisms, have been identified by their functional properties. We report here the functional cloning of a 2.6-kilobase pair human cDNA encoding the nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR)-insensitive, equilibrative nucleoside transporter ei by functional complementation of the transport deficiency in a subline of CEM human leukemia cells. Expression of this cDNA conferred an NBMPR-insensitive, sodium-independent nucleoside transport activity to the cells that exhibited substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity characteristic of the ei transporter. The cDNA contained a single open reading frame that encoded a 456-residue protein with 11 potential membrane-spanning regions and two consensus sites for N-glycosylation in the first predicted extracellular loop. The predicted protein was 50% identical to the recently cloned human NBMPR-sensitive, equilibrative nucleoside transporter ENT1 and thus was designated ENT2. Surprisingly, the carboxyl-terminal portion of the ENT2 protein was nearly identical to a smaller protein in the GenBankTM data base (human HNP36, 326 residues) that has been identified as a growth factor-induced delayed early response gene of unknown function. Comparison of the ENT2 and HNP36 nucleotide sequences suggested that HNP36 was translated from a second start codon within the ENT2 open reading frame. Transient expression studies with the full-length ENT2 and a 5'-truncated construct that lacks the first start codon (predicted protein 99% identical to HNP36) demonstrated that only the full-length construct conferred uridine transport activity to the cells. These data suggest that the delayed early response gene HNP36 is a truncated form of ENT2 and that the full-length open reading frame of ENT2 is required for production of a functional plasma membrane ei transporter.","['Crawford, C R', 'Patel, D H', 'Naeve, C', 'Belt, J A']","['Crawford CR', 'Patel DH', 'Naeve C', 'Belt JA']","[""Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Equilibrative-Nucleoside Transporter 2)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (SLC29A2 protein, human)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Equilibrative-Nucleoside Transporter 2', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.9.5288 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)47110-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Feb 27;273(9):5288-93. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.9.5288.,"['P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA55056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF034102'],,

In addition, the growth factor requirement was decreased in these cells. However, cells expressing a deletion mutant of MEN lacking the lysine-rich region did not exhibit such biological abilities. c-Fos protein expression and AP-1 activity were elevated in the MEN-expressing cells, which might be part of the mechanism responsible for the transformation.

Despite its potent biological activity, little is known about the receptor and intracellular signaling pathways. Here we analyzed the signal transduction mechanisms through LTD4 receptors using human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells. When these cells were stimulated with LTD4, intracellular calcium concentration was increased and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) was activated severalfold. This activation was inhibited by staurosporine or GF109203X treatment or abolished by protein kinase C depletion. Cytosolic protein kinase Calpha was translocated to the membrane, and Raf-1 was activated by LTD4 treatment in a similar time course. LTD4-induced Raf-1 activation was diminished by protein kinase C depletion in the cells. A chemotactic response of THP-1 cells toward LTD4 was observed which was inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX) pretreatment. Thus, LTD4 has at least two distinct signaling pathways in THP-1 cells, a PTX-insensitive mitogen-activated protein kinase activation through protein kinase Calpha and Raf-1 and a PTX-sensitive chemotactic response. This cellular signaling can explain in part the versatile activities of LTD4 in macrophages under inflammatory and allergic conditions.","['Hoshino, M', 'Izumi, T', 'Shimizu, T']","['Hoshino M', 'Izumi T', 'Shimizu T']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Hongo 7-3-1, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene)', '73836-78-9 (Leukotriene D4)', 'AJT72OTM42 (cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'LRF7RW46ID (leukotriene D4 receptor)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Calcium/analysis', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Cyclic AMP/analysis', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukotriene D4/*pharmacology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Leukotriene/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.9.4878 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)47053-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Feb 27;273(9):4878-82. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.9.4878.,,,,,,,,,,

The overexpression of the normal protein in a proerythroblastic cell prevents its terminal differentiation. In normal hematopoiesis Spi-1/PU.1 is a transcription factor that plays a key role in normal myeloid and B lymphoid differentiation. Moreover, Spi-1/PU.1 binds RNA and interferes in vitro with the splicing process. Here we report that Spi-1 interacts in vivo with TLS (translocated in liposarcoma), a RNA-binding protein involved in human tumor-specific chromosomal translocations. This interaction appears functionally relevant, since TLS is capable of reducing the abilities of Spi-1/PU.1 to bind DNA and to transactivate the expression of a reporter gene. In addition, we observe that TLS is potentially a splicing factor. It promotes the use of the distal 5' splice site during the E1A pre-mRNA splicing. This effect is counterpoised in vivo by Spi-1.

Its expression is upregulated by wild-type p53, and the p21WAF1/CIP1 protein appears to be a potent effector of the p53-dependent cell cycle regulatory pathway. We have previously reported that p53 mutations frequently occur during bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-induced leukemogenesis in cattle but not in sheep. Therefore, we have investigated the involvement of p21WAF1/CIP1 mutations in the tumorigenic process associated with BLV. We first cloned the bovine and ovine WAF1 genes and determined the complete nucleotide sequences of their second coding exons. These sequences share respectively 79% and 80% homology with those of the human counterpart exon. In order to screen for mutations that could be associated with BLV-induced pathogenicity, we performed single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assays on the WAF1 genes from BLV-induced tumors. No WAF1 mutations were detected in any of the ten BLV-induced bovine tumor samples. Among eleven sheep tumors and three ovine cell lines, only one sample revealed a single mutation in the WAF1 coding sequence, but this mutation was silent at the translational level. We concluded that mutations of the WAF1 gene are not involved in the development of the tumors during BLV-induced leukemogenesis.","['Dequiedt, F', 'Willems, L', 'Kerkhofs, P', 'Burny, A', 'Kettmann, R']","['Dequiedt F', 'Willems L', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Burny A', 'Kettmann R']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*genetics/virology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Exons', 'Genes, p53', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Sheep']",1998/02/27 00:00,1998/02/27 00:01,['1998/02/27 00:00'],"['1998/02/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(97)00081-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2427(97)00081-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1997 Nov;59(3-4):311-22. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2427(97)00081-0.,,,,,,,,,,

The conditions of IFN/LPS induction and subsequent assessment of cytotoxicity that were employed were identical to those used conventionally to test macrophage-mediated tumor cell cytotoxicity. What was totally unexpected was that these same blast cells, in the absence of stimulation with IFN/LPS, were also found to mediate high levels of spontaneous cytotoxicity against autologous bone marrow cells and against the U937 human promonocytic leukemia cell line in vitro. This high level of spontaneous cytotoxicity against autologous bone marrow or U937 promonocytic leukemia cells was not enhanced by IFN/LPS or MCSF under conditions that stimulated cytotoxic function in normal blood monocytes and was markedly reduced by pretreatment of the blast cells with IL2 under conditions that induced potent NK/LAK-mediated cytotoxicity. Neutralizing antibodies against TNFalpha and/or IL1alpha/beta eliminated the cytolytic function of blast cells against autologous bone marrow or U937 promonocytic leukemia targets. These findings demonstrate the existence of a population of cells with the morphologic characteristics of blast cells in the peripheral blood of AML patients which has the capacity to mediate spontaneous cytolysis of autologous bone marrow cells or a promonocytic leukemia cell line. These cells may be an immature variant of normal precursors produced as a consequence of the disordered hematopoietic environment in the marrow of AML patients. Alternatively, this function may be mediated by a subset of the leukemic blasts themselves.","['Braun, D P', 'Preisler, H D']","['Braun DP', 'Preisler HD']","['Department of Medicine and the Rush Cancer Institute, Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/02/26 00:00,1998/02/26 00:01,['1998/02/26 00:00'],"['1998/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709058312 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Nov;27(5-6):459-67. doi: 10.3109/10428199709058312.,"['CA58922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The earliest B-cell progenitors coexpress the antigens CD10, CD19, or CD34 on their cell surfaces. In a large cohort of 2028 children with ALL, we compared treatment outcomes of a subset of B-lineage ALL patients with CD10+CD19+CD34+ immature B-progenitor leukemia (BPL) to the treatment outcomes of the remaining CD19+ B-lineage ALL patients. Pediatric B-lineage ALL cases enrolled on risk-adjusted ALL treatment protocols of the Children's Cancer Group were immunophenotypically classified as BPL or non-BPL. Patients were stratified further into age groups of > or = 1 year and <12 months. Event-free survival (EFS) outcomes were calculated by standard life table methods. BPL patients in both age groups generally had more favorable presenting characteristics than non-BPL controls. Within the age group of > or = 1 year, BPL patients had a slightly better EFS outcome than non-BPL patients, with 3-year estimates of 83.9% (SD = 1.1%) vs. 78.8% (SD = 1.8%), respectively (P = 0.10). Infants with BPL, representing one-fifth of the total infant patient population, had a significantly better EFS outcome than infants with non-BPL (three-year EFS: 82.4%, SD = 9.2% vs. 34.4%, SD = 5.9%, P = 0.006). In univariate analyses, the relative hazard rate (RHR) was 3.73 for non-BPL vs BPL and this marked difference in EFS outcome was maintained at 5 years of follow-up. The favorable prognostic influence of the BPL immunophenotype for infants remained significant in multivariate analyses with an RHR of 2.72 for non-BPL vs BPL (P = 0.05).

Results obtained in studies of NK-cell-mediated killing of AML blasts show that monocytes inhibit IL-2-induced lysis of AML blasts in vitro. Histamine, a biogenic amine, prevents the monocyte-derived, inhibitory signal; thereby, histamine and IL-2 synergize to induce killing of AML blasts. Here we present updated results of a post-consolidation trial in which histamine (0.5-0.7 mg s.c. bid) has been administered together with IL-2 (1 micro/kg s.c. bid) to 22 AML patients (aged 29-79, mean 59) in repeated courses of three weeks, continued until relapse or until a disease-free remission of 24 months. Low-dose therapy with cytarabine and thioguanine was given between the initial courses of histamine/IL-2. In 13 patients, treatment according to this protocol was started in first complete remission (CR1). The mean remission time in CR1 patients is 19 (median 14) months, and 9/13 remain in CR. Nine patients have entered the protocol in CR2 (n=6), CR3 (n=2), or CR4 (n=1). The mean remission time in CR2-4 is 19 (median 21) months, and 6/9 patients remain in CR. Seven out of seven evaluable patients have achieved a duration of CR which exceeds that of the foregoing remission. Histamine has been well tolerated, and 21/22 CR patients have treated themselves at home throughout the trial. We conclude that the putative benefit of histamine treatment in AML should be the focus of a randomized trial.","['Hellstrand, K', 'Mellqvist, U H', 'Wallhult, E', 'Carneskog, J', 'Kimby, E', 'Celsing, F', 'Brune, M']","['Hellstrand K', 'Mellqvist UH', 'Wallhult E', 'Carneskog J', 'Kimby E', 'Celsing F', 'Brune M']","[""Department of Virology, Sahlgren's University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Communication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Histamine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interleukin-2/physiology/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/02/26 00:00,1998/02/26 00:01,['1998/02/26 00:00'],"['1998/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709058309 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Nov;27(5-6):429-38. doi: 10.3109/10428199709058309.,,,,,,,,,,

Data from other laboratories were incorporated where compatible. Exon/intron boundaries were sequenced and an intron-phase analysis was performed. The results are expected to contribute to a better understanding of those structural alterations of the gene that conserve the open reading frame and produce presumably oncogenic variants of the ALL-1 protein.

One method by which this might be achieved in vivo has been developed in Genoa and involves the administration of high dose chemotherapy and G-CSF followed by peripheral blood stem cell collection. These collections are frequently devoid of Philadelphia positive cells and the hope is that this will enhance the effects of subsequent autograft. We have investigated the use of a less toxic regimen for this procedure using oral hydroxyurea and G-CSF. In this review we describe the background to autografting in CML and the development of strategies to mobilise Philadelphia negative cells into the peripheral blood.

Bone marrow transplantation has highlighted the importance of allogeneic disparity in maintaining remissions in CML. However, it has been unclear whether the immune effect against CML is mediated by T cells, natural killer cells (NK) or a combination of both. We have previously demonstrated that autologous activated NK are capable of selectively lysing malignant CML progenitors while sparing benign progenitors. NK effectors may play an important role in CML since NK lytic function, clonogenic frequency and proliferative capacity decrease as CML progresses from chronic phase to advanced phase and blast crisis. Incubation of CML NK with IL-2 is capable of restoring cytolytic activity to normal levels. We hypothesize that activated NK represent a potential therapy against CML to maintain remissions in a minimal residual disease setting induced by autologous transplantation.

Stromal cells within the BM microenvironment provide a suitable environment for self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Within the hematopoietic microenvironment, whether it is embryonic yolk sac, fetal liver, or adult bone marrow, microvascular endothelium not only acts as a gatekeeper controlling the trafficking and homing of hematopoietic progenitors, but also provides cellular contact and secretes cytokines that allows for the preservation of the steady state hematopoiesis. Recently, homogenous monolayers of bone marrow endothelial cells (BMEC) have been isolated and cultivated in tissue culture. Long-term coculture studies have shown that BMEC monolayers are unique type of endothelium and can support long-term proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells particularly megakaryocytic and myeloid progenitor cells by constitutive elaboration of lineage-specific cytokines such as G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, Kit-ligand, IL6, FLK-2 ligand, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Direct cellular contact between hematopoietic progenitor cells and BMEC monolayers through specific adhesion molecules including beta1, beta2 integrins and selectins play a critical role in trafficking and possibly proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells. Dysfunction of microvascular endothelial cells within the hematopoietic microenvironment may result in stem cell disorders and progression to aplastic anemias, and contribute to graft failure during bone marrow transplantation. Further studies on the role of microvascular endothelium in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell homing and proliferation may enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of stem cell and leukemic disorders.","['Rafii, S', 'Mohle, R', 'Shapiro, F', 'Frey, B M', 'Moore, M A']","['Rafii S', 'Mohle R', 'Shapiro F', 'Frey BM', 'Moore MA']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/physiopathology', 'Megakaryocytes/physiology', 'Microcirculation']",1998/02/26 00:00,1998/02/26 00:01,['1998/02/26 00:00'],"['1998/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199709058305 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Nov;27(5-6):375-86. doi: 10.3109/10428199709058305.,"['KO8-HL-02926/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-59461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK 42693/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,85,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the bystander effect in human lung-cancer cell lines, and the role of gap-junctional intercellular communication as the mechanism responsible for it. Gap-junctional intercellular communication was measured both with a dye-transfer assay involving single-cell microinjection of Lucifer Yellow and with a PKH26/calcein-AM double-dye-transfer assay. Significant bystander tumoricidal effect was observed in lung-cancer cell lines when cultured cells contained only 10% HSV-tk expressing cells. This was also observed to occur with cell lines of different origin or from different species. Although gap-junctional intercellular communication characterized by rapid transfer of Lucifer Yellow was not observed, we did detect gap-junctional communication marked by the slow transfer of calcein-AM in lung-cancer cell lines. However, neither an inhibitor (1-octanol) nor an enhancer (all trans-retinoic acid [ATRA]) of gap-junctional communication affected the extent of the bystander effect. These findings suggest that low levels of gap-junctional communication may be efficient for producing the bystander effect in lung-cancer cells, or that other mechanisms may underlie this effect. Although gap-junctional communication may play an important role in generating the bystander effect in tumor cells expressing the HSV-tk gene, further knowledge of the mechanism of this effect may help improve the treatment of lung cancer with an HSV-tk system.","['Imaizumi, K', 'Hasegawa, Y', 'Kawabe, T', 'Emi, N', 'Saito, H', 'Naruse, K', 'Shimokata, K']","['Imaizumi K', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Kawabe T', 'Emi N', 'Saito H', 'Naruse K', 'Shimokata K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'NV1779205D (1-Octanol)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['1-Octanol/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma/*pathology', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Ganciclovir/*pharmacology', 'Gap Junctions/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/26 00:00,1998/02/26 00:01,['1998/02/26 00:00'],"['1998/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1165/ajrcmb.18.2.2821 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 1998 Feb;18(2):205-12. doi: 10.1165/ajrcmb.18.2.2821.,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Altogether 2238 workers employed in 1955--1990 were included in a historic cohort and followed until 31 December 1993. National cancer rates were used to calculate the expected number of cancer cases. RESULTS: The overall cancer risk was close to the expected, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) being 1.01. The risk of stomach cancer was doubled [10 observed, SIR 1.99, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.95--3.66], as was the risk of pancreatic cancer (7 observed, SIR 1.88, 95% CI 0.75-3.88). For the men with known pulp exposure, lung cancer was slightly increased (SIR 1.53, 95% CI 0.94-2.37). Other cancers with elevated risks were leukemia (7 observed, SIR 1.84) and soft-tissue sarcomas (4 observed, SIR 2.37). The risk of non-Hodgkin' s lymphoma was not increased.

The procedure essentially involved removal of the blood cells by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) induced lysis, followed by DNA extraction after degradation of fungal cell walls by a recombinant beta-1,3-glucanase. The genes of two different aspartic proteinases from C. albicans, SAP1 and SAP2, with an overall homology of 77% in their nucleotide sequences, were chosen as targets for PCR. The oligonucleotide primers used were directed to strictly conserved regions similar in both genes. As the number of base pairs between the primers are different in the two genes, amplification products of 220 bp and 238 bp in length were obtained. This led to a characteristic double band in subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. The detection limit for a nested PCR was less than 10 C. albicans cells ml-1 of seeded blood. The detection limit of conventional PCR from a blood volume in the 10 ml range was less than 100 yeasts ml-1. Preliminary trials with clinical blood specimens suggested, that conventional PCR from large blood samples, being less laborious and prone to contamination than nested PCR, could be suited for the detection of deepseated C. albicans mycosis.","['Reichard, U', 'Margraf, S', 'Hube, B', 'Ruchel, R']","['Reichard U', 'Margraf S', 'Hube B', 'Ruchel R']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Gottingen, FR Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,"['0 (DNA, Fungal)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (SAP1 protein, Candida albicans)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (SAP2 protein, Candida)']",IM,"['Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/complications', 'Candidiasis/*blood/complications', 'DNA, Fungal/*blood', 'Female', '*Fungal Proteins', '*Genes, Fungal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",1998/02/26 00:00,1998/02/26 00:01,['1998/02/26 00:00'],"['1998/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1439-0507.1997.tb00228.x [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 1997 Nov;40(7-8):249-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1439-0507.1997.tb00228.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Aspergillus infections of the upper respiratory tract may also involve the nasal cavity or sinuses resulting in nasal obstruction, epistaxis, facial pain, periorbital swelling and even palate destruction. Primary cutaneous infections present as non-purulent ulcerations and may be seen in association with implantable intravenous devices. Other sites of infections, such as the central nervous system, originate from dissemination of molds and may be suspected when focal neurological findings or meningism develop.

There is not a strict demarcation of them, so that mixed syndromes can develop as are hypoplastic syndromes on one side and mixed myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative syndromes (MDS-MPS) on the other side. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among our 616 pts with MDS we looked for those cases, who had beside myelodysplasia signs of myeloproliferation with increased number of blood cells. They were examined in detail including bone-marrow histology, bone marrow cultivation, cytogenetics and bcr-abl gen. Signs of MDS-MPS were found in 22 patients at the first contact with the patient (13 patients had thrombocytemia and 9 patients had leukocytosis). Further 7 patients were diagnosed as MDS, proliferative syndrome developed after several months (MDS-MPS in evolution). The level of thrombocytemia was relatively stable, the number of leukocytes was progressive. All subtypes of MDS were found. All subjects had variable degree of anemia. Ring-sideroblasts and myelofibrosis were frequent finding in MDS-MPS. Men prevailed in patients with leukocytosis. Cytogenetic and cultivation findings were similar to MDS cases, deletion of long arm of chromosome 20 was present in 3 patients. Five patients transformed to acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Sings of myelodysplasia and myeloproliferation were found in 4% of our MDS patients, designated as mixed myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative syndrome (MDS-MPS).

These drugs are not directly cytotoxic but induce apoptosis. Due to their lipophilicity, anthracyclines are rapidly distributed in myeloid and lymphatic leukemia cells. Within 20 min after treatment, daunorubicin and idarubicin are found to intercalate into DNA. Shortly after treatment, DNA damage occurs and increases within 3 hours. Apoptosis can be monitored 12-24 hours after treatment, at this timepoint the majority of DNA strand breaks have already been repaired. A statistically highly significant linear correlation could be established between the DNA binding rate of anthracyclines and the resulting cell death. This indicates that DNA binding is a prerequisite for the induction of apoptosis. With respect to cellular resistance mechanisms, 2 different pharmacodynamic phases can be distinguished: intracellular distribution and cellular reaction. The endpoint of the ""distribution phase"" is marked by the DNA intercalation of the anthracyclines. Cellular resistance mechanisms which decrease the DNA binding include membrane transport mechanisms and vesicular trapping of the drugs. The ""reaction phase"" might be disturbed by complex antiapoptotic mechanisms. The assessment of DNA binding in malignant cells during or shortly after treatment with anthracyclines might be a useful tool to distinguish cellular resistance mechanisms.","['Gieseler, F', 'Nussler, V', 'Brieden, T', 'Kunze, J', 'Valsamas, S']","['Gieseler F', 'Nussler V', 'Brieden T', 'Kunze J', 'Valsamas S']","['University Hospital, Medizinische Poliklinik, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '86189-66-4 (idarubicinol)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism']",1998/02/26 00:00,1998/02/26 00:01,['1998/02/26 00:00'],"['1998/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 1998 Jan;36(1):25-8.,,,,,,,,,,

Thrombopoietin is a hematopoietic growth factor that regulates the production of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells and platelets. To evaluate the possibility that an abnormality in thrombopoietin-mediated signal transduction might be involved in the pathogenesis of polycythemia vera, we examined thrombopoietin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins and the expression of the thrombopoietin receptor in platelets from patients with the disease. METHODS: Platelets were isolated from the blood of patients with polycythemia vera or other chronic myeloproliferative disorders and control subjects. The platelets were exposed to either thrombopoietin or thrombin and then lysed for analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet proteins and the expression of the proteins by means of immunoblotting. Expression of the thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl) by platelets and megakaryocytes was also assessed. RESULTS: Thrombopoietin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins was impaired in platelets from 20 patients with polycythemia vera and 3 with idiopathic myelofibrosis, but not in 4 patients with essential thrombocytosis, 3 with chronic myelogenous leukemia, 6 with secondary erythrocytosis, 2 with iron-deficiency anemia, 4 with hemochromatosis, or 5 normal subjects. Thrombin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins was intact in platelets from patients with polycythemia vera, and the tyrosine kinases and substrates involved in the process were present in normal amounts. However, expression of the platelet thrombopoietin receptor MpI was markedly reduced or absent in 34 of 34 patients with polycythemia vera and in 13 of 14 patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis. Impaired thrombopoietin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in patients with these two diseases was uniformly associated with markedly reduced expression of MpI or the lack of its expression. In patients with polycythemia vera, reduced expression of MpI by platelets was associated with reduced expression of MpI by megakaryocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced expression of the thrombopoietin receptor MpI is characteristic of polycythemia vera and idiopathic myelofibrosis.

Since in polycythemia vera an abnormal clone of erythroid progenitors is independent of erythropoietin, we investigated whether the endogenous expression of Bcl-xL was deregulated in these cells. METHODS: Erythroid colonies from patients with polycythemia vera and normal subjects were cultured in the presence and absence of erythropoietin and assessed by immunocytochemical and flow-cytometric analysis with anti-Bcl-x antibodies that recognize the two species of Bcl-x (Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS). Reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction analysis was used to determine which one of the two species was responsible for anti-Bcl-x staining. Bone marrow mononuclear cells from 8 healthy bone marrow donors, 14 patients with polycythemia vera, 19 patients with other myeloproliferative syndromes, and 12 patients with secondary erythrocytosis were analyzed by flow cytometry with antibodies against Bcl-x and glycophorin A, an erythroid marker. RESULTS: Erythroid cells from patients with polycythemia vera survived in vitro without erythropoietin, and this finding correlated with the expression of Bcl-x protein (Bcl-xL messenger RNA was the main species of Bcl-x found), even in mature erythroblasts that normally do not express Bcl-x. The mean (+/-SD) percentage of cells positive for both glycophorin A and Bcl-x in the 14 patients with polycythemia vera (21.8+/-3.6 percent) was significantly higher than that in 8 normal donors (6.62+/-1.58 percent), 12 patients with secondary erythrocytosis (6.87+/-1.95 percent), 9 patients with essential thrombocythemia (3.81+/-0.97 percent), and 10 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (2.7+/-0.41 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Deregulated expression of Bcl-x may contribute to the erythropoietin-independent survival of erythroid-lineage cells in polycythemia vera and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.","['Silva, M', 'Richard, C', 'Benito, A', 'Sanz, C', 'Olalla, I', 'Fernandez-Luna, J L']","['Silva M', 'Richard C', 'Benito A', 'Sanz C', 'Olalla I', 'Fernandez-Luna JL']","['Servicio de Immunologia, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*chemistry/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'Reference Values', 'Thrombocytosis/blood/pathology', 'bcl-X Protein']",1998/02/26 00:00,1998/02/26 00:01,['1998/02/26 00:00'],"['1998/02/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199802263380902 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1998 Feb 26;338(9):564-71. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199802263380902.,,,,,,['N Engl J Med. 1998 Feb 26;338(9):613-5.

D. Anderson Cancer Center for recurrent disease after resection of a stage I ovarian serous neoplasm of low malignant potential (SNLMP) are reported. At the time of diagnosis, the age of the patients ranged from 26 to 43 years (mean 33). Seven patients had stage IB tumors and 4 had stage IA tumors. All patients were treated with a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The size of the ovarian tumors ranged from 4 to 15 cm in maximum dimension. Stromal microinvasion was seen in 2 cases, and foci of endosalpingiosis were seen in the peritoneum in 8 cases. Nine patients were treated with radiotherapy and 2 with chemotherapy. The time to recurrent disease ranged from 7 to 39 years (mean 16). Eight tumors recurred in the pelvis or abdomen, 2 in the neck with subsequent abdominal involvement, and 1 in the pleura without abdominal or pelvic involvement. In 10 cases, the recurrent tumors were serous carcinoma, and in 1 case it was a SNLMP. Recurrences were treated with chemotherapy in 10 cases and with hormones in 1 case. Seven patients died of progressive serous carcinoma 2 to 5 years after the recurrence. One patient died of leukemia with recurrent ovarian tumor 10 years after the recurrence was detected. Two patients are alive with progressive disease 1 and 7 years after the recurrence, and 1 patient whose disease recurred as a SNLMP is alive with no evidence of disease 9 years after the recurrence. These 11 patients were compared with 16 patients who had stage I ovarian SNLMPs that did not recur after a minimum follow-up of 15 years. There was no difference in the age of the patients, gravidity, size of the tumors, or several microscopic parameters, including degree of epithelial proliferation, number of mitoses, and nuclear atypia. Microinvasion was found in one case. The only significant difference between the two groups was the low frequency of endosalpingiosis in the cases that had no disease recurrences (12.5% versus 72.7%). In summary, we found no clinical or pathologic features that can unequivocally predict the recurrence of stage I ovarian SNLMPs. Because of the long interval to recurrence, the fact that the recurrent tumors in 10 of 11 patients were serous carcinomas, and the result of the X-chromosome inactivation in one case, the recurrent tumors could represent independent primaries or a slow progression of one clone present in the SNLMPs.","['Silva, E G', 'Tornos, C', 'Zhuang, Z', 'Merino, M J', 'Gershenson, D M']","['Silva EG', 'Tornos C', 'Zhuang Z', 'Merino MJ', 'Gershenson DM']","['University of Texas M.

Since RNR is a key enzyme of nucleotide metabolism and DNA synthesis, a reduced Trx level would result in reduced enzymatic activity and cause DNA damage. Furthermore, Trx is considered to be an effective regulator of redox sensitive gene expression. The role of Trx in nucleotide metabolism and gene expression may be an explanation for increased chromosomal instability as well as hypersensitivity towards oxygen, ROI and ROI generating agents. The activity of tyrosinase, the key enzyme of melanin biosynthesis, is influenced by the thioredoxin level and by superoxide radicals. Low thioredoxin levels and high superoxide concentrations activate tyrosinase causing hyperpigmentation of the skin. In addition to the observed high superoxide concentration in Fanconi anemia (FA) patients, a low thioredoxin level might be responsible for the hyperpigmentation (cafe-au-lait spots) in this disease. We observed that overexpression of the thioredoxin cDNA in FA fibroblasts completely abolished the DNA damaging effects of mitomycin C and diepoxybutane and inhibited the constitutive activity of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) in SV40 transformed FA fibroblasts. However, spontaneous chromosomal breakage was not affected.","['Ruppitsch, W', 'Meisslitzer, C', 'Hirsch-Kauffmann, M', 'Schweiger, M']","['Ruppitsch W', 'Meisslitzer C', 'Hirsch-Kauffmann M', 'Schweiger M']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin-Dahlem, Germany. wrupp@chemie.fu-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '60OB65YNAB (diepoxybutane)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Epoxy Compounds/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Fanconi Anemia/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Mitomycin/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/physiology', 'Thioredoxins/*metabolism', 'Transfection/genetics', 'Transformation, Genetic/genetics']",1998/02/25 00:00,1998/02/25 00:01,['1998/02/25 00:00'],"['1998/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(97)01608-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(97)01608-6 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1998 Jan 23;422(1):99-102. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(97)01608-6.,,,,,,,,,,

In mixing experiments of cell lines with different structural abnormalities, we found a sensitivity of approximately 10%. We applied DNA fiber FISH for detection of t(11;14) in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and immunoglobulin (Ig) class switching in hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Using a barcode for the Ig and BCL-1 loci at 14q32 and 11q13, we detected and mapped a t(11;14) breakpoint in 35 of 36 MCL. In 5 cases complex mono-allelic rearrangements at both sides of the cyclin D1 gene were identified. In 13 HCL with phenotypic evidence of Ig class switching, including 2 cases with solely IgD, fiber FISH revealed concordant Ig class switch deletions. In most cases both alleles were affected.

We have synthesized a group of square planar gold(III) complexes, all containing at least two gold-chloride bonds in cis-position, and tested their in vitro cytotoxicity on a panel of established human tumor cell lines. Remarkably, all these compounds showed significant cytotoxic effects. In particular, the complexes containing the salycilaldiminate ligand induced tumor cell growth inhibitory effects comparable to or even greater than cisplatin. All gold(III) complexes substantially retained their antitumor potency against two cisplatin-resistant tumor cell lines (CCRF-CEM/R leukemia and A2780/R ovarian carcinoma); only minimal cross-resistance with cisplatin was observed. When considering the mechanism of action, it is reasonable to assume that the cytotoxicity of these gold(III) complexes derives from DNA binding. Preliminary spectroscopic results are consistent with this hypothesis; indeed, circular dichroism experiments show that both the salycilaldiminate- and the pyridine-containing gold(III) complexes bind calf thymus DNA in vitro and alter reversibly its B-type solution conformation. These results, however, must be treated with caution; solution studies indicate that gold(III) compounds are poorly stable under physiological conditions, possibly implying that, when injected, only a small amount will reach, unchanged, the DNA target. The results of our investigations are discussed in the perspective of future work on the cytotoxic and antitumor properties of gold(III) compounds.","['Calamai, P', 'Carotti, S', 'Guerri, A', 'Mazzei, T', 'Messori, L', 'Mini, E', 'Orioli, P', 'Speroni, G P']","['Calamai P', 'Carotti S', 'Guerri A', 'Mazzei T', 'Messori L', 'Mini E', 'Orioli P', 'Speroni GP']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA Adducts', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gold', 'Humans', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/02/25 00:00,1998/02/25 00:01,['1998/02/25 00:00'],"['1998/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1998 Jan;13(1):67-80.,,,,,,,,,,

Population and autopsy based studies have shown no increased risk, which is at variance with several institutional analyses. A retrospective review was performed with comparison to expected cancer data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of a cohort of prostate cancer patients treated with staging pelvic lymphadenectomy and definitive radiotherapy between November 1, 1974 and July 7, 1987 were reviewed. Median potential followup from date of diagnosis was 10.9 years. RESULTS: Of the 164 patients 150 (91.5%) had followup to death or to August 1995, with data available in part on 4 of the remaining patients. In 43 patients 51 second primary malignancies developed. Increased frequency of lymphomas, and kidney, bladder and rectal lesions (all p < 0.001) was observed concurrently with diagnosis of prostate cancer, although this may be due to bias since full staging for the prostate cancer may have led to their diagnosis. An increased frequency of renal lesions in the 1 to 4-year followup period (p = 0.032) also was observed. Two sarcomas and a leukemia were putatively radiation induced but their frequency was not significantly different from the comparison baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Much of the apparent increase in second primary malignancies associated with prostate cancer noted by some authors may be attributed to bias in the staging process. Renal cancers may occur more frequently in patients with prostate cancer but the distribution of these lesions is inconsistent with a field defect mechanism of cancer induction.","['Johnstone, P A', 'Powell, C R', 'Riffenburgh, R', 'Rohde, D C', 'Kane, C J']","['Johnstone PA', 'Powell CR', 'Riffenburgh R', 'Rohde DC', 'Kane CJ']","['Radiation Oncology Division and Urology, Naval Medical Center, San Diego, California 92134-5000, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,,IM,"['Aged', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",1998/02/25 00:00,1998/02/25 00:01,['1998/02/25 00:00'],"['1998/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-5347(01)63777-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Urol. 1998 Mar;159(3):946-9.,,,,,,,,,,

After eliminating duplications, the criteria in each protocol were enumerated and classified according to a novel schema. NSABP trials contained significantly more criteria than POG trials, and added precision criteria (making study populations homogeneous) at a faster rate than POG studies. The difference between NSABP studies (explanatory trials) and POG studies (pragmatic trials) suggest that large numbers of eligibility criteria are not necessary for quality studies. We recommend that: (1) the inclusion/exclusion criteria distinction be abandoned; (2) eligibility criteria be explicitly justified; (3) the need for each criterion be assessed when new trials are planned; (4) criteria in phase III trials restricting patient accrual be minimized; and (5) further research be done to assess the impact of criteria on generalizability.","['Fuks, A', 'Weijer, C', 'Freedman, B', 'Shapiro, S', 'Skrutkowska, M', 'Riaz, A']","['Fuks A', 'Weijer C', 'Freedman B', 'Shapiro S', 'Skrutkowska M', 'Riaz A']","['Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Epidemiol,Journal of clinical epidemiology,8801383,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Canada', 'Child', 'Clinical Protocols/standards', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', '*Patient Selection', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Time Factors']",1998/02/25 00:00,1998/02/25 00:01,['1998/02/25 00:00'],"['1998/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0895435697002400 [pii]', '10.1016/s0895-4356(97)00240-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Epidemiol. 1998 Feb;51(2):69-79. doi: 10.1016/s0895-4356(97)00240-0.,,,,,,,,,,

Data were collected through a survey of a sample of 29 mothers whose children were diagnosed with some form of childhood cancer, mainly leukemia. Family functioning was positively related to both caregiver adaptation and doctor-parent relationship. Mothers who reported decreased maternal depression and burden were significantly more likely to report respectively improved spousal relationships and improved spousal communication. Mothers reporting more positive doctor-parent relationships also described themselves as having improved relationships with spouse and child, and improved spousal communication. Maternal well-being and doctor-parent relationship were not directly related. By suggesting that both intrapsychic and instrumental maternal adaptation are influenced by positive relationships in the family, this study provides support for the social ecological model of stress. The possibility that family factors exert a direct influence on both caregiver intrapsychic well-being and instrumental skills argues for the importance of their being carefully considered in any models evaluating caregiver adaptation.","['Shapiro, J', 'Perez, M', 'Warden, M J']","['Shapiro J', 'Perez M', 'Warden MJ']","['Department of Family Medicine, University of California, Irvine, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'California', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Depression/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Psychological', 'Mothers/*psychology', '*Neoplasms', 'Nuclear Family/*psychology', '*Professional-Family Relations']",1998/02/25 00:00,1998/02/25 00:01,['1998/02/25 00:00'],"['1998/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4542(98)90007-8 [pii]', '10.1177/104345429801500107 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 1998 Jan;15(1):47-54. doi: 10.1177/104345429801500107.,['ID15 PE 10046/PE/BHP HRSA HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Immunoprecipitation revealed two antigen specificities on REH6 cells of m.w. 220 kDa and 190 kDa, both presenting wide range of isoelectric point pI approximately 6.0-7.5. Nonrestricted CD45 epitopes were not affected by the sialyl acid cleavage with sodium metaperiodate or neuraminidase, but were sensitive to both, tunicamycin, the N-glycosylation inhibitor and monensin, an inhibitor of protein transport through the Golgi compartment. O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase from Pasteurella haemolytica A1 partially cleaved CD45RA and CD45RB epitopes, while nonrestricted CD45 determinants were not affected by this enzyme. Limited proteolysis of this antigen resulted in the appearance of 160-180 kDa peptide domains which retained CD45 epitopes. Further, the treatment of cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induced marked down-regulation of 220 and 190 kDa isoforms and the appearance of new 210, 180 and 170 kDa variant glycoprotein forms which were not found on parental cells. This PMA effect was not accompanied by the programmed cell death and was markedly blocked by a nonselective protein kinase (PK) inhibitor isoquinoline sulfonamide H7. Modulation of CD45 by phorbol esters might serve as an in vitro model for an additional insight into the function of CD45 in hematopoietic cells.","['Duraj, J', 'Sedlak, J', 'Rauko, P', 'Chorvath, B']","['Duraj J', 'Sedlak J', 'Rauko P', 'Chorvath B']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '84477-73-6 (1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-3-methylpiperazine)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*drug effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/02/25 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1997;44(4):205-11.,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 52 children with ALL in first relapse received high-dose cytosine arabinoside and L-asparaginase (HDAraC/L-Asp) after failed attempts to achieve CR2. AraC was given at a dose of 3 gm/m2 q12 h x 4 on days 0-1 and 7-8. L-asparaginase was given IM 6,000 IU/m2 3 hours after completion of each 2-day cycle of AraC. RESULTS: Of the 42 surviving to day 28, 22 (42% of all patients) achieved CR2. Ten died before day 28 (19%); four from leukemia and six from infections or toxicity (12% regimen-related mortality), There were 17 bacterial infections (three fatal), 17 invasive fungal infections (12 fatal), one fatal adenoviral infection, and one-non-fatal Pneumocystis pneumonia. One patient was surviving when lost to follow-up at four months and one patient survives over 5 years after transplant. Sixteen of the 22 patients who entered CR2 subsequently relapsed, five died of non-leukemic causes, and one was lost to follow-up.

Treatment of K562 cells with PMA results in growth arrest, polyploidy, morphological changes, and increased cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion. These PMA-induced changes in K562 cells are preceded by a rapid rise in the activity of MEK (MAP kinase/extracellular regulated kinases) that leads to a sustained activation of ERK2 (extracellular regulated kinase; MAPK). Blockade of MEK1 activation by PD098059, a recently described specific MEK inhibitor [D. T. Dudley et al. (1995). Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92, 7686-7689], reverses both the growth arrest and the morphological changes of K562 cells induced by PMA treatment. These changes are not associated with a disruption of PMA-induced down-regulation of BCR-ABL kinase or early integrin signaling events but are associated with a block of the cell-surface expression of the gpIIb/IIIa (CD41) integrin, a cell marker of megakaryocytic differentiation. These results demonstrate that the PMA-induced signaling cascade initiated by protein kinase C activation requires the activity of the MEK/ERK signaling complex to regulate cell cycle arrest, thus regulating the program that leads to the cell-surface expression of markers associated with megakaryocytic differentiation.","['Herrera, R', 'Hubbell, S', 'Decker, S', 'Petruzzelli, L']","['Herrera R', 'Hubbell S', 'Decker S', 'Petruzzelli L']","['Department of Cell Biology, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division of Warner-Lambert Company, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105, USA.

J. Bhat et al. (1997) Hypertension 29(Pt. 2), 356-360]. In the present study, we observed that exposure of CCL39 cells (a Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line) to alpha-thrombin resulted in a time-dependent decrease in basal SIF-A activity. We hypothesized that the decrease in basal SIF-A was due to the initiation of an inhibitory pathway, following alpha-thrombin exposure. To test this hypothesis, we determined if alpha-thrombin would inhibit Stat3 and SIF-A activation by interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). In support of this hypothesis, alpha-thrombin inhibited the Stat3/SIF-A response induced by all the above cytokines. The inhibition by alpha-thrombin was concentration dependent, was sensitive to hirudin, and was mimicked by the thrombin receptor agonist peptide. The inhibition did not require the activation of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-sensitive isoforms of protein kinase C and was reversed by pretreatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAPKK1 or MEK1) inhibitor PD98059. Inhibitory cross talk between alpha-thrombin and IL-6 was also observed in MRC-5 cells, a fibroblast cell line derived from human lung tissue. Thus, we identify a novel alpha-thrombin inhibitory pathway which, acting through a MAPKK1-dependent mechanism, blocks IL-6-, LIF-, and CNTF-induced Stat3/SIF-A activation. This inhibitory cross talk may provide an important regulatory function to modulate gene transcription by these cytokines, during immune and inflammatory responses.","['Bhat, G J', 'Hunt, R A', 'Baker, K M']","['Bhat GJ', 'Hunt RA', 'Baker KM']","['Research Program, Sigfried and Janet Weis Center for Research, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 100 North Academy Avenue, Danville, Pennsylvania 17822, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thrombin/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(97)90520-8 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1997.0520 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1998 Feb 15;350(2):307-14. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1997.0520.,['HL09484/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,

The German CML Study Group.,1810-9,"Hydroxyurea, interferon, and HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplantation are common therapies for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. Which is best is controversial. The purpose of this study was to compare survival of patients with CML receiving HLA-identical sibling transplants versus hydroxyurea or interferon. The transplant cohort included 548 recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants, reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. The nontransplant cohort included 196 patients receiving hydroxyurea (n = 121) or interferon (n = 75) on a randomized trial of the German CML Study Group. Survivals were compared using proportional hazards regression with fixed and time-dependent variables to adjust for patient differences and changing risks over time. For the first 18 months after diagnosis, mortality was higher in the transplant than the nontransplant cohort (relative risk [RR], 5.85; P < .0001). From 18 to 56 months, mortality was similar (RR, 0.80; P = .38). After 56 months, mortality was lower in the transplant cohort (RR, 0.16; P < .0001). Seven-year survival probabilities (95% confidence interval) were 58% (50% to 66%) with transplant and 32% (22% to 41%) with hydroxyurea or interferon. There was a significant survival advantage for hydroxyurea or interferon in the first 4 years after diagnosis and for transplants starting 5.5 years after diagnosis. For transplants done within 1 year of diagnosis, the survival advantage for transplantation began earlier. Survival advantage for transplants was greater and occurred earlier in patients with intermediate- and high-risk prognostic features than in those with low-risk features. This study confirms higher early mortality, but a long-term survival advantage for HLA-identical sibling transplants over hydroxyurea or interferon in CML.","['Gale, R P', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Zhang, M J', 'Hasford, J', 'Goldman, J M', 'Heimpel, H', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Klein, J P', 'Kolb, H J', 'McGlave, P B', 'Passweg, J R', 'Rowlings, P A', 'Sobocinski, K A', 'Horowitz, M M']","['Gale RP', 'Hehlmann R', 'Zhang MJ', 'Hasford J', 'Goldman JM', 'Heimpel H', 'Hochhaus A', 'Klein JP', 'Kolb HJ', 'McGlave PB', 'Passweg JR', 'Rowlings PA', 'Sobocinski KA', 'Horowitz MM']","['International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Health Policy Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Interferons/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57161-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 1;91(5):1810-9.,['P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In such cases, large tumor cells have the morphological and immunophenotypic features of classical Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells. However, it is not known whether the H-RS cells arise from transformation of the underlying CLL cells or from a different pathological process. We report herein a study of the clonal relationship between the CLL cells and the H-RS cells in three cases of Richter's syndrome with HD features by using a single cell assay. We isolated single CLL cells and H-RS cells from immunostained tissue sections by micromanipulation. The immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) complementarity determining region (CDR) III of each cell was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The products were then compared by gel electrophoresis and nucleotide sequencing. The IgH CDRIII sequences from the H-RS cells were identical to those from the CLL cells in two cases. In one case, the clonal relationship between the two types of cells could not be determined because PCR products could not be obtained from any of the H-RS cells. This study shows that the H-RS cells and the CLL cells belong to the same clonal population in some cases of Richter's syndrome with HD features. Furthermore, our findings indicate that mature B cells can undergo transformation to cells with the features of H-RS cells, in association with a cellular background typical of HD. This study also supports recent findings suggesting that the H-RS cells in classical HD are derived from transformed B cells.","['Ohno, T', 'Smir, B N', 'Weisenburger, D D', 'Gascoyne, R D', 'Hinrichs, S D', 'Chan, W C']","['Ohno T', 'Smir BN', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Hinrichs SD', 'Chan WC']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-3135, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/chemistry', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/*pathology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57154-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 1;91(5):1757-61.,,,,,,,,,,

In heterogeneous clinical samples, apoptosis cannot be detected by standard methods in small cellular subsets. We developed, therefore, a combined assay of in situ end-labeling of nicked DNA by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase, with measurements of cellular DNA content and surface antigens (CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19) by multiparametric flow cytometry. This assay was used to determine F-ara-A-induced apoptosis in different lymphocyte subsets from CLL patients and normal controls treated with F-ara-A in vitro. Apoptosis was also correlated to bcl-2 protein levels. We observed a direct effect of F-ara-A on both B-CLL and T lymphocytes. The response to F-ara-A in B-CLL lymphocytes in vitro was Rai stage-dependent, the early-stages being more responsive (P = .01). Higher levels of spontaneous apoptosis were observed in B-CLL lymphocytes from early stage patients (P = .02). No difference was observed in spontaneous apoptosis of normal T cells in B-CLL, although T lymphocytes in late-stage disease were more sensitive to F-ara-A-induced apoptosis. Incubation with cyclosporin A did not affect B-CLL and T-lymphocyte survival compared with control cultures.

The Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group.,1716-22,"The cryptic translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22) has been recently recognized as the most common genetic rearrangement in B-lineage childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The resulting fusion transcript, termed TEL-AML1, has been associated with an excellent prognosis at initial ALL diagnosis. Hence, we postulated that the incidence of TEL-AML1 fusion should be lower in patients with ALL relapse. To address this assumption and to investigate the prognostic significance of TEL-AML1 expression in relapsed childhood ALL, bone marrow samples of 146 children were analyzed by reverse-transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All children were treated according to Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) ALL relapse trial protocols (ALL-REZ BFM 90-96). Their clinical features and outcome were compared with those of 262 patients who could not be tested due to lack of bone marrow samples. Thirty-two of 146 children with relapsed ALL were TEL-AML1-positive. Four of the negative patients had T-lineage and nine Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive leukemia. Thus, the incidence of TEL-AML1 in relapsed Ph1-negative, B-cell precursor ALL is 32 of 133 (24%). The 32 TEL-AML1-positive and 101 negative patients differed significantly with respect to duration of last remission (42.5 v 27 months; P = . 0001) and age at initial diagnosis (53.5 v 74 months; P = .0269). At a median follow-up time of 21.5 months, children positive for TEL-AML1 had a significantly (P = .0011) higher probability of event-free survival (EFS; 0.79 v 0.33). The predominant majority of patients had been treated for initial ALL according to German multicenter BFM (108 of 133) or Cooperative ALL study group (CoALL) (19 of 133) frontline protocols. The comparison of tested and not-tested (N = 262) patients showed no significant difference. TEL-AML1 positivity predicted a favorable short-term outcome; long-term results are unknown. Screening for TEL-AML1 should become routine at relapse diagnosis and might be used for therapy stratification in future trials.","['Seeger, K', 'Adams, H P', 'Buchwald, D', 'Beyermann, B', 'Kremens, B', 'Niemeyer, C', 'Ritter, J', 'Schwabe, D', 'Harms, D', 'Schrappe, M', 'Henze, G']","['Seeger K', 'Adams HP', 'Buchwald D', 'Beyermann B', 'Kremens B', 'Niemeyer C', 'Ritter J', 'Schwabe D', 'Harms D', 'Schrappe M', 'Henze G']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charit-e-Virchow-Klinikum, Humboldt-University at Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57149-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 1;91(5):1716-22.,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports have indicated that a variety of apoptotic stimuli cause the preapoptotic mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (cyt c) into cytosol, which mediates the cleavage and activity of caspase-3 involved in the execution of apoptosis. Whether Bcr-Abl exerts its antiapoptotic effect upstream to the cleavage and activation of caspase-3 or acts downstream by blocking the ensuing degradation of substrates resulting in apoptosis, has been the focus of the present studies. In these, we used (1) the human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) HL-60 cells that are stably transfected with the bcr-abl gene (HL-60/Bcr-Abl) and express p185 Bcr-Abl; and (2) the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)-blast crisis K562 cells, which have endogenous expression of p210 Bcr-Abl. Exposure of the control AML HL-60 cells to high-dose Ara-C (HIDAC), etoposide, or sphingoid bases (including C2 ceramide, sphingosine, or sphinganine) caused the accumulation of cyt c in the cytosol, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and increase in the reactive oxygen species (ROS). These preapoptotic events were associated with the cleavage and activity of caspase-3, resulting in the degradation of poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and morphologic features of apoptosis. In contrast, in HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells, these apoptotic stimuli failed to cause the cytosolic accumulation of cyt c and other associated mitochondrial perturbations, as well as the failure to induce the activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis. While the control HL-60 cells showed high levels of Bcl-2 and barely detectable Bcl-xL, HL-60/Bcr-Abl cells expressed high levels of Bcl-xL and undetectable levels of Bcl-2, a pattern of expression similar to the one in K562 cells. Bax and caspase-3 expressions were not significantly different between HL-60/Bcr-Abl or K562 versus HL-60 cells. These findings indicate that Bcr-Abl expression blocks apoptosis due to diverse apoptotic stimuli upstream by preventing the cytosolic accumulation of cyt c and other preapoptotic mitochondrial perturbations, thereby inhibiting the activation of caspase-3 and execution of apoptosis.","['Amarante-Mendes, G P', 'Naekyung Kim, C', 'Liu, L', 'Huang, Y', 'Perkins, C L', 'Green, D R', 'Bhalla, K']","['Amarante-Mendes GP', 'Naekyung Kim C', 'Liu L', 'Huang Y', 'Perkins CL', 'Green DR', 'Bhalla K']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Winship Cancer Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sphingolipids/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57147-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 1;91(5):1700-5.,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the roles of AML1/ETO(MTG8) and AML1/Evi-1 in leukemogenesis, we investigated subcellular localization of these chimeric proteins by immunofluorescence labeling and subcellular fractionation of COS-7 cells that express these chimeric proteins. AML1/ETO(MTG8) and AML1/Evi-1 are nuclear proteins, as is wild-type AML1. Polyomavirus enhancer binding protein (PEBP)2beta(core binding factor [CBF]beta), a heterodimerizing partner of AML1 that is located mainly in the cytoplasm, was translocated into the nucleus with dependence on the runt domain of AML1/ETO(MTG8) or AML1/Evi-1 when coexpressed with these chimeric proteins. When a comparable amount of wild-type AML1 or the chimeric proteins was coexpressed with PEBP2beta(CBFbeta), more of the cells expressing the chimeric proteins showed the nuclear accumulation of PEBP2beta(CBFbeta), as compared with the cells expressing wild-type AML1. We also showed that the chimeric proteins associate with PEBP2beta(CBFbeta) more effectively than wild-type AML1. These data suggest that the chimeric proteins are able to accumulate PEBP2beta(CBFbeta) in the nucleus more efficiently than wild-type AML1, probably because of the higher affinities of the chimeric proteins for PEBP2beta(CBFbeta) than that of wild-type AML1. These effects of the chimeric proteins on the cellular distribution of PEBP2beta(CBFbeta) possibly cause the dominant negative properties of the chimeric proteins over wild-type AML1 and account for one of the mechanisms through which these chimeric proteins contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Tanaka, K', 'Tanaka, T', 'Kurokawa, M', 'Imai, Y', 'Ogawa, S', 'Mitani, K', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Tanaka K', 'Tanaka T', 'Kurokawa M', 'Imai Y', 'Ogawa S', 'Mitani K', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57146-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 1;91(5):1688-99.,,,,,,,,,,

This molecule is involved in the pathogenesis of prion diseases in both humans and animals. We have characterized the expression patterns of PrPC during human leukocyte maturation by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies to PrPC, the glycan moiety CD15, and the stem cell marker CD34. We observe that prion protein is present on CD34+ bone marrow (BM) stem cells. Although lymphocytes and monocytes maintain PrPC expression throughout their differentiation, PrPC is downregulated upon differentiation along the granulocyte lineage. In vitro retinoic acid-induced differentiation of the premyeloid line HL-60 into granulocyte-like cells mimics the suppression of PrPC in granulocyte differentiation, as both PrPC mRNA and protein are downregulated. These data suggest that selected BM cells and peripheral mononuclear cells may support prion agent replication, because this process is dependent on availability of PrPC. Additionally, retinoic acid-induced extinction of PrPC expression in HL-60 cells provides a potential model to study PrP gene regulation and protein function. Finally, these data suggest the existence of cell-specific glycoforms of PrPC that may determine cellular susceptibility to infection by the prion agent.","['Dodelet, V C', 'Cashman, N R']","['Dodelet VC', 'Cashman NR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Prions)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/chemistry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes/*chemistry/*cytology', 'Lewis X Antigen/analysis', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Monocytes/chemistry', 'Prions/*analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57131-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 1;91(5):1556-61.,,,,,,,,,,

The murine ELM erythroleukemia is an interesting model because the erythroid progenitors retain dependence on bone marrow-derived stromal cells for long-term growth in vitro, and they also undergo erythroid differentiation in the presence of erythropoietin (EPO) and interleukin-3 (IL-3). In this report, we have shown using neutralizing antibodies that stem cell factor (SCF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, and integrin signaling pathways are all involved. We then determined whether ELM cells can be maintained long-term without stroma in various combinations of growth factors produced by stroma cells or growth factors for which ELM cells have receptors. This showed that ELM cells could be maintained with high efficiency in SCF alone; furthermore, the cells remained absolutely SCF-dependent and did not become more tumorigenic than cells maintained on stroma. In contrast, ELM cells underwent clonal extinction when serially cloned in IGF1; any cells that survived long-term growth in IGF-1 were found to be IGF1-independent. One important difference between maintaining ELM cells on stroma and growth in SCF is that stroma reversibly inhibits their differentiation in response to EPO and IL-3, whereas SCF does not.","[""O'Prey, J"", 'Leslie, N', 'Itoh, K', 'Ostertag, W', 'Bartholomew, C', 'Harrison, P R']","[""O'Prey J"", 'Leslie N', 'Itoh K', 'Ostertag W', 'Bartholomew C', 'Harrison PR']","['Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, CRC Beatson Laboratories, Bearsden, Glasgow G61 1BD, Scotland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/pharmacology', 'Integrins/physiology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57130-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Mar 1;91(5):1548-55.,,,,,,,,,,

A significant amount of variant telomeric repeats (a telomeric sequence having one-base mismatch within the authentic telomeric repeat TTAGGG) was found in this region. The variant telomeric repeat has been shown to be present in the proximal region of telomeres and does not perform telomeric functions by itself. Therefore, these results indicated that the telomeres had already been critically shortened when the jumps occurred.

Thirty mice were inoculated with LP-BM5; 30 received vehicle (DMEM) injections. Fifteen LP-BM5 and 15 DMEM mice were trained in avoidance 7 wk after inoculation; retention of the avoidance response was tested 4 wk later. The remaining mice were trained 11 wk after inoculation. In animals trained 7 wk after inoculation, the groups performed similarly, with a marginally significant tendency for LP-BM5-infected animals to make more avoidance responses. This group difference was significant when animals were retested at 11 wk. However, LP-BM5 animals trained 11 wk after inoculation made significantly fewer avoidance responses than controls trained at the same time. We conclude that in later stages of disease, LP-BM5 impairs response acquisition, but not performance, in the active avoidance procedure.

A comparative analysis was performed in transplanted patients not affected by aGVHD and in other conditions commonly associated with peripheral eosinophilia, i.e., interleukin (IL)-2 immunotherapy and allergy. CD25, recognizing the p55 subunit of IL-2 receptor, was detected in all patients with aGVHD except two who, at the onset of eosinophilia, were already receiving methylprednisolone intravenously. The specificity of our findings is confirmed by the absence of reactivity with anti-CD25 mAb in PBEs from transplanted patients not affected by aGVHD. Interestingly, the expression of CD25 progressively declined after steroid therapy. CD25 was also expressed after rhIL-2 administration, probably reflecting analogous mechanisms of eosinophil activation. No aGVHD or rhIL-2-treated patient showed reactivity with anti-CD4, CD23, or HLA-DR. CD25 and CD23 antigens were detected in 29% and 36% of allergic patients only. The accessibility of the EG2 epitope was significantly enhanced in all study groups compared with controls. In vitro activation of normal eosinophils with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate upregulated CD9 and EG2 expression but failed to induce the CD25 antigen, suggesting that selective activating stimuli may be required. The functional significance of in vivo CD25 expression and the role of activated PBEs in the development of cellular and cytokine-mediated tissue destructive processes in aGVHD remain to be clarified.","['Rumi, C', 'Rutella, S', 'Bonini, S', 'Bonini, S', 'Lambiase, A', 'Sica, S', 'Puggioni, P', 'Salutari, P', 'Etuk, B', 'Leone, G']","['Rumi C', 'Rutella S', 'Bonini S', 'Bonini S', 'Lambiase A', 'Sica S', 'Puggioni P', 'Salutari P', 'Etuk B', 'Leone G']","['Center for the Flow Cytometric Study of Blood Cells, Catholic University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'Child', 'Eosinophilia/etiology/immunology/therapy', 'Eosinophils/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*blood/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, IgE/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/02/24 00:00,1998/02/24 00:01,['1998/02/24 00:00'],"['1998/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 Feb;26(2):170-8.,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the influence of selective T cell depletion of allogeneic PBPC grafts on graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) activity and investigated the effectiveness of ex vivo treatment with NK cell-activating cytokines to compensate for the putative loss of T cell-derived factors stimulating natural cytotoxicity. After pretreatment of Balb/c (H-2d) recipients with 7.5 Gy of total body irradiation, 2x10(7) rhG-CSF-mobilized PBPCs of splenectomized syngeneic or MHC-identical DBA (H-2d) mice were transferred. Selective T cell depletion (TCD) was performed by immunomagnetic purging with a mononoclonal antibody directed against CD3. In some experimental groups, T cell-depleted PBPCs were incubated with 200 U/mL interleukin (IL)-2 and 100 U/mL IL-12 for 24 hours. To investigate antileukemic activity in vivo, recipient mice were inoculated with 1x10(5) A20 cells (a B-lymphoblastic leukemia of Balb/c origin) 2 days before PBPC transplantation (PBPCT). After transplantation of unmanipulated allogeneic cells, 25% of the animals died with signs of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) but 71% were free from relapse 100 days after PBPCT. After TCD of allogeneic grafts with anti-CD3, the incidence of GVH-related mortality was below 5% but the leukemia-free survival rate was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased to 25% and thus was similar to that observed after syngeneic PBPCT (17%). When CD3-depleted grafts were incubated with IL-2 and IL-12, 45% of the animals remained free from leukemia; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Our results suggest that ex vivo activation of residual NK cells with IL-2 and IL-12 does not fully compensate for the abrogation of GVL activity after depletion of CD3+ T cells from MHC-matched PBPCT.","['Uharek, L', 'Glass, B', 'Zeis, M', 'Dreger, P', 'Steinmann, J', 'Loffler, H', 'Schmitz, N']","['Uharek L', 'Glass B', 'Zeis M', 'Dreger P', 'Steinmann J', 'Loffler H', 'Schmitz N']","['Department of Internal Medicine II and Institute of Immunology, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology/*therapy', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Filgrastim', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/*immunology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-12/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Splenectomy', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1998/02/24 00:00,1998/02/24 00:01,['1998/02/24 00:00'],"['1998/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 Feb;26(2):93-9.,,,,,,,,,,

In a first set of experiments, CD34+ cells were infected with supernatant containing amphotropic retroviral particles carrying the nls-lacZ reporter gene and the effects of centrifugation, cell adhesion to fibronectin, and Polybrene on the transduction of both clonogenic progenitors (CFC) and long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-IC) were studied. Transduction efficiency was evaluated on the percentage and total number of progenitors expressing the beta-galactosidase activity. Results show that a 48-hr infection of CD34+ cells with viral supernatant combining centrifugation at 1000 x g for 3 hr followed by adhesion to fibronectin allows transduction levels for both CFC and LTC-IC to be reached that are as good as using direct co-cultivation. In a second set of experiments, CD34+ cells were infected using this optimized protocol with pseudotyped retroviral particles carrying the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelope protein. Under these conditions, between 50 and 100% of CFC and LTC-IC were transduced.

To investigate the potential of genetically engineering hematopoietic precursors, CD34+ progenitors were selected from cord blood, bone marrow, and peripheral blood mobilized stem cells (patients + solid tumors) and transduced with FOCH-Neo. High transduction rates were achieved using virus supernatant and minimal doses of hematopoietic growth factors during pretransduction and transduction steps. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay investigating the presence of both neomycin-encoding and viral vector sequences tested positive in 45-90% of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) generating cells (bone marrow and peripheral blood derived cells) following transduction.

In those experiments where long-term in vitro cultures could be maintained over 5 weeks (all cord blood and 5 among 23 PBSC), efficient transduction of long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) hematopoietic progenitors was demonstrated on the basis of both resistance to G418 and virus integration.

In these experiments, GaLV and amphotropic virus were equally efficient in transducing early human progenitors. Importantly, mixing amphotropic and GaLV pseudotyped retroviruses resulted in significantly higher transduction efficiencies as compared with single infections, up to 70% vector-positive CFU-GM. Glucocerebrosidase activity, measured in the progeny of human CD34+ cells, increased up to 460% compared with mock-infected CD34+ cells. Upon transduction of Gaucher CD34+ bone marrow cells the glucocerebrosidase deficiency was reversed.","['Havenga, M', 'Fisher, R', 'Hoogerbrugge, P', 'Roberts, B', 'Valerio, D', 'van Es, H H']","['Havenga M', 'Fisher R', 'Hoogerbrugge P', 'Roberts B', 'Valerio D', 'van Es HH']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Medical Faculty, Leiden University, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 3.2.1.45 (Glucosylceramidase)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology/immunology', 'Gaucher Disease/immunology/*therapy', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Glucosylceramidase/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Retroviridae']",1998/02/24 00:00,1998/02/24 00:01,['1998/02/24 00:00'],"['1998/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300532 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1997 Dec;4(12):1393-400. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300532.,,,,,,,,,,

A central problem of this strategy is the targeting of tumor cells to avoid damage to normal ones. It has been noticed that transduction of wt-p53 into a large number of cancer cells induces tumor suppression. In contrast, some observations suggest that introduction of exogenous wt-p53 into nontransformed cells does not impair proliferation. If normal bone marrow (BM) cells are not affected by wt-p53 transduction, BM purging from p53-responding leukemic cells might be achieved in vitro by delivering the wild-type onco-suppressor to all marrow cells. We undertook a series of experiments to assess whether transduction of wt-p53 into normal hematopoietic cells is harmful. Two different wt-p53-recombinant retroviruses were used to infect primary, murine BM cells. Expression of exogenous wt-p53 in these cells did not affect in vitro colony formation, and did not induce any observable effects on morphology and differentiation. In contrast, the same viruses suppressed the tumor phenotype of v-src-transformed 32D cells. These results might open the way to gene therapy approaches to leukemias with the p53 gene without the need to target specifically and uniquely the tumor cells, sparing the normal ones.","['Scardigli, R', 'Bossi, G', 'Blandino, G', 'Crescenzi, M', 'Soddu, S', 'Sacchi, A']","['Scardigli R', 'Bossi G', 'Blandino G', 'Crescenzi M', 'Soddu S', 'Sacchi A']","['Molecular Oncogenesis Laboratory, Regina Elena Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genes, p53', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Retroviridae', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/24 00:00,1998/02/24 00:01,['1998/02/24 00:00'],"['1998/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3300530 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 1997 Dec;4(12):1371-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300530.,,,,,,,,,,

A preliminary report.,246-56,"We conducted a proportional mortality study of 1043 deaths among men who took part in an antimalarial campaign in Sardinia, Italy from 1946 to 1950. DDT comprised 94% of the insecticide used during the campaign, and was sprayed over the soil of the entire region at an average concentration of 10 mg/m2, as well as in all dwellings and animal shelters. Expected deaths were derived from the proportional mortality rates of the general Italian male population, specific by cause, 5-year age groups, and 5-year calendar periods in the period from 1956 to 1992. The proportional mortality ratio (PMR) for cardiovascular diseases was significantly decreased, while nonmalignant respiratory diseases showed a 22% increase in risk of borderline statistical significance. Significant increases in risk among workers exposed to DDT in application or inspection jobs were observed for liver and biliary tract cancer (PMR = 228; 95% C.I. = 143-345) and multiple myeloma (PMR = 341; 95% C.I. = 110-795). The PMR for myeloid leukemia was also increased (PMR = 189; 95% C.I. = 38-552), although it was not statistically significant. PMRs for liver and biliary tract cancer and myeloid leukemia were also elevated among workers who did not have direct occupational contact with DDT (liver and biliary cancer: PMR = 210; 95% C.I. = 117-346; myeloid leukemia: PMR = 170; 95% C.I. = 19-614). No trends occurred according to length of employment in exposed jobs. These preliminary results are somewhat in agreement with experimental studies in rodents and previous epidemiologic findings. Expansion of the cohort to include all applications, and collection of information to improve exposure assessment is needed to clarify these findings.","['Cocco, P', 'Blair, A', 'Congia, P', 'Saba, G', 'Ecca, A R', 'Palmas, C']","['Cocco P', 'Blair A', 'Congia P', 'Saba G', 'Ecca AR', 'Palmas C']","['Istituto di Medicina del Lavoro, Universita di Cagliari, Italy. coccop@pacs.unica.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Insecticides)', 'CIW5S16655 (DDT)']",IM,"['DDT/*poisoning', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Insecticides/*poisoning', 'Italy', 'Malaria/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Time Factors']",1998/02/24 00:00,1998/02/24 00:01,['1998/02/24 00:00'],"['1998/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb56878.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1997 Dec 26;837:246-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb56878.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Cases have been confirmed through hospital record review of 95 percent of the cancers. Exposures are based on measured values of the two chemicals from personal monitoring data in seven of the eight plants under study. The results indicate that the risk of leukemia increases with exposure to a time-weighted average butadiene measure. The odds ratio at only 1 ppm average butadiene exposure is 1.50 (95% CI 1.07, 2.10). Work in specific areas also contributes to the risk, possibly because these areas have not been completely characterized for differences in butadiene exposure. Hodgkins disease is also associated with butadiene exposure. Multiple myeloma, lymphosarcoma, and all lymphomas are associated with exposure to styrene. Since workers in this industry are apparently exposed to two carcinogenic agents, further effort must be made to distinguish the exposures to each chemical over time and to characterize their interrelationship with the risk of cancers of the lymphohematopoietic system.","['Matanoski, G', 'Elliott, E', 'Tao, X', 'Francis, M', 'Correa-Villasenor, A', 'Santos-Burgoa, C']","['Matanoski G', 'Elliott E', 'Tao X', 'Francis M', 'Correa-Villasenor A', 'Santos-Burgoa C']","['Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Styrenes)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)']",IM,"['Butadienes/*poisoning', '*Carcinogens', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Risk Factors', 'Rubber', 'Styrene', 'Styrenes/*poisoning', 'Time Factors']",1998/02/24 00:00,1998/02/24 00:01,['1998/02/24 00:00'],"['1998/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb56872.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1997 Dec 26;837:157-69. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb56872.x.,['OH-02730/OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Studies were conducted on 34 unselected patients and 34 age matched controls. Patients were in remission, off therapy for at least 20 months and from high risk (HR, n=21) and standard risk (SR, n=13) groups as described by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute protocols 87-01 and 91-01. Twenty-nine patients had received cranial irradiation, 7 on a hyperfractionated schedule. Power spectral analysis of the heart rate (PS/HRV) was performed on 30 min heart rate time series and time domain statistics were computed from 24 h Holter recordings. Left ventricular function was assessed by measuring ejection and shortening fractions on echocardiography. All such measures were normal. Analysis of PS/HRV revealed that the supine low frequency: high frequency (LF:HF) area ratio was elevated in patients compared to controls. Changes in the LF and HF power on standing were attenuated in the patients compared to controls. Circadian analysis revealed a depressed diurnal rhythm of heart rate in the patients. Those from the SR group showed greater reduction of the LF power response to orthostatic stress and a reduced circadian rhythm of the heart rate compared to those with HR ALL. Patients from the HR group showed reductions in both HF and LF power responses to orthostasis compared to controls. Elevated supine LF power and depressed circadian variation in the HF power band were evident only in female subjects. Patients who received standard cranial irradiation had higher LF:HF area ratio and diminished LF and HF power responses to orthostatic stress than did subjects in the hyperfractionated group. These findings suggest that the autonomic nervous regulation of the heart is compromised in patients treated for ALL in childhood even when resting echocardiographic measures provide no evidence of cardiac decompensation. The extent of neurocardiac dysfunction is influenced by risk status, gender and schedule of cranial irradiation.","['Kamath, M V', 'Halton, J', 'Harvey, A', 'Turner-Gomes, S', 'McArthur, A', 'Barr, R D']","['Kamath MV', 'Halton J', 'Harvey A', 'Turner-Gomes S', 'McArthur A', 'Barr RD']","['Health Sciences Centre, Room 3E25, McMaster University, 1200 Main Street West, Hamilton, Ontario, L8N 3Z5, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Autonomic Nervous System Diseases/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control/radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",1998/04/18 00:00,1998/04/18 00:01,['1998/04/18 00:00'],"['1998/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.12.3.635 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1998 Mar;12(3):635-40. doi: 10.3892/ijo.12.3.635.,,,,,,,,,,

These findings establish a role for SCL in embryonic angiogenesis and argue for critical functions in both embryonic blood and vascular cells, the descendents of the presumptive hemangioblast.","['Visvader, J E', 'Fujiwara, Y', 'Orkin, S H']","['Visvader JE', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Orkin SH']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital and the Dana Farber Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gt(ROSA)26Sor non-coding RNA, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*embryology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Cardiovascular', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*genetics', 'Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Untranslated', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptor, TIE-2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Vitelline Membrane/blood supply', 'Yolk Sac/blood supply']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.12.4.473 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1998 Feb 15;12(4):473-9. doi: 10.1101/gad.12.4.473.,,,,,,,PMC316527,,,

In contrast to IL-5, which acts mainly as an eosinophil lineage specific factor in vivo, IL-3 and GM-CSF stimulate the survival, proliferation and development of various hematopoietic cell lineages and also multipotent progenitor cells. IL-5 has little effect on the survival or proliferation of the multipotent stem cell line FDCP-Mix A4 but does promote some eosinophil development. To investigate whether the lineage specificity of IL-5 is due to the restricted expression of the IL-5 receptor alpha subunit we transfected the FDCP-Mix A4 cells with a retroviral vector containing this alpha subunit. The ectopic expression of the IL-5 receptor alpha subunit in the FDCP-Mix cells did not increase the observed eosinophilic development but did stimulate survival and proliferation of the transfected cells when IL-5 was added. IL-5 thus acts like IL-3 in these cells, promoting proliferation and survival. The results suggest that IL-5, whilst having a capacity to promote proliferation, does not influence eosinophilic lineage commitment in these multipotent cells. The results further argue that the observed lineage specificity of IL-5 is probably due to factors in addition to the restricted expression of the IL-5 receptor alpha subunit.","['Pierce, A', 'Whetton, A D', 'Owen-Lynch, P J', 'Tavernier, J', 'Spooncer, E', 'Dexter, T M', 'Heyworth, C M']","['Pierce A', 'Whetton AD', 'Owen-Lynch PJ', 'Tavernier J', 'Spooncer E', 'Dexter TM', 'Heyworth CM']","['Leukemia Research Fund, Cellular Development Unit, UMIST, Manchester M60 1QD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-5)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Interleukin-5/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-5', 'Transfection']",1998/05/12 00:00,1998/05/12 00:01,['1998/05/12 00:00'],"['1998/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1998 Mar;111 ( Pt 6):815-23.,,,,,,,,,,

Contemporary treatment of leukemia is very complex and requires the application of cytostatics, biological therapy and transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells. The treatment of acute leukemia by cytostatics and induction protocols results in a rather high percentage of remissions, but unfortunately most of them cannot be preserved. Allogenic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood have given the best results in the treatment of acute and chronic leukemia. Anti-leukemic effect is bound to the previous chemoradiotherapy, particularly to the activity of donor's immunocompetent cells in the transplant, having an effect of a graft against leukemia. The cleansing of the autograft and isolation of stem cells together with the application of IL-2 will be a significant improvement of the efficacy of autologous transplantation in leukemia. It is realistic to expect that the treatment of malignant diseases such as leukemia will in near future, besides the already existing treatment methods, include molecular therapy at various cell levels, which will make possible a correction of the basic disorder in the process of malignant alteration of hematopoietic cells.","['Pejin, D', 'Stefanovic, N', 'Belic, A', 'Popovic, S', 'Spasojevic, J', 'Uzurov, V', 'Savic, I', 'Savic, A']","['Pejin D', 'Stefanovic N', 'Belic A', 'Popovic S', 'Spasojevic J', 'Uzurov V', 'Savic I', 'Savic A']","['Klinika za hematologiju, Medicinski fakultet, Novi Sad.']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Med Pregl,Medicinski pregled,2985249R,,IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy']",1998/02/21 00:00,1998/02/21 00:01,['1998/02/21 00:00'],"['1998/02/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Pregl. 1997 Nov-Dec;50(11-12):473-9.,,,,Savremeno lecenje leukemija i transplantacija maticne celije hematopoeze.,,,,,,

The first question was discussed by Ph. Travade, who presented the long term results from two trials of the French Cooperative Group in previously untreated stage A CLL patients and by Sue Richards who submitted to meta-analysis the data from the American, British, French, and Spanish groups. Consensus was reached to accept that the different randomized trials and the meta-analysis results clearly demonstrate that conventional CB schedules do not prolong survival in these patients. Since deferring therapy until it is required by disease progression to stages B or C does not compromise survival of these patients, therapy should be deferred until progression is observed. It is widely admitted that CB treatment provides relief from symptoms for a large proportion of patients. However, results from different trials presented indicate that at least at conventional schedules, CB is unlikely to prolong survival in CLL. However, Jaksic presented favorable results with high dose (i.e., 10-15 mg/day) continuous CB schedule. The role of purine analogues was discussed by M. Keating and A. Saven, who presented long term results in non-randomized studies with fludarabine (FDB) and 2-chloro-deoxyadenosine (CDA), respectively. In addition the results from two randomized American and French Trials were presented by K. Rai and M. Leporrier. Long term results indicate that purine analogues are active agents in CLL. Both drugs obtain important overall response rates (> 75%) and about 25% complete remissions. Long term results from MD Anderson series indicate that the median progression free interval is 30 months and that, in previously untreated patients, FDB is well tolerated. However, opportunistic infections and autoimmune complications are frequently observed in previously treated patients. Results from the American and French trials confirm that FDB is probably the best single agent in terms of response, since it appears to induce higher response rates than CB and anthracycline containing regimens. No important toxicities were observed in these series including exclusively previously untreated patients. The long term results from MD Anderson show a median survival of 5 years for CLL patients receiving FDB, which is not different to the historical results with other treatment modalities and is confirmed by the present results of the the American and French trials showing no improvement of the overall survival. These results suggest that purine analogues should be included in the list of drugs with proven efficacy in the initial treatment of patients with CLL. Although these drugs produce better responses, they do not cure CLL. For young patients with poor prognosis CLL, future attempts should be made to improve complete remissions at molecular level, which may lead towards significantly increasing the overall survival. Combination of purine analogues with other drugs, autologous transplantation and/or biological response modifiers like monoclonal antibodies or anti-idiotypic vaccines deserve investigation.","['Dighiero, G']",['Dighiero G'],"[""Institut Pasteur, Unite d'Immuno-Hematologie et d'Immunopathologie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Congress', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Purines)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Purines/therapeutic use']",1998/02/21 00:00,1998/02/21 00:01,['1998/02/21 00:00'],"['1998/02/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-997-0031-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1997 Nov;39 Suppl 1:S31-40. doi: 10.1007/s00282-997-0031-6.,,,78,,,,,,,

These are brought about by the interplay of cytokines produced through cell/cell contacts among malignant B cells, macrophages and T cells. 3) the view that the very properties of accumulating anergic self-reactive CD5+ B lymphocytes may provide a bridge between autoimmunity and immune incompetence. CD5+ malignant B cells influence the cytokine production by T cells, but are inefficient Ag presenting cells (APC). As such they are a hurdle to the production of normal Ab. However, by stimulating in vitro the CD40 molecule on the membrane of CLL cell with the CD40 ligand the inefficient APC is turned into an efficient APC. In vivo, such an activation may conceivably occur in specific environments like the spleen and favour the production by normal residual B-cells of polyclonal autoAb against red cell or platelet self Ag.","['Caligaris-Cappio, F']",['Caligaris-Cappio F'],"['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Congress', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,,IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmunity/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology']",1998/02/21 00:00,1998/02/21 00:01,['1998/02/21 00:00'],"['1998/02/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00282-997-0013-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1997 Nov;39 Suppl 1:S13-6. doi: 10.1007/s00282-997-0013-8.,,,15,,,,,,,

The development of new techniques such as FISH, comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) and a whole range of molecular methods is being applied to identify abnormalities in this relatively common B-cell leukaemia. The abnormalities may be of a different nature. There are some which are clearly associated with particular forms of the disease and usually with aggressive characteristics. The best examples are deletions at 11q23 seen in younger patients with generalised lymphadenopathy and inferior prognosis; trisomy 12, commonly associated with an increased proportion of prolymphocytes (CLL/PL) and more progressive disease; 17p abnormalities, chiefly mutations and deletions of p53, although rare, seem to be associated with transformation such as Richter syndrome, with CLL/PL and poor response to therapy. Abnormalities at 13q, though not correlated with particular clinical syndromes, are the subject of intense interest due to the possibility that one or more tumour suppressor genes relevant to the pathogenesis of CLL may be identified. Two areas in which work is being focused are 13q14 and 13q12. Finally, the incidence of familial cases of CLL, which has been known for a number of years, will lead to an international effort to collect familial cases, which ultimately will allow a genetic linkage study to discover a CLL ""susceptibility gene"".

The resistant cell line HL 60 R shows similar functional characteristics as the original HL 60. Both lines can be induced to terminal differentiation into a granulocytic phenotype by DMSO. In this process, normal HL 60 cells also become resistant towards HePC. Determinations of cellular membrane lipid composition did not show significant changes, which would explain the resistance mechanism. Analysis of cellular proteins by 2D-gelelectrophoresis revealed two 50 kDa proteins expressed in HL 60 and differentiated HL 60 cells, which were not expressed in HL 60 R. Reversion of resistance of HL 60 R after prolonged cultivation without HePC led to re-expression of the two proteins, indicating at a possible involvement of these proteins in HePC sensitivity.","['Berkovic, D', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Kuduz, J', 'Fleer, E A']","['Berkovic D', 'Hiddemann W', 'Kuduz J', 'Fleer EA']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Clinic of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', '53EY29W7EC (miltefosine)', '5ZZK34MC3V (ilmofosine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phospholipid Ethers/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1998/02/21 00:00,1998/02/21 00:01,['1998/02/21 00:00'],"['1998/02/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804997002347 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(97)00234-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1997 Oct;33(11):1875-80. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(97)00234-7.,,,,,,,,,,

The cDNA encoding this C1q receptor that modulates phagocytosis, C1qRP, has recently been cloned. Using a DNA probe based on the coding region of the receptor, Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from different cell types showed C1qRP expression in cells of myeloid origin and in endothelial cells, but not in cells of lymphoid origin nor in the HeLa epithelial-like cell line or iliac artery smooth muscle cells. FACS analysis of cell surface expression of C1qRP, as detected by mAb R139 and R3, corresponded in all cases to the mRNA levels detected. Using the anti-C1qRP mAb, the 126,000 Mr receptor was also detected in lysates of human platelets. Interestingly, C1qRP is not expressed by the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, and differentiation of these cells with various chemical compounds did not induce C1qRP expression.

Analysis of a large panel of established CD8+ CTL clones specific for M-MuLV indicated an overwhelming bias for V beta4 in BALB/c mice and for V beta5.2 in C57BL/6 mice. These V beta biases were already detectable in mixed lymphocyte:tumor cell cultures established from virus-immune spleen cells. Furthermore, direct ex vivo analysis of PBL from BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice immunized with syngeneic M-MuLV-infected tumor cells revealed a dramatic increase in CD8+ cells expressing V beta4 or V beta5.2, respectively. M-MuLV-specific CD8+ cells with an activated (CD62L-) phenotype persisted in blood of immunized mice for at least 2 mo, and exhibited decreased TCR and CD8 levels compared with their naive counterparts. In C57BL/6 mice, most M-MuLV-specific CD8+ CTL clones and immune PBL coexpressed V alpha3.2 in association with V beta5.2. Moreover, these V beta5.2+ V alpha3.2+ cells were shown to recognize the recently described H-2Db-restricted epitope (CCLCLTVFL) encoded in the leader sequence of the M-MuLV gag polyprotein.

Production of mAb that can modulate human NK cell proliferation yielded NKH3, which recognizes the CD94 Ag. NKH3 immunoprecipitates contain approximately 70-kDa heterodimeric complexes consisting of a approximately 25-kDa glycoprotein and approximately 40- to 45-kDa molecules. Analysis by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE suggests that several different 40- to 45-kDa species are present in the CD94 receptor complex in human NK cells. NKH3 reacted with essentially all resting NK cells, although CD94 is expressed at higher levels on the CD56(bright) (i.e., high level of CD56) CD16(dim/neg) (i.e., low level of or absent CD16) subpopulation than on the more abundant CD56(dim)CD16(bright) NK cell subset. Moreover, the Z199 mAb, which appears to recognize NKG2-A species that can form heterodimers with CD94, stained virtually all CD56(bright) NK cells, but only a subset of CD56(dim) NK cells. Ligation of CD94 augmented the proliferation of CD56(bright) NK cells in response to IL-2 or IL-15 by as much as 10-fold. Secretion of IFN-gamma by CD56(bright) NK cells stimulated with IL-2 or IL-15 was also enhanced up to 10-fold after CD94 ligation. CD94 mAb did not consistently costimulate proliferation of or IFN-gamma production by CD56(dim) NK cells cultured with IL-2 or IL-15. In contrast, irradiated K562 cells costimulated proliferation of both CD56(bright) and CD56(dim) NK cells. These results indicate that CD56(bright) and CD56(dim) NK cells can be costimulated through different receptors, which may allow these distinct NK cell subsets to be independently regulated in vivo.","['Voss, S D', 'Daley, J', 'Ritz, J', 'Robertson, M J']","['Voss SD', 'Daley J', 'Ritz J', 'Robertson MJ']","['Department of Radiology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (Klrd1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Communication/immunology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', '*Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D', 'Receptors, Mitogen/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/20 00:00,1998/02/20 00:01,['1998/02/20 00:00'],"['1998/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Feb 15;160(4):1618-26.,"['CA41619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA59367-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We describe the clinical and biologic features of these patients and evaluate the results of treatment during the cisplatin era. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1976 and 1993, 38 patients with mediastinal NSGCT received cisplatin-based chemotherapy as part of their primary treatment. Twenty-nine of them were initially treated at the Institut Gustave-Roussy (IGR), VillejuiF, France, and nine were referred for salvage treatment. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients initially treated at IGR, 11 (39%) had metastasis. A complete response (CR) to therapy was obtained in 19 of 29 patients (66%) after chemotherapy and surgery. Ten patients (34.5%) have remained free of disease with a median follow-up of 89 months. All patients who did not achieve a CR died of disease. The 2-year overall survival rate for the IGR patients is 45% and the 2-year disease-free survival is 37%. Only the presence of extrapulmonary metastasis was of prognostic significance in the univariate analysis (P = .0095). None of the 20 patients who required salvage therapy is currently disease-free. Five patients developed and subsequently died of a hematologic malignancy at an interval range of 1 to 47 months from treatment of mediastinal NSGCT. Cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells found an isochromosome of the short arm of chromosome 12 (12p) in two cases. The incidence of leukemia was 21% in patients who attained a CR. CONCLUSION: Primary mediastinal NSGCT is a clinical and biologic entity that should be distinguished from other GCT. About 40% of these patients can envisage long-term survival with modern therapy that includes cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of residual masses. New strategies are required for patients who do not attain a CR. Predictive factors and improvement in therapy are required for mediastinal NSGCT-associated leukemia.","['Fizazi, K', 'Culine, S', 'Droz, J P', 'Kramar, A', 'Theodore, C', 'Ruffie, P', 'Le Chevalier, T']","['Fizazi K', 'Culine S', 'Droz JP', 'Kramar A', 'Theodore C', 'Ruffie P', 'Le Chevalier T']","['Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France. courtier@igr.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Platinum Compounds)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Germinoma/*drug therapy/mortality/secondary', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Platinum Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate']",1998/02/20 00:00,1998/02/20 00:01,['1998/02/20 00:00'],"['1998/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.2.725 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Feb;16(2):725-32. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.2.725.,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with MCL were included in the study. In two cases, fludarabine was the first-line therapy, the second in four cases, the third in five cases, and the fourth in four cases. The diagnosis of MCL was based on the criteria of the European Lymphoma Task Force (ELTF), with morphologic, immunologic, and cytogenetic data. Patients were treated with intravenous fludarabine 25 mg/m2/d for 5 days every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Toxicity of fludarabine was mild: World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 and 4 granulocytopenia occurred in 15 of 56 assessable cycles (cy) (27%), there was no grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, one grade 3 bacterial lung infection, and no treatment-related death. There were five partial responses (33%) but no complete response. The duration of these responses was short and ranged from 4 to 8 months. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that fludarabine can be moderately effective in the treatment of MCL. Fludarabine appears to be far less effective than in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Therefore, fludarabine should be evaluated in association with other chemotherapeutic agents in MCL.","['Decaudin, D', 'Bosq, J', 'Tertian, G', 'Nedellec, G', 'Bennaceur, A', 'Venuat, A M', 'Bayle, C', 'Carde, P', 'Bendahmane, B', 'Hayat, M', 'Munck, J N']","['Decaudin D', 'Bosq J', 'Tertian G', 'Nedellec G', 'Bennaceur A', 'Venuat AM', 'Bayle C', 'Carde P', 'Bendahmane B', 'Hayat M', 'Munck JN']","['Department of Medicine, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1998/02/20 00:00,1998/02/20 00:01,['1998/02/20 00:00'],"['1998/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.2.579 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Feb;16(2):579-83. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.2.579.,,,,,,,,,,

A safe anthracycline dose that will not result in late cardiac abnormalities has not been established due to the limited dose ranges used in existing studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To determine the relationship between cumulative anthracycline dose and late cardiotoxicity, we performed echocardiograms on 189 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia a median of 8.1 years (range, 2.0 to 23.4) after completion of anthracycline therapy. Patients were treated according to protocols that used widely varying cumulative anthracycline doses, but comparable nonanthracycline chemotherapy. Patients were divided into four groups based on the city of treatment and cumulative anthracycline dose: Copenhagen, 0 to 23 mg/m2 (n = 32); Boston, 45 mg/m2 (n = 17); Copenhagen, 73 to 301 mg/m2 (n = 53); and Boston, 244 to 550 mg/m2 (n = 87). Left ventricular dimension and fractional shortening were adjusted for sex and age or body-surface area through use of a control population (n = 296), and then compared among the four groups. RESULTS: Mean left ventricular dimension was significantly increased in the high-dose Boston group (observed:predicted value, 4.57 cm:4.45 cm; P = .002) and significantly higher than in the two Copenhagen groups. In the three lower-dose groups, there was no significant increase in mean left ventricular dimension, and the groups were not significantly different from each other. Similarly, the mean left ventricular fractional shortening was significantly depressed in the high-dose Boston group (observed:predicted value, 29.0%:33.8%; P = .0001) and significantly lower than in the three lower-dose groups. CONCLUSION: Depressed left ventricular fractional shortening and left ventricular dilatation were uncommon years after treatment of childhood leukemia when cumulative anthracycline doses were < or = 300 mg/m2.","['Nysom, K', 'Holm, K', 'Lipsitz, S R', 'Mone, S M', 'Colan, S D', 'Orav, E J', 'Sallan, S E', 'Olsen, J H', 'Hertz, H', 'Jacobsen, J R', 'Lipshultz, S E']","['Nysom K', 'Holm K', 'Lipsitz SR', 'Mone SM', 'Colan SD', 'Orav EJ', 'Sallan SE', 'Olsen JH', 'Hertz H', 'Jacobsen JR', 'Lipshultz SE']","['Department of Pediatrics, National University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects']",1998/02/20 00:00,1998/02/20 00:01,['1998/02/20 00:00'],"['1998/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.2.545 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Feb;16(2):545-50. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.2.545.,"['CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: At Stanford,694 children and teenagers were monitored for 1 to 31.6 years (mean, 13.1) after treatment for Hodgkin's disease. Relative risks (RRs), actuarial risks, and absolute excess risks for second malignancies were calculated. The influences of sex, age, stage, splenectomy, treatment and relapse were assessed by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients developed 59 secondary malignancies: 48 solid tumors, eight leukemias, and three non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The RR of developing a second cancer was 15.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.6 to 21.5) for females and 10.6 (95% CI, 6.6 to 16.0) for males. Breast cancer (n = 16) and sarcoma (n = 13) were the most common solid tumors. The actuarial risk at 20 years follow-up evaluation was 9.7% for males, 16.8% for females, and 9.2% for breast cancer. The median interval to diagnosis of a second malignancy was shortest for leukemia, 4.3 years, and longest for lung cancer, 18.4 years. Relapse of Hodgkin's disease increased the risk of second malignancy (hazards ratio [HR] = 2.6, P < .001). Hodgkin's disease stage, patient age, splenectomy, and treatment modality did not appear to alter overall risk, although chemotherapy was associated with subsequent leukemia. CONCLUSION: Aggressive Hodgkin's disease therapy is successful, but patients have a significant risk of second malignancy. Newer treatment programs focus on obtaining a relapse-free cure of Hodgkin's disease with judicious use of radiation and alkylating agent chemotherapy.

Because most patients treated by contemporary therapies now achieve improved outcomes, we have reassessed the prognostic significance of t(1;19). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetic data were accepted for 1,322 children (<21 years old) with newly diagnosed ALL enrolled between 1988 and 1994 on risk-adjusted studies of the Children's Cancer Group (CCG). Forty-seven patients (3.6%) were t(1;19) positive (+); 1,275 (96.4%) were t(1;19) negative (-). Clinical characteristics and treatment outcome were compared using standard methods. RESULTS: Translocation (1;19)+ patients were more likely than t(1;19)- patients to be 10 years of age or greater (P < .001) or CD10+ CD19+ CD34- (P < .0001), or nonwhite (P = .02).

However, patients with unbalanced der(19)t(1;19) had significantly better outcomes than patients with balanced t(1;19): 4-year EFS were 80.6% (SD, 7.1%) and 41.7% (SD, 13.5%), respectively (P = .003). These differences were maintained within the individual studies analyses and after exclusion of t(1;19)+ patients whose cells were hyperdiploid with more than 50 chromosomes. CONCLUSION: The overall group of t(1;19)+ patients, as well as the subgroup with an unbalanced der(19)+ (1;19) had outcomes similar to that of t(1;19)- patients, whereas patients with balanced t(1;19) had poorer outcomes. Thus, although the overall prognostic significance of t(1;19) has been obviated by contemporary risk-adjusted protocols, the balanced t(1;19) translocation remains an adverse prognostic factor.","['Uckun, F M', 'Sensel, M G', 'Sather, H N', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Arthur, D C', 'Lange, B J', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Kraft, P', 'Hutchinson, R', 'Nachman, J B', 'Reaman, G H', 'Heerema, N A']","['Uckun FM', 'Sensel MG', 'Sather HN', 'Gaynon PS', 'Arthur DC', 'Lange BJ', 'Steinherz PG', 'Kraft P', 'Hutchinson R', 'Nachman JB', 'Reaman GH', 'Heerema NA']","[""Children's Cancer Group ALL Biology Reference Laboratory and Wayne Hughes Institute, St. Paul, MN 55113, USA. faitih-uckun@mercury.lh.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Prognosis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/02/20 00:00,1998/02/20 00:01,['1998/02/20 00:00'],"['1998/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.2.527 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Feb;16(2):527-35. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.2.527.,"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

However, myelosuppression has been a significant adverse effect of this approach. In this study, we assessed the impact of r-metHu granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on the period of neutropenia, number of days of hospitalization, and delays in subsequent administration of chemotherapy in a cohort of patients with T-cell leukemia (T-ALL) or advanced stage lymphoblastic lymphoma (ASLL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, randomized trial incorporated r-metHuG-CSF into the induction and two consecutive continuation-therapy cycles of our intensive program for T-cell malignancies. In the induction phase, r-metHuG-CSF was given after two different combinations of chemotherapy, one of which included vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and adriamycin and the other a continuous infusion of high-dose ara-C and L-asparaginase. In the two continuation-therapy cycles, r-metHuG-CSF was given following the combination of vincristine, adriamycin, prednisone, and 6-mercaptopurine (MP) and after continuous infusion of high-dose cytarabine (ara-C). RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with T-ALL and 33 with ASLL were enrolled onto study from April 1994 to December 1995. Our data show no significant difference in number of days of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/microL, hospitalizations, or delays in therapy in the induction phase. However, in the continuation-therapy phase the number of days of ANC less than 500/microL was significantly shorter (P = .017) on the G-CSF-arm without significantly affecting the number of days of hospitalizations or delays in therapy. CONCLUSION: r-metHuG-CSF did not significantly affect the period of neutropenia, hospitalization, or delays in therapy in the induction phase, whereas in the two cycles of continuation therapy, it significantly shortened the period of neutropenia.","['Laver, J', 'Amylon, M', 'Desai, S', 'Link, M', 'Schwenn, M', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Shuster, J']","['Laver J', 'Amylon M', 'Desai S', 'Link M', 'Schwenn M', 'Mahmoud H', 'Shuster J']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA. laverjh@musc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1998/02/20 00:00,1998/02/20 00:01,['1998/02/20 00:00'],"['1998/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.2.522 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Feb;16(2):522-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.2.522.,"['CA-33603/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-69177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-69428/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Platinum-resistant disease was defined as progression on platinum-based chemotherapy or recurrence within 6 months of completing therapy. The starting dose was 50 mg/m2/d (30 mg/m2/d for prior radiotherapy) for 21 days, every 28 days. A dose escalation to a maximum dose of 60 mg/m2/d was prescribed. RESULTS: Of 99 patients entered, 97 were assessable for toxicity and 82 were assessable for response. Among 41 platinum-resistant patients a 26.8% response rate (7.3% complete response [CR] and 19.5% partial response [PR] rate) occurred. The median response duration was 4.3 months (range, 1.3 to 8.7), median progression-free interval (PFI) was 5.7 months (range, 0.8 to 30.8+), and median survival time was 10.8 months (range, 1.9 to 45.8). Twenty-five of 41 platinum-resistant patients had also previously received paclitaxel; of which eight (32%) responded. Among 41 platinum-sensitive patients, a 34.1% response rate (14.6% CR and 19.5% PR rate) occurred. The median response duration was 7.5 months (range, 1.9 to 15.2+), median PFI was 6.3+ months (range, 0.9 to 20.4), and median survival time was 16.5+ months (range, 0.9 to 34.8). Of 97 patients assessable for toxicity, grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was common, with leukopenia occurring in 41.2% (grade 3, 29%; grade 4, 12%), neutropenia in 45.4% (grade 3, 20%; grade 4, 25%), thrombocytopenia in 9% (grade 3, 5%; grade 4, 4%), and anemia in 13.4%. Three treatment-related deaths occurred: two from neutropenic sepsis and one from thrombocytopenic bleeding after an overdose. One patient developed leukemia. CONCLUSION: This regimen is active in platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma.

The malignant cells were large with fine granular cytoplasm. The patient was febrile without positive cultures and exhibited wasting resembling ""graft-vs-host"" disease. Both his lymphoma cells collected from the blood, and his serum, exerted strong cytotoxicity toward a battery of human tumour cell lines established in culture. We reported him as the first case of a new entity; ""cytotoxic lymphoma"". Later, elsewhere, natural killer (NK) cells were characterized, and cases of malignant lymphomas arising from large granular lymphocytes were described, as those of NK cells. Malignant NK cells constitutively express Fas ligand (L), both membrane-bound (m) and soluble (s). Upon binding FasL Fas receptor (R)-positive hosts cells succumb to apoptotic death. Patients with FasL-producer lymphoma cells suffer from anaemia, neutropenia, hepatotoxicity and autoimmunity. The FasL-->FasR system regulates normal lymphocyte homeostasis. This system is used by the placental trophoblast against maternal lymphocytes; by transplants against host lymphocytes; and by donor lymphocytes exerting graft-vs-host-reaction. In tumour immunology, FasR+ tumour cells can be killed by FasL+ lymphocytes and, vice versa, FasL+ tumour cells can induce apoptotic death of FasR+ host lymphocytes (""counterattack on lymphocytes""). Some tumour cells co-express FasL, FasR and bcl-2 and not only escape programmed cell death but also utilize the FasL-->FasR system as an autocrine growth loop (""counterattack on apoptosis"").","['Sinkovics, J G']",['Sinkovics JG'],"[""Cancer Institute, St. Joseph's Hospital, Tampa, FL, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Hungary,Acta Microbiol Immunol Hung,Acta microbiologica et immunologica Hungarica,9434021,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/02/20 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Microbiol Immunol Hung. 1997;44(3):295-303.,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study on the basis of hospital records. SETTING: The former Northern Health region of England. SUBJECTS: 685 children who were born and lived in the region and who developed cancer before their 15th birthday, and 3442 controls also born between 1960 and 1991 and matched only for date and hospital of birth. The notes of a further 701 index cases were untraceable. MAIN EXPOSURE MEASURE: Administration of intramuscular vitamin K versus no exposure to vitamin K. RESULTS: There was no association between the administration of vitamin K and the development of all childhood cancers (unadjusted odds ratio 0.89; 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.15) or for all acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (1.20; 0.75 to 1.92), but there was a raised odds ratio for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia developing 1-6 years after birth (1.79; 1.02 to 3.15). No such association was seen in a separate cohort-based study not dependent on case note retrieval in which the rates of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children born in hospital units where all babies received vitamin K were compared with those born in units where less than a third received prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: It is not possible, on the basis of currently published evidence, to refute the suggestion that neonatal intramuscular vitamin K administration increases the risk of early childhood leukaemia. Any association may have been masked in earlier studies that did not use controls matched for time and locality by other unidentified factors affecting the spatiotemporal variations in incidence of leukaemia.","['Parker, L', 'Cole, M', 'Craft, A W', 'Hey, E N']","['Parker L', 'Cole M', 'Craft AW', 'Hey EN']","['Sir James Spence Institute of Child Health, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Royal Victoria Infirmary.

DESIGN: Matched case-control study. SETTING: Selected large maternity units in England and Wales. SUBJECTS: Children with cancer born 1968-85, diagnosed 1969-86; controls matched for sex, month of birth, and hospital of birth. MAIN EXPOSURE MEASURES: Neonatal administration of vitamin K, length of gestation, birth weight, type of delivery, admission to special care baby unit. RESULTS: After exclusion of cases with missing notes or unknown hospital vitamin K policy, 597 cases and matched controls were studied. Written records on the use of vitamin K were available for only about 40% of these, and to avoid possible bias from selective recording it was assumed that the stated hospital policy was followed. The association between cancer generally and intramuscular vitamin K was of borderline significance (odds ratio 1.44, P = 0.05); the association was strongest for leukaemia. There was, however, also an effect of abnormal delivery, which could explain some of the findings. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of consistency between the various studies so far published, including this one, and the low relative risks found in most of them suggest that the risk, if any, attributable to the use of vitamin K cannot be large, but the possibility that there is some risk cannot be excluded. A comparison of the predicted consequences of various policies shows that even a 10% increase would imply that prophylaxis using the commonly recommended 1 mg intramuscular dose should be restricted to babies at particularly high risk of vitamin K deficiency bleeding; alternatively a lower dose might be given to a larger proportion of those at risk.","['Passmore, S J', 'Draper, G', 'Brownbill, P', 'Kroll, M']","['Passmore SJ', 'Draper G', 'Brownbill P', 'Kroll M']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, Oxford.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,['12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Vitamin K/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Vitamin K Deficiency/prevention & control', 'Wales/epidemiology']",1998/02/20 00:00,1998/02/20 00:01,['1998/02/20 00:00'],"['1998/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.316.7126.178 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1998 Jan 17;316(7126):178-84. doi: 10.1136/bmj.316.7126.178.,,,,,,['BMJ. 1998 Jan 17;316(7126):161-2.

We report a woman who experienced seizures and had subarachnoid enhancement on MRI suggestive of leukemic infiltrates in the leptomeninges.

We hypothesized that the outcome of treatment would be improved if doses were individualized to prevent low systemic exposure to the drugs in patients with fast drug clearance. METHODS: We stratified and randomly assigned 182 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia to postremission regimens that included high-dose methotrexate and teniposide plus cytarabine. The doses of these drugs were based on body-surface area (in the conventional-therapy group) or the rates of clearance of the three medications in each patient (in the individualized-treatment group). In the individualized-treatment group, doses were increased in patients with rapid clearance and decreased in patients with very slow clearance. RESULTS: Patients who received individualized doses had significantly fewer courses of treatment with systemic exposures below the target range than did patients who received conventional doses (P<0.001 for each medication). Among the patients with B-lineage leukemia, those who received individualized therapy had a significantly better outcome than those given conventional therapy (P=0.02); the mean (+/-SE) rates of continuous complete remission at five years were 76+/-6 percent and 66+/-7 percent, respectively. There was no significant difference between treatments for patients with T-lineage leukemia (P=0.54). In a proportional-hazards model, the time-dependent systemic exposure to methotrexate, but not to teniposide or cytarabine, was significantly related to the risk of early relapse in children with B-lineage leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Adjusting the dose of methotrexate to account for the patient's ability to clear the drug can improve the outcome in children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Evans, W E', 'Relling, M V', 'Rodman, J H', 'Crom, W R', 'Boyett, J M', 'Pui, C H']","['Evans WE', 'Relling MV', 'Rodman JH', 'Crom WR', 'Boyett JM', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics']",1998/02/19 00:00,1998/02/19 00:01,['1998/02/19 00:00'],"['1998/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199802193380803 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1998 Feb 19;338(8):499-505. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199802193380803.,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

For example, tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y mRNA decrease in axotomized sympathetic neurons in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). In the present study, the effects of axotomy on the expression of nicotinic receptor subunit transcripts were examined in the SCG and the results were compared to those produced by deafferentation and explantation. Normally, neurons in the SCG express five different nicotinic subunits: alpha3, alpha5, alpha7, beta2, and beta4. Forty-eight hours after axotomy in vivo or explantation, dramatic decreases in these transcripts were seen, except for beta2, which increased. In contrast, deafferentation of the SCG had negligible effects on any of these transcripts. Both leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) have been shown to play a role in the decrease in neuropeptide Y mRNA expression after axotomy. In the cases of these nicotinic receptor transcripts, however, similar decreases were seen in wild-type and LIF knockout animals. Furthermore, administration of an antiserum to NGF in intact animals produced no changes in transcript levels. On the other hand, providing exogenous NGF to axotomized SCG in vivo or in explant cultures partially prevented the decreases in the transcripts for alpha3, alpha5, alpha7, and beta4. These data indicate that axotomy produces dramatic decreases in the expression of several nicotinic receptor subunit transcripts, and that the molecular signals underlying these changes differ from those previously shown to mediate the decrease in neuropeptide Y expression.","['Zhou, Y', 'Deneris, E', 'Zigmond, R E']","['Zhou Y', 'Deneris E', 'Zigmond RE']","['Department of Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4975, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurobiol,Journal of neurobiology,0213640,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Nicotinic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axotomy', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Nicotinic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/drug effects/physiology', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1998/02/19 04:54,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/02/19 04:54'],"['1998/02/19 04:54 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/02/19 04:54 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4695(19980205)34:2<164::AID-NEU6>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(19980205)34:2<164::aid-neu6>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurobiol. 1998 Feb 5;34(2):164-78. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(19980205)34:2<164::aid-neu6>3.0.co;2-0.,['NS 12651/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Because direct biochemical modification of LFA-1 by DTT is not apparently involved, we investigated the possible role of a reduction-oxidation (redox)-sensitive adhesion-regulatory pathway. Phenylarsine oxide (PAO), an oxidant selectively reactive with closely spaced pairs of thiol groups, inhibited LFA-1-dependent adhesion of human natural killer and HSB2 T leukemia cells to murine cells expressing human ICAM-1. PAO also induced disappearance of a conformation-sensitive LFA-1 epitope recognized by KIM127 antibodies and promoted an increase in total apparent cytoskeleton-linked LFA-1 in which a novel cytochalasin D-resistant linkage was involved. Exposure of PAO-pretreated cells to DTT caused a decline in LFA-1/cytoskeleton linkages in conjunction with rapid restoration of KIM127 epitope expression and LFA-1 adhesive function. Implicating an intracellular site of action were findings that (1) an epitope-tagged PAO probe bound predominantly to intracellular proteins but not detectably to immunoprecipitation-purified LFA-1 chains, and (2) membrane permeant but not impermeant dithiol antioxidants reversed PAO adhesion-inhibitory effects. These results support the concept of a reversible redox-sensitive linkage between LFA-1 and cytoskeleton by which oxidants and antioxidants may exert profound opposing effects on LFA-1 conformation and adhesive function.","['Edwards, B S', 'Southon, E A', 'Curry, M S', 'Salazar, F', 'Gale, J M', 'Robinson, M K', 'Graf, L H Jr', 'Born, J L']","['Edwards BS', 'Southon EA', 'Curry MS', 'Salazar F', 'Gale JM', 'Robinson MK', 'Graf LH Jr', 'Born JL']","['Pathophysiology Division, Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. bedwards@salud.unm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0HUR2WY345 (oxophenylarsine)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoskeleton/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*physiology', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Phosphothreonine/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1998/02/19 04:54,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/02/19 04:54'],"['1998/02/19 04:54 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/02/19 04:54 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.63.2.190 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1998 Feb;63(2):190-202. doi: 10.1002/jlb.63.2.190.,"['R01 CA51130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR0 3470-S03/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Different lengths of the human IL-1beta gene fragment (-685 to +550) were cloned upstream from a chloramphenical acetyltransferase (CAT) gene to make the IL-1beta promoter/CAT reporter constructs.

Functional studies show that CAT production is undetectable when the 19 bp region (+513 to +531) is removed, and CAT production is diminished when the 10-bp region (+539 to +548) is deleted.

Angiotensin II (10(-7) mol/L) induced rapid phosphorylation of JAK2 and Tyk2, but not JAK1, and phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2, but not STAT3, in the early stage up to 30 minutes. The time course of JAK/STAT activation by angiotensin II was apparently slower than that by LIF. Interestingly, angiotensin II phosphorylated STAT3 and rephosphorylated STAT1 in the late stage at 120 minutes. We also found that angiotensin II induced the formation of interferon-stimulating gene factor (ISGF) complexes biphasically, in the early stage at 15 to 30 minutes and in the late stage at 120 minutes, and that angiotensin II induced delayed activation of the sis-inducing factor (SIF) complex at 120 minutes. Formation of ISGF and SIF complexes in response to angiotensin II paralleled the phosphorylation pattern of STAT1 and STAT3 and was quite different from those obtained in response to LIF.

Since expression of bcr-abl mRNA frequently increases with disease progression and a duplication of the Philadelphia chromosome (harbouring the bcr-abl hybrid locus) represents the most frequent karyotypic abnormality in acute phase CML, we hypothesized that the level of BCR-ABL protein may affect the disease phenotype. Therefore, the biological effects of high and low levels of BCR-ABL expression were compared in growth factor-dependent and -independent myeloid and lymphoid cell lines. Our results demonstrated that low levels of BCR - ABL were sufficient to render these cell lines growth factor independent and tumorigenic, but higher levels were mandatory for additional protection against apoptotic stimuli. The provision of growth factor or an activated ras oncogene did not afford the same degree of protection as high levels of BCR-ABL and there were qualitative differences between the survival signals mediated by BCR-ABL and Bcl-2. These results have enabled us to establish a dose-dependent hierarchy of BCR-ABL induced biological effects, thus distinguishing the activation of pathways mediating protection from cytokine withdrawal from those protecting against other apoptotic stimuli.","['Cambier, N', 'Chopra, R', 'Strasser, A', 'Metcalf, D', 'Elefanty, A G']","['Cambier N', 'Chopra R', 'Strasser A', 'Metcalf D', 'Elefanty AG']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, PO Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",1998/02/19 00:00,1998/02/19 00:01,['1998/02/19 00:00'],"['1998/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201490 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Jan 22;16(3):335-48. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201490.,['CA22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We used a limiting dilution assay to investigate whether remaining CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes derived from such leukopenic patients could be activated and undergo clonogenic proliferation. The activation signal in our model was accessory cells (irradiated normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells) + phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) + interleukin-2 (IL-2). During severe leukopenia a majority of circulating lymphocytes were CD4+ T cells. Clonogenic proliferating T lymphocytes were detected for all patients. Higher frequencies of clonogenic cells were detected in the CD8+ subset as compared to the CD4+ subset. However, for both subsets frequencies of proliferating cells were decreased compared with healthy individuals. The CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were also capable of proliferation in response to alloactivation, and accessory cells mainly containing acute myelogenous leukaemia blast were efficient as accessory cells for activation. For the CD4+ cells, increased proliferation was detected in the presence of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) blasts compared with normal accessory cells. Based on our results we conclude that: (1) although acute leukaemia patients with therapy-induced leukopenia have both a quantitative and a qualitative T-cell defect, (2) the remaining T-cell population includes a subset capable of clonogenic proliferation. However, (3) proliferation of the clonogenic CD4+ cells can be modulated by AML blasts.","['Bruserud, O', 'Ulvestad, E', 'Berentsen, S', 'Bergheim, J', 'Nesthus, I']","['Bruserud O', 'Ulvestad E', 'Berentsen S', 'Bergheim J', 'Nesthus I']","['Section for Haematology, Gade Institute, Haukeland Hospital, University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukopenia/blood/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1998/02/19 00:00,1998/02/19 00:01,['1998/02/19 00:00'],"['1998/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-3083.1998.00254.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1998 Jan;47(1):54-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3083.1998.00254.x.,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we present the population-based survival patterns of leukaemia over the last two decades from East Anglia. METHODS: Data on leukaemia from the East Anglian cancer registry were analysed to study survival based on age and time period at diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier survival was calculated for children (ages 0-14) and for adults (ages 15+) separately, for the main leukaemia sub-types. RESULTS: A total of 2044 males and 1524 females with leukaemia were registered between 1971 and 1990, of whom 158 (7.7 per cent) and 123 (8.1 per cent) were aged less than 15 years at diagnosis. In children, five-year survival was significantly better for females for all leukaemias (p = 0.02) and for acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) (p < 0.01). Infants and older children had the worst prognosis as compared with children aged 2-9 years. Analysis by quinquennium of diagnosis showed a highly significant improvement in survival (p < 0.00001) for children with ALL in the later decade (1981-1990). In adults, patients with lymphoid leukaemia survived better as compared with the myeloid subtypes (p < 0.0001). Analysis by year of diagnosis in five-year calendar period showed a significant improvement in survival for acute myeloid leukaemia (p < 0.01), chronic myeloid leukaemia (p < 0.05), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (p < 0.05) and for the four types together (p < 0.001). Survival decreased with age for each subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Age is an important predictor of survival.

The first type of exposures are those connected with military and industrial uses and, to some extent broadcast exposures. It is this type that most of the data cited in this study draw upon. The second type, cellular telephones and their associated broadcast requirements, have raised concerns about current exposures because of their increasingly widespread use. Four types of effects were originally reported in multiple studies: increased spontaneous abortion, shifts in red and white blood cell counts, increased somatic mutation rates in lymphocytes, and increased childhood, testicular, and other cancers. In addition, there is evidence of generalized increased disability rates from a variety of causes in one study and symptoms of sensitivity reactions and lenticular opacity in at least one other. These findings suggest that RF exposures are potentially carcinogenic and have other health effects. Therefore, prudent avoidance of unneeded exposures is recommended as a precautionary measure. Epidemiologic studies of occupational groups such as military users and air traffic controllers should have high priority because their exposures can be reasonably well characterized and the effects reported are suitable for epidemiologic monitoring.

Some studies suggest a relationship between leukemia incidence in populations residing near high-voltage lines and the distance to these lines. Other epidemiologic studies suggest a relationship between leukemia incidence and exposure to 50/60 Hz magnetic fields (measured or estimated) and distance from the main system (220 or 120 V). The present work does not question these results but is intended to draw attention to a possible concurrent cause that might also increase the incidence of this disease; the presence on an electric grid of radiofrequency currents used for communications and remote control. These currents have been detected on high- and medium-voltage lines. In some cases they are even used on the main system for remote reading of electric meters. This implies that radiofrequency (RF) magnetic fields are present near the electric network in addition to the 50/60 Hz fields. This intensity of these RF fields is low but the intensity of currents induced in the human body by exposure to magnetic fields increases with frequency. Because scientific research has not yet clarified whether the risk is related to the value of magnetic induction or to the currents this kind of exposure produces in the human body, it is reasonable to suggest that the presence of the RF magnetic fields must be considered in the context of epidemiologic studies.","['Vignati, M', 'Giuliani, L']","['Vignati M', 'Giuliani L']","['Istituto Superiore Prevenzione e Sicurezza del Lavoro, Rome, Italy. vignatimz@etruria.net']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Electrophysiology', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Muscle, Skeletal/radiation effects', '*Radio Waves', 'Sweden']",1998/02/19 00:00,1998/02/19 00:01,['1998/02/19 00:00'],"['1998/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.97105s61569 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1997 Dec;105 Suppl 6:1569-73. doi: 10.1289/ehp.97105s61569.,,,,,,,PMC1469914,,,

Parents are especially concerned with the possibility that children might develop cancer after exposure to the RF emissions from mobile telephone base stations erected in or near schools. These questions have followed scientific reports suggesting that residence near high voltage power lines may to be associated with an increased childhood leukemia risk. Epidemiologic studies have been plagued by poor RF exposure assessment and differences in methodology. There are no high-quality epidemiologic studies that can be used to evaluate health risks from RF exposure. Laboratory studies in this area have been somewhat confusing. Some animal studies suggest that RF fields accelerate the development of sarcoma colonies in the lung, mammary tumors, skin tumors, hepatomas, and sarcomas. A substantial RF-induced increase in lymphoma incidence in transgenic mice exposed for up to 18 months has also been reported. In contrast, other studies have not found carcinogenic effects. These conflicting results indicate the need for more well-conducted studies on laboratory animals, supplemented with high-quality in vitro studies to identify effects that need further research in vivo, and to characterize any acting mechanisms, especially at low RF field levels.

If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer data, a threshold of more than about 0.2 Sv is inconsistent with the data, whereas these data are consistent with there being no threshold. Among solid cancer subtypes there is strong evidence for a possible dose threshold only for nonmelanoma skin cancer. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukemia data, a threshold of more than about 0.3 Sv is inconsistent with the data. In contrast to the estimates for the threshold level for solid cancer data, the best estimate for the threshold level in the leukemia data is significantly different from zero even when allowance is made for a possible quadratic term in the dose response, albeit at borderline levels of statistical significance (p = 0.04). There is little evidence for curvature in the leukemia dose response from 0.2 Sv upwards. However, possible underestimation of the errors in the estimates of the dose threshold as a result of confounding and uncertainties not taken into account in the analysis, together with the lack of biological plausibility of a threshold, makes interpretation of this finding questionable.","['Little, M P', 'Muirhead, C R']","['Little MP', 'Muirhead CR']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Oxon, United Kingdom. mark.little@nrpb.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['0 (Radioactive Fallout)'],IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radioactive Fallout/*adverse effects']",1998/02/19 00:00,1998/02/19 00:01,['1998/02/19 00:00'],"['1998/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.97105s61505 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1997 Dec;105 Suppl 6:1505-9. doi: 10.1289/ehp.97105s61505.,,,,,,,PMC1469947,,,

These data add new insights and provide possible answers to several important questions regarding radiation and its impact on occupational and public health. The 1986 Chernobyl accident initiated a major and early increase in childhood thyroid cancer that resulted from ingestion of iodine-131 (131I) by young children living in the most heavily contaminated areas of Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. No significant additional cancer or other adverse medical effects have yet been reported in the affected populations and among clean-up workers. Major psychological stress independent of radiation dose has been observed in those people thought to be exposed. During the early days of the atomic energy program in the former Soviet Union, some unfortunate events occurred. The country's first atomic test in Semipalatinsk in 1949 exposed over 25,000 people downwind from the blast to significant doses of fission products, especially 131I. During the late 1940s and the early 1950s nuclear material production facilities were developed near Chelyabinsk in the South Ural Mountains, which resulted in major releases into the environment and significant overexposures for thousands of workers and nearby populations. Chronic radiation sickness was observed early in exposed workers, and increases in leukemia and other cancers were also reported. The series of plutonium inhalation-related lung cancers and fatalities among workers exposed in that first decade appears to be unique. Long-term consequences of chronic radiation sickness and four decades of follow-up are being described for the first time. Villagers downstream from the plant consumed high levels of 137Cs and 90Sr and, it is reported, manifested increases in leukemia from internal and external exposures. Although the 40-year databases for retrospective dosimetry epidemiology studies are just beginning to be integrated and evaluated, preliminary evaluations suggest that there may be graded, significant dose-rate amelioration factors for cancer and leukemia risks in workers and the general population relative to the risk data on the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Even for plutonium-induced lung cancers in workers, such a dose-rate effect may be evident. These experiences give us insight into the consequences of protracted radiation at high and low doses and rates. If these findings are validated and confirmed, they can provide information that reduces some of the uncertainties in retrospective radiation dosimetry and radiation risk estimates (especially for low-level, chronic exposures) for activities related to medicine as well as the handling of nuclear materials and nuclear facility decommissioning, decontamination, and demilitarization.","['Goldman, M']",['Goldman M'],"['University of California, Davis, USA. mgoldman@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['0 (Radioactive Pollutants)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Radioactive Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'Russia', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology']",1998/02/19 00:00,1998/02/19 00:01,['1998/02/19 00:00'],"['1998/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.97105s61385 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1997 Dec;105 Suppl 6:1385-91. doi: 10.1289/ehp.97105s61385.,,,23,,,,PMC1469939,,,

Patterson, Leukemia inhibitory factor, a cytokine at the interface between neurobiology and immunology, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 (1994) 7833-7835]. We considered the possibility that these agents may also affect the development of neuronal cell shape. Intracellular dye injection and immunocytochemistry were used to assess dendritic growth in cultures of perinatal rat sympathetic neurons and the effects of LIF and CNTF were compared to those of osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1), a growth factor that induces profuse dendritic growth in these neurons [P. Lein, M. Johnson, X. Guo, D. Rueger, D. Higgins, Osteogenic protein-1 induces dendritic growth in rat sympathetic neurons, Neuron 15 (1995) 597-605]. Under control conditions, sympathetic neurons formed only axons. Exposure to either LIF or OP-1 stimulated dendritic growth, but the magnitude of the response to LIF was much less than that obtained with OP-1 with respect to both dendritic number and length. Simultaneous exposure to LIF and OP-1 resulted in dendritic growth equivalent to that observed in the presence of LIF alone, suggesting that LIF inhibits the response of neurons to OP-1. Both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of LIF were mimicked by CNTF, but not by other growth factors. These data suggest that LIF and CNTF regulate dendritic development in a complex manner that is dependent on both the morphological state of the neuron and the presence of other growth factors. However, the net effect of exposure to these cytokines appears to be the production of a population of neurons with rudimentary arbors consisting of only one or two short dendrites.","['Guo, X', 'Metzler-Northrup, J', 'Lein, P', 'Rueger, D', 'Higgins, D']","['Guo X', 'Metzler-Northrup J', 'Lein P', 'Rueger D', 'Higgins D']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, State University of New York, Buffalo 14214, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Brain Res Dev Brain Res,Brain research.

Clinically, LRP/MVP expression in cancer at time of diagnosis provided a strong and independent prognostic factor for response to chemotherapy and outcome in different tumor types, notably acute myeloid leukemia and ovarian cancer. To facilitate additional immunohistopathological studies, we have optimized LRP/MVP detection in paraffin-embedded tissues using two monoclonal antibodies, LRP-56 and LMR-5. Blocking experiments showed that LRP-56 and LMR-5 MAbs detect different epitopes of LRP/MVP. Immunohistochemical studies with both MAbs in a panel of human multidrug resistant tumor cell lines, normal tissues, and colorectal tumors showed that LRP/MVP expression can be reliably detected after formalin-fixation and paraffm-embedding using overnight incubation at 4 degrees C with the primary MAbs at 5- to 10-fold higher concentrations (ie, 1 to 10 microg/ml) as currently used with frozen sections. Both streptavidin-biotin complex and alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase techniques could be successfully used for signal-amplification.

Each of the antibodies reacted with a distinct epitope on gp190 expressed either by gp190-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells or by the LIF receptor-positive choriocarcinoma JAR cell line. Two of the antibodies (1B4 and 6E6) had binding stoichiometries that were approximately 2-fold lower than those of other mAb (10B2, 12D9 and 7G7), suggesting either that gp190 is present as a pre-associated homodimer in the cell membrane or that part of gp190 is pre-associated with another component. Two mAb (1C7 and 1B4) were found to inhibit LIF binding on the two cell types studied. On JAR cells, this inhibition was, however, restricted to the high-affinity LIF component, suggesting different modes of LIF engagement with the low- and high-affinity receptor species. mAb 1C7 and 1B4 were also found to synergize for inhibiting LIF high-affinity binding. This synergy also extended to the inhibition of LIF- or oncostatin M (OSM)-induced proliferation of a Ba/F3 cell line co-transfected with human gp130 and gp190. However, this mAb combination inhibited LIF- but not OSM-induced haptoglobin secretion by HepG2 cells, suggesting that whereas haptoglobin secretion induced by LIF involves gp130/gp190 common LIF/OSM type I receptors, that induced by OSM mainly involves type II OSM receptors.","['Blanchard, F', 'Pitard, V', 'Taupin, J L', 'Raher, S', 'Hallet, M M', 'Moreau, J F', 'Godard, A', 'Jacques, Y']","['Blanchard F', 'Pitard V', 'Taupin JL', 'Raher S', 'Hallet MM', 'Moreau JF', 'Godard A', 'Jacques Y']","['Groupe de Recherche Cytokines et Recepteurs, Unite INSERM 463, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'CHO Cells/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*immunology/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/18 00:00,1998/02/18 00:01,['1998/02/18 00:00'],"['1998/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/9.12.1775 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1997 Dec;9(12):1775-84. doi: 10.1093/intimm/9.12.1775.,,,,,,,,,,

Donors were HLA-identical siblings (SIB) (n = 36) or unrelated donors (MUD) (n = 24) matched by serology for HLA A and B and by molecular biology for HLA DR. All patients were prepared with cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg and fractionated total body irradiation 10-12 Gy. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin A (CsA) starting on day -7 and short-course methotrexate. Bone marrow was unmanipulated in all cases. Cytomegalovirus prophylaxis consisted of acyclovir for SIBs and foscarnet for MUDs. When compared to SIB transplants, MUD patients were younger (29 vs 36 years; P = 0.002), had younger donors (31 vs 39; P = 0.001), had a longer interval between diagnosis and BMT (1459 vs 263 days; P < 0.001) and received a smaller number of nucleated cells at transplant (3.3 vs 4.4 x 10(8)/kg; P = 0.003). More MUDs had advanced disease (50 vs 17%, P = 0.005). The median day to 0.5 x 10(9)/l neutrophils was similar in both groups (18 days for SIBs vs 17 days for MUDs; P = 0.06); the median platelet count on days +30, +50, +100 was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in SIB than in MUD patients (122 vs 38, 113 vs 50 and 97 vs 45 x 10(9)/l, respectively). Acute GVHD was scored as absent-mild, moderate, or severe, in 36, 58 and 6% of SIBs vs 25, 42 and 33% in MUD patients (P = 0.01). Chronic GVHD was comparable (P = 0.1). The actuarial risk of CMV antigenemia at 1 year was 60% in both groups. There were six deaths in SIB patients (two leukemia, two infections, one GVHD, one pneumonitis) and four deaths in MUD patients (three acute GVHD and one infection). Fifty patients survive with a median follow-up of 656 days for SIBs and 485 for MUDs. The actuarial 3-year transplant-related mortality is 12% in SIBs and 17% in MUDs (P = 0.5); the actuarial relapse is 18% in SIBs vs 6% in MUDs (P = 0.4) and 3-year survival 78% in SIBs vs 82% in MUDs (P = 0.7). This study suggests that survival of CML patients after marrow transplantation from unrelated or sibling donors is currently similar, provided the former are well matched. The increased incidence of GVHD in MUD patients is possibly compensated by a lower risk of relapse.","['Lamparelli, T', 'Van Lint, M T', 'Gualandi, F', 'Occhini, D', 'Barbanti, M', 'Sacchi, N', 'Ficai, G', 'Ghinatti, C', 'Ferrara, G B', 'Delfino, L', 'Pozzi, S', 'Morabito, A', 'Zikos, P', 'Vitale, V', 'Corvo, R', 'Frassoni, F', 'Bacigalupo, A']","['Lamparelli T', 'Van Lint MT', 'Gualandi F', 'Occhini D', 'Barbanti M', 'Sacchi N', 'Ficai G', 'Ghinatti C', 'Ferrara GB', 'Delfino L', 'Pozzi S', 'Morabito A', 'Zikos P', 'Vitale V', 'Corvo R', 'Frassoni F', 'Bacigalupo A']","['Divisione Ematologia II, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '364P9RVW4X (Foscarnet)', 'X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)']",IM,"['Acyclovir/therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Viral/blood', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cause of Death', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Foscarnet/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils', 'Nuclear Family', 'Premedication', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Viremia/diagnosis/epidemiology']",1998/02/18 00:00,1998/02/18 00:01,['1998/02/18 00:00'],"['1998/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701031 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Dec;20(12):1057-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701031.,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Results were compared with those from the same center 30 years ago and current data from western Asia. RESULTS: Between 1983 and 1994, 9364 cases were recorded, averaging 780 cases per year, representing more than one-third of the national case-load. Cases were almost equally distributed between males and females. Average age of females was significantly younger (48.7 years) than that of males (52.2 years). Among males, the five most frequently reported cancers were of the lung, bladder, larynx, lymphoma, and leukemia. Among females, the four most frequently reported cancers were of the breast, cervix uteri, lymphoma, and brain, with leukemia and corpus uteri ranking equally as fifth. Over the past 30 years, the frequency of colorectal cancer decreased and that of lung cancer increased in both sexes. Oral cancer decreased dramatically among males. Digestive system cancers in this series were less frequent than in cumulative data from western Asia area. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer dynamics changed little since the 1950s, except regard to cancers related to smoking and diet. Diet differences may explain the lower frequencies of digestive cancers in Lebanon as compared with elsewhere in western Asia. The potential impact of cancer prevention and early detection on highly prevalent cancer types such as lung, larynx, breast, and cervix was highlighted.","['Adib, S M', 'Mufarrij, A A', 'Shamseddine, A I', 'Kahwaji, S G', 'Issa, P', 'el-Saghir, N S']","['Adib SM', 'Mufarrij AA', 'Shamseddine AI', 'Kahwaji SG', 'Issa P', 'el-Saghir NS']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Faculty of Health Sciences, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,,IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Databases, Factual', 'Diet/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lebanon/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Population Surveillance', '*Registries', 'Sex Distribution', 'Smoking/adverse effects']",1998/02/18 00:00,1998/02/18 00:01,['1998/02/18 00:00'],"['1998/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1047279797001099 [pii]', '10.1016/s1047-2797(97)00109-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 1998 Jan;8(1):46-51. doi: 10.1016/s1047-2797(97)00109-9.,,,,,,,,,,

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura thus has become the typical indication for LS, although few data are available to demonstrate any superiority of the laparoscopic approach over conventional surgery for this indication. We retrospectively analyzed 35 cases of LS for benign (22 patients) or malignant (13 patients) hematologic disorders. LS was attempted irrespective of the volume of the spleen. The overall operative mortality rate was 2.9%, and complications occurred in 23% of all patients. The conversion rate was 9%, and accessory spleens were found in 17% of patients. Although the patients with malignant disease were significantly older, were higher operative risks (ASA score), had much larger spleens, and required longer operative times, more conversions to laparotomy, and more blood transfusions than patients with benign disease, their mortality and complication rates and the duration of their hospital stays were not significantly different from those with benign disease.

Our studies compare two rabbit HTLV-I-infected T cell lines: one, RH/K34, causes lethal experimental leukemia and the other, RH/K30, mediates asymptomatic infection. We show herein that the product of the protooncogene vav is constitutively Tyr-phosphorylated in RH/K34 but not in RH/K30. A role for the retrovirus in phosphorylation of Vav was assigned by transfection experiments with molecular clones of HTLV-I derived from the two lines. The HTLV-I molecular clone from RH/K30, but not that from RH/K34, down-regulates Vav phosphorylation in a Herpesvirus ateles-transformed T cell line. Use of recombinant virus clones revealed that a pX region sequence differing by two nucleotides between the two clones mediates this down-regulation. Because Vav is involved in T cell signaling and Vav phosphorylation occurs upon activation of T cells, control of the activation state of Vav by viral proteins may relate to the leukemogenic potential of certain HTLV-I-infected cells.","['Mahana, W', 'Zhao, T M', 'Teller, R', 'Robinson, M A', 'Kindt, T J']","['Mahana W', 'Zhao TM', 'Teller R', 'Robinson MA', 'Kindt TJ']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Twinbrook II Facility, National Institutes of Health, 12441 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20852, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)', '0 (pX protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chimera', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics', 'src Homology Domains']",1998/03/21 00:00,1998/03/21 00:01,['1998/03/21 00:00'],"['1998/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.4.1782 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Feb 17;95(4):1782-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.4.1782.,,,,,,,PMC19190,"['GENBANK/L03561', 'GENBANK/L03562']",,

This system was used to model the interaction of soluble antigen with antibody in therapeutic settings and to develop rational principles to optimize the delivery of antibody to tumor target cells. First, we confirmed that sTac in vivo can block anti-Tac binding sites and diminish antibody binding to Tac+ cells. Second, the bioactivity of antibody in vivo correlated directly with the amount of antibody infused and inversely with the sTac concentration. Third, bindability of antibody declined in the hours and days after anti-Tac infusion in patients. Finally, tumor targeting was achieved even in the presence of excess sTac, demonstrating a partition of antibody between soluble and cell-bound antigen. A role is proposed for the Brambell receptor (FcRB) to delay saturation of human or chimeric antibodies via differential catabolism of antigen-antibody complexes.

So far, transcriptional analyses of p40 have been carried out only using bacterial constituents such as LPS as stimuli. In the present study, we have characterized the transcriptional induction of p40 by CD40 ligation in a human B lymphoblastoid cell line, Daudi, and a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. These cells, stimulated by an agonistic monoclonal antibody against CD40 or by transfection with a CD40L expression vector, secreted p40 and showed enhanced p40 mRNA expression. Sequence analysis of the p40 promoter region identified two potential nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB binding sites conserved between mouse and human. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the potential NF-kappaB binding sequence which is located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 genes formed an NF-kappaB complex with nuclear extract from Daudi cells stimulated by CD40 ligation. Moreover, transfection of Daudi cells with the polymerized NF-kappaB binding sequence ligated to a thymidine kinase/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid greatly induced CAT activity, but transfection with the polymerized mutated NF-kappaB binding sequence did not. These results suggest that the NF-kappaB binding site located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 promoter regions could be important for the p40 induction by CD40 ligation via activation of NF-kappaB.","['Yoshimoto, T', 'Nagase, H', 'Ishida, T', 'Inoue, J', 'Nariuchi, H']","['Yoshimoto T', 'Nagase H', 'Ishida T', 'Inoue J', 'Nariuchi H']","['Department of Allergology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Japan. yoshimot@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*immunology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Transfection']",1998/02/17 00:00,1998/02/17 00:01,['1998/02/17 00:00'],"['1998/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830271247 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1997 Dec;27(12):3461-70. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830271247.,,,,,,,,,,

In rat mast cells and rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL) aggregation of surface Thy-1 with antibodies triggers a series of intracellular events, resembling those induced by aggregation of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilonRI), including tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins and release of secretory components. Unlike the Fc epsilonRI-mediated activation, where both the membrane-associated protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) Lyn and the cytoplasmic PTK Syk are responsible for initiating the signaling cascade, only Lyn has been implicated in Thy-1-mediated activation in RBL cells. Here we report that Syk is also rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated upon Thy-1 cross-linking. Increased Syk tyrosine phosphorylation is observed only in cells in which extensive aggregation of Thy-1 is induced by two layers of cross-linking reagents. RBL-derived mutant cells deficient in the expression of surface Thy-1 and transfectants re-expressing surface Thy-1 were used to exclude the possibility that Syk activation reflects an interaction of the cross-linking reagents with surface molecules other than Thy-1. As Fc epsilonRI gamma subunits are well known to promote activation of Syk and its recruitment to membrane complexes, we also investigated the role of these subunits in Thy-1-mediated Syk activation, using RBL-derived mutant cells deficient in the expression of Fc epsilonRI gamma subunits and their revertants.

Whether these cells are also resistant to apoptosis and if so, under what conditions remains controversial. We now show that highly purified populations of very primitive neoplastic progenitor cells obtained directly from CML patients survive and proliferate in vitro for several weeks in the absence of any added growth factors (except insulin). In contrast, purified primary normal progenitors maintained under the same conditions die rapidly. Nevertheless, both primary CML cells and BCR-ABL+ BAF3 cells show the same dose-dependent sensitivity to TNF-alpha or ceramide-induced apoptosis as their respective normal counterparts. In fact, time course studies demonstrated an even faster onset of apoptosis in ceramide-treated BCR-ABL+ BAF3 cells as compared to normal controls. BCR-ABL+ cells treated with ceramide also showed a rapid and sequential increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p210(BCR-ABL), p46-56SHC and p120Cbl. These findings suggest growth factor deprivation and treatment with TNF-alpha or ceramide trigger different initial events both of which can lead to apoptosis in factor-dependent hematopoietic cells. However, in the first case, activation of apoptosis is blocked by the basal activity of p210(BCR-ABL), whereas in the second, the presence of p210(BCR-ABL) appears to accelerate the onset of apoptosis by a mechanism that may involve an activation of its kinase function.","['Maguer-Satta, V', 'Burl, S', 'Liu, L', 'Damen, J', 'Chahine, H', 'Krystal, G', 'Eaves, A', 'Eaves, C']","['Maguer-Satta V', 'Burl S', 'Liu L', 'Damen J', 'Chahine H', 'Krystal G', 'Eaves A', 'Eaves C']","['The Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1998/02/17 00:00,1998/02/17 00:01,['1998/02/17 00:00'],"['1998/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1201533 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Jan 15;16(2):237-48. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201533.,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we report on the cloning of the rat C5a receptor (ratC5aR). We used a hybridization probe produced by PCR utilizing degenerate primers which corresponded to conserved parts of the human, canine and murine C5a receptor nucleotide sequences and to the published partial amino acid sequence of the rat C5a receptor to screen a rat macrophage cDNA library. We found two overlapping clones containing an open reading frame of 1056 bp, a 3'untranslated region of 683 bp and a 5'untranslated region of 27 bp. The overall nucleotide acid sequence identity, compared to the murine, human and canine C5a receptor sequences, was 85.8, 70.5 and 68.9%, respectively. The greatest diversity exists in the putative extracellular domains, especially in the aminoterminal domain which is assumed to be involved in ligand binding. An N-glycosylation site is present within the N-terminal sequence at residue 6. One of the cDNA containing the 5'untranslated region, the coding sequence and part of the 3'untranslated region was cloned into an eucaryotic expression vector and stably transfected into the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3. Expression of the rat C5a receptor on the surface of these cells could be demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis using FITC-labeled recombinant rat C5a (rrC5a). By measuring the release of calcium from intracellular stores after stimulation with rrC5a it could further be shown that the receptor is functionally coupled. Receptor binding assays showed that rrC5a specifically binds to the ratC5aR with a KD of 0.91 +/- 0.36 and to the human C5a receptor (huC5aR) with a KD of 7.19 +/- 1.56. The determined KD for binding of human C5a (huC5a) to the huCSaR was 2.16 +/- 0.65. No binding of huC5a to the ratC5aR could be observed although high concentrations of this ligand (> 60 nM) promoted chemotaxis of RBL cells transfected with the huC5aR.","['Rothermel, E', 'Zwirner, J', 'Vogt, T', 'Rabini, S', 'Gotze, O']","['Rothermel E', 'Zwirner J', 'Vogt T', 'Rabini S', 'Gotze O']","['Abteilung fur Immunologie, Georg-August-Universitat, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Complement C5a/*metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Complement/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1998/02/17 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0161-5890(97)00104-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1997 Aug-Sep;34(12-13):877-86. doi: 10.1016/s0161-5890(97)00104-1.,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/Y09613'],,

AA is a gamma-crotonolactone derivative with reactive hydroxyl groups at the 2- and 3-positions and an ethylene glycol substitution at the 4-position. Despite the various reports on AA toxicity, no work has been reported underlying the critical chemical structural features for its activity. The present study addresses this question. We tested in vivo, using malignant leukemia cell line P388D1, (i) L-AA and its isomers, (ii) substitution at the 2-position: -PO4, -SO4, O-Me, O-octadecyl, (iii) substitution at the 6-position: -PO4, -SO4, -palmitate, -stearate, (iv) substitution at the 2,6-position: dipalmitate, (v) 6-deoxy derivative: -Cl, -Br, -NH2 and (vi) dihydroxy gamma-crotonolactone with substitutions at the 4-position: -H, -CH3, -CH2-CH3 and -CH=CH2. L-AA and its isomers were very cytotoxic even at very low concentration. All 6-substituted and 6-deoxy derivatives were as toxic as AA. However, 2-substituted and 2,6-disubstituted AA derivatives were non-toxic. Interestingly, dihydroxy gamma-crotonolactone with or without substitution at the 5-position also exhibited toxicity. These results suggest that the underlying criterion for AA toxicity resides in dihydroxy gamma-crotonolactone moiety. Either substitution in the hydroxy groups or saturating the double bond render the molecule inactive.","['Roomi, M W', 'House, D', 'Eckert-Maksic, M', 'Maksic, Z B', 'Tsao, C S']","['Roomi MW', 'House D', 'Eckert-Maksic M', 'Maksic ZB', 'Tsao CS']","['Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94306, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/17 00:00,1998/02/17 00:01,['1998/02/17 00:00'],"['1998/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(97)00376-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(97)00376-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1998 Jan 9;122(1-2):93-9. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(97)00376-5.,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the presence of integrated EBV DNA has been reported. We investigated EBV integration into the human genome in EBV-associated disease using Southern blotting. One hundred four cases in which the presence of EBV was confirmed by Southern blotting with EBV-W probes were thus analyzed with left- and right-hand end probes of linear EBV. Integrated EBV was demonstrated in 11 of 104 cases; five of 14 cases with B cell lymphoma (36%), one of 12 cases with nasopharyngeal carcinomas (8%), four of 31 cases with natural killer (NK) leukemia/lymphoma (13%) and one of 11 cases with chronic EBV infection (9%). However, none of the 24 T cell lymphoma, seven Hodgkin's disease, or five acute EBV infection cases showed integrated EBV. In addition, seven of the 11 cases with EBV integration (five B cell lymphoma and two NK leukemia/lymphoma) showed only an integration form, however, the other four (two NK leukemia/lymphoma, one nasopharyngeal carcinoma and one chronic EBV infection) showed both integrated and episomal forms. The integrated form was frequently found in B cell lymphoma and especially in high grade B cell lymphoma.

In contrast, GMCSF downregulated PBMC levels of HDAC3 mRNA. All HDACs were found to be ubiquitously expressed in immune and non-immune tissues.

Review article.,895-903,"Over the past decade molecular genetic methods have played an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of hematologic malignancies. Moreover, they have provided a tool to analyze many of the non-random cytogenetic anomalies associated with hematologic neoplasias, contributing considerably to our understanding of several of those diseases, and to improving diagnostic accuracy. The rapid development of molecular genetics progressively allows the replacement of time-consuming and technically demanding procedures. Even more relevant are the new clinical applications that already include the search for valuable prognostic information and ways of evaluating minimal residual disease or recognizing early relapsing disease. This paper is a critical but necessarily simplified overview of the main contributions of molecular genetics to the field of hematopathology. We discuss the information provided by several molecular methods within different clinical contexts, covering common problems in diagnostic pathology as well as prognostic evaluation and therapy monitoring.","['Sambade, C', 'Sallstrom, J F', 'Sundstrom, C']","['Sambade C', 'Sallstrom JF', 'Sundstrom C']","['Department of Pathlogy, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,APMIS,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",8803400,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/diagnosis', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",1998/02/17 00:00,1998/02/17 00:01,['1998/02/17 00:00'],"['1998/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1699-0463.1997.tb05100.x [doi]'],ppublish,APMIS. 1997 Dec;105(12):895-903. doi: 10.1111/j.1699-0463.1997.tb05100.x.,,,68,,,,,,,

Even that, conventional cytogenetic techniques destroy the cytoplasmic membrane and the lineage involvement of the karyotyped cells is unknown. In this work the usefulness of a method that keeps the cell intact and allows the sequential application of immunological, cytochemical, morphological and cytogenetic techniques in the same cell is shown. This technique is called MAC for morphology, antibodies and chromosomes. The combination of MAC and in situ hybridization techniques (MACISH method) allows the detection of a chromosome abnormality in all the cells even when no mitosis are present. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The MAC method was applied in 51 patients and the MACISH method in 9 patients in order to identify the cells which karyotype is analyzed. We have studied 47 patients with normal karyotype (37 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [CLL] and 10 essential trombocythaemias (ET) and 4 patients with different diseases and abnormal karyotype. RESULTS: Among 37 patients with CLL and normal karyotype, in 9 cases only normal T-cells were in mitoses and in 28 cases the normal karyotype belonged to neoplastic B cells. Trisomy 12 has been confined exclusively to the leukaemic B cells with the MACISH technique in 3 of these CLL cases. In 10 patients with ET and normal karyotype the MAC method showed that in any case the mitosis analyzed belonged to the megakaryocyte lineage. In 4 patients with different chromosomal abnormalities the haematological cell lines involved in the neoplasia were known with the MAC method. CONCLUSION: In this work is shown the usefulness of the combination of the MAC and MACISH techniques with conventional cytogenetics in order to complete the chromosomic study of the haematological neoplasms is confirmed. These methods are specially usefull when different cell lineages are involved in the neoplasia, reactive proliferations are suspected, or to discard false aneuploidies.","['Perez-Losada, A', 'Woessner, S', 'Sole, F', 'Florensa, L']","['Perez-Losada A', 'Woessner S', 'Sole F', 'Florensa L']","[""Laboratori de Citologia Hematologica, Hospital Central L'Alianca, Barcelona.""]",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Metaphase', 'Phenotype', 'Thrombocytopenia/genetics/pathology']",1998/02/14 00:00,1998/02/14 00:01,['1998/02/14 00:00'],"['1998/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1997 Nov 8;109(16):611-4.,,,,Contribucion de la fenotipificacion de celulas en metafase y en interfase (tecnicas MAC y MACHIS) al estudio de neoplasias hematologicas.,,,,,,

We have generated PML-RARA and PLZF-RARA transgenic mice and show here that these fusion proteins play a critical role in leukaemogenesis and in determining responses to RA in APL, because PLZF-RARA transgenic mice develop RA-resistant leukaemia, while PML-RARA mice are responsive to RA treatment. We demonstrate that both PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha fusion proteins can act as transcriptional repressors and are able to interact with nuclear receptor transcriptional co-repressors, such as SMRT. PLZF-RARalpha, but not PML-RARalpha, can form, via its PLZF moiety, co-repressor complexes which are insensitive to RA. Histone deacetylase inhibitors such as Trichostatin A (TSA), in combination with RA, can overcome the transcriptional repressor activity of PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha as well as the unresponsiveness of PLZF-RARalpha-expressing leukaemic cells to RA. Thus, our findings unravel a crucial role for transcriptional silencing in APL pathogenesis and resistance to RA in APL.","['He, L Z', 'Guidez, F', 'Tribioli, C', 'Peruzzi, D', 'Ruthardt, M', 'Zelent, A', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['He LZ', 'Guidez F', 'Tribioli C', 'Peruzzi D', 'Ruthardt M', 'Zelent A', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Department of Human Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Zinc Fingers']",1998/02/14 00:00,1998/02/14 00:01,['1998/02/14 00:00'],"['1998/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/ng0298-126 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Genet. 1998 Feb;18(2):126-35. doi: 10.1038/ng0298-126.,"['CA 74031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to compare the smoking behavior and associated factors in young-adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with those in sibling controls. METHODS: A telephone interview that surveyed smoking behavior was conducted with 592 young-adult survivors, treated before age 20 years on Children's Cancer Group ALL protocols, and 409 sibling controls. Using stratified chi-squared analyses and Cox proportional hazards models, we compared the rates of smoking initiation and smoking cessation between survivors and control subjects. Demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, and education) and psychological factors (mood and self-concept) were examined as predictors interacting with survivorship in logistic regression analyses to try to distinguish a subgroup of survivors who may be at greater risk for smoking. RESULTS: Survivors were significantly less likely to have ever smoked (23.0% versus 35.7%; P<.0001) and thus were less likely to ever be regular, daily smokers than sibling controls (19.1% versus 31.3%; P<.0001). Survivors were less likely to quit smoking than sibling controls (26.6% versus 35.2%), although this result was not statistically significant. There were no interactions between survivor status and either demographic or psychological features on smoking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Young-adult survivors of childhood ALL are less likely to experiment with smoking but, once having started, are at similar risk for becoming habitual, persistent smokers as sibling controls.","['Tao, M L', 'Guo, M D', 'Weiss, R', 'Byrne, J', 'Mills, J L', 'Robison, L L', 'Zeltzer, L K']","['Tao ML', 'Guo MD', 'Weiss R', 'Byrne J', 'Mills JL', 'Robison LL', 'Zeltzer LK']","['Joint Center for Radiation Therapy, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prevalence', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation', 'Survivors']",1998/02/14 00:00,1998/02/14 00:01,['1998/02/14 00:00'],"['1998/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/90.3.219 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998 Feb 4;90(3):219-25. doi: 10.1093/jnci/90.3.219.,,,,,,,,,,

ACL antibodies were found in 25 patients (68%). None of the patients had high positive titers; 8 had moderately positive while 17 had low positive ACL antibody titers. ACL antibody positivity did not predict response to chemotherapy and was not correlated with age, gender, FAB class, platelet and white blood cell counts at presentation, and the risk of thromboembolism. ACL antibody titers did correlate, however, with AML activity in the majority of patients (93%) during 4-19 months of follow up.

Here we demonstrate that the down-regulation of surface class I molecules in differentiated primary rat oligodendrocytes was accompanied by reduced steady-state levels of class I heavy-chain mRNA. Transient expression assays were performed in oligodendrocytes and fibroblasts, using a mouse H-2Kb class I promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid termed pH2KCAT (which contained 5'-flanking sequences from -2033 to +5 bp of the H-2Kb gene relative to the transcriptional start site at +1 bp). These assays showed that H-2Kb promoter activity was reduced in oligodendrocytes but not in class I-expressing fibroblasts. H-2Kb promoter activity was up-regulated in oligodendrocytes co-transfected with a plasmid expression vector encoding the transcriptional activator tax of human T-cell leukaemia virus type I, showing that down-regulation of promoter activity was reversible. Deletion mutant analysis of the H-2Kb promoter revealed the presence of negative regulatory elements that were functional in oligodendrocytes at -1.61 to -1.07 kb and -242 to -190 bp. Deletion of sequences in pH2KCAT encompassing the downstream element totally abolished promoter activity in both oligodendrocytes and fibroblasts, whereas a deletion within the upstream negative regulatory element increased promoter activity specifically in oligodendrocytes. The upstream negative regulatory element also down-regulated a linked heterologous herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter in oligodendrocytes, but not in fibroblasts.

Thus, the secreted glycoprotein inhibits early neutrophil activation, which likely affects the host response to infection, whereas binding of the transmembrane glycoprotein to endothelial cells may contribute to the hemorrhagic symptoms of this disease.","['Yang, Z', 'Delgado, R', 'Xu, L', 'Todd, R F', 'Nabel, E G', 'Sanchez, A', 'Nabel, G J']","['Yang Z', 'Delgado R', 'Xu L', 'Todd RF', 'Nabel EG', 'Sanchez A', 'Nabel GJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (secreted glycoprotein, Ebola virus)', '0 (transmembrane glycoprotein, Ebola virus)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Ebolavirus/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*metabolism/virology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola/virology', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/physiology', 'Neutrophil Activation', 'Neutrophils/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",1998/03/07 00:00,1998/03/07 00:01,['1998/03/07 00:00'],"['1998/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.279.5353.1034 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1998 Feb 13;279(5353):1034-7. doi: 10.1126/science.279.5353.1034.,,,,,,"['Science. 1998 Oct 30;282(5390):843', 'Science. 1998 Feb 13;279(5353):983-4.

The duplicated genes on chromosomal band 6p21.3 include the genes for type 11 collagen alpha2 subunit (COL11A2), NOTCH4 (mouse int-3 homologue), 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSPA1A, HSPA1B, and HSPA1L), valyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (VARS2), complement components (C2 and C4), pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor 2 (PBX2), retinoid X receptor beta (RXRB), NAT/RING3, and four other proteins.

Among these, the genes for collagen, complement components, NAT/RING3, PBX, and RXR appear to have been duplicated around the time of vertebrate emergence, supporting the idea that they were duplicated simultaneously at that time. Another group of genes that includes NOTCH and HSP appear to have diverged long before that time. A comparison of the physical maps of these two regions revealed that the genes which duplicated in the same period were arranged in almost the same order in the two regions, with the assumption of a few chromosomal rearrangements. We propose a possible model for the evolution of these regions, taking into account the molecular mechanisms of regional duplication, gene duplication, translocation, and inversion. We also propose that a comparative mapping of paralogous genes within the human genome would be useful for identifying new genes.","['Endo, T', 'Imanishi, T', 'Gojobori, T', 'Inoko, H']","['Endo T', 'Imanishi T', 'Gojobori T', 'Inoko H']","['Center for Information Biology, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 6.1.1.9 (Valine-tRNA Ligase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', '*Evolution, Molecular', '*Genome, Human', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', '*Multigene Family', 'Phylogeny', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Valine-tRNA Ligase/genetics']",1998/02/14 00:00,1998/02/14 00:01,['1998/02/14 00:00'],"['1998/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(97)00478-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(97)00478-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1997 Dec 31;205(1-2):19-27. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(97)00478-2.,,,,,,,,,"['Gene 1998 Apr 14;210(2):351, 353']",

Cells treated with protoporphyrin IX exhibit enhanced transferrin-receptor expression and markedly reduced ferritin synthesis. Stimulation of transferrin-receptor expression is observed at both the mRNA and protein level. The effect on ferritin synthesis is mediated by translational inhibition of the mRNA, which, in contrast, is transcriptionally stimulated by protoporphyrin IX treatment. The regulation of transferrin receptor and ferritin in response to iron perturbations has been studied extensively and is mediated by the binding of iron-regulatory proteins (IRP) to the iron-responsive elements (IRE) present in the 3' and 5' untranslated regions of the transferrin-receptor and ferritin mRNA, respectively. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of protoporphyrin IX on ferritin and transferrin-receptor expression, the role of the IRE sequence was investigated both in vivo by transfection experiments, with a construct containing the coding region for the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene under the translational control of the ferritin IRE, and in vitro by RNA band-shift assays. Whereas, examination of IRP binding to the IRE by in vitro assays suggests an apparent inactivation of IRP by protoporphyrin IX treatment, CAT assays indicate that protoporphyrin IX is able to induce in vivo a translational inhibition similar to that obtained by treatment with the iron chelator Desferal. This observation raises the possibility of different effects on the IRP activity exerted by porphyrin treatment in intact tissue-culture cells and in vitro. We conclude that translation of ferritin mRNA and degradation of transferrin-receptor mRNA are inhibited in intact tissue-culture cells by protoporphyrin IX through a mechanism similar to that exerted by iron chelation, thus involving depletion of the intracellular iron pool. These results can improve the understanding of the regulation of ferritin gene expression in some pathological conditions associated with disturbed heme synthesis.","['Coccia, E M', 'Perrotti, E', 'Stellacci, E', 'Orsatti, R', 'Del Russo, N', 'Marziali, G', 'Testa, U', 'Battistini, A']","['Coccia EM', 'Perrotti E', 'Stellacci E', 'Orsatti R', 'Del Russo N', 'Marziali G', 'Testa U', 'Battistini A']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Iron-Sulfur Proteins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Ferritins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Protoporphyrins/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Transfection/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/14 00:00,1998/02/14 00:01,['1998/02/14 00:00'],"['1998/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.00764.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1997 Dec 15;250(3):764-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.00764.x.,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, dolichyl phosphate and structurally related compounds were examined regarding their apoptosis-inducing activities in U937 cells. Dihydroheptaprenyl and dihydrodecaprenyl phosphates, of which isoprene units are shorter than that of dolichyl phosphate, induced apoptosis in U937 cells. This phenomenon occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as seen with dolichyl phosphate-induced apoptosis. Derivatives of the same isoprene units of dolichyl phosphate, such as dolichol, dolichal or dolichoic acid, did not induce DNA fragmentation. Farnesyl phosphate and geranylgeranyl phosphate also failed to induce apoptosis. During apoptosis, the caspase family of cysteine proteases play important roles. We observed that apoptosis induced by dihydroprenyl phosphate was mediated by caspase-3-like (CPP32-like) activation but not by caspase-1-like (ICE-like) activation. This caspase-3-like activation was inhibited by a specific inhibitor of caspase-3, DEVD-CHO, but not by an caspase-1 inhibitor YVAD-CHO. We interpret these results to mean that dihydroprenyl phosphates with more than seven isoprene units have apoptosis-inducing activity and that their signal is mediated by caspase-3-like activation.","['Yasugi, E', 'Nakata, K', 'Yokoyama, Y', 'Kano, K', 'Dohi, T', 'Oshima, M']","['Yasugi E', 'Nakata K', 'Yokoyama Y', 'Kano K', 'Dohi T', 'Oshima M']","['Division of Biochemistry and Nutrition, Research Institute, International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo. yasugi@imcj.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Dolichol Phosphates)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Polyisoprenyl Phosphates)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-amino-4-methylcoumarin)', '0 (aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '12698-55-4 (dolichol monophosphate)', '84744-41-2 (dihydroheptaprenyl phosphate)', '99103-20-5 (dihydrodecaprenyl phosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 1', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Coumarins/metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dolichol Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Polyisoprenyl Phosphates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/14 00:00,1998/02/14 00:01,['1998/02/14 00:00'],"['1998/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0005-2760(97)00156-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0005-2760(97)00156-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 Jan 15;1389(2):132-40. doi: 10.1016/s0005-2760(97)00156-2.,,,,,,,,,,

Antibodies to ZD1694 have been used to establish a sensitive radioimmunoassay as an alternative to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The radioimmunoassay is reproducible, accurate and provides a means of determining low levels of ZD1694 in plasma (< 1 nM). By virtue of the high cross-reactivity of the antibodies with polyglutamated forms of ZD1694, it is also possible to measure the total concentration of drug in tissues. Results obtained in L1210 mouse leukaemia cells and in mouse tissues were similar to those previously determined using radiolabelled drug. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice have confirmed that the compound is rapidly eliminated from the plasma and that there is a prolonged terminal elimination phase. ZD1694 was measured in plasma (0.56 ng ml(-1); 1.2 pmol ml(-1)) up to 7 days after a single i.p. dose of 100 mg kg(-1) ZD1694. Liver, kidney and gut epithelium had a substantially higher level of ZD1694 immunoreactivity than plasma. For example, 24 h after a single i.p. dose at 1, 10 and 100 mg kg(-1), total drug levels in the liver were 480, 325 and 152 times higher than plasma levels respectively. In kidney and gut epithelium, total drug levels at these doses were approximately 55 and 34 times those of plasma. The high tissue to plasma ratios were maintained for at least 7 days after administration. Similarly, high tissue to plasma ratios (> 100) were found in dogs treated with a clinically relevant dose of ZD1694. These were maintained for 4 weeks in liver and kidney tissue (> 100). Total gastrointestinal concentrations of ZD1694 were approximately 10 times higher than plasma 3 days after administration, but levels were near to the limit of detection at 4 weeks. These results are consistent with extensive polyglutamation of ZD1694 within tissues in both mice and dog and provide further support for the infrequent schedule that has been used clinically. Although it has not been possible to measure individual polyglutamated forms of ZD1694, the radioimmunoassay provides a convenient means of assessing total drug levels in tissues and is currently the only method suitable for measuring the extent of drug retention in normal tissue and tumour biopsies obtained from patients treated with ZD1694.","['Aherne, G W', 'Ward, E', 'Lawrence, N', 'Dobinson, D', 'Clarke, S J', 'Musgrove, H', 'Sutcliffe, F', 'Stephens, T', 'Jackman, A L']","['Aherne GW', 'Ward E', 'Lawrence N', 'Dobinson D', 'Clarke SJ', 'Musgrove H', 'Sutcliffe F', 'Stephens T', 'Jackman AL']","['CRC Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/blood/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Thiophenes/blood/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tissue Distribution']",1998/02/14 00:00,1998/02/14 00:01,['1998/02/14 00:00'],"['1998/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.37 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998;77(2):221-6. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.37.,,,,,,,PMC2151243,,,

The magnitude of this synergistic effect, together with evidence of clinical responses seen when these agents were given sequentially in ovarian cancer, merits further study.","['McGown, A T', 'Jayson, G', 'Pettit, G R', 'Haran, M S', 'Ward, T H', 'Crowther, D']","['McGown AT', 'Jayson G', 'Pettit GR', 'Haran MS', 'Ward TH', 'Crowther D']","['Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Lactones/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine/administration & dosage', 'Tamoxifen/*administration & dosage', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/administration & dosage']",1998/02/14 00:00,1998/02/14 00:01,['1998/02/14 00:00'],"['1998/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.36 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998;77(2):216-20. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.36.,,,,,,,PMC2151232,,,

By analysis of a short 244 bp segment of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene of other HERV-K10-like sequences, it has become clear that these elements represent an extended family consisting of multiple groups (the HML-1 to HML-6 subgroups). Some of these elements are transcriptionally active and contain an intact open reading frame for the RT protein, raising the possibility that this family is still expanding through retrotransposition. To better define the relationship of these endogenous retroviruses, we identified ten new members of the HML-2 subgroup. PCR was used to amplify reverse-transcribed RNA of a 595 bp region of the RT gene in a variety of human cell samples, including normal and leukaemic bone marrow and peripheral blood, placenta cells and a transformed T cell line. We provide an extensive phylogenetic analysis of the relationships for this cluster of HERV-K-related endogenous retroviral elements. Nucleotide diversity values for nonsynonymous versus synonymous codon positions indicate that moderately strong selection is or was operating on these retroviral RT gene segments. The evolution of this class of endogenous retroelements is discussed.","['Zsiros, J', 'Jebbink, M F', 'Lukashov, V V', 'Voute, P A', 'Berkhout, B']","['Zsiros J', 'Jebbink MF', 'Lukashov VV', 'Voute PA', 'Berkhout B']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'DNA, Viral', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/classification/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1998/02/14 00:00,1998/02/14 00:01,['1998/02/14 00:00'],"['1998/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-79-1-61 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1998 Jan;79 ( Pt 1):61-70. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-79-1-61.,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/U87587', 'GENBANK/U87588', 'GENBANK/U87589', 'GENBANK/U87590', 'GENBANK/U87591', 'GENBANK/U87592', 'GENBANK/U87593', 'GENBANK/U87594', 'GENBANK/U87595', 'GENBANK/U87596']",,

Resource allocation is, however, only one of a number of issue raised by the events of this case of a little girl with leukaemia. Child B appeared on, and was the subject of, a BBC Panorama current affairs documentary broadcast in the UK which made it clear that she was neither informed about her prognosis nor about the ensuing legal battle. The little girl was 10 years old. Adults have a duty to protect and promote the interests of children but a suspicion remains that this child's views might usefully have been sought before the clinical decision not to offer further treatment was taken. Even without this it is difficult to justify withholding the decision from her. It is the purpose of this paper to consider some of the moral tensions inherent in nursing someone in this child's position. The ethical arguments that appeared in the press were predictably deontological and utilitarian (relating to duty and the greater good respectively). Watching Child B tell her story served as a reminder that moral decisions are about the lives of people.

A preliminary phase I study demonstrated that up to 80 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone in combination with cytarabine 3 g/m2 daily for 5 days could be given as induction therapy to leukaemic patients with acceptable toxicity. Pharmacokinetic data from these patients demonstrated that high concentrations of mitoxantrone were achievable in vivo to levels that were extremely cytotoxic in vitro. Subsequently, in a phase II study, 45 patients with untreated acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) under the age of 60 received mitoxantrone 80 mg/m2 in combination with cytarabine 3 g/m2 daily for 5 days and etoposide 150 mg/m2 for 3 days. Following this induction, patients received five cycles of consolidation with cytarabine 3 g/m2 daily for 4 days with mitoxantrone 20 mg/m2 for 1 day on cycles 2 and 4, and etoposide 150 mg/m2 for 2 days with cytarabine on courses 1, 3 and 5. The patients in this study achieved a complete remission (CR) rate of 80% and a 3-year projected probability of survival of 40%. In a second AML study, 54 adults over the age of 60 with untreated AML were randomized to receive either high-dose or standard-dose mitoxantrone with cytarabine as a single induction regimen without consolidation. Patients receiving high-dose mitoxantrone did not experience increased morbidity or mortality compared with those given lower doses. Comparison of CR rates, disease-free and overall survival consistently favoured high-dose mitoxantrone, although the results did not achieve statistical significance. In patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), high-dose mitoxantrone with cytarabine was given as initial therapy in a phase II study involving 37 previously untreated adults. Results demonstrated that this dose-intensive regimen could produce a high CR rate (84%) with acceptable toxicity and compared favourably with experiences with vincristine/prednisone-based induction regimens. These studies demonstrate that high-dose mitoxantrone can be safely and effectively administered to patients with acute leukaemia and suggest that the incorporation of high doses of mitoxantrone into treatment regimens may lead to enhanced antileukaemic efficacy compared with standard doses.

RESULTS: Blast cell morphology was undifferentiated or of subtype FAB-L2 lymphoblastic leukemia with medium sized blasts, agranular basophilic cytoplasm, reticular nuclear chromatin and a prominent nucleolus. Cytochemical staining was negative for peroxidase and esterases, immunophenotyping showed the expression of one or more myeloid antigens (CD13, CD33) and was negative for lymphoid antigens. Immunocytochemical expression of myeloperoxidase was positive in the three cases where it was performed. Only one patient achieved complete remission and is free of disease after 36 months of follow up. All other patients died without obtaining remission, six shortly after the onset and one 12 months after.

The present study was designed to assess the effects of the combination of these cytokines after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Ten patients received rIFN-gamma alone and 13 patients the combination of rIFN-gamma + rIL-2. Patients received transplants because of lymphoma (10 patients), acute leukemia (3 patients) or solid tumors (10 patients). Immunotherapy was started at a median of 67 days after ABMT.

In the rIFN-gamma group, toxicity was mild and some biological changes were seen (NK/LAK activation, increase of phagocytosis and of NBT reduction). The combination of rIFN-gamma with rIL-2 did not increase the usual rIL-2 toxicity. NK/LAK cytotoxicity was strongly activated after the first cycle of rIL-2 and was maintained until the end of therapy. Granulocyte chemotaxis was defective after cycle 1 but recovered thereafter. We conclude that the administration of rIFN-gamma + rIL-2 is feasible after ABMT. Our data suggest that the combination may have prolonged the immunologic activation provided by rIL-2 and some improvement of the deleterious effects of rIL-2 on granulocyte functions was achieved.

Expression of the receptors was studied in the human monocytic leukemia line THP-1. Within two days of incubation, the proinflammatory cytokines, interferon (IFN)-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), each induced a slight increase in cell surface expression of the 75 kDa TNF receptors (TNF-R75), and a more pronounced increase in the generation of soluble TNF-R75. Similarly, receptor mRNA levels were increased in response to both cytokines. GM-CSF and IFN-gamma in combination induced a much stronger increase in cell surface and soluble receptors as well as in receptor mRNA. Expression of the 55 kDa TNF receptor and its mRNA was largely unaffected by the two cytokines. Experiments using TNF-neutralizing antibodies indicate that the changes in TNF-R75 expression occurred independently of endogenously-produced TNF. The half life of TNF-R75 mRNA in cells exposed to GM-CSF + IFN-gamma did not differ significantly from that in untreated cells. According to nuclear run-on assays the synthesis of TNF-R75 mRNA in cells treated with GM-CSF + IFN-gamma, as well as with the phorbol ester TPA, was markedly increased compared to untreated cells, indicating that the observed changes in receptor expression primarily involve altered transcription of the gene. The results suggest that in inflammatory processes, GM-CSF and IFN-gamma contribute to increased synthesis of TNF-R75 by monocytic cells, a prerequisite for the formation of large amounts of soluble receptors.","['Mylius-Spencker, H', 'Winzen, R', 'Resch, K', 'Holtmann, H']","['Mylius-Spencker H', 'Winzen R', 'Resch K', 'Holtmann H']","['Institute of Molecular Pharmacology, Medical School Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Solubility', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/12 00:00,1998/02/12 00:01,['1998/02/12 00:00'],"['1998/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 1997 Dec;8(4):351-8.,,,,,,,,,,

In mouse brain, p85 as well as a protein of 70-72 kDa were immunodetected. This protein was also present in several other mouse tissues. Limited proteolysis of p85 and the 70-72kDa-protein from mouse yielded similar peptide fragments, suggesting that both proteins are related. Fragments of the same molecular masses were also detected in OK cell membranes following proteolysis, showing that p85 in both models (mouse brain and OK cell) share a similar sequence. p85 is not N-glycosylated since an assay using endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F did not alter the electrophoretic mobility of p85. We also observed that regulation of phosphate transport by incubating OK cells without any phosphate or by PTH treatment occurs without any changes in the amount of p85. In conclusion, these data demonstrate for the first time a Western blot detection of a type III phosphate transporter using polyclonal antibodies. They also suggest that, conversely to type I and type II phosphate transporters which are localized in the kidney, this third type of transporter is ubiquitous and probably absorbs the readily available phosphate from interstitial fluid for normal cellular functions in many species and tissues, serving as a housekeeping Na+/Pi cotransport system. This is also the first report showing that p85 is not regulated in the same manner as type II phosphate transporters.","['Boyer, C J', 'Baines, A D', 'Beaulieu, E', 'Beliveau, R']","['Boyer CJ', 'Baines AD', 'Beaulieu E', 'Beliveau R']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Universite du Quebec a Montreal-Hopital Ste-Justine, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chymotrypsin/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kidney/cytology/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Opossums', 'Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/immunology/*metabolism', 'Sodium/*metabolism', 'Species Specificity']",1998/02/12 00:00,1998/02/12 00:01,['1998/02/12 00:00'],"['1998/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0005-2736(97)00159-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0005-2736(97)00159-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 Jan 5;1368(1):73-83. doi: 10.1016/s0005-2736(97)00159-4.,,,,,,,,,,

PCR techniques have greatly simplified routine detection of monoclonal rearrangements. But on the one hand, identification of the sequences requires sequencing methods and on the other hand, sizing of rearrangements by conventional analysis of PCR products on agarose or nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels may be uncertain. We have developed an approach based on amplification of rearranged IGH, TCRG and TCRD locus by fluorescent PCR associated to a computerized analysis of generated PCR products allowing their objective sizing. We tested this method on DNA samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, whose pattern of IGH and TCRG rearrangements had been previously identified by Southern blot techniques. TCRG-PCR assay allowed detection of 100% of rearranged samples. No false-negative results were found but a high rate (60%) of Southern-negative and PCR-positive samples were identified. TCRD PCR-assay detected VD1-JD1 or VD2-D2/3 rearrangements in both acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples. IGH PCR assay permitted detection of all known rearranged samples. The sensitivity of these three different PCR assays (1% leukemic cells) was equivalent to that of other published PCR protocols. These results show the validity and reliability of the fluorescent PCR method for routine detection of IGH, TCRG and TCRD rearrangements. Sizing of PCR products by computerized analysis was also validated. It provides additional information on rearrangement patterns in lymphoproliferative diseases, as clonal rearrangements can be recognized by their size. This can be of great interest in various circumstances, particularly for detection and follow-up of oligoclonality.","['Kerlan-Candon, S', 'Soua, Z', 'Lefranc, M P', 'Clot, J', 'Eliaou, J F']","['Kerlan-Candon S', 'Soua Z', 'Lefranc MP', 'Clot J', 'Eliaou JF']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, INSERM U291, Hopital Saint Eloi, CHU Montpellier, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Child', 'Fluorescent Dyes', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics']",1998/02/12 00:00,1998/02/12 00:01,['1998/02/12 00:00'],"['1998/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1998.tb02943.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1998 Jan;51(1):20-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1998.tb02943.x.,,,,,,,,,,

The functional relevance of PKC for the MDR phenotype remains unclear, and the involvement of a particular PKC isozyme in clinically occurring drug resistance is not known. Recently, we have demonstrated significant correlations between the expression levels of the PKC eta isozyme and the MDR1 or MRP (multidrug resistance-associated protein) genes in blasts from patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and in ascites cell aspirates from ovarian cancer patients. To extend these findings to further types of human tumours we analysed specimens from 64 patients with primary breast cancer for their individual expression levels of several MDR-associated genes (MDR1, MRP, LRP (lung cancer resistance-related protein), topoisomerase (Topo) II alpha/IIbeta, cyclin A and the PKC isozyme genes (alpha, beta1, beta2, eta, theta, and mu) by a cDNA-PCR approach. We found significantly enhanced mean values for MRP, LRP and PKC eta gene expression, but significantly decreased Topo II alpha and cyclin A gene expression levels in G2 tumours compared with G3. Remarkably, significant positive correlations between the MDR1, MRP or LRP gene expression levels and PKC eta were determined: MDR1/PKC eta (rs = +0.6451, P < 0.0001) n = 62; MRP/PKC eta (rs = +0.5454, P < 0.0001) n = 63; LRP/PKC eta (rs = +0.5436, P < 0.0001) n = 62; MRP/LRP (rs = +0.7703, P < 0.0001) and n = 62, MDR1/MRP (rs = +0.5042, P < 0.0001) n = 62.

We have analysed etoposide-induced cell death in two lymphoblastoid T-cell lines, CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4, specifically in relation to DNA cleavage as indicated by pulse-field gel and conventional electrophoresis. High (5 microM) concentration etoposide causes 50-kb cleavage of DNA that occurs at the same time as apoptotic morphology and internucleosomal cleavage. At lower concentrations (0.5-0.05 microM), sequential change may be discerned with altered gene expression being similar to that at high dose, but preceding cell cycle arrest and 50-kb cleavage. These last changes, in turn, clearly precede internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA, vital dye staining and morphological evidence cell death. The pattern of higher order fragmentation constitutes a sensitive indicator of commitment to cell death in these cells. Morphological evidence of cell death is associated with internucleosomal fragmentation in one of the lines, but the pattern of 50-kb DNA cleavage provides the clearest evidence of commonality in death processes occurring at low and high drug concentration.","['Sleiman, R J', 'Catchpoole, D R', 'Stewart, B W']","['Sleiman RJ', 'Catchpoole DR', 'Stewart BW']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney Children's Hospital, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Coloring Agents', '*DNA Fragmentation', '*DNA, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trypan Blue', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/02/12 00:00,1998/02/12 00:01,['1998/02/12 00:00'],"['1998/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.7 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998;77(1):40-50. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.7.,,,,,,,PMC2151273,,,

However, small percentages of less than 9.0% of cells with bcr/abl fusion signals were below the threshold of interphase FISH, thereby limiting its use for detecting minimal residual disease.","['Werner, M', 'Ewig, M', 'Nasarek, A', 'Wilkens, L', 'von Wasielewski, R', 'Tchinda, J', 'Nolte, M']","['Werner M', 'Ewig M', 'Nasarek A', 'Wilkens L', 'von Wasielewski R', 'Tchinda J', 'Nolte M']","['Institute of Pathology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes/cytology', 'Middle Aged', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1998/02/12 00:00,1998/02/12 00:01,['1998/02/12 00:00'],"['1998/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00019606-199710000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 1997 Oct;6(5):282-7. doi: 10.1097/00019606-199710000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,

The aryl groups of these tricyclic pyrone (TP) analogs are either 3, 4-dimethoxyphenyl in H5 and H15 or 3-pyridyl in H10 and H14. Since 50 M H5 and H10 both inhibit DNA synthesis and tumor cell growth by 79-100%, concentrations 25 M were used in this study to assess the structure-activity relationships for this class of compounds. At 10-25 M, H5 and H14 are more potent inhibitors of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis than H10. In contrast, at 5-25 M, H10 is much more effective than H5 and H14 at inhibiting the growth of L1210 cells over a 4-day period. Interestingly, H15 inhibits DNA synthesis as much as H10 but fails to alter tumor cell growth. This discrepancy between the ability of TPs to inhibit macromolecule synthesis and leukemic cell growth suggests that other molecular targets may be involved in the antitumor action of these drugs. Their short-term inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis is reversible following drug removal but their long-term inhibition of tumor cell growth is not. Moreover, 25 M H5 and H10 are not cytotoxic at 2 days but equally decrease cell viability at 4 days, suggesting that the potent and irreversible inhibition of cell proliferation observed 1-4 days after H10 treatment is not solely caused by drug cytotoxicity. The effectiveness of H10 as inhibitor of L1210 cell growth is comparable to that of a spectrum of representative anticancer drugs. A critical finding is that 5 M H10 blocks the polymerization of purified tubulin by 90% and, therefore, may be a novel microtubule de-stabilizing drug. Indeed, H10 inhibits tubulin polymerization and L1210 cell growth as much as 5 M of vincristine (VCR). In contrast, 5 M H5 alters neither tubulin polymerization nor tumor cell growth. The ability of H10 to disrupt microtubule dynamics indirectly suggests that TPs may be novel cell cycle-specific anticancer drugs useful for arresting mammalian cells in mitosis.","['Newell, S W', 'Perchellet, E M', 'Ladesich, J B', 'Freeman, J A', 'Chen, Y', 'Liu, L', 'Hua, D H', 'Kraft, S L', 'Basaraba, R J', 'Perchellet, J P']","['Newell SW', 'Perchellet EM', 'Ladesich JB', 'Freeman JA', 'Chen Y', 'Liu L', 'Hua DH', 'Kraft SL', 'Basaraba RJ', 'Perchellet JP']","['Anti-Cancer Drug Laboratory, Division of Biology, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, Kansas 66506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Tubulin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Nucleic Acids/biosynthesis', 'Pyrones/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tubulin/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/12 05:01,2001/03/07 10:01,['1998/02/12 05:01'],"['1998/02/12 05:01 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '1998/02/12 05:01 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.12.2.433 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1998 Feb;12(2):433-42. doi: 10.3892/ijo.12.2.433.,,,,,,,,,,

In order to contribute to the analysis of the mechanisms involved in this drug resistance, expression and activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), two drug efflux pumps conferring multidrug resistance, have been investigated in the CD34+ KG1a leukemic myeloid cell line and in two CD34- K562 and HL60 leukemic myeloid cell lines. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and dye efflux assays revealed that KG1a cells express P-gp but not MRP whereas neither P-gp nor MRP were detected in K562 and HL60 cells. In addition, KG1a cells were demonstrated to display resistance to anticancer drug substrates for P-gp such as vincristine and daunorubicin and to poorly accumulate vincristine.

We studied the inhibitory effect of sterols on induction of LDL-receptor activity in leukemic cells from 27 patients with AML and in white blood cells from 13 healthy individuals. The high affinity degradation rate of 125I-labeled LDL was determined in mononuclear blood cells directly after isolation from blood and after incubation for 2 days in medium with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum with or without various concentrations of 25-hydroxycholesterol + cholesterol. The median sterol concentration for 50% inhibition (IC50) of induction was more than five times higher for leukemic cells than for normal mononuclear cells. At the highest sterol concentration (0.400 microg/mL 25-hydroxycholesterol + 8 microg/mL cholesterol), the LDL-receptor activity was abolished in cells from all healthy individuals while the induction of LDL-receptor activity in cells from three AML patients was unaffected. The LDL-receptor activity of leukemic cells, directly after isolation from blood, correlated with IC50 values (r = 0.53, P = 0.007) and WBC counts (r = 0.72, P = 0.0001) but not with cellular cholesterol levels.

In the current studies, we have employed murine plasma cell tumors to examine IL-2-mediated tumor rejection as a possible model for therapeutic approaches to human myeloma or plasma cell leukemia. Two murine plasma cell tumor lines, S107 and X24, were infected with a retroviral vector expressing the human IL-2 gene, and the antitumor potential of IL-2-expressing infectants was characterized in syngeneic BALB/c and BALB/c nu/nu mice. Results demonstrate that tumorigenicity of both lines correlates inversely with the amount of IL-2 produced by the tumor cells. However, there are clear differences between the two lines in terms of reduced tumorigenicity and the ability to protect against co-injected parental tumor cells that appear unrelated to IL-2 levels. More importantly, intravenous immunization of animals with irradiated, IL-2 secreting cells from either line leads to significant protection from challenge with highly metastatic parental cells. These results suggest that such an approach may warrant consideration in the treatment of human plasma cell dyscrasias.","['Kopantzev, E', 'Roschke, V', 'Rudikoff, S']","['Kopantzev E', 'Roschke V', 'Rudikoff S']","['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/11 00:00,1998/02/11 00:01,['1998/02/11 00:00'],"['1998/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1998.9.1-13 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1998 Jan 1;9(1):13-9. doi: 10.1089/hum.1998.9.1-13.,,,,,,['Hum Gene Ther. 1998 Jan 1;9(1):1-2.

L. Condorelli et al., Blood, 86: 164-175, 19951. Here, it is shown that, in a hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) unilineage differentiation culture, tal-1 is induced and then expressed, in a sustained manner, in the megakaryopoietic lineage, whereas it is barely or not detected in the monocytopoietic series. We have investigated the role of enforced tal-1 expression by retroviral transfer into HPCs [erythroid burst-forming units and megakaryocytic and granulomonocytic colony-forming units (CFUs)], primitive HPCs (high proliferative potential colony-forming cells), and putative hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), assayed as long-term culture initiating cells. TAL-1 overexpression induces an increase of erythroid burst-forming unit colony number and size and megakaryocytic CFU colony number and an inhibition of granulomonocytic CFU and granulocytic CFU (CFU-G) but not monocytic CFU colony number; conversely, TAL-1 mutants with defective heterodimerizing or DNA-binding domains do not exert these effects at a significant level. Although it does not affect long-term culture initiating cells, exogenous TAL-1 causes a significant proliferative stimulus on primary and secondary high proliferative potential colony-forming cells. In conclusion, exogenous tal-1 exerts differential and stage- and lineage-specific effects on the HPC/HSC differentiation/proliferation gene programs. Thus, it induces a stimulatory effect at the level of erythroid and megakaryocytic HPCs, while exerting a selective proliferative action on downstream erythropoiesis. Furthermore, it induces differential effects on the myeloid series: the partial blockade of CFU-G differentiation is possibly linked to the sharp down-modulation of endogenous TAL-1 expression at the level of the CFU-G-to-granulopoietic precursor differentiation step; in contrast, no significant effect is observed on monocytic CFU colony formation. Finally, the stimulatory effect on primitive HPCs but not putative stem cells suggests subtle differences in the effects exerted by tal-1 overexpression on primitive HPC/HSC subsets in adult life.","['Valtieri, M', 'Tocci, A', 'Gabbianelli, M', 'Luchetti, L', 'Masella, B', 'Vitelli, L', 'Botta, R', 'Testa, U', 'Condorelli, G L', 'Peschle, C']","['Valtieri M', 'Tocci A', 'Gabbianelli M', 'Luchetti L', 'Masella B', 'Vitelli L', 'Botta R', 'Testa U', 'Condorelli GL', 'Peschle C']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects', '*Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/drug effects', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection']",1998/02/11 00:00,1998/02/11 00:01,['1998/02/11 00:00'],"['1998/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Feb 1;58(3):562-9.,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr) antibody revealed that HMBA increased P-Tyr levels and/or amounts of several proteins containing P-Tyr in F5-5, a murine erythroleukemia cell line. Among these proteins, we identified a Mr 130,000 protein to be Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2). HMBA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) but not other JAKs or STATs. This phosphorylation was apparent 12 h after treatment, maximal at 24 h, and persisted for at least 96 h. Consistently, HMBA increased STAT5 DNA-binding activities. Other chemical inducers, DMSO and butyrate, also induced a sustained activation of JAK2/STAT5, whereas fetal calf serum and erythropoietin induced transient activation but not differentiation. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative form of STAT5 inhibited the chemically induced differentiation. These results suggest that persistent activation of the signaling pathway plays a significant role in the inducer-mediated differentiation. Our data also suggest that molecular mechanisms for the inducer-mediated activation of JAK2 are independent of cytokine receptor-mediated activation mechanisms. We tentatively conclude that cytokine signaling is an important target of chemical inducers in these cells.","['Yamashita, T', 'Wakao, H', 'Miyajima, A', 'Asano, S']","['Yamashita T', 'Wakao H', 'Miyajima A', 'Asano S']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Japan. y-taka@hgc.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Fetal Blood', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/11 00:00,1998/02/11 00:01,['1998/02/11 00:00'],"['1998/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Feb 1;58(3):556-61.,,,,,,,,,,

This crucial initiation event is believed to be the result of random DNA breakage and misrepair, whereas the subsequent steps, promotion and progression, must rely on mechanisms of selective pressure to provide the expanding leukemic population with its proliferative/renewal advantage. To investigate the susceptibility of human cells to external agents at the genetic recombination stage of leukemogenesis, we subjected two hematopoietic cell lines, KG1 and HL60, to high doses of gamma-irradiation. The irradiation induced the formation of fusion genes characteristic of leukemia in both cell lines, but at a much higher frequency in KG1 than in HL60. In KG1 cells, the AML1-ETO hybrid gene [associated with the t(8;21) translocation of acute myeloid leukemia] occurred significantly more often than the BCR-ABL [associated with t(9;22) chronic myeloid leukemia] or the DEK-CAN [associated with t(6;9) acute myeloid leukemia] fusion genes. These findings support the notion that ionizing radiation can directly generate leukemia-specific fusion genes but emphasize the differing susceptibility of different cell populations and the differing frequency with which the various fusion genes are formed. The selectivity observed at the primary level of gene fusion formation may explain at least in part the differential risk for development of some but not other forms of leukemia after high-dose radiation exposure.","['Deininger, M W', 'Bose, S', 'Gora-Tybor, J', 'Yan, X H', 'Goldman, J M', 'Melo, J V']","['Deininger MW', 'Bose S', 'Gora-Tybor J', 'Yan XH', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DEK-CAN fusion protein, recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/radiation effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', '*Gamma Rays', 'HL-60 Cells/*radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*genetics', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*radiation effects']",1998/02/11 00:00,1998/02/11 00:01,['1998/02/11 00:00'],"['1998/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Feb 1;58(3):421-5.,,,,,,,,,,

The major causes of death in this population are relapse of leukemia, infection, and treatment related complications. Our purpose was to achieve a homogenous radiation dose distribution and to minimize the dose to the lungs, liver, and kidneys so that the incidence of organ injury was reduced. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Dose to the bone marrow, midplane, and periphery was quantified by use of thermoluminescent detectors in a bone-equivalent tissue phantom. In an effort to reduce the risk of complications, we treated relapsed or refractory leukemia patients with TBI administered in fractionated, parallel opposed large fields with 24 MV photons, using tissue compensation and partial-transmission lung shielding. Tissue toxicities were then determined. RESULTS: Dose quantitation in bone-equivalent and tissue-equivalent phantoms demonstrated that backscatter and pair production interactions adjacent to bone increased the bone marrow dose by 6 to 11%. At an SSD of 400 cm and at patient diameters of 20 to 40 cm, the percent inhomogeneity across the phantom with 24 MV photons was 0 to 0.3%, compared to 4 to 6% for 6 MV photons. End-organ toxicities consisted of clinical interstitial pneumonitis in six patients, idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis in three patients, renal toxicity in seven patients, and veno-occlusive disease of the liver in one patient. Toxicities did not correlate with fractionation schedule. CONCLUSIONS: Total-body irradiation administered with 24 MV photons increases the dose deposition in bone marrow through pair production and backscatter interactions occurring in bone. Because percent depth dose increases with SSD, the 24 MV beam is more penetrating at a 400 cm distance than at 100 cm and dose homogeneity is improved with higher energies. Thus, the incidence of radiation-mediated injury to lung, liver, and kidney is reduced. This is an effective preparatory regimen for patients with high-risk leukemias requiring bone marrow transplantation.","['Bradley, J', 'Reft, C', 'Goldman, S', 'Rubin, C', 'Nachman, J', 'Larson, R', 'Hallahan, D E']","['Bradley J', 'Reft C', 'Goldman S', 'Rubin C', 'Nachman J', 'Larson R', 'Hallahan DE']","['Department of Radiation and Cellular Oncology, The University of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods/mortality']",1998/02/11 00:00,1998/02/11 00:01,['1998/02/11 00:00'],"['1998/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360301697005786 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(97)00578-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Jan 15;40(2):391-6. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(97)00578-6.,['CA 58508/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In this population, infection is frequently due to reactivation of latent virus. The major immediate early promoter of HCMV controls production of immediate early gene products, which are both trans- and cis-active and are responsible for reactivation. Activation of this promoter is therefore a crucial step in regulation of reactivation infection. It is known that there are cAMP-response elements in the HCMV major immediate early promoter. We hypothesized that prostaglandins (PG), like PGE2, which are known to increase cAMP, as well as cytokines known to be released during acute inflammation, may be important in the regulation of this promoter and thus in reactivation of HCMV. To examine this, we transfected pCAT760, a plasmid containing the major immediate early promoter of HCMV upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, into THP-1 cells. These cells were subsequently stimulated with PGE2 and/or one of a variety of cytokines. We found that PGE2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-1 beta each upregulated the HCMV major immediate early promoter. TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-10 were each synergistic or additive with PGE2 in upregulating the promoter. Since PGE2 and the cytokines are all products of activated macrophages, we suggest that acute inflammation and macrophage activation may predispose to reactivation of latent HCMV.","['Kline, J N', 'Hunninghake, G M', 'He, B', 'Monick, M M', 'Hunninghake, G W']","['Kline JN', 'Hunninghake GM', 'He B', 'Monick MM', 'Hunninghake GW']","['Department of Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Exp Lung Res,Experimental lung research,8004944,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Cytomegalovirus/*genetics/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*drug effects/physiology', 'Genes, Immediate-Early/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Activation/*drug effects/physiology']",1998/02/11 00:00,1998/02/11 00:01,['1998/02/11 00:00'],"['1998/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/01902149809046050 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Lung Res. 1998 Jan-Feb;24(1):3-14. doi: 10.3109/01902149809046050.,"['KO8 HL02950/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI35018/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'SCOR HL37121/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Our goal was to introduce posttransplantation immunotherapy for eradication of tumor cells that escape high-dose chemoradiotherapy prior to transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Murine B-cell leukemia in BALB/c mice was used to develop a preclinical model to study the role of cytokine-mediated immunotherapy and allogeneic cell-mediated immunotherapy with donor lymphocytes in minimal residual disease (MRD). Based on these studies, a clinical trial was initiated to investigate the safety and efficacy of treating lymphoma patients with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) at the stage of MRD following autoBMT. The clinical application of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) was also investigated for treatment and prevention of relapse following alloBMT. Patients in relapse following alloBMT who were resistant to DLI were treated with DLI plus rIL-2 in an attempt to activate the alloreactive potential of immunocompetent donor lymphocytes. RESULTS: High-dose rIL-2 was effective against MRD in BALB/c mice, and the combination of rIL-2 and IFN-alpha resulted in synergistic effects even at doses of rIL-2 that were ineffective when given alone. In this animal model, graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effects were induced by DLI after alloBMT and could be potentiated by coadministration of rIL-2. In clinical studies, rIL-2 plus IFN-alpha significantly improved relapse rate and survival in lymphoma patients treated after autoBMT. Relapse following alloBMT was successfully treated with DLI, and a proportion of patients who failed to respond to DLI could be salvaged with a combination of DLI and low-dose rIL-2. CONCLUSIONS: Following autoBMT, GVL effects may be induced with a combination of rIL-2 and IFN-alpha, resulting in a reduced rate of relapse. The combination of both allogeneic donor lymphocytes and rIL-2 seemed synergistic. Because DLI plus rIL-2 was effective, even following failure of myeloablative conditioning, future strategies for treatment of leukemia should be based on T-cell-dependent immunotherapy rather than high-dose chemoradiotherapy.","['Slavin, S', 'Nagler, A']","['Slavin S', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer J Sci Am,The cancer journal from Scientific American,9513568,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/methods', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/02/11 00:00,1998/02/11 00:01,['1998/02/11 00:00'],"['1998/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer J Sci Am. 1997 Dec;3 Suppl 1:S59-67.,,,,,,['Cancer J Sci Am. 1997 Dec;3 Suppl 1:S35-6.

It has been postulated that recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) administered as consolidative immunotherapy early after BMT or SCT, at a time of minimal residual disease, might reduce the relapse rate. We review here preliminary results from a series of studies designed to investigate the safety, immunomodulatory effects, and clinical benefits of rIL-2 therapy following autologous and allogeneic BMT and SCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with hematologic malignancies underwent autologous or allogeneic BMT or SCT and received rIL-2 by continuous intravenous infusion a median of 33 to 56 days later. In all trials, the rIL-2 regimen consisted of a moderate induction dose for 4 to 5 days in the hospital, 4 to 6 days of rest, and a low maintenance dose for 10 days in the outpatient setting. A phase I trial of Roche rIL-2 after autoBMT, a feasibility trial of autologous lymphokine-activated killer cells with rIL-2, and another phase I/II trial of Chiron rIL-2 after autoBMT were performed. A similar phase I trial of IL-2 after alloBMT was also performed in children with acute leukemia beyond first complete remission. RESULTS: An rIL-2 regimen has been identified that can be tolerated early after transplantation. Administration of this rIL-2 regimen induces marked increases in CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes and CD3-CD56+ natural killer cells and enhances their antitumor cytolytic activity. Encouraging but somewhat inconsistent clinical outcomes were noted in phase I/II trials in patients with lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia.

We report here the updated results of those studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1988, a total of 24 patients with relapsed-refractory AML and < or = 30% bone marrow blasts (median blastosis, 15%), who were not suitable for further chemotherapy, were treated with a daily dose-escalating protocol of rIL-2 (8-18 x 10(6) IU/m2 x 5 days) by continuous intravenous infusion with a 72-hour rest period between each cycle. Patients achieving a response to induction therapy received subcutaneous maintenance rIL-2 therapy at lower doses for 5 days/month. Based on these encouraging results, a prospective randomized trial was initiated by the Italian cooperative groups GIMEMA (Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto) and AIEOP (Associazione Italiana Ematologie e Oncologia Pedietrica) to assess the efficacy of this rIL-2 regimen in AML patients in second CR. Of 264 AML patients enrolled, 146 patients (55%) achieved a second CR in response to mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine; 32 patients who were not eligible for transplantation were randomized to rIL-2 (15 patients) or no treatment (17 control patients). Accural goals were never reached, however, due to low recruitment. RESULTS: In the pilot study, 13 patients (54%) obtained a CR, which persists in eight patients with a median follow-up of 64 months (range, 1-110 months) on maintenance rIL-2. In the randomized study, a trend in favor of improved disease-free survival was observed in the rIL-2 arm. CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging results have been obtained with rIL-2 therapy in AML patients with relapsed-refractory disease and limited blastosis and in patients in second CR. These results have prompted a large, multicenter, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of high-dose rIL-2 therapy in AML patients with advanced disease but limited blastosis in relapse following cytoreductive chemotherapy or autologous transplantation.","['Meloni, G', 'Vignetti, M', 'Pogliani, E', 'Invernizzi, R', 'Allione, B', 'Mirto, S', 'Sica, S', 'Leoni, F', 'Selleri, C', 'Mandelli, F']","['Meloni G', 'Vignetti M', 'Pogliani E', 'Invernizzi R', 'Allione B', 'Mirto S', 'Sica S', 'Leoni F', 'Selleri C', 'Mandelli F']","[""Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) cooperative group, Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer J Sci Am,The cancer journal from Scientific American,9513568,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/02/11 00:00,1998/02/11 00:01,['1998/02/11 00:00'],"['1998/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer J Sci Am. 1997 Dec;3 Suppl 1:S43-7.,,,,,,['Cancer J Sci Am. 1997 Dec;3 Suppl 1:S35-6.

We studied the medical history and outcome of seven patients with a primary malignant parotid lymphoma. We looked for prognostic variables and for different behavior of these lymphomas in comparison to lymphomas in the usual sites. METHODS: Between 1985 and 1995, we conducted a retrospective study of the medical histories of malignant parotid tumors operated at our hospital. There were 18 malignancies, of which 7 were primary malignant lymphomas. We classified them according to Rosenberg et al. [Blood 1994;84: 1359-1392]. Outcome and survival time were compared with malignant lymphomas in usual sites. Further we looked for possible prognostic factors. RESULTS: We found an unusually high percentage of primary malignant lymphomas in the parotid gland in our series: 38% of all malignancies. Histological workup showed one Hodgkin lymphoma, two marginal zone B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, two lymphoplasmocytoid non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and two follicular non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The clinical course of these lymphomas is comparable to that in lymphomas in the usual sites. CONCLUSIONS: Primary malignant lymphomas in the parotid gland have no different behavior compared to lymphomas in usual sites. There are no prognostic variables that distinguish a malignant lymphoma in the parotid gland. The only difference is a rather difficult operation to obtain a histologic specimen.","['von Stritzky, M', 'Wereldsma, J C', 'Pegels, J G']","['von Stritzky M', 'Wereldsma JC', 'Pegels JG']","['Department of Surgery, St. Franciscus Gasthuis, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parotid Gland/surgery', '*Parotid Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies']",1998/02/11 04:14,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/02/11 04:14'],"['1998/02/11 04:14 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/02/11 04:14 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-9098(199801)67:1<25::AID-JSO5>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-9098(199801)67:1<25::aid-jso5>3.0.co;2-o [doi]']",ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 1998 Jan;67(1):25-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-9098(199801)67:1<25::aid-jso5>3.0.co;2-o.,,,,,,,,,,

Early NO-mediated signals comprise activation of a Z-A-DCB (benzoyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene)-sensit ive, caspase-3 like cysteine protease that cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP), and the fluorogenic substrate N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. In association with these early apoptotic alterations p21 (WAF1/Cip1) is upregulated, but NO affected cell proliferation and apoptosis at a similar dose. At later time points the classical antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 is downregulated, indicating that decreased Bcl-2 expression is secondary and not a prerequisite for initiation of apoptosis. N-Acetylcysteine (1 mM) interfered with NO-mediated apoptotic signaling, blocking DNA fragmentation as well as PARP and U1 snRNP cleavage. In contrast Z-A-DCB suppressed DNA fragmentation and U1 snRNP cleavage, while PARP breakdown proceeded unaltered. Observing proteolytic PARP digestion without apoptotic alterations questions PARP cleavage as an apoptotic parameter. These results suggest that a Z-A-DCB-sensitive caspase that is distinct from the PARP-cleaving enzyme is activated during NO exposure. NO-mediated apoptotic signaling in U937 cells activates caspases, some of which are dispensable for propagating the death signal.","['Brockhaus, F', 'Brune, B']","['Brockhaus F', 'Brune B']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medicine IV-Experimental Division, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nitrogen Oxides)', '0 (Nitroso Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nuclear)', '136587-13-8 (spermine nitric oxide complex)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '57564-91-7 (S-Nitrosoglutathione)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glutathione/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Nitric Oxide/*pharmacology', 'Nitrogen Oxides', 'Nitroso Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nuclear/metabolism', 'S-Nitrosoglutathione', 'Spermine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/11 00:00,1998/02/11 00:01,['1998/02/11 00:00'],"['1998/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(97)93778-2 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3778 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1998 Jan 10;238(1):33-41. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3778.,,,,,,,,,,

Associations between oral manifestations and laboratory data were also investigated. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of 230 cases was conducted to investigate the nature and incidence of oral manifestations at initial presentation. The following data were determined for each patient: age, sex, haemogram at diagnosis (which included haemoglobin, red blood cell counts, differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts), classification of the type of leukemia's systemic symptoms and oral manifestations at the initial physical examination including the dental consultation. RESULTS: It was revealed that the type of leukemia diagnosed, except with CML, is related to the age prediliction of patients. The incidence of leukemia is higher in males than in females. The most common manifestations of leukemia are lymphadenopathy (71.4% in ALL; 45% in AML), laryngeal pain (52.7% in ALL; 37.3% in AML), gingival bleeding (43.2% in AML; 28.6% in ALL), oral ulceration, and gingival enlargement. Fever (92.2%) was the most common symptom in patients with all types of leukemia. Platelet counts from 25,000 mm-3 to 60,000 mm-3 are at sufficiently low levels to result in spontaneous bleeding. Most of the patients had WBC counts of greater than 10,000 mm-3. Only 12.6% of patients had normal WBC counts.

GAL1 overexpression is associated with neoplastic transformation and loss of differentiation. The gene encoding for human GAL1 resides on chromosome 22(q12; q13), and its expression is developmentally regulated. Although devoid of signal peptide GAL1 can be externalized from cells by a mechanism independent of the normal secretory process. We report here on a study of the effects of erythroid differentiation of the human leukemia cell line K562 on GAL1 protein expression. In undifferentiated K562 cells, GAL1 was expressed into the cytosol. However, the amount of GAL1 was surprisingly weaker in K562 cells than in other leukemia cell lines such as TF-1 or KG1a. Treatment of K562 cells with erythropoietin (EPO) or with aphidicolin (APH), an inhibitor for DNA polymerase alpha, induced an erythroid phenotype and led to the externalization of cytosolic GAL1 which was then bound to ligands on cell surface in a galactoside-inhibitable fashion. Our results demonstrate that acquisition of an erythroid phenotype is associated with an externalization of GAL1. The autocrine binding of GAL1 to cell surface ligands of non adherent cells such as K562 suggest that GAL1 is implicated rather in signal transduction than in cell-cell or cell-matrix interaction. Moreover, the reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22 t(9;22) present in K562 cells might explain the weak expression of GAL1 in K562 leukemia cells.","['Lutomski, D', 'Fouillit, M', 'Bourin, P', 'Mellottee, D', 'Denize, N', 'Pontet, M', 'Bladier, D', 'Caron, M', 'Joubert-Caron, R']","['Lutomski D', 'Fouillit M', 'Bourin P', 'Mellottee D', 'Denize N', 'Pontet M', 'Bladier D', 'Caron M', 'Joubert-Caron R']","['Biochimie Cellulaire des Hemopathies Lymphoides et des Vascularites, Laboratoire de Biochimie et Technologie des Proteines, Universite Paris-Nord, Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Galectin 1)', '0 (Glycoconjugates)', '0 (Hemagglutinins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)']",IM,"['Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA Polymerase I/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Galectin 1', 'Glycoconjugates/metabolism', 'Hemagglutinins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/10 00:00,1998/02/10 00:01,['1998/02/10 00:00'],"['1998/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/glycob/7.8.1193 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycobiology. 1997 Dec;7(8):1193-9. doi: 10.1093/glycob/7.8.1193.,,,,,,,,,,

For instance, the human T-cell leukemia Jurkat is sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis and to activation-induced cell death (AICD), and the promonocytic leukemia U937 is sensitive to Fas- and TNF-induced apoptosis. In this work, we have analyzed the mechanisms of resistance to physiological or pharmacological apoptosis in human leukemia by generating highly proliferative (hp) sub-lines derived from Jurkat and U937 cells. These hp sub-lines were resistant to Fas- and TNF-induced apoptosis, as well as to AICD. This was due to the complete loss of Fas and TNFR surface expression and, in the case of Jurkat-derived sub-lines, also of CD3, CD2 and CD59 molecules. The sub-lines also completely lacked the expression of the apoptotic protease CPP32, present in parental cells. Moreover, these sub-lines were no longer sensitive to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, which was efficiently blocked by the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk in the parental cell lines.

In contrast, many of the translocations in B-cell tumors involve immunoglobulin gene (IG) loci, and coding regions of the oncogenes on partner chromosomes are not interrupted by the translocation. Therefore, targets for PCR amplification are single-copy oncogene/IG fusion sequences within the complex genomic DNA. We present here a novel strategy for detection of translocations in B-cell tumors on the basis of long-distance (LD-) PCR that is capable of amplifying up to 30 kb of DNA. LD-PCR is a general method using primer pairs designed for distinctive regions of IG and oncogenes involved in translocations, and amplifying long DNA fragments encompassing the oncogene/IG junction. LD-PCR is capable of detecting virtually all the important translocations in B-cell tumors, including t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(14;18)(q32;q21), t(3;14)(q27;q32) and its variants. We show here that LD-PCR can substitute for time-consuming Southern blot hybridization in the rapid detection of these translocations. Furthermore, as amplified fragments obtained by LD-PCR contained exons and flanking sequences of the oncogenes and IGs, restriction analysis and nucleotide sequencing of the products refined the characteristics of translocations.","['Akasaka, T', 'Akasaka, H', 'Ohno, H']","['Akasaka T', 'Akasaka H', 'Ohno H']","['First Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54-Shogoin-Kawaramachi, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-01, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Exons', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1998/02/10 00:00,2003/01/31 04:00,['1998/02/10 00:00'],"['1998/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [medline]', '1998/02/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.12.1.113 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1998 Jan;12(1):113-21. doi: 10.3892/ijo.12.1.113.,,,36,,,,,,,

We have reported that UTI inhibited TNF-induced urokinase (uPA) production via a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent mechanism. It is likely that UTI suppresses tumor cell invasion and metastasis by a mechanism, possibly by inhibiting uPA production. In the present study, we attempted to determine how UTI is associated with PKC, and how UTI is involved in uPA-dependent tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The increments of membrane-associated PKC activity by TNF were subsequently accompanied by a rapid loss of cytosol-associated PKC activity in U937 leukemia cells. Semi-quantitative immunoblotting of membrane and cytosol fractions showed that the translocation of PKC-alpha, -beta, and -epsilon were blocked by the addition of UTI in cells stimulated with TNF but not in cells stimulated with PMA, demonstrating that PKC itself is not sensitive to UTI. This effect was dependent on the carboxyl-terminus of UTI. In addition, UTI neither inhibited TNF binding to cellular receptors nor inactivate PKC and uPA activities directly. Taken together, the experiments suggest that the carboxyl-terminus of UTI may inhibit the PKC-signalling pathways upstream of diacylglycerol by a mechanism, possibly by interrupting the coupling of receptor and effector systems. UTI was shown to have an interesting new function besides being a protease inhibitor. This is the first report that UTI has a selective inhibition of TNF-activated PKC. We conclude that UTI suppresses tumor cell invasion and metastasis by a mechanism that UTI inhibits TNF-stimulated uPA production via a PKC-dependent mechanism.","['Kobayashi, H', 'Sugino, D', 'Terao, T']","['Kobayashi H', 'Sugino D', 'Terao T']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Handacho 3600, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, 431-31, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Trypsin Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.2.1.1 (alpha-Amylases)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'OR3S9IF86U (urinastatin)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Plant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', '*Protein Transport', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trypsin/metabolism', 'Trypsin Inhibitors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/enzymology', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/metabolism', 'alpha-Amylases/antagonists & inhibitors']",1998/02/10 00:00,2003/01/31 04:00,['1998/02/10 00:00'],"['1998/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [medline]', '1998/02/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1998 Jan;12(1):95-105.,,,,,,,,,,

Bleeding categorization was based on daily scores of intensity used by the blood transfusion service. Moderate and severe episodes were analyzed for bleeding sites. Analysis of the cause of death and the interval of the bleeding episode to outcome endpoints was recorded. Survival estimates were computed for 1,353 BMT patients. The overall incidence was 34%. Minor bleeding was seen in 10.6%, moderate bleeding was seen in 11.3%, and severe bleeding was seen in 12% of all patients. Fourteen percent of patients had moderate or severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage, 6.4% had moderate or severe hemorrhagic cystitis, 2.8% had pulmonary hemorrhage, and 2% had intracranial hemorrhage. Sixty-one percent had 1 bleeding site and 34.4% had more than 1 site. Moderate and severe bleeding was more prevalent in allogeneic (31%) and unrelated patients (62.5%) compared with autologous patients (18.5%). Significant distribution of incidence was found among the different diagnoses, but not by disease status in acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bleeding was associated with significantly reduced survival in allogeneic, autologous, and unrelated BMT and in each disease category except multiple myeloma. Survival was correlated with the bleeding intensity, bleeding site, and the number of sites. Although close temporal association was evident to mortality, bleeding was recorded as the cause of death in only the minority of cases compared with other toxicities after BMT (graft-versus-host disease, infections, and preparative regimen toxicity). Acute bleeding is a common complication after BMT that is profoundly associated with morbidity and mortality. Although bleeding was not a direct cause of death in the majority of cases, it has a potential prognostic implication as a predictor of poor outcome in clinical assessment of patients after BMT.","['Nevo, S', 'Swan, V', 'Enger, C', 'Wojno, K J', 'Bitton, R', 'Shabooti, M', 'Fuller, A K', 'Jones, R J', 'Braine, H G', 'Vogelsang, G B']","['Nevo S', 'Swan V', 'Enger C', 'Wojno KJ', 'Bitton R', 'Shabooti M', 'Fuller AK', 'Jones RJ', 'Braine HG', 'Vogelsang GB']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD 21287-8985, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hemorrhage/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/03/07 00:00,1998/03/07 00:01,['1998/03/07 00:00'],"['1998/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55539-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Feb 15;91(4):1469-77.,['CA15386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The contribution of ETV6 to leukemogenesis occurs through different mechanisms that involve either its helix-loop-helix dimerization domain or its E26 transformation-specific (ETS) DNA-binding domain. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization we characterized seven new ETV6 rearrangements in chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The proliferation of a human erythroleukemia cell line, HEL cells, which can differentiate into macrophage- and megakaryocyte-like cells, and erythroid precursors was dramatically induced on coculture with a hematopoietic-supportive stromal cell line, HESS-5 cells, which can support long-term hematopoiesis in vitro without fetal bovine serum. HEL cells proliferated when they were cocultured with but not without direct cell contact. Because the coculture supernatants with direct cell contact and cytokines such as interleukins and growth factors did not exhibit growth-stimulating activity toward HEL cells, it was suggested that some molecule that has growth-stimulating activity exists on the surface of the cells. Extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and collagen did not affect the proliferation of HEL cells. An anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the common beta chain of the beta2 integrin subfamily, induced dramatic proliferation of HEL cells. Moreover, the proliferation of HEL cells was inhibited by an antisense oligonucleotide of CD18 mRNA. As judged from these observations, the proliferation of HEL cells was mediated by CD18 molecules expressed on HEL cells. On the contrary, the common counter-receptor of the beta2 integrin subfamily, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, which is expressed on CHO-K1 cells, did not stimulate the growth of HEL cells. It is known that other counter molecules of the beta2 integrin subfamily, such as complement C3bi and fibrinogen, are not produced by stromal cells. These findings suggest that the proliferation of HEL cells may be induced through an interaction between a novel molecule of the beta2 integrin subfamily on HEL cells and the counter-receptor on HESS-5 cells. The beta2 integrin subfamily may regulate the growth of hematopoietic cells in hematopoiesis in vivo and/or cause the abnormal growth of leukemia cells.","['Tsuji, T', 'Waga, I', 'Tezuka, K', 'Kamada, M', 'Yatsunami, K', 'Kodama, H']","['Tsuji T', 'Waga I', 'Tezuka K', 'Kamada M', 'Yatsunami K', 'Kodama H']","['Division of Hematology, Pharmaceutical Frontier Research Laboratories Inc, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (CD18 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'CD18 Antigens/*physiology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/07 00:00,1998/03/07 00:01,['1998/03/07 00:00'],"['1998/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55515-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Feb 15;91(4):1263-71.,,,,,,,,,,

To understand its expression within the hematopoietic compartment, RNA extracted from bone marrow or peripheral blood from normal donors and patients with leukemia was reverse transcribed and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bomapin PCR products were readily detected in normal bone marrow, which was designated as a medium mRNA level. In peripheral blood, bomapin expression was low or undetectable in normal donors (n = 6) and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 6). Blood from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 6), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 6), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 5), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 5) exhibited low to medium levels of bomapin expression. Furthermore, a high level of bomapin expression was detected in one individual with acute monocytic leukemia. These data suggest that bomapin expression may be elevated in hematopoietic cells of monocytic lineage. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of bomapin within cell lines that exhibited characteristics of the monocytic lineage. Bomapin PCR products were detected in the monocytic THP-1 and AML-193 cell lines but not in CRL 7607, CRL 7541, KG-1, or K562 cells. Induction of bomapin transcripts was not detected in the latter series of cell lines following a 24-hour treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 10(-8) mol/L) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha, 30 U/mL), whereas treatment of THP-1 or AML-193 cells with these agents reduced the intensity of the bomapin PCR products. Northern blotting confirmed these results and showed that the expression of bomapin in THP-1 cells was downregulated over a 4-day period by PMA and, to a lesser extent, TNF-alpha. Immunoblotting was used to show the presence of a 40-kD protein in THP-1 cytosol preparations. Bomapin antigen levels were correspondingly reduced after treatment with PMA. Because PMA and TNF-alpha induce monocytic differentiation in THP-1 and AML-193 cells, these data increase the possibility that bomapin may play a role in the regulation of protease activities specifically in early stages of cellular differentiation.","['Riewald, M', 'Chuang, T', 'Neubauer, A', 'Riess, H', 'Schleef, R R']","['Riewald M', 'Chuang T', 'Neubauer A', 'Riess H', 'Schleef RR']","['Department of Vascular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (SERPINB10 protein, human)', '0 (Serpins)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Serpins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1998/03/07 00:00,1998/03/07 00:01,['1998/03/07 00:00'],"['1998/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55514-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Feb 15;91(4):1256-62.,['HL49563/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow involvement (P = .005), involvement of parenchymal organs (P = .03), and involvement of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle (P = .002) were also associated with an increased risk for CNS disease. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified only involvement of more than one extranodal site (P = .0005) and an increased LDH (P = .0008) as independent predictors of CNS recurrence.

Because the gp55 from the polycythemic strain (gp55-P), but not from the anemic strain (gp55-A), activates the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) for proliferation of hematopoietic cell lines, the mechanism by which gp55-A initiates erythroleukemia has remained a mystery. We show here that gp55-A activates the EpoR in fetal liver cells. In contrast to previous studies using bone marrow cells from phenylhydrazine-treated, anemic mice, we find that both gp55-A and gp55-P induce erythroid differentiation from colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) progenitors in fetal liver cells. The effects on CFU-Es of both gp55-A and -P are mediated by the EpoR, because no colonies are seen upon expression of either gp55 in EpoR-/- fetal liver cells.

All 4 cases examined had extensive somatic mutations in contrast with CLL or MCL. The VH gene sequences of de novo CD5+ DLBL displayed 86.9% to 95.2% homology with the corresponding germlines, whereas those of simultaneously analyzed CLL and MCL displayed 97.6% to 100% homology. The VH family used was VH3 in 1 case, VH4 in 2 cases, and VH5 in 1 case. In 2 of 4 examined cases, the distribution of replacement and silent mutations over the complementarity determining region and framework region in the VH genes was compatible with the pattern resulting from the antigen selection. Clinically, CD5+ DLBL frequently involved a variety of extranodal sites (12/13) and lymph node (11/13). Immunophenotypically, CD5+ DLBL scarcely expressed CD21 and CD23 (3/13 and 2/13, respectively).

Both the execution of the apoptotic process and the intracellular acidification were reduced by the addition of forskolin plus theophylline or other cAMP increasing agents. These agents also attenuated the induction of apoptosis by camptothecin, heat-shock, cadmium chloride and X-radiation. Although etoposide slightly increased the production of reactive oxygen intermediates, this increase was not prevented by forskolin plus theophylline, and the addition of antioxidant agents failed to inhibit apoptosis. Etoposide caused a great increase in NF-(kappa)B binding activity, which was not prevented by forskolin plus theophylline, while AP-1 binding was little affected by the topoisomerase inhibitor. The treatments did not significantly alter the levels of Bcl-2 and Bax. By contrast, the expression of c-myc, which was very high in untreated U-937 cells and only partially inhibited by etoposide, was rapidly and almost totally abolished by the cAMP increasing agents. Finally, it was observed that etoposide caused a transient dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb), which was associated with cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Both Rb dephosphorylation and PARP cleavage were inhibited by forskolin plus theophylline. The inhibition of Rb (type I) phosphatase and ICE/CED-3-like protease activities, and the abrogation of c-myc expression, are mechanisms which could explain the anti-apoptotic action of cAMP increasing agents in myeloid cells.","['Garcia-Bermejo, L', 'Perez, C', 'Vilaboa, N E', 'de Blas, E', 'Aller, P']","['Garcia-Bermejo L', 'Perez C', 'Vilaboa NE', 'de Blas E', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Bioogicas, CSIC, Velazquez 144, 28006-Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/*biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/05/30 00:00,1998/05/30 00:01,['1998/05/30 00:00'],"['1998/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1998 Mar;111 ( Pt 5):637-44.,,,,,,,,,,

The correct termination of retroviral transcripts at the 3' LTR R/U5 junction is primarily dependent on the canonical AAUAAA polyadenylation signal, so we have analyzed the effect of mutating the polyadenylation signal sequences on the properties of a selectable murine retroviral vector. Mutation of consensus polyadenylation signal sequences in the 5' and/or 3' proviral LTRs demonstrated that a UA to GG change generated larger sized virus-specific RNA, consistent with loss of normal polyadenylation. Cell clones infected with viruses generated by proviral constructs containing this mutation in the 5' LTR express either normal-length or elongated viral RNA. Fused transcripts contained the mutant polyadenylation signal, while sequence analysis was consistent with the hypothesis that premature 5' to 3' primer strand transfer was responsible for the high frequency (80%) of wild-type polyadenylation. Cells infected by viruses from constructs mutated in both 5' and 3' proviral LTRs expressed poly(A)+ viral RNA between 0.3 and 3 kb larger than normal virus in 100% of infected clones, and sequence analysis of clones derived from either infected rodent or human cells confirmed that these transcripts contained both viral and adjacent cellular sequences. While mutant virus exhibits no increased ability to alter cell phenotypes, the read-through transcripts contain both unique and repetitive cell-derived sequences and can easily be recovered using PCR techniques, suggesting that these viruses may serve as effective tools for rapidly cloning cellular sequences and generating random genomic markers for gene mapping.","['Zhang, Q Y', 'Clausen, P A', 'Yatsula, B A', 'Calothy, G', 'Blair, D G']","['Zhang QY', 'Clausen PA', 'Yatsula BA', 'Calothy G', 'Blair DG']","['Division of Basic Sciences, NCI-FCRDC, Frederick, Maryland, 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis', 'Poly A/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism', '*Virus Integration']",1998/02/28 00:00,1998/02/28 00:01,['1998/02/28 00:00'],"['1998/02/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(97)98947-9 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8947 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Feb 1;241(1):80-93. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8947.,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF014450', 'GENBANK/AF014451', 'GENBANK/AF014452', 'GENBANK/AF014453', 'GENBANK/AF014454', 'GENBANK/AF014455', 'GENBANK/AF014456', 'GENBANK/AF014457']",,

Limitations of the short-chain fatty acids as therapeutics include their rapid metabolism and a tendency to induce cell growth arrest if administered for prolonged periods. In studies described here, the cellular effects of other inducers of fetal globin, phenoxyacetic acid and derivatives of short-chain fatty acids and cinnamic acids, were investigated in the human erythroid cell line K562, the IL-3 dependent multi-lineage cell line (32D), and in mice and primates. Several test compounds supported 32D cell proliferation despite a 50-fold depletion of IL-3, which resulted in growth arrest and apoptotic death in control cells. The degree of proliferation induced by certain test compounds was similar to the degree of proliferation induced by Erythropoietin and G-CSF in the cells. Eight of ten compounds induced gamma globin mRNA in K562 cells. A 2.5 to 6-fold increase in reticulocytosis was observed in vivo in mice treated with two prototype compounds. Pharmacokinetic studies of three prototype compounds demonstrated millimolar plasma concentrations after single oral doses for many hours in primates. These findings identify orally bioavailable compounds which induce gamma globin gene expression and hematopoietic cell proliferation through an activity which partially abrogates requirements for IL-3. Such compounds provide potential for oral therapeutics which stimulate proliferation of hematopoietic cells of multiple lineages, as well as inducing fetal globin.","['Boosalis, M S', 'Ikuta, T', 'Pace, B S', 'da Fonseca, S', 'White, G L', 'Faller, D V', 'Perrine, S P']","['Boosalis MS', 'Ikuta T', 'Pace BS', 'da Fonseca S', 'White GL', 'Faller DV', 'Perrine SP']","['Cancer Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carboxylic Acids/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Globins/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Interleukin-3/administration & dosage/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Papio', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/10 00:00,1998/02/10 00:01,['1998/02/10 00:00'],"['1998/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079979697901625 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1997.0162 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1997 Dec;23(3):434-42. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1997.0162.,"['HL-15157/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-37118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that mouse and human HSC have low levels of the mRNA encoding PiT-2, the amphotropic retrovirus receptor. We hypothesized that the low level of PiT-2 mRNA was responsible for the low frequency of transduction of HSC by amphotropic retroviral vectors (2). In this study we compared the level of PiT-2 and PiT-1, the Gibbon Ape Leukemia Virus receptor (GaLV), in 5 human tissue culture cell lines. PiT-2 and PiT-1 mRNA levels were highest in K562 cells and lowest in HL60 cells. In hematopoietic cell lines, the level of PiT-2 or PiT-1 mRNA correlated directly with retrovirus binding and transduction with the appropriate (amphotropic or GaLV) retrovirus vector. The level of expression of PiT-2 and PiT-1 mRNA could be increased by treatment of HL60 cells with either PMA or Interleukin-1alpha. The increase in the level of PiT-2 and PiT-1 mRNA correlated with increased transduction with both amphotropic and GaLV retroviral vectors.

Intracerebral grafts survived in 61% of cyclosporine immunosuppressed rats and 100% of mouse hosts, exhibited variable size and morphology, and both intracerebral and kidney capsule grafts developed large numbers of cells exhibiting neuronal morphology and immunoreactivity for neurofilament, neuron-specific enolase, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and cells immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Though graft size and histology were variable, typical grafts of 5-10 mm3 contained 10-20,000 TH+ neurons, whereas dopamine-beta-hydroxylase+ cells were rare. Most grafts also included nonneuronal regions. In intracerebral grafts, large numbers of astrocytes immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein were present. Both TH+ and 5-HT+ axons from intracerebral grafts grew into regions of the dopamine-lesioned host striatum. TH+ axons grew preferentially into striatal gray matter, while 5-HT+ axons showed no white/gray matter preference.

Stress echocardiography (SEC) has proved of value in determining left ventricular function at rest and under stress in patients with heart disease. The study was undertaken to assess the value of SEC in comparison with radionuclide ventriculography (RNV). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 63 unselected patients with malignant tumour (20 women, 43 men; mean age 49 +/- 15 years) underwent SEC and RNV. No chemotherapy had yet been started in 17 of them, 43 had received anthracyclines as main component of the chemotherapy (mean anthracycline dose 339 +/- 251 mg/m2). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured by both SEC and RNV at rest and during standardized stress (recumbent ergometry). Both methods were applied and results measured independently by two examiners. RESULTS: The time interval between the two tests averaged 1 = 2 days. EC could be performed at rest in 62 of 63 and under stress in 59 of 63 patients (RNV: 63 of 63 and 54 of 63, respectively). Resting LVEF was 61 +/- 8% by SEC and 64 +/- 9% by RNV (P < 0.05). LVEF during stress, measured by SEC, was 71 +/- 11% and 73 +/- 10% by RNV (not significant). Mean LVEF increase between rest and stress was 9 +/- 10% by SEC and 9 +/- 8% by RNV (not significant). CONCLUSION: SEC is a satisfactory alternative to RNV in the assessment of ventricular function in patients receiving chemotherapy. It is less involved and more cost-effective than RNV, avoids radiation exposure and provides additional information on heart size and segmental contraction abnormalities.","['Leischik, R', 'Eising, E G', 'Katz, M', 'Glattki, G', 'Bruch, C', 'Seeber, S', 'Bockisch, A', 'Erbel, R']","['Leischik R', 'Eising EG', 'Katz M', 'Glattki G', 'Bruch C', 'Seeber S', 'Bockisch A', 'Erbel R']","['Medizinische Klinik Abteilung fur Kardiologie, Universitats-Gesamthochschule Essen.']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cardiomyopathies/*chemically induced/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging', '*Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasmacytoma/drug therapy', '*Radionuclide Ventriculography', 'Rest', 'Seminoma/drug therapy', 'Software', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Stroke Volume', 'Testicular Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Ventricular Function, Left']",1998/02/07 00:00,1998/02/07 00:01,['1998/02/07 00:00'],"['1998/02/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1047793 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 1997 Dec 5;122(49):1509-15. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1047793.,,,,Vergleich von Belastungsechokardiographie und Radionuklidventrikulographie in der Diagnostik der Kardiomyopathie bei Patienten mit malignen Erkrankungen unter Chemotherapie.,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to expose technical details in order to perform a simple articulated cement spacer which could be implanted during this period to improve hip function, to authorize partial weight bearing and to avoid leg length discrepancy. MATERIAL: This method was applied in three two-stage procedures justified because of particular immunodeficiency conditions: a 43 years old man who had bone marrow allograft and immunosuppressive therapy because of leukemia suffering of subacute septic hip arthritis; a 58 years old man suffering of diabetes and active C-hepatitis who had a septic loosening of a total hip arthroplasty (THA); a 76 years old woman suffering of diabetes who had a third septic loosening of THA. METHOD: The prosthesis was made of antibiotic-impregnated cement according to organisms antibiotic resistance. The prosthetic junction between head and diaphysis was reinforced with a tibial plate. Prosthetic shape was identical to the one of femoral broaches inserted in the femur after prosthetic and cement removal. The broach size was chosen when mechanical stability in the femur was obtained, and avoided leg length discrepancy after trials with cups. The tibial plate was bent in order to reinforce the junction with regard to the shape of the determined broach. Two doses of antibiotic-impregnated cement were mixed and molded with hands, then the plate was incorporated at the appropriate location, finally the broach was applied on this composite and cement in excess was removed before polymerisation. For prosthetic head, two options were available: to mold the cephalic zone of the cement at the patient acetabulum diameter with a soft aluminium cup previously molded in the acetabulum; to mold the cement cephalic zone with a trial cup in order to obtain a 22 or 28 ball. For this last option, a third dose of antibiotic-impregnated cement was prepared and placed in the acetabulum, a trial femoral head was applied in it to mold the location for the 22 or 28 prosthetic head. Before insertion, a collar was applied on the stem to prevent migration. Active mobilization was encouraged, and partial weight-bearing authorized. RESULTS: The mean range of hip flexion during period was 60 degrees. The patients were discharged approximatively 12 days after the first stage. Two patients had effective painless partial weight-bearing. The second stage was performed six weeks later on the average. The second procedure was easier than the second stage of a conventional two-stage procedure because of: easy and low hemorrhagic dissection authorized by the prosthesis; low difficulties with soft tissue tension as the prosthesis prevents leg length discrepancy; preservation of the articular space which prevents soft tissue sacrifice during the second stage. CONCLUSION: This simple technique is effective to prevent complications related to the excision period of a two-stage hip revision arthroplasty. Likewise, the economical aspect (short delay of hospitalisation, quick functional recovery) should be considered when compared with the excision period of a conventional two-stage procedure.","['Migaud, H', 'Chantelot, C', 'Besson, A', 'Gougeon, F', 'Dubois, H H', 'Duquennoy, A']","['Migaud H', 'Chantelot C', 'Besson A', 'Gougeon F', 'Dubois HH', 'Duquennoy A']","[""Service d'Orthopedie-Traumatologie B, Hopital B, C.H.R.U. de Lille.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Chir Orthop Reparatrice Appar Mot,Revue de chirurgie orthopedique et reparatrice de l'appareil moteur,1272427,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents, Local)', '0 (Bone Cements)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Infective Agents, Local/*administration & dosage', '*Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip/adverse effects/methods', 'Bone Cements/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prosthesis Failure', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/*therapy', 'Reoperation']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/02/07 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/07 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['77678 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Chir Orthop Reparatrice Appar Mot. 1997;83(5):466-8.,,,,Prothese temporaire en ciment impregne d'antibiotiques au cours des arthroplasties en deux temps sur hanche infectee.,,,,,,

Immunocytochemical analysis has demonstrated that PML is co-localized with a novel ubiquitin-like protein in the nuclear bodies, which could be disrupted by the PML-RARalpha fusion protein. The physical nature of this co-localization is unknown. Using a COS cell expression system, we show that PML is covalently modified by all three members of the sentrin family of ubiquitin-like proteins. Covalent modification of PML requires the conserved Gly residue near the C termini of sentrin proteins. Sentrinization of PML is highly specific because neither NEDD8 nor ubiquitin could modify PML. Similar specificity is also observed for the covalent modification of RanGAP1 by the sentrin member of ubiquitin-like proteins. These observations highlight the fine substrate specificity of the sentrinization pathway. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, two forms of PML-RARalpha fusion proteins have been reported. Remarkably, both forms of PML-RARalpha fusion proteins could not be sentrinized. Thus differential sentrinization of PML and PML-RARalpha could play an important role in regulating the biological function of PML and in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Kamitani, T', 'Nguyen, H P', 'Kito, K', 'Fukuda-Kamitani, T', 'Yeh, E T']","['Kamitani T', 'Nguyen HP', 'Kito K', 'Fukuda-Kamitani T', 'Yeh ET']","['Department of Internal Medicine, and Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Diseases, The University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism']",1998/03/07 03:07,2000/05/20 09:00,['1998/03/07 03:07'],"['1998/03/07 03:07 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/03/07 03:07 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.6.3117 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)93698-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Feb 6;273(6):3117-20. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.6.3117.,['HL-45851/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Six hundred and ninety-four eligible patients ranging in age from 1-20 years were entered on the study. Sixty-five percent of the patients had T-cell immunophenotype. Of these, 678 were randomized to one of four regimens: Regimen A: Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 76/79; Regimen B: LSA2-L2 with cranial irradiation; Regimen C: LSA2-L2 without cranial irradiation; and Regimen D: the New York (NY) regimen. RESULTS: Complete remission was induced in 97% of patients. The overall event free survival (EFS) +/- the standard deviation was 60 +/- 4% 6 years after diagnosis, in contrast to 36 +/- 6% in a comparable historic group. The EFS of the 371 T-cell patients was 62 +/- 7%. EFS was best on the NY (67 +/- 7%) and the BFM (67 +/- 6%) arms. These were significantly better than the EFS on the 2 LSA-L2 regimens, with an EFS of 53 +/- 8% (Regimen B) and 42 +/- 11% (Regimen C) (P = 0.03 and 0.0003 for NY vs. Regimen B and NY vs. Regimen C; P = 0.01 and 0.0001 for BFM vs. Regimen B and BFM vs. Regimen C). Regimen C had a 3-fold greater central nervous system (CNS) recurrence rate than the identical chemotherapy Regimen B (16 +/- 5% vs. 6 +/- 4%; P = 0.02), although the difference in overall EFS did not reach the required level for significance. Testicular recurrence varied from 2-8% in comparison with 20% in the historic group. EFS was not influenced by age, gender, CNS disease at diagnosis, morphology, or immunophenotype. In addition to treatment regimen and early response rate, initial leukocyte count, hemoglobin level, liver, spleen, and lymph node enlargement, and the presence of a mediastinal mass had univariate prognostic influence on EFS. In multivariate analysis, only the kinetics of response, leukocyte count (unfavorably, P < 0.0001), and mediastinal mass status (favorably, P = 0.01) were prognostic. CONCLUSIONS: The adverse prognostic implications of lymphomatous ALL can be minimized by the NY and BFM regimens. Cranial irradiation resulted in better CNS disease control when added to the LSA2-L2 regimen, but did not improve the overall disease free survival. With improved systemic chemotherapy, there was no excess of lymph node, testicular, or other local recurrence without prophylactic irradiation to sites of initial bulk disease or to the testes.","['Steinherz, P G', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Breneman, J C', 'Cherlow, J M', 'Grossman, N J', 'Kersey, J H', 'Johnstone, H S', 'Sather, H N', 'Trigg, M E', 'Uckun, F M', 'Bleyer, W A']","['Steinherz PG', 'Gaynon PS', 'Breneman JC', 'Cherlow JM', 'Grossman NJ', 'Kersey JH', 'Johnstone HS', 'Sather HN', 'Trigg ME', 'Uckun FM', 'Bleyer WA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'LSA2-L2 protocol', 'New York protocol', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1998/02/06 05:53,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/02/06 05:53'],"['1998/02/06 05:53 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/02/06 05:53 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980201)82:3<600::AID-CNCR24>3.0.CO;2-4 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19980201)82:3<600::aid-cncr24>3.0.co;2-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Feb 1;82(3):600-12. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19980201)82:3<600::aid-cncr24>3.0.co;2-4.,,,,,,,,,,

The authors identified five additional patients with both neoplasms. METHODS: A review of the clinical records of patients with AML, ATL, or lymphoid neoplasms other than ATL diagnosed between 1986 and 1995 was performed. Cytokine levels were assayed in selected patients. The authors searched for reports from other institutions using MEDLINE and the proceedings of two Japanese hematology societies. RESULTS: ATL was diagnosed in 134 patients, whereas 180 had AML. Five patients with both neoplasms were identified (3.7% of ATL patients and 2.8% of AML patients). In seven of the nine patients (including four patients in the literature) with ATL and AML, the ATL was diagnosed prior to the AML, whereas in the remaining two patients both neoplasms were diagnosed simultaneously. Six of the nine cases were therapy-related (t)-AML, which developed after chemotherapy for ATL. Monoclonal integration of proviral human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 was detected in ATL cells but not in AML cells in the six patients examined. The plasma levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were elevated in 3, 1, and 1, respectively, of the 4 patients examined at AML onset who had active ATL. In one case, the levels of several cytokines, including GM-CSF and M-CSF, in the supernatant fluid of short term cultured ATL cells were elevated. Three patients with de novo ATL and AML received remission induction therapy, and two achieved a complete remission (CR) of both diseases. Among the four patients who received chemotherapy for t-AML, two achieved CR. CONCLUSIONS: ATL patients also can develop AML, irrespective of treatment with chemotherapy for ATL. This association does not indicate exclusive chemoresistance of both neoplasms. Cytokines produced by ATL cells may support the growth of AML cells.","['Tsukasaki, K', 'Koba, T', 'Iwanaga, M', 'Murata, K', 'Maeda, T', 'Atogami, S', 'Nakamura, H', 'Yamada, Y', 'Kamihira, S', 'Tomonaga, M']","['Tsukasaki K', 'Koba T', 'Iwanaga M', 'Murata K', 'Maeda T', 'Atogami S', 'Nakamura H', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S', 'Tomonaga M']","['Department of Hematology, Atomic Disease Institute, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Remission Induction']",1998/02/06 05:53,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/02/06 05:53'],"['1998/02/06 05:53 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/02/06 05:53 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980201)82:3<488::AID-CNCR10>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19980201)82:3<488::aid-cncr10>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Feb 1;82(3):488-94. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19980201)82:3<488::aid-cncr10>3.0.co;2-y.,,,34,,,,,,,

All 8 patients with positive blood cultures were neutropenic, and the average duration of neutropenia before the positive blood cultures were obtained was 43 (range, 0-101) days. For prophylaxis of fungal infection, eight patients were kept in a laminar air flow room and also received nebulization with amphotericin B. Five patients received oral amphotericin B. All 9 patients died of the infection an average of 9 days after their blood cultures turned positive. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were evaluated in six available strains obtained from the patients. They were all resistant to amphotericin B and azoles. CONCLUSIONS: More effective antifungal agents are required for the treatment of infections with this organism.","['Kataoka-Nishimura, S', 'Akiyama, H', 'Saku, K', 'Kashiwa, M', 'Mori, S', 'Tanikawa, S', 'Sakamaki, H', 'Onozawa, Y']","['Kataoka-Nishimura S', 'Akiyama H', 'Saku K', 'Kashiwa M', 'Mori S', 'Tanikawa S', 'Sakamaki H', 'Onozawa Y']","['Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Opportunistic Infections/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', '*Trichosporon']",1998/02/06 05:53,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/02/06 05:53'],"['1998/02/06 05:53 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/02/06 05:53 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980201)82:3<484::AID-CNCR9>3.0.CO;2-P [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Feb 1;82(3):484-7.,,,,,,,,,,

Although changes of CD20 antigen density did not correlate with clinical parameters representative of either tumor mass (i.e. clinical stage, histological pattern of bone marrow involvement, absolute peripheral blood lymphocytosis) or disease progression (i.e. lymphocyte doubling time), a trend toward a better life-expectancy was observed in the low CD20 expression group compared with the high CD20 expression group (p = 0.05; relative risk of death, 0.51, 95% confidence interval, 0.24-1.04). Given the correlation between CD20 ABC and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of light chain (LC) surface immunoglobulins (Sm Ig) (r = 0.481, p < 0.0001), as well as the impact of MFI of Sm Ig LC on overall survival (p = 0.01; relative risk of death 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.76), we tried to verify whether a combination of B-cell markers, evaluated in a quantitative manner, could have additive prognostic properties. To this purpose we gave a value of 1 or 0 to each B-cell marker according to whether it was expressed at a low (i.e. CD20 ABC < 17.9 x 10(3) molecules/cell, MFI of LC Sm Ig < 100) or high (i.e. CD20 ABC > or = 17.9 x 10(3) molecules/cell, MFI of LC Sm Ig > or = 100) level thus allowing patient stratification into two groups with scores of 2 and 0-1, respectively. Survival of patients who scored 2 was significantly longer respectively. Survival of patients who scored 2 was significantly longer than that of patients who scored 0-1 (p = 0.02; relative risk of death, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.72). However, when quantitative changes of CD20 antigen and LC Sm Ig expression, either alone or in combination, were simultaneously analyzed in a Cox model which included usual clinico-hematological features, only absolute peripheral blood lymphocytosis (p = 0.0001) and Binet clinical stages (p = 0.0001) maintained their prognostic power unmodified. Although variability of CD20 and Sm Ig expression make it possible to appreciate biological heterogeneity of B-cell CLL better, however, they cannot substitute well-established clinico-hematological features in the prognostic assessment of B-CLL patients.","['Molica, S', 'Levato, D', 'Dattilo, A', 'Mannella, A']","['Molica S', 'Levato D', 'Dattilo A', 'Mannella A']","['Divisione Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD20/*analysis', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis', 'Receptors, IgE/analysis']",1998/02/06 00:00,1998/02/06 00:01,['1998/02/06 00:00'],"['1998/02/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb00995.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1998 Jan;60(1):47-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb00995.x.,,,,,,,,,,

The ratio between the proliferative and apoptotic cell fraction was coined leukaemia turnover index (LTI). In order to estimate the impact of clinical and various morphological as well as dynamic features of prognostic significance, a multivariate analysis was carried out using the classification and regression tree approach (CART). Discrimination of single disease parameters revealed that fibrosis remained the most significant variable for survival in both therapeutic groups. Indicators of myeloid metaplasia such as occurrence of erythro-normoblasts and/or splenomegaly were important clinical parameters for prognosis.

METHODS: From 1988 to 1996, 18 patients with hematologic diseases were referred with the diagnosis of localized invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The diagnosis was based on clinical features, failure to respond to antibiotic therapy, an air crescent sign suggestive of aspergillosis on the computed tomographic scan (39%), and retrieval of fungi by bronchoalveolar lavage (44%). RESULTS: The following procedures were done: one pneumonectomy, four bilobectomies, seven lobectomies, six wedge resections, and one lobectomy with wedge resection (one patient had two procedures). No perioperative deaths or complications occurred. The histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in 12 patients. The six other diagnoses were as follows: one case of classic aspergilloma, one case of pneumonia, and four cases of pulmonary abscess. According to univariate analysis, thoracic pain was less common in the group with noninvasive pulmonary aspergillosis (1/6) than in the group with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (8/12) (p < 0.05). Sixteen patients required subsequent hematologic treatments. Sixty-six percent of the patients are alive with a mean follow-up of 29.1 +/- 27.8 months (range 2 to 103 months), with no statistically significant difference between the invasive and the noninvasive pulmonary aspergillosis groups. Five patients died of a recurrence of their malignant disease at a mean of 17.2 +/- 12.5 months (range 2 to 30 months), and one had a cerebral recurrence of Aspergillus infection during a bone marrow transplantation 3 months later. CONCLUSION: Aggressive surgical management radically improves the prognosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, even if the surgical indications include some nonmycotic infections because of the difficulty in establishing the clinical diagnosis.","['Baron, O', 'Guillaume, B', 'Moreau, P', 'Germaud, P', 'Despins, P', 'De Lajartre, A Y', 'Michaud, J L']","['Baron O', 'Guillaume B', 'Moreau P', 'Germaud P', 'Despins P', 'De Lajartre AY', 'Michaud JL']","['Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Nantes University Center Hospital, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/complications/pathology/*surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lung Abscess/complications/pathology/*surgery', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications/pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Prognosis']",1998/02/06 00:00,1998/02/06 00:01,['1998/02/06 00:00'],"['1998/02/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-5223(98)70443-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-5223(98)70443-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1998 Jan;115(1):63-8; discussion 68-9. doi: 10.1016/s0022-5223(98)70443-x.,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the use of a new retrovirally based gene transfer system for this purpose. METHODS: MFGnlslacZ retroviral vector, packaged in high-titer, split-genome packaging cell line (FLYA4) was used to transduce the skeletal myoblast cell line L6. L6 cells, cultured in 10% fetal calf serum, were transduced with the MFGnlslacZ vector by means of filtered supernatant from FLYA4 cells. Transduced L6 cells were divided into four groups. Group I cells were fixed as myoblasts 3 days after transduction. Group II cells were allowed to differentiate into myotubes. Group III cells were split every 3 days for 4 months. Group IV cells were split as in group III but then allowed to differentiate into myotubes. All samples were fixed and stained for beta-galactosidase activity. The effects on gene transfer of transforming growth factor-beta, insulin-like growth factor-I, and platelet-derived growth factor were determined by spectrophotometric assay of beta-galactosidase activity in cells transduced in the presence or absence of serum with 0 to 200 ng/ml of each growth factor. RESULTS: Morphometric analysis showed that 66.3% +/- 3% to 69.6% +/- 6% of cells in group I to IV expressed the lacZ reporter gene. In the presence of serum, transforming growth factor-beta significantly inhibited gene transfer, whereas insulin-like growth factor-I and platelet-derived growth factor significantly enhanced gene transfer. In absence of serum, however, only platelet-derived growth factor enhanced retrovirally mediated gene transfer into skeletal myoblasts. CONCLUSION: MFG retroviral vectors packaged in FLYA4 cells are efficient in gene transfer into skeletal myoblasts and result in transgenic expression that is maintained after repeated cell division, differentiation, or both. Platelet-derived growth factor enhances retrovirally mediated gene transfer into skeletal myoblasts.","['el Oakley, R M', 'Brand, N J', 'Burton, P B', 'McMullen, M C', 'Adams, G B', 'Poznansky, M C', 'Barton, P J', 'Yacoub, M H']","['el Oakley RM', 'Brand NJ', 'Burton PB', 'McMullen MC', 'Adams GB', 'Poznansky MC', 'Barton PJ', 'Yacoub MH']","['Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Imperial College School of Medicine, National Heart and Lung Institute, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Lac Operon', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*cytology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",1998/02/06 00:00,1998/02/06 00:01,['1998/02/06 00:00'],"['1998/02/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/06 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022522398000099 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-5223(98)70436-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1998 Jan;115(1):1-8. doi: 10.1016/s0022-5223(98)70436-2.,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we show that preincubation of nonaggregating rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells with purified LexGSLs resulted in incorporation of the GSLs into plasma membrane, as determined by immunostaining, and formation of aggregates in the presence of Ca2+; no aggregates were formed after preincubation of the cells with globoside or sphingomyelin. Lex-mediated aggregation was inhibited by removal of Ca2+or by addition of lactofucopentaose III but not by lactose or lacto-N-fucopentaose II. In a mixture of Lex-positive and Lex-negative RBL cells most of the aggregates were composed exclusively of Lex-positive cells. The combined data suggest that interactions between LexGSL on opposite cell surfaces are strong enough to allow formation of stable cell-cell contacts.","['Boubelik, M', 'Floryk, D', 'Bohata, J', 'Draberova, L', 'Macak, J', 'Smid, F', 'Draber, P']","['Boubelik M', 'Floryk D', 'Bohata J', 'Draberova L', 'Macak J', 'Smid F', 'Draber P']","['Department of Mammalian Gene Expression, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Lewis Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Sialyl Lewis X Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Aggregation/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Glycosphingolipids/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Lewis Blood Group Antigens/*physiology', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Oligosaccharides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Sialyl Lewis X Antigen', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/14 00:00,1998/03/14 00:01,['1998/03/14 00:00'],"['1998/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['cwb015 [pii]', '10.1093/glycob/8.2.139 [doi]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 1998 Feb;8(2):139-46. doi: 10.1093/glycob/8.2.139.,,,,,,,,,,

Using immune complex phospholipase assays, we show that FcepsilonRI cross-linking activates both PLCgamma1 and PLCgamma2. Activation is accompanied by the increased phosphorylation of both PLCgamma isoforms on serine and tyrosine in antigen-treated cells. We also show that the two PLCgamma isoforms have distinct subcellular localizations. PLCgamma1 is primarily cytosolic in resting RBL-2H3 cells, with low levels of plasma membrane association. After antigen stimulation, PLCgamma1 translocates to the plasma membrane where it associates preferentially with membrane ruffles. In contrast, PLCgamma2 is concentrated in a perinuclear region near the Golgi and adjacent to the plasma membrane in resting cells and does not redistribute appreciably after FcepsilonRI cross-linking. The activation of PLCgamma1, but not of PLCgamma2, is blocked by wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor previously shown to block antigen-stimulated ruffling and to inhibit Ins(1,4,5)P3 synthesis. In addition, wortmannin strongly inhibits the antigen-stimulated phosphorylation of both serine and tyrosine residues on PLCgamma1 with little inhibition of PLCgamma2 phosphorylation. Wortmannin also blocks the antigen-stimulated translocation of PLCgamma1 to the plasma membrane. Our results implicate PI 3-kinase in the phosphorylation, translocation, and activation of PLCgamma1. Although less abundant than PLCgamma2, activated PLCgamma1 may be responsible for the bulk of antigen-stimulated Ins(1,4,5)P3 production in RBL-2H3 cells.","['Barker, S A', 'Caldwell, K K', 'Pfeiffer, J R', 'Wilson, B S']","['Barker SA', 'Caldwell KK', 'Pfeiffer JR', 'Wilson BS']","['Department of Pathology and Cancer Research and Treatment Center, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigens/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Golgi Apparatus/enzymology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Isoenzymes/analysis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*enzymology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphoserine/analysis', 'Phosphotyrosine/analysis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/analysis/*metabolism', 'Wortmannin']",1998/04/04 00:00,1998/04/04 00:01,['1998/04/04 00:00'],"['1998/04/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/04/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/04/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.9.2.483 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1998 Feb;9(2):483-96. doi: 10.1091/mbc.9.2.483.,"['GM-49814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-50562/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC25278,,,

Normal bone marrow mononuclear (BMNC) cells expressed low telomerase activity. Higher telomerase activity was detected in 10 myeloid leukaemic cell lines compared to normal BMNC cells. Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, and vitamin D3 analogues, EB1089 and KH1060, reduced telomerase activity in vitamin D3-sensitive HL-60 cells, whereas vitamin D3 insensitive K562 cells did not change its activity. This down-regulation of telomerase activity by EB1089 was associated with induction of p21 protein. The rank order of telomerase activity was leukaemic CD34- cells > leukaemic CD34+ cells > normal CD34- cells > normal CD34+ cells. Telomerase activity was positive in all of the AML patients tested; however, heterogeneity of telomerase activity was found amongst this group. Therefore we compared telomerase activity with clinical response. Unexpectedly, we found that a higher rate of complete remission was noted in AML patients with higher telomerase activity.

The mechanisms that enable CLL cells to live longer and to resist apoptosis remain unclear. Because the malignant CLL cells express CD40 and Fas receptors, which can transduce cell-survival and cell-death signals, we examined the role of CD40 in the growth regulation of CLL cells and its interaction with Fas-mediated and fludarabine-induced apoptosis in vitro. Primary CLL cells underwent spontaneous apoptosis in culture, which was enhanced by exogenous human Fas ligand (FasL) or fludarabine. Exogenous CD40L rescued CLL cells from spontaneous apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, and caused CLL cells to resist apoptosis induced by FasL or fludarabine. Patients' autologous plasma rescued CLL cells from spontaneous apoptosis, an effect that could be reversed with anti-CD40 ligand (CD40L) antibodies. The levels of soluble CD40 ligand in the sera of 51 CLL patients and 55 healthy donors were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mean soluble CD40L level in normal donors was 0.29 ng/ml compared to a mean value of 0.80 ng/ml in CLL patients (P < 0.001).

In an attempt to identify some structural determinants for activity and develop a molecular structure/cytotoxicity correlation, four new structural analogs of the antitumor NBQ-2 were prepared and their cytotoxic activity and DNA binding properties were investigated. The cytotoxic activity was evaluated against six different human tumor cell lines: U937, K-562, HL-60, HT-29, HeLa, and A431. The results showed that these new drugs elicit pronounced cytotoxic effects against U937, K-562, HL-60 and A431 while HeLa and HT-29 were less sensitive to the new drugs. This apparent selectivity was different to that of m-AMSA, a drug currently used for cancer treatment. Since the interaction of NBQ-2 to DNA by intercalation has been proposed as the initial step leading to its antineoplastic activity, DNA binding and changes in DNA contour length induced by the new NBQ-2 structural analogs were also investigated using calf thymus and human DNA. The drug, 7-(1-propenyl)-3-nitrobenzimidazolo[3,2-alpha]quinolinium chloride (NBQ-59) was the most cytotoxic agent of the analog series (IC50 = 16 microM for HL-60 cells), however, it demonstrated the weakest binding to DNA (Kint = 0.9 x 10[5] M-1 for calf thymus DNA). NBQ-59 was also found to be a poor intercalator into the DNA double helix. Therefore, our results suggest that DNA binding is not the primary mechanism of drug action for this family of compounds. In addition structural determinants important for cytotoxicity of the benzazolo quinolinium chlorides were suggested by our results. In particular, the nitro group in the 3 position does not seem to be necessary for bioactivity, while substitutions in the benzazolo moiety have striking effects on the biological activity of the drugs.","['Vivas-Mejia, P E', 'Rodriguez-Caban, J L', 'Diaz-Velazquez, M', 'Hernandez-Perez, M G', 'Cox, O', 'Gonzalez, F A']","['Vivas-Mejia PE', 'Rodriguez-Caban JL', 'Diaz-Velazquez M', 'Hernandez-Perez MG', 'Cox O', 'Gonzalez FA']","['Department of Chemistry, Biotesting Center, University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus, San Juan 00931-3346, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Quinolinium Compounds)', '82773-09-9 (3-nitrobenzothiazolo(3,2-a)quinolinium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'DNA/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Quinolinium Compounds/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viscosity']",1998/02/05 00:00,1998/02/05 00:01,['1998/02/05 00:00'],"['1998/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1006857118469 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1997 Dec;177(1-2):69-77. doi: 10.1023/a:1006857118469.,"['5G12RR03641/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'S06GM08102/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

These structures are prepared from isolated nuclei by a series of extraction steps involving the use of ionic detergents or high salt, and restriction enzymes or non-specific nucleases to remove chromatin and other loosely bound components. Since these treatments are harsh and unphysiological, the question remains open as to whether or not these structures, isolated in vitro, correspond to a nucleoskeleton existing in vivo. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the majority of nuclear matrix proteins are involved in RNA metabolism. In this study we have employed a morphological approach involving the use of confocal laser scanning microscopy and indirect immunofluorescence techniques to analyze whether two widely employed methods to prepare the nuclear scaffold or matrix can maintain the spatial distribution of two polypeptides involved in RNA metabolism, i.e., a 105-kDa component of spliceosomes and a ribonucleoprotein antigen. We demonstrate that the localization of these polypeptides changes, in some cases dramatically, in the final nucleoskeletal structures when compared with intact cells. Only when isolated nuclei were stabilized in vitro with the cross-linking agent sodium tetrathionate (NaTT) prior to extraction with 2 M NaCl and DNase I digestion, were the immunofluorescent patterns displayed by the nuclear matrix indistinguishable from those detected in intact cells. These results emphasize the usefulness of NaTT in studying putative nucleoskeletal structures, but also show that the methods currently employed to prepare the nuclear scaffold or matrix may create in vitro artifacts.","['Neri, L M', 'Zweyer, M', 'Falcieri, E', 'Bortul, R', 'Martelli, A M']","['Neri LM', 'Zweyer M', 'Falcieri E', 'Bortul R', 'Martelli AM']","['Istituto di Anatomia Umana Normale, Universita di Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Histochem Cell Biol,Histochemistry and cell biology,9506663,"['0 (Buffers)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Buffers', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Magnesium', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nuclear Matrix/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'RNA Splicing', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Spliceosomes/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/05 00:00,1998/02/05 00:01,['1998/02/05 00:00'],"['1998/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004180050193 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochem Cell Biol. 1997 Dec;108(6):525-36. doi: 10.1007/s004180050193.,,,,,,,,,,

However, APL cells develop resistance to retinoic acid treatment. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) can induce clinical remission in patients with APL, including those who have relapsed after retinoic acid treatment, by inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the leukemia cells. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which As2O3 induces apoptosis in retinoic acid-sensitive NB4 APL cells, in retinoic acid-resistant derivatives of these cells, and in fresh leukemia cells from patients. METHODS: Apoptosis was assessed by means of DNA fragmentation analyses, TUNEL assays (i.e., deoxyuridine triphosphate labeling of DNA nicks with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase), and flow cytometry. Expression of the PML/RAR alpha fusion protein in leukemia cells was assessed by means of western blotting, ligand binding, and immunohistochemistry. Northern blotting and ribonuclease protection assays were used to evaluate changes in gene expression in response to retinoic acid and As2O3 treatment. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: As2O3 induces apoptosis without differentiation in retinoic acid-sensitive and retinoic acid-resistant APL cells at concentrations that are achievable in patients. As2O3 induces loss of the PML/RAR alpha fusion protein in NB4 cells, in retinoic-acid resistant cells derived from them, in fresh APL cells from patients, and in non-APL cells transfected to express this protein. As2O3 and retinoic acid induce different patterns of gene regulation, and they inhibit the phenotypes induced by each other. Understanding the molecular basis of these differences in the effects of As2O3 and retinoic acid may guide the clinical use of arsenic compounds and provide insights into the management of leukemias that do not respond to retinoic acid.","['Shao, W', 'Fanelli, M', 'Ferrara, F F', 'Riccioni, R', 'Rosenauer, A', 'Davison, K', 'Lamph, W W', 'Waxman, S', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Avvisati, G', 'Testa, U', 'Peschle, C', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, C', 'Nervi, C', 'Miller, W H Jr']","['Shao W', 'Fanelli M', 'Ferrara FF', 'Riccioni R', 'Rosenauer A', 'Davison K', 'Lamph WW', 'Waxman S', 'Pelicci PG', 'Lo Coco F', 'Avvisati G', 'Testa U', 'Peschle C', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Nervi C', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 on p42mapk phosphorylation using human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (NB4). 1Alpha,25-(OH)2D3 (10[-8] M) significantly increased p42mapk phosphorylation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with the earliest response detectable at 30 sec. Because 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 is a conformationally flexible molecule, we have used a series of conformationally locked (6-s-cis vs. 6-s-trans) analogs to evaluate which shape is optimal for activation. Four 6-s-cis-locked analogs (HF, JM, JN, and JP) and two 6-s-trans-locked analog (JB and JD) were studied. HF, JM, JN, and JP all increased p42mapk phosphorylation at 1 and 5 min (10[-8] M), but JB and JD had little effect. Analog HL [1beta,25-(OH)2D3], a specific antagonist for only the rapid effects of 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3, attenuated 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3-induced p42mapk phosphorylation 65-90%. To assess the potential involvement of the VDRnuc in mediating the analog's action, the relative abilities of the analogs to compete with [3H]1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 for binding in vitro to the VDRnuc of NB4 cells was measured. All 6-s-cis analogs bound poorly to VDRnuc (relative competitive index, 0.5-2%) compared with 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 (relative competitive index, 100%). The present studies demonstrate for the first time that in NB4 cells 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3 rapidly activates the p42mapk pathway, and that this effect can be selectively mediated by analogs that can assume a 6-s-cis conformation.","['Song, X', 'Bishop, J E', 'Okamura, W H', 'Norman, A W']","['Song X', 'Bishop JE', 'Okamura WH', 'Norman AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of California, Riverside 92521, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vitamin D/analogs & derivatives']",1998/02/04 00:00,1998/02/04 00:01,['1998/02/04 00:00'],"['1998/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.139.2.5747 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1998 Feb;139(2):457-65. doi: 10.1210/endo.139.2.5747.,"['DK-09012-032/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-16595-23/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of LP-BM5 viral infection on cellular activation and membrane integrity of splenocytes. Oxidative burst in splenocytes in response to exposure to PMA (20 microg/ml) was significantly higher (p<.02) in infected than in control mice at two weeks post-infection using luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. By 13 weeks post-infection superoxide anion production in infected mice was significantly lower when compared to controls coinciding with decreased proliferative response to mitogens. The extent of cell membrane damage as indicated by lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in serum was significantly higher in infected than in control mice (p<.001). The results from this study suggests that LP-BM5 virus causes an initial stimulation of cellular activity followed by a decreased cell activation characterized by decreased proliferation of splenocytes and decreased oxygen radical production. Decreased cell membrane integrity indicated by increased LDH activity may partly be responsible for these changes.","['Mdurvwa, E G', 'Alak, J I', 'Pimentel-Smith, G E', 'Gakou, H S', 'Kolavala, S', 'Abdelrahman, H', 'Reddy, P G']","['Mdurvwa EG', 'Alak JI', 'Pimentel-Smith GE', 'Gakou HS', 'Kolavala S', 'Abdelrahman H', 'Reddy PG']","['Center for Biomedical Research/RCMI Carver Research Foundation, Tuskegee University, AL 36088, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology/*enzymology/immunology/*metabolism']",1998/02/04 00:00,1998/02/04 00:01,['1998/02/04 00:00'],"['1998/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 1997 Nov;43(7):1039-44.,['G12RR03059-10/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Efficacy of treatment with these drugs was based upon their ability to influence survival and disease pathophysiology by monitoring the development of splenomegaly. Toxicity was determined by changes in body weight, total peripheral white blood cell count and hematocrit. Didox or trimidox monotherapy was associated with increased survival and decreased disease pathophysiology, with no apparent toxicity. Combined with ddI, their ability to reduce development of viral induced splenomegaly was enhanced compared to trimidox, didox or ddI alone.

Clinical and etiological difference with adults.,401-6,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to re-evaluate the clinical features of stroke in children, their outcome and the place of the different mechanisms, in the light of CT-scan and magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: A 10-year review of the Dijon Childhood Neurology Clinic experience (1985-1995) identified 54 patients with arterial stroke. Diagnosis was established by CT-scan and angiography and by magnetic resonance imaging from 1987. When an hemorrhagic stroke was identified, a cerebral arteriogram and an investigation of the coagulation factors were performed. When an ischemic stroke was identified, the following tests were performed: an ultrasound examination of the cervical arteries, a cerebral arteriogram, a lumbar puncture, an investigation of the coagulation factors and lipid status, a measurement of homocystine in the plasma and the urine, an electrocardiogram, a Holter procedure and a cardiac echography. RESULTS: During the 11 full calendar years of this study, we observed 54 stroke patients. There were 31 cases of ischemic stroke, representing some 57% of the total, as well as 23 cases of hemorrhagic stroke, representing 43% of the total. Of the 31 cases with ischemic stroke, 4 had no known predisposing condition, 6 occurred in children with pre-existing heart disease, 2 had moya-moya disease, 2 had leukemia, 2 had a carotid dissection, 1 had an hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and 14 were observed in patients with other associated conditions, such as infections (7 cases) or slight cranial trauma (7 cases). On CT-scan, a basal ganglia infarction was identified in 14 cases. Among the 23 hemorrhagic strokes, 9 were due to arteriovenous malformations, 2 to arterial aneurysm and 5 to cavernomas. Two cases occurred in hemophilia, 2 in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and 2 after throat infections. One case had no etiologic factor. Clinical course was marked by a low mortality rate even in hemorrhagic stroke, long-lasting seizures, and hemidystonia. CONCLUSION: This neuro-imaging survey focused on the real place of hemorrhage and basal ganglia infarctions in children under 16 years of age, compared to adulthood. Follow-up demonstrated good or complete resolution of neurological deficits despite the frequent late hemidystonia and late epilepsy.","['Giroud, M', 'Lemesle, M', 'Madinier, G', 'Manceau, E', 'Osseby, G V', 'Dumas, R']","['Giroud M', 'Lemesle M', 'Madinier G', 'Manceau E', 'Osseby GV', 'Dumas R']","['Consultation de Neurologie Infantile, Service de Neurologie, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Acta Neurol Scand,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,0370336,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Brain Ischemia/epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/classification/*epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",1998/02/04 00:00,1998/02/04 00:01,['1998/02/04 00:00'],"['1998/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0404.1997.tb00306.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Neurol Scand. 1997 Dec;96(6):401-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0404.1997.tb00306.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments in a human bronchial xenograft model demonstrated high-level gene transduction with a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) HIV vector into undifferentiated, cystic fibrosis (CF)-derived cells of the xenograft. CFTR expression was stable and capable of functional correction of the CF defect after the graft matured.

Autologous transplantation with genetically altered pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells encoding anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genes could in theory completely and permanently reconstitute all blood lineages and immune functions with cells resistant to HIV. Recent studies showed that CD34+ stem cell can be mobilized in HIV-infected individuals after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration without major side effects or increase of viral load. In this study, peripheral blood CD34+ cells of five HIV-infected individuals were mobilized with G-CSF and after leukapheresis and enrichment, subjected to retroviral transduction with genes encoding anti-HIV ribozyme-decoy fusion molecules. These cells were tested for the ability to give rise to progeny cells, for retroviral transduction efficiency, and for expression of the transgene. CD34+-derived macrophage-like cells were also challenged with HIV. Results showed that CD34+ cells from HIV-infected individuals gave rise to similar numbers of progeny colonies as cells from healthy donors. The transduction efficiency of these cells varied from 68.8 to 100% as assessed by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the transgene in individual colonies. CD34+-derived macrophages expressed anti-HIV genes and displayed a substantial and sustained inhibition of HIV replication as compared to untransduced cells. Furthermore, we showed that after thawing, cryopreserved CD34+ cells from these individuals have survival, proliferation, and transduction parameters comparable to fresh cells. Thus, CD34+ cells from HIV-infected patients can be stored for further genetic manipulations with improved vectors or anti-HIV genes as they become available.","['Gervaix, A', 'Schwarz, L', 'Law, P', 'Ho, A D', 'Looney, D', 'Lane, T', 'Wong-Staal, F']","['Gervaix A', 'Schwarz L', 'Law P', 'Ho AD', 'Looney D', 'Lane T', 'Wong-Staal F']","['Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0665, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'HIV Infections/*blood/therapy', 'HIV-1/pathogenicity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Monocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'RNA, Catalytic/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/04 00:00,1998/02/04 00:01,['1998/02/04 00:00'],"['1998/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1997.8.18-2229 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1997 Dec 10;8(18):2229-38. doi: 10.1089/hum.1997.8.18-2229.,"['A136612/PHS HHS/United States', 'DK 49618/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['Hum Gene Ther. 1997 Dec 10;8(18):2170-2.

One approach would be to enable retroviral vectors to accumulate at sites of vascular injury and enhance local vector concentration. An early step in wound repair is the adhesion of platelets to collagen exposed from damaged vasculature. Hence, the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) envelope (env) protein was engineered to incorporate a high-affinity collagen-binding domain derived from von Willebrand clotting factor, and expressed in Escherichia coli and in mammalian cells. The chimeric env protein bound tightly to collagen, and virions bearing this collagen-binding env protein exhibited viral titers approaching those of virions expressing wild-type (WT) env protein. The chimeric virions were concentrated on collagen matrices, and they retained their infectivity under conditions in which virions bearing WT env protein were washed away. Targeted delivery of the chimeric env protein to injured mouse aorta and selective binding of the collagen-targeted virions to injured rabbit artery were observed. In comparative studies, vascular smooth muscle cell transduction was demonstrated in catheter-injured carotid arteries following infusion of collagen-targeted virions but not of virions bearing WT env protein. Taken together, these observations demonstrate the ability of collagen-targeted virions to localize gene delivery to sites of vascular injury.","['Hall, F L', 'Gordon, E M', 'Wu, L', 'Zhu, N L', 'Skotzko, M J', 'Starnes, V A', 'Anderson, W F']","['Hall FL', 'Gordon EM', 'Wu L', 'Zhu NL', 'Skotzko MJ', 'Starnes VA', 'Anderson WF']","['Department of Surgery, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California School of Medicine, 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Aorta/metabolism', 'Arteries/injuries/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism', 'Genetic Engineering', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vena Cava, Inferior/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'von Willebrand Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",1998/02/04 00:00,1998/02/04 00:01,['1998/02/04 00:00'],"['1998/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1997.8.18-2183 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1997 Dec 10;8(18):2183-92. doi: 10.1089/hum.1997.8.18-2183.,"['2P30 CA14089-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM49715/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The Australian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry was founded in 1991 to record this activity. AIM: To describe allogeneic and autologous bone marrow and blood stem cell transplantation in Australia during 1992-95. METHODS: Each bone marrow transplant programme in each State of Australia has been invited to contribute information to the Registry and all do. A single information sheet is compiled by the data manager in each programme when a marrow transplant is performed and mailed to the Registry office. An annual follow-up sheet is then mailed from the Registry to the contributing centre at the anniversary of each individual transplant. RESULTS: Australia-wide, haemopoietic cell transplants have increased in number from 478 in 1992 to 681 in 1995. The number of hospitals contributing registrations to the Australian Bone Marrow Transplant Registry has increased from 20 in 1992 to 25 in 1995. The main reason for the increased number of transplants is an increase in the number of autologous blood stem cell transplants including an increase in the number of staged autologous blood stem cell transplants. The most common indication for a single autologous transplant in 1995 was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and for a staged autologous transplant was breast cancer. The commonest indication for an allogeneic family member transplant in 1995 was acute myeloid leukaemia and for an allogeneic unrelated donor transplant, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The three year actuarial overall survival for patients receiving a haemopoietic stem cell transplant between 1992 and 1994 was 54% with a median follow-up time of 2.04 years. Recurrence of the underlying malignant disease was the main cause of death during both the first and second year post transplant after both allogeneic (13.3% and 8.3%) and autologous (22.1% and 11.8%) transplantation. Treatment-related mortality was 13.1% after allogeneic transplantation and 3.3% after autologous transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in bone marrow and blood stem cell transplantation practice in Australia during 1992-1995 have been outlined and both practice and outcome can be compared with that in other countries. The main cause of treatment failure, recurrence of the underlying malignant disease, indicates that this is where current and future research needs to be focused.","['Atkinson, K', 'Nivison-Smith, I', 'Hawkins, T']","['Atkinson K', 'Nivison-Smith I', 'Hawkins T']","[""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, NSW.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality/therapy', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends']",1997/08/01 00:00,1998/02/04 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1997.tb02200.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1997 Aug;27(4):408-19. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1997.tb02200.x.,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: To review retrospectively the outcomes for febrile neutropenia occurring in patients of the Medical Oncology Unit at our institution, and to identify factors associated with worse outcome, particularly prolonged admission or death. METHODS: We reviewed 102 episodes of febrile neutropenia occurring in 85 patients treated between 1992 and 1994. Demographic factors, tumour-related factors and clinical aspects of the episodes were correlated with outcome. RESULTS: The median age was 60 years (range, 18-87), with 56 (55%) episodes occurring in females. Twenty-eight (27%) episodes occurred in patients with lymphoma, with the remaining 74 (73%) occurring in patients with solid tumours. At presentation, the median absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was 0.14 x 10(9)/L with a median duration of significant neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 10(9)/L) of three days. The median duration of fever was two days. Twenty-nine (28%) episodes had positive cultures; of these 11 had bacteraemia. Forty-four (43%) episodes were classified as unexplained fevers. The remaining 29 episodes were associated with clinically documented infection but negative cultures. There was a high treatment success rate (81%) with first-line empirical antibiotics. Of 19 treatment failures, 13 were due to the necessity for antibiotic modification; the other six patients died from infection. Factors associated with a worse outcome (including prolonged admission and death) include: diagnosis of lymphoma; increasing number of chemotherapy courses; early onset of neutropenia; pneumonia; severe hypotension; and multiple co-morbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Febrile neutropenia in adult patients with solid tumours or lymphoma is associated with a relatively good outcome, possibly due to the short duration of neutropenia. A future prospective study to validate the risk factors identified in this study would be useful for defining patients at low risk for the adverse outcomes examined, in whom less intensive management for this condition may be possible.","['Leong, D C', 'Kinlay, S', 'Ackland, S', 'Bonaventura, A', 'Stewart, J F']","['Leong DC', 'Kinlay S', 'Ackland S', 'Bonaventura A', 'Stewart JF']","['Newcastle Mater Misericordiae Hospital, NSW.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/complications/drug therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*etiology', 'Oncology Service, Hospital', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1997/08/01 00:00,1998/02/04 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1997.tb02199.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1997 Aug;27(4):403-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1997.tb02199.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitantly, herbimycin A pretreatment prevented both high molecular weight and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation induced by etoposide. Two major bands at 30 and 66 kDa with enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation inhibited by herbimycin A were detectable after 30 min of incubation with etoposide. In addition, herbimycin A prevented etoposide-induced NF-kappa B activation. The expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax, on the other hand, were not affected by herbimycin A pretreatment. Herbimycin A was also found to inhibit 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-induced apoptotic changes and NF-kappa B activation.

We have previously demonstrated that levels of human amphotropic MLV receptor (pit2) mRNA varied considerably in different human cell lines. Removal of phosphate from the culture medium led to increases in the amount of pit2 mRNA and the quantity of a 71-kDa protein specifically recognized by antibodies against Pit2. To determine if the increases in pit2 mRNA and protein levels were due to a transcriptional effect, the pit2 promoter region was cloned. This region was characterized and found to contain a functional TATA-less promoter that under our experimental conditions does not respond to phosphate depletion. Instead, pit2 mRNA was found to be more stable in response to Pi depletion. These results suggest that the increase in pit2 mRNA levels observed in response to Pi depletion occurs at a posttranscriptional level and is due to enhanced mRNA stability.","['Chien, M L', ""O'Neill, E"", 'Garcia, J V']","['Chien ML', ""O'Neill E"", 'Garcia JV']","[""Department of Virology & Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes', 'Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/04 00:00,1998/02/04 00:01,['1998/02/04 00:00'],"['1998/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(97)98933-9 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8933 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Jan 5;240(1):109-17. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8933.,"['AI49316/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We previously have shown that a mutant inhibitory form of an essential viral protein, Rev M10, prolongs the survival of T cells transduced with a nonviral vector in HIV-infected individuals. Because these gene-modified cells were not observed in patients beyond 8 weeks, efforts were made to improve the duration of engraftment. In this study, we used retroviral vector delivery of Rev M10 to CD4(+) cells and analyzed relevant immune responses in a pilot study of three HIV-seropositive patients. DNA and RNA PCR analyses revealed that cells transduced with Rev M10 retroviral vectors survived and expressed the recombinant gene for significantly longer time periods than those transduced with a negative control vector in all three patients. Immune responses were not detected either to Rev M10 or to Moloney murine leukemia virus gp70 envelope protein.

The cytotoxicity of all the naphthoquinones examined was not affected at all by the treatment in combination with diethyl maleate, a glutathione-specific SH-blocking agent in the cells. Depending on the characteristics of the response to the treatment in combination with iodoacetamide (IAA) and glutathione (GSH), these naphthoquinones were tentatively classified into three groups. The chemicals of Group I, which include naphthoquinones carrying an electron-donating group(s) other than an OH group on the quinone ring moiety, showed synergistic cytotoxicity with IAA and no reduction in cytotoxicity with GSH. Those of Group II, which include naphthoquinones without an electron-donating group on the quinone ring moiety, showed no synergy with IAA but appreciable reductions in cytotoxicity with GSH. Group III includes 2-hydroxylated naphthoquinones, which showed neither synergy with IAA nor cytotoxicity reduction with GSH. Cytotoxicity was discussed in terms of the electron-deficiency of the quinone ring moiety. It is suggested that the cytotoxicity of Group I quinones comes from the active oxygen generation which follows semiquinone formation, whereas that of the other groups of quinones is not likely caused simply by either SH-blocking of biomolecules or active oxygen-related mechanism.","['Noda, Y', 'Kawazoe, Y', 'Hakura, A']","['Noda Y', 'Kawazoe Y', 'Hakura A']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Maleates)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', 'G81WQB56OL (diethyl maleate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'ZRH8M27S79 (Iodoacetamide)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Drug Interactions', 'Glutathione/*pharmacology', 'Iodoacetamide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Maleates/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Naphthoquinones/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.20.1250 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1997 Dec;20(12):1250-6. doi: 10.1248/bpb.20.1250.,,,,,,,,,,

The CD69 C-type lectin is reportedly the earliest activation antigen on lymphocytes and can be detected within hours of mitogenic stimulation. Recently reports have described differential activation dynamics with respect to different antigenic or mitogenic stimuli. This study has investigated the dynamics of CD69 expression over time after mitogenic, allogeneic, cytokine and target cell mediated activation of T-cell and NK cell subsets. It is apparent that the dynamics of CD69 expression differ with respect to the cell type and the method of stimulation. Mitogenic stimulation resulted in the most rapid expression of CD69 on both T- and NK cells while alloantigen stimulation induced a far slower response. Target cell stimulation of NK cells gave paradoxical results in that the CD69 + ve subset increased as a proportion of the total NK cells but did not increase in number. This was due to the selective binding of CD69 - ve NK cells to the target cells and their subsequent loss from the lymphoid gate. We confirmed this by showing that CD69 + ve NK cells do not lyse K562 target cells. This observation demonstrates the caution needed in the analysis of flow cytometric data based solely upon relative proportions of cells within discrete subsets.","['Craston, R', 'Koh, M', 'Mc Dermott, A', 'Ray, N', 'Prentice, H G', 'Lowdell, M W']","['Craston R', 'Koh M', 'Mc Dermott A', 'Ray N', 'Prentice HG', 'Lowdell MW']","['BMT Programme, Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (phytohemagglutinin-P)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*biosynthesis', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/pharmacology', 'Isoantigens/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-1759(97)00143-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(97)00143-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1997 Nov 10;209(1):37-45. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(97)00143-9.,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: In both cases, trisomy 14 was identified using conventional cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization methods. The patients were elderly men, 70 and 77 years old, who presented with anemia and thrombocytopenia. According to the French-American-British classification, case 1 was classified as refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, and case 2 was classified as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In both cases, the aspirate smears revealed obvious abnormalities in erythroid and megakaryocytic maturation, with more subtle abnormalities in myeloid maturation. The biopsy sections were hypercellular, and there was marked myeloid hyperplasia in case 2. Both patients received only supportive therapy after the diagnosis was established. Clinical follow-up was available for both patients. The patient in case 1 died 67 months after disease onset of an unrelated illness, and the patient in case 2 was alive at last follow-up, 12 months after diagnosis. LITERATURE REVIEW: Thirty-five cases of trisomy 14 have been previously reported in the literature, predominantly in cytogenetics journals, and the description of the pathologic findings for the majority of these cases is limited or not provided. According to published data, the majority of these cases are myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemias associated with myelodysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of trisomy 14 in the bone marrow strongly correlates with the presence of a myelodysplastic syndrome. The two cases of myelodysplastic syndrome associated with trisomy 14 we describe here did not exhibit characteristic morphologic findings that might suggest the presence of the cytogenetic abnormality.","['Vasef, M A', 'Murata-Collins, J L', 'Alsabeh, R', 'Medeiros, L J']","['Vasef MA', 'Murata-Collins JL', 'Alsabeh R', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, Calif 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Syndrome', '*Trisomy']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1998 Jan;122(1):77-83.,,,27,,,,,,,

The authors review one institution's CSF cytology results over an 11-year period. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective study of 5951 CSF specimens generated between 1985 and 1995. Specimens from pediatric patients (<19 years of age) from the same time period were separately identified. RESULTS: A total of 5561 adult and 390 pediatric CSF specimens were interpreted. A diagnosis of ""negative for malignant cells"" was assigned in 5171 (93%) of the adult cases and in 351 (90%) of the pediatric cases. Specific infectious organisms were identified in 26 adult specimens and one pediatric specimen. Cryptococcus was the most common infectious agent observed (n = 23 adults), and Toxoplasma was the sole pediatric infectious agent. Two hundred seventy-six (5%) adult cases and 31 (8%) pediatric cases were positive for malignant cells. Diagnoses included metastatic tumors (adult, 140 [51%]; pediatric, 0); lymphoma/leukemia (adult, 112 [41%]; pediatric, 4 [13%]); malignant unclassified neoplasms (adult, 9 [3%]; pediatric, 0); and primary central nervous system neoplasms (adult, 12 [4%]; pediatric, 27 [87%]). Medulloblastoma was the most common pediatric neoplasm (n = 21). There were 105 (2%) adult cases and 8 (2%) pediatric cases with atypical cells present. Atypical lymphoid cells were the most common type in adult cases (53%). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, infectious agents were rarely identified in pediatric CSF specimens. In adult specimens, the most commonly identified organisms was Cryptococcus. Primary central nervous system neoplasms accounted for a higher percentage of CSF specimens in the pediatric population than in the adult population. The most commonly identified malignancy in adults was metastatic neoplasms, and in children, medulloblastoma.","['Prayson, R A', 'Fischler, D F']","['Prayson RA', 'Fischler DF']","['Department of Anatomic Pathology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/*cytology/microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cryptococcosis/diagnosis/pathology', 'Cryptococcus neoformans/isolation & purification', 'Glioblastoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Medulloblastoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Melanoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1998 Jan;122(1):47-51.,,,,,,,,,,

PML localizes within distinct nuclear structures, called nuclear bodies, which are disrupted by the expression of PML-RAR alpha. We report that PML colocalizes with the nonphosphorylated fraction of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) within nuclear bodies and that pRB is delocalized by PML-RAR alpha expression. Both PML and PML-RAR alpha form complexes with the nonphosphorylated form of pRB in vivo, and they interact with the pocket region of pRB. The regions of PML and PML-RAR alpha involved in pRB binding differ; in fact, the B boxes and the C-terminal region of PML, the latter of which is not present in PML-RAR alpha, are essential for the formation of stable complexes with pRB. Functionally, PML abolishes activation of glucocorticoid receptor-regulated transcription by pRB, whereas PML-RAR alpha further increases it.

In the t(8;21) translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the AML1(CBFA2/PEBP2alphaB) gene is juxtaposed to the MTG8(ETO/CDR) gene. We show here that the resultant AML1-MTG8 gene product specifically and strongly interacts with an 85-kDa phosphoprotein. Molecular cloning of cDNA indicated that the AML1-MTG8-binding protein (MTGR1) is highly related to MTG8 and similar to Drosophila Nervy. Comparison of amino acid sequences among MTGR1, MTG8, and Nervy revealed four evolutionarily conserved regions (NHR1 to NHR4). Ectopic expression of AML1-MTG8 in L-G murine myeloid progenitor cells inhibits differentiation to mature neutrophils and induces cell proliferation in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Analysis with C-terminal deletion mutants of AML1-MTG8 indicated that the region of 51 residues (488 to 538), which contains NHR2, is essential for the induction of G-CSF-dependent cell proliferation. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicates that this region is required for AML1-MTG8 to form a stable complex with MTGR1. Overexpression of MTGR1 stimulates AML1-MTG8 to induce G-CSF-dependent proliferation of L-G cells and to interfere with AML1-dependent transcription. These results suggest that AML1-MTG8 could function as a complex with MTGR1 and that the complex might be important in promoting leukemogenesis.","['Kitabayashi, I', 'Ida, K', 'Morohoshi, F', 'Yokoyama, A', 'Mitsuhashi, N', 'Shimizu, K', 'Nomura, N', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Ohki, M']","['Kitabayashi I', 'Ida K', 'Morohoshi F', 'Yokoyama A', 'Mitsuhashi N', 'Shimizu K', 'Nomura N', 'Hayashi Y', 'Ohki M']","['Radiobiology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan. ikitabay@ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (CBFA2T2 myeloid-transforming gene-related protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.2.846 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Feb;18(2):846-58. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.2.846.,,,,,,,PMC108796,"['GENBANK/AF013970', 'GENBANK/AF069747', 'GENBANK/AF076449', 'GENBANK/AF076450', 'GENBANK/AF076451', 'GENBANK/AF076452', 'GENBANK/AF076453', 'GENBANK/AF076454', 'GENBANK/AF076455', 'GENBANK/AF076456', 'GENBANK/AF076457', 'GENBANK/AF076458', 'GENBANK/AF076459', 'GENBANK/AF076460', 'GENBANK/AF076461']",,

To activate HTLV-1 transcription, Tax interacts with the cellular DNA binding protein cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and recruits the coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP), forming a nucleoprotein complex on the three viral cyclic AMP-responsive elements (CREs) in the HTLV-1 promoter. Short stretches of dG-dC-rich (GC-rich) DNA, immediately flanking each of the viral CREs, are essential for Tax recruitment of CBP in vitro and Tax transactivation in vivo. Although the importance of the viral CRE-flanking sequences is well established, several studies have failed to identify an interaction between Tax and the DNA. The mechanistic role of the viral CRE-flanking sequences has therefore remained enigmatic. In this study, we used high resolution methidiumpropyl-EDTA iron(II) footprinting to show that Tax extended the CREB footprint into the GC-rich DNA flanking sequences of the viral CRE. The Tax-CREB footprint was enhanced but not extended by the KIX domain of CBP, suggesting that the coactivator increased the stability of the nucleoprotein complex. Conversely, the footprint pattern of CREB on a cellular CRE lacking GC-rich flanking sequences did not change in the presence of Tax or Tax plus KIX. The minor-groove DNA binding drug chromomycin A3 bound to the GC-rich flanking sequences and inhibited the association of Tax and the Tax-CBP complex without affecting CREB binding. Tax specifically cross-linked to the viral CRE in the 5'-flanking sequence, and this cross-link was blocked by chromomycin A3. Together, these data support a model where Tax interacts directly with both CREB and the minor-groove viral CRE-flanking sequences to form a high-affinity binding site for the recruitment of CBP to the HTLV-1 promoter.","['Lenzmeier, B A', 'Giebler, H A', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Lenzmeier BA', 'Giebler HA', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'DVW027E7NL (Chromomycin A3)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Chromomycin A3/pharmacology', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.2.721 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Feb;18(2):721-31. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.2.721.,['CA-55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC108783,,,

Kde rearrangements occur either to Vkappa gene segments (Vkappa-Kde rearrangements) or to the heptamer recombination signal sequence in the Jkappa-Ckappa intron. Kde rearrangements were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and heteroduplex analysis in 130 B-lineage leukemias: 63 precursor-B-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) and 67 chronic B cell leukemias. To obtain detailed information about Kde rearrangements, we sequenced 109 of the 189 detected junctional regions. Vkappa gene family usage in the Vkappa-Kde rearrangements in our series of B-lineage leukemias was comparable to Vkappa gene family usage in functional Vkappa-Jkappa rearrangements in normal and malignant mature B cells, except for a higher frequency of VkappaII family usage in precursor-B-ALL. Junctional region sequencing of the Kde rearrangements in precursor-B-ALL revealed a mean insertion of 4.7 nucleotides and a mean deletion of 9.5 nucleotides, resulting in an extensive junctional diversity, whereas in chronic B cell leukemias the insertion (1.9) and deletion (6.0) were significantly lower. The relatively extensive junctional diversity of the Kde rearrangements in precursor-B-ALL allowed us to design leukemia/patient-specific oligonucleotide probes, which were proven to be useful for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) with sensitivities of 10(-4) to 10(-5). Kde rearrangements occur in approximately 50% of precursor-B-ALL cases and are likely to remain stable during the disease course, because Kde rearrangements are assumed to be 'end-stage' rearrangements, which cannot easily be replaced by continuing rearrangement processes. These findings indicate that junctional regions of Kde rearrangements in precursor-B-ALL represent new valuable patient-specific PCR targets for detection of MRD.","['Beishuizen, A', 'de Bruijn, M A', 'Pongers-Willemse, M J', 'Verhoeven, M A', 'van Wering, E R', 'Hahlen, K', 'Breit, T M', 'de Bruin-Versteeg, S', 'Hooijkaas, H', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Beishuizen A', 'de Bruijn MA', 'Pongers-Willemse MJ', 'Verhoeven MA', 'van Wering ER', 'Hahlen K', 'Breit TM', 'de Bruin-Versteeg S', 'Hooijkaas H', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['Gene Deletion', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400904 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Dec;11(12):2200-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400904.,,,,,,,,,,

PCR techniques are more and more being used for molecular clonality studies. The main disadvantage of the PCR-based detection of clonal TCR gene rearrangements, is the risk of false-positive results due to 'background' amplification of similar rearrangements in polyclonal reactive T lymphocytes. Therefore, PCR-based clonality assessment should include analyses that discern between PCR products derived from monoclonal and polyclonal cell populations. One such method is heteroduplex analysis, in which homo- and heteroduplexes resulting from denaturation (at 94 degrees C) and renaturation (at lower temperatures) of PCR products, are separated in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels based on their conformation. After denaturation/renaturation, PCR products of clonally rearranged TCR genes give rise to homoduplexes, whereas in case of polyclonal cells heteroduplexes with heterogeneous junctions are formed. We studied heteroduplex PCR analysis of TCR gene rearrangements with respect to the time and temperature of renaturation and the size of the PCR products. Variation in time did not have much influence, but higher renaturation temperatures (>30 degrees C) clearly showed better duplex formation. Nevertheless, distinction between monoclonal and polyclonal samples was found to be more reliable at a renaturation temperature of 4 degrees C, using relatively short PCR products. To determine the sensitivity of heteroduplex analysis with renaturation at 4 degrees C, (c)DNA of T cell malignancies with proven clonal rearrangements was serially diluted in (c)DNA of polyclonal mononuclear peripheral blood cells and amplified using V and C primers (TCRB genes) or V and J primers (TCRG and TCRD genes). Clonal TCRB and TCRD gene rearrangements could be detected with a sensitivity of at least 5%, whereas the sensitivity for TCRG genes was somewhat lower (10-15%). The latter could be improved by use of Vgamma member primers instead of Vgamma family primers. We conclude from our results that heteroduplex PCR analysis of TCR gene rearrangements is a simple, rapid and cheap alternative to Southern blot analysis for detection of clonally rearranged TCR genes.","['Langerak, A W', 'Szczepanski, T', 'van der Burg, M', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Langerak AW', 'Szczepanski T', 'van der Burg M', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Dept of Immunology, Erasmus University Rotterdam and University Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Temperature']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400887 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Dec;11(12):2192-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400887.,,,,,,,,,,

Nowadays, a whole family of bcl-2-related genes has been identified and consist of members which can either protect or promote induction of PCD. The family members form protein dimers, and the relative abundance of specific dimers regulates the cellular sensitivity to death signals (the rheostat model). Aberrant expression of different family members in several types of malignancies alter the cellular rheostat and thereby promote cellular resistance to chemotherapy.","['Meijerink, J P']",['Meijerink JP'],"['Department of Hematology, University Hospital St Radboud Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400849 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Dec;11(12):2175-87. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400849.,,,,,,,,,,

In most cases in which it has been examined, the paraprotein contains high-titer anti-HIV activity.

Recent work in plasma cell tumorigenesis has indicated that transformation at a single point in the B lymphocyte lineage can give rise to either lymphoma or myeloma, dependent upon environmental factors such as T cell function, which may be required for directing transformed lymphocytes from lymphoma and towards plasma cell differentiation.

It was the aim of the present study to analyze the degree of immaturity of UCB progenitor cells. UCB mononuclear (MNC) and/or CD34+ cells were tested for surface antigen phenotype, expression of cytokines receptor, effect of stem cell factor (SCF) on colony growth, resistance to mafosfamide and replating potential. We have found that 34.9 +/- 3.4% and 77.9 +/- 2.6% of UCB CD34+ cells did not express CD38 and CD45RA antigens, respectively, suggesting that UCB contains a high proportion of immature progenitor cells. By means of three-color analysis, the receptor for SCF was detected on the majority of the CD34+ HLA-DR+ subpopulation; in fact, 81.8% +/- 4.3% of CD34+ HLA-DR+ cells were defined as SCF(low) and 8.1 +/- 1.5% as SCF(high). Colony growth of MNC and CD34+ cells was enhanced by the addition of SCF to methylcellulose mixture, resulting in a statistically significant increase in CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM but not in BFU-E numbers. UCB progenitor cells showed a higher resistance to mafosfamide treatment, in comparison to BM; the addition of SCF to the culture medium resulted in a statistically significant increase in mafosfamide concentration required to inhibit 95% of colony growth (P < or = 0.05). Moreover, as shown by single colony transfer assays, the presence of SCF in primary cultures promoted a significantly higher replating potential for both untreated (42 +/- 3.3% vs 21 +/- 4.6%, P < or = 0.018) and mafosfamide-treated samples (62 +/- 5.6% vs 44 +/- 6.1%, P < or = 0.018). In conclusion, UCB is a source of progenitor cells with immature characteristics in terms of surface antigen expression, distribution of SCF receptor, resistance to mafosfamide and replating potential. Therefore, UCB progenitor cells represent an ideal candidate population for experimental programs involving gene transfer and ex vivo stem cell expansion.","['Almici, C', 'Carlo-Stella, C', 'Wagner, J E', 'Mangoni, L', 'Garau, D', 'Rizzoli, V']","['Almici C', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Wagner JE', 'Mangoni L', 'Garau D', 'Rizzoli V']","['Department of Hematology, BMT Unit, University of Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/analysis', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400871 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Dec;11(12):2143-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400871.,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells cultured under serum-free conditions constitutively secreted low amounts of TSP into the cultured medium, approximately 13 ng/10(6) cells/24 h. PMA used at 4 x 10(-8) M did not significantly modulate TSP secretion over a 24 h period. In contrast, RA at 10(-7) M induced a 5- to 10-fold increase in TSP secreted by HL-60 cells during their differentiation into granulocytes over a 5 day period. The role of secreted TSP in RA-dependent cessation of growth and differentiation was examined using blocking anti-TSP antibodies. In the presence of the polyclonal anti-TSP antibody R5 (25 microg/ml), growth of RA-treated HL-60 cells was maintained at control levels for up to 3 days and a concomitant delay in granulocytic differentiation was observed. Moreover, the addition of soluble TSP (0.5-5 microg/ml) to untreated HL-60 cells decreased their growth and promoted their differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. Using a neutralizing antibody to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) or purified TGF-beta1 we further demonstrated that the effects of TSP were not mediated through activation of latent TGF-beta. These studies indicate that TSP decreases the proliferation and promotes the differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Touhami, M', 'Fauvel-Lafeve, F', 'Da Silva, N', 'Chomienne, C', 'Legrand, C']","['Touhami M', 'Fauvel-Lafeve F', 'Da Silva N', 'Chomienne C', 'Legrand C']","['Unite 353 INSERM, Proteines Adhesives et Proteases des Cellules Vasculaires et Sanguines, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Thrombospondins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Thrombospondins/analysis/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400866 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Dec;11(12):2137-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400866.,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation of myeloid cells into neutrophils or monocytes is associated with the acquisition of the O2- producing enzyme, NADPH oxidase, which plays a critical role in microbial killing. In this study, the expression of the components of the NADPH oxidase complex during the differentiation of NB4 cells into neutrophils or macrophages has been investigated. Whereas cells exposed to ATRA were able to produce O2- after 2 days of differentiation, they remain unable to generate O2- when exposed to PMA or PMA + VD3. With the exception of p21rac, none of the other oxidase components was expressed in non-differentiated cells. Addition of ATRA induced the progressive expression and accumulation of p22phox, p91phox, p47phox and p67phox. Compared to the other components, p67phox was expressed late and its expression appeared to correlate most closely with the generation of O2- in the differentiation process. In PMA or PMA + VD3-differentiated NB4 cells, expression of the NADPH oxidase components was incomplete. Therefore, ATRA induced the expression of a functional NADPH oxidase complex in neutrophil-like NB4 cells. In contrast, when NB4 cells are exposed to monocytic differentiating agents, they acquire only part of the phenotypic characteristics of monocytes and lack one of the major phagocytic functionalities, the respiratory burst oxidase.","[""N'Diaye, E N"", 'Vaissiere, C', 'Gonzalez-Christen, J', 'Gregoire, C', 'Le Cabec, V', 'Maridonneau-Parini, I']","[""N'Diaye EN"", 'Vaissiere C', 'Gonzalez-Christen J', 'Gregoire C', 'Le Cabec V', 'Maridonneau-Parini I']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UPR 9062, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'NADPH Oxidases/*biosynthesis', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400855 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Dec;11(12):2131-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400855.,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed alterations of p16 and p15 genes in 46 acute leukemias with MLL gene rearrangements by Southern blot analysis, and investigated the association with clinical characteristics. We identified homozygous deletion of p16 and p15 genes in five (19%) of 27 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) and in two (11%) of 19 acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). Patients with homozygous deletion of p16 and p15 genes showed higher average leukocyte counts (343 x 10(9)/l vs 271 x 10(9)/l) and lower estimated 2-year survival rates than those with normal p16 and p15 genes (14.3 vs 30.7%), although the differences were not statistically significant.

We have previously documented recurrent clonal and non-clonal chromosomal abnormalities in hairy cells. To ascertain whether this instability of the genome is restricted to the malignant cells or if it might also include normal cells we performed cytogenetic investigations on skin fibroblasts and hairy cells from eight HCL patients and skin fibroblasts from eight referents. The frequency of chromosome abnormalities, regardless of clonality, was significantly increased in the fibroblasts from patients compared to referents. Also, five patients compared to one referent showed clonal abnormalities in their fibroblasts. Immunohistochemical investigations excluded the possibility that the fibroblast cultures were contaminated with hairy cells. Two patients had constitutional abnormalities, inv(5)(p13.1q13.3) and t(13;14), and one additional patient, possibly mosaic, showed the same abnormality, inv(9)(p21-22q22), in both fibroblasts (17/30) and blood (5/21) cells.

A clonal expansion with trisomy 7 occurred in vitro as documented by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The only clonal abnormality occurring in a referent was -Y/-Y,+15 in an elderly male.

We studied eight AML or MDS patients with 7q-, in order to define the commonly deleted area in more detail. Separated blood lymphocytes and granulocytes were typed with 48 polymorphic microsatellite markers, and the heterozygosity between the two cell lineages was compared. The minimum commonly deleted region spanned from D7S658 to D7S655. Unexpectedly, four of the patients showed remarkable homozygosity in both lymphocytes and granulocytes around the commonly deleted area, and thus no deletions could be demonstrated by comparing the two cell lineages. Comparison to leukemic patients without 7q- and to normal individuals revealed that the homozygosity was restricted to patients with 7q-.

The translocation t(8;16)(p11;p13.3) consistently disrupts two genes: the CBP gene on chromosome band 16p13.3 and the MOZ gene on chromosome band 8p11. Although a fusion of these two genes as a result of the translocation is expected, attempts at detecting the fusion transcript by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have proven difficult; to date, only one in-frame CBP/MOZ fusion transcript has been reported. We therefore sought other reliable means of detecting CBP rearrangements. We applied fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analyses to a series of AML patients with a t(8;16) and detected DNA rearrangements of both the CBP and the MOZ loci in all cases tested. All six cases examined for CBP rearrangements have breakpoints within a 13 kb breakpoint cluster region at the 5' end of the CBP gene. Additionally, we used a MOZ cDNA probe to construct a surrounding cosmid contig and detect DNA rearrangements in three t(8;16) cases, all of which display rearrangements within a 6 kb genomic fragment of the MOZ gene. We have thus developed a series of cosmid probes that consistently detect the disruption of the CBP gene in t(8;16) patients.

HL 60 cells are at least 10- to 20-fold more sensitive to Ara-C than Raji cells. After 4 h incubation with 50 microM Ara-C, both cells show deviations in their phosphatidylcholine (PC) and triglyceride (TG) contents, starting as early as 8 h after treatment. After 24 h, the Ara-C-induced changes in lipid metabolism are accompanied by a severe loss of viability in HL 60 cells but not in Raji cells. At this time point the HL 60 cells show a 20% depletion of PC with a concomitant increase in TG of 25%, whereas in Raji cells both PC and TG are increased 20 and 22%, respectively. The addition of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) antagonizes Ara-C-induced cell death in various leukemic cell lines and primary AML blasts from patients. Since lysoPC is a direct precursor for PC and increases the PC content of the membrane, we assume that the loss of PC in the sensitive cell line HL 60 and in other cells plays a role in Ara-C-induced toxicity. Further evidence for this mechanism is presented by the observation that hexadecylphosphocholine, an inhibitor of PC synthesis shows synergistic antiproliferative effects with Ara-C. We conclude that the rapid cell lysis described during high-dose Ara-C treatment seems to be mediated by reduction of cell membrane PC content.","['Berkovic, D', 'Fleer, E A', 'Breass, J', 'Pfortner, J', 'Schleyer, E', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Berkovic D', 'Fleer EA', 'Breass J', 'Pfortner J', 'Schleyer E', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*metabolism']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400860 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Dec;11(12):2079-86. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400860.,,,,,,,,,,

The mean fluorescence index (MFI), expressed as the ratio of sample mean channel:control mean channel, ranged from 3.0 to 39.5 with a median value of 14.

When bcl-2 intensity expression was correlated with complete remission (CR) rate, a higher MFI was associated with a low CR rate after standard intensive chemotherapy. In particular, CR was achieved in 86% of patients with a bcl-2 MFI <14, but only in 57% of patients with a MFI >14 (P = 0.008). A further decrease of CR rate to 41% was observed in patients in whom a higher bcl-2 MFI was coupled with the presence of CD34 antigen on their blasts. By statistical analysis we also demonstrated that both bcl-2 high MFI (>14) and CD34 expression are independent prognostic factors for achieving CR in AML. These data raise the hypothesis that high values of bcl-2 may confer on myeloid blasts a higher resistance to standard chemotherapy.

In order to determine the role of p-glycoprotein in the cellular pharmacology of mitoxantrone flow cytometry and confocal microscopy were used to study two human myeloid leukemia cell lines selected for resistance to mitoxantrone (HL-60MX2) and doxorubicin (HL-60DOX). To optimize the detection of intracellular mitoxantrone, we determined the maximum excitation (607 nm) and emission (684 nm) wavelength by fluorescence spectroscopy. The modified flow cytometric conditions using 568.2 nm laser emission for excitation and a 620 nm long pass filter for fluorescence collection resulted in a 1-log increase in sensitivity, compared with standard 488-nm laser excitation. Uptake and retention of mitoxantrone in the presence of verapamil, a calcium channel blocker known to inhibit p-glycoprotein, were analyzed. Our results showed no change in uptake and retention of the drug in p-glycoprotein-negative mitoxantrone-resistant HL-60MX2 cells and in its sensitive parental line, HL-60s. In contrast, 3.1- and 2.4-fold increases were found in uptake and retention of mitoxantrone in p-glycoprotein-positive cells (HL-60DOX) incubated with verapamil. Confocal microscopy of intracellular drug distribution demonstrated reduced nuclear uptake, which could be reversed by verapamil, in HL-60DOX. A characteristic punctate pattern was observed for the intracytoplasmic drug distribution in HL-60DOX and HL-60MX2 cells and was partially modified by the presence of verapamil in HL-60DOX cells. Verapamil increased cytotoxicity of mitoxantrone two-fold in HL-60DOX cells, 1.4-fold in HL-60MX2, and had no effect in HL-60s. Our study demonstrates that the cellular pharmacology of mitoxantrone is affected by p-glycoprotein and can be reversed at least in part by verapamil. Other mechanisms of resistance however, seem to play a determinant role in the modulation of mitoxantrone cytotoxicity.","['Consoli, U', 'Van, N T', 'Neamati, N', 'Mahadevia, R', 'Beran, M', 'Zhao, S', 'Andreeff, M']","['Consoli U', 'Van NT', 'Neamati N', 'Mahadevia R', 'Beran M', 'Zhao S', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Hematology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400511 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Dec;11(12):2066-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400511.,"['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 57639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to find common characteristics in the four patients, we performed detailed immunological marker analysis, Southern blot analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes, and cytogenetic studies. In three patients clonality of the B-cells could be proven by single Ig light chain expression, but in the fourth patient no Ig light chain expression was detected and clonality of the B cells could only be demonstrated by Southern blot analysis of the Ig genes. Interestingly, in two patients, the Ig gene rearrangement patterns were compatible with the presence of two independent B cell clones, whereas in the two other siblings a monoclonal rearrangement pattern was found. All four patients showed clonal chromosome aberrations, which were different in each patient. In the two patients with biclonal Ig gene rearrangement patterns, two unrelated clones could also be demonstrated by the cytogenetic studies. These combined Ig gene and cytogenetic data indicate the presence of two different B-CLL in two of the four patients. Remarkably, the B-CLL cells of the two oldest patients expressed the CD8 antigen, which is rarely observed.

Whilst the ability of the leukaemia cells to elicit an anti-leukaemic immune response in the allogeneic setting is established, it remains unclear why such anti-leukaemic response does not occur in vivo in the autologous setting. We previously demonstrated the presence of leukaemia-reactive T cells in a patient with CML. However, we found that the T cells were normally anergic unless pre-incubated in vitro in high-dose recombinant interleukin-2. We speculated that the T cell anergy was the result of a lack of the appropriate immune costimulatory molecules on the leukaemia cell surface. In this study, we confirm the absence of immune costimulatory molecules, CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), on leukaemia cells and demonstrated that these costimulatory molecules on the leukaemia cells can be upregulated by a combination of GM-CSF and IL-4. There was an associated restoration of leukaemia cell immunogenicity to autologous T cells in mixed lymphocyte leukaemia reactions, suggesting a possible enhancement of anti-leukaemic reaction. More importantly, T cells primed with 'activated' leukaemia cells were able to recognise fresh cytokine-naive leukaemia cells. Furthermore, leukaemia cells expressing the dendritic cell marker, CD1a, were also generated. Our findings therefore suggest the opportunity in future to use these combination cytokines in vivo or these leukaemia cells which have been activated in vitro for leukaemia immunotherapy.","['Coleman, S', 'Throp, D', 'Fisher, J', 'Bailey-Wood, R', 'Lim, S H']","['Coleman S', 'Throp D', 'Fisher J', 'Bailey-Wood R', 'Lim SH']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400858 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Dec;11(12):2055-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400858.,,,,,,,,,,

As initial passage stocks of Dami are no longer available for comparison, we investigated whether cross-contamination by HEL was more likely to have occurred during Dami's establishment or subsequently, by karyotyping currently available stocks of both cell lines for comparison with that originally reported for Dami. We found that the karyotype of current stocks of Dami overwhelmingly resembles that described in the original report, having retained at least 16/18 structural chromosome rearrangements as described therein, cf. 12/20 shared by current stocks of Dami and HEL. HEL's antecedence is shown by the retention of normal homologs of chromosomes, 6, 18, and 21--all rearranged in Dami.

Frequent genetic abnormalities identified in human leukemia are chromosomal rearrangements such as chromosomal translocations and inversions. Chromosome band 3q26 is the site of the breakpoint of recurring translocations and inversions observed in patients with myeloid leukemias. Two genes located at 3q26 have been implicated in development or progression of myeloid leukemia. They are MDS1 and EVI1. MDS1, first identified as part of a fusion transcript resulting from the t(3;21)(q26;q22), encodes a small protein of unknown function. EVI1 encodes a zinc finger protein inappropriately overexpressed by chromosomal rearrangements (in man) or by retroviral insertion (in the mouse). Both genes are rearranged by the t(3;21)(q26;q22) and by the t(3;12)(p13;q22). As a result of the translocation, they are expressed as fusion genes either with AML1 or with TEL. EVI1 and MDS1 are unusual in that they can either encode separate proteins, or they can be expressed as one protein which we named MDS1/EVI1.

Nearly all children with leukemia should have an adequate cytogenetic analysis which in 80-90% is expected to show clonal chromosomal abnormalities. Moreover, with the availability of appropriate gene probes and sophisticated molecular techniques, genetic rearrangements become detectable in the majority of leukemia patients. Genetic abnormalities often associate with particular clinical-biological characteristics of the disease. In ALL, for example, genetic alterations together with distinct immunologic and clinical features, define various subgroups. In AML, unique cytogenetic rearrangements have been identified and associated with distinct morphological subgroups. Apart from the diagnostic assessment, cytogenetic studies provide valuable prognostic information which may influence treatment choices. Molecular analysis has also become of important value in the management of children with leukemias, as it serves, for example, to identify genetic abnormalities not detected by chromosomal analysis and to monitor residual disease during treatment and follow-up. Thus, genetic analyses of leukemic cells provide information of clinical relevance as well as contributing to our understanding of leukemogenesis. Alternative classifications of acute leukemias which take into account genetic information are being proposed. The available cytogenetic and molecular data have then to be included in clinical protocols, either by selecting individualized therapies in certain leukemia subtypes or by modifying treatment according to quantification of residual disease.

Both chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) are associated with the expression of BCR/ABL proteins. This knowledge has not yet been translated into any specific tool to control ABL driven neoplastic cells growth. CGP57148B is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of the ABL protein kinase; it has been shown to inhibit the kinase activity of ABL both in vitro and in vivo and to inhibit the growth of v-abl and bcr/abl transfectants, as well as the in vitro formation of bone marrow (BM)-derived colonies in the presence of growth factors in some CML patients. These studies were performed to investigate the activity of CGP57148B on the spontaneous proliferation of both fresh and cultured, leukemic and normal, BCR/ABL positive and negative cells, and to study its mechanism of action. Six cell lines derived from BCR/ABL+ leukemias (K562, BV173, KCL22, KU812, MC3, LAMA84), thirteen BCR/ABL negative lines, both neoplastic (KG1, SU-DHL-1, U937, Daudi, NB4, NB4.306) and derived from normal cells (PHA blasts, LAK, fibroblasts, LCL, renal epithelial cells, endothelial cells, CD34(+) cells), and 14 fresh leukemic samples were tested using a tritiated thymidine uptake assay. The in vivo phosphorylation of the BCR/ABL protein was evaluated by western blot, while apoptosis was detected by the annexin V/propidium binding test. The induction of differentiation was assayed by immunofluorescence using multiple antibodies. All six BCR/ABL+ lines showed a dose dependent inhibition of their spontaneous proliferative rate, which was not accompanied by differentiation. The treatment caused, within minutes, dephosphorylation of the BCR/ABL protein, followed in 16-24 hours by a decrease in cycling cells and induction of apoptosis. No significant inhibition of DNA synthesis was observed in any BCR/ABL negative normal or neoplastic line at concentrations </=3 microM, with the exception of fibroblasts and CD34 cells. Proliferation inhibition was observed also when using fresh samples obtained from two Ph+ ALL and 12 consecutive CML patients. Induction of apoptosis was observed in these samples too. The activity of CGP57148B can be monitored in ex vivo isolated or cultured cells using a simple and reproducible assay, without the need for exogenously added growth factors. This molecule possibly exerts its effects through the inhibition of the kinase activity of BCR/ABL and the subsequent initiation of apoptosis, without inducing cell differentiation. Some normal cells are also affected. These data support the use of CGP57148B in initial clinical studies; possible toxic effects on BM and fibroblast-derived cells will have to be closely monitored. The in vivo monitoring of patients will have to be focused on the induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells.","['Gambacorti-Passerini, C', 'le Coutre, P', 'Mologni, L', 'Fanelli, M', 'Bertazzoli, C', 'Marchesi, E', 'Di Nicola, M', 'Biondi, A', 'Corneo, G M', 'Belotti, D', 'Pogliani, E', 'Lydon, N B']","['Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'le Coutre P', 'Mologni L', 'Fanelli M', 'Bertazzoli C', 'Marchesi E', 'Di Nicola M', 'Biondi A', 'Corneo GM', 'Belotti D', 'Pogliani E', 'Lydon NB']","['Division of Experimental Oncology D and Medical Oncology C, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy. gambacorti@istitutotumori.mi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/classification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/28 00:00,1998/03/28 00:01,['1998/03/28 00:00'],"['1998/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(97)90155-8 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.1997.0155 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 1997 Dec;23(3):380-94. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.1997.0155.,,['Copyright 1997 The Blood Cells Foundation.'],,,,,,,,

Patients received myeloablative cytoreduction consisting of hyperfractionated total body irradiation, thiotepa, and cyclophosphamide. Those patients at risk for immune-mediated graft rejection received additional immune suppression with antithymocyte globulin and methylprednisolone in the early peritransplant period. Patients with AML who underwent allogeneic T-cell-depleted bone marrow transplantations (BMT) in first or second remission have achieved respective disease-free survival (DFS) probabilities of 77% (median follow-up at approximately 56 months) and 50% (median follow-up at approximately 48 months). Ten of 31 patients transplanted in first remission were > or = 40 years old and have attained a DFS at 4 years of 70%. For patients with AML transplanted in first or second remission, the respective cause-specific probabilities of relapse were 3.2% or 12.5%, and those of nonleukemic mortality were 19.4% or 37.5%. There were no cases of immune-mediated graft rejection and no cases of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). All survivors enjoy Karnofsky performance scores (KPS) of 100%, except 2 patients with KPS of 80% to 90%. T-cell-depleted allogeneic BMT can provide durable DFS together with an excellent performance status in the majority of patients with de novo AML. In addition, GVHD is not an obligatory correlate of the graft-versus-leukemia benefit or freedom from relapse afforded by allogeneic BMT administered as postremission therapy for AML.

We show that the specific attachment and rolling of human neutrophils and the leukemia cell lines HL-60 and U937 on immobilized, purified L-selectin under continuous shear stress is only partially inhibited by treatment with the PSGL-1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), KPL1 (41% to 53% inhibition), suggesting that L-selectin ligand activity in addition to PSGL-1 may mediate myeloid cell rolling on L-selectin. K562 cells cotransfected with cDNAs encoding alpha (1,3)fucosyltransferase-VII (FucT-VII) and PSGL-1 rolled on L-selectin. Adhesion of FucT-VII-PSGL-1 transfectants to L-selectin was completely blocked by MoAb KPL1, indicating that both L-selectin and P-selectin bind similar sites on PSGL-1. In support of existence of a non-PSGL-1 L-selectin ligand activity on leukocytes, an HL-60 membrane preparation immunodepleted of PSGL-1 supported rolling of L-selectin, but not P-selectin transfectants. Treatment of HL-60 cells with O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase inhibited attachment and rolling on L-selectin and P-selectin. However, neuraminidase treatment completely blocked HL-60 rolling on L-selectin, but not P-selectin, suggesting L-selectin and P-selectin ligand activities have different contributions of sialic acid. These findings indicate that myeloid cells express sialylated, O-linked glycoprotein ligand activity independent of PSGL-1 that supports L-selectin-mediated rolling.","['Ramos, C L', 'Smith, M J', 'Snapp, K R', 'Kansas, G S', 'Stickney, G W', 'Ley, K', 'Lawrence, M B']","['Ramos CL', 'Smith MJ', 'Snapp KR', 'Kansas GS', 'Stickney GW', 'Ley K', 'Lawrence MB']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville 22908, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Mucins)', '0 (P-selectin ligand protein)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Fucosyltransferases/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mucins/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Rheology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55366-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Feb 1;91(3):1067-75.,"['HL09578/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54136/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54614/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The t(1;19) fuses E2A to PBX1 in more than 95% of cases and this molecular abnormality can be reliably identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated amplification of E2A-PBX1 chimeric mRNAs. We used a nested PCR assay, which reproducibly detected a 10(4)- to 10(5)-fold dilution of t(1;19)+ into t(1;19)- cells, to evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) in 48 children with t(1;19)+ ALL enrolled in POG clinical trials for lower (POG 9005) and higher (POG 9006) risk ALL. Peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples were collected prospectively at the end of consolidation (weeks 25 and 31 after end of induction) and the presence or absence of PCR-detectable MRD was correlated with clinical outcome. Overall, 41 of 148 (28%) samples were PCR+. Of the 65 time points with informative results from both PB and BM, PCR results were concordant for 51 pairs (10 PB+/BM+, 41 PB-/ BM-) and discordant for 14 (5 PB+/BM-, 9 PB-/BM+), indicating that assessment of only PB or only BM can inaccurately classify some PCR+ cases as PCR-. There were no significant differences in event-free survival between PCR+ and PCR- patients. We conclude that qualitative detection of MRD by amplification of E2A-PBX1 chimeric mRNAs at the end of consolidation was not significantly predictive of outcome for children treated on POG 9005/9006 and that such results should not be used to alter therapy for patients with t(1;19)+ ALL.","['Hunger, S P', 'Fall, M Z', 'Camitta, B M', 'Carroll, A J', 'Link, M P', 'Lauer, S J', 'Mahoney, D H', 'Pullen, D J', 'Shuster, J J', 'Steuber, C P', 'Cleary, M L']","['Hunger SP', 'Fall MZ', 'Camitta BM', 'Carroll AJ', 'Link MP', 'Lauer SJ', 'Mahoney DH', 'Pullen DJ', 'Shuster JJ', 'Steuber CP', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', '*Translocation, Genetic', '*Treatment Outcome']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55361-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Feb 1;91(3):1021-8.,"['CA-09184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33603/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Inactivation of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor protein, encoded by MTS1, is thought to be the major functional consequence of these chromosomal rearrangements. The two other cell cycle inhibitors encoded by genes identified in the locus (p19ARF by MTS1 and p15INK4b by MTS2), also represent possible candidates for inactivating events. By analyzing p16INK4a expression in three cases in which an identical 36-kb deletion had deleted MTS2 and disrupted the p19ARF, but spared the p16INK4a MTS1 encoding exons, we have excluded p16INK4a and pinpointed p19ARF and/or p15INK4b as the functional target(s) of this rearrangement. Moreover, by the study of the MTS genomic configuration of 149 rearranged alleles from a large series of T-ALL cases, we have shown that p19ARF encoding exons were always disrupted or deleted, whereas p16INK4a and p15INK4b encoding exons were spared in four and 21 cases, respectively.

Analysis of breakpoints and deleted segments by fluorescence in situ.,1008-15,"Recently, we and other groups reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) a strong correlation between cytogenetic rearrangements leading to 17p deletion, a typical form of dysgranulopoiesis combining pseudo-Pelger-Huet hypolobulation and small vacuoles in neutrophils, and p53 mutation. To gain further insight into this ""17p-syndrome,"" we studied 17 cases of AML and MDS with 17p deletion by whole chromosome painting (WCP) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes spanning the 17p arm, including a p53 gene probe. Cytogenetically, 15 patients had unbalanced translocation between chromosome 17 and another chromosome (chromosome 5 in nine cases and unidentified chromosome -add 17p- in three cases), one patient had monosomy 17, and one had i(17q). All rearrangements appeared to result in 17p deletion. Sixteen patients had additional cytogenetic rearrangements. WCP analysis confirmed the cytogenetic interpretation in all cases and identified one of the cases of add 17p as a t(17;22). WCP also identified chromosome 17 material on a marker or ring chromosome in two cases of t(5;17). FISH analysis with 17p markers made in 16 cases showed no deletion of the 17p markers studied in the last two patients, who had no typical dysgranulopoiesis; p53 mutation analysis in one of them was negative. In the 14 other cases, FISH showed a 17p deletion of variable extent but that always included deletion of the p53 gene.

At 10 mumol/L, median CyA toxicity was 99% (range, 88% to > 99%). CyA was equally toxic to both a multidrug-resistant cell line, CEM-VLB100, which overexpresses gp-170 P-glycoprotein, and one resistant to topoisomerase II inhibitors, CEM-VM1-5, which has a mutation in the topoisomerase II gene. CyA was also toxic to primary leukemic cells maintained in stroma-based culture, a system that substantially prolongs in vitro cell survival. Against lymphoblasts from 21 patients with B-lineage ALL, the compound (at 5 mumol/L) reduced the leukemic cell number by a median of 87% (range, 27% to > 99%) compared with results for parallel control cultures lacking CyA. Seven of these samples were from cases with unfavorable genetic features (e.g., Philadelphia-chromosome or MLL gene rearrangements); three were obtained at relapse. Against T lymphoblasts (from six patients), the median reduction in cell number was 79% (range, 30% to > 99%). At 10 mumol/L, the cell kill exceeded 97% in all cases studied. The mechanism of CyA cytotoxicity was found to be the activation of apoptosis, which was suppressed by phorbol myristate acetate but not by inhibitors of ceramide-mediated apoptosis, phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase activity, or tyrosine kinase activity. These findings demonstrate high levels of CyA-induced toxicity against ALL cells at concentrations achievable in vivo, thus providing a strong rationale for clinical testing of this agent in patients with ALL.","['Ito, C', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Behm, F G', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Pui, C H', 'Campana, D']","['Ito C', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Behm FG', 'Raimondi SC', 'Pui CH', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', '*Apoptosis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55358-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Feb 1;91(3):1001-7.,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the partner protein Bax acts as a positive regulator of apoptosis. Based on the observation that all four of these polypeptides are expressed in a variety of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cell lines, cellular levels of these polypeptides were examined by immunoblotting in bone marrow samples harvested from 123 adult AML patients and 36 adult ALL patients before initial antileukemic therapy. Levels of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bax each varied over a more than 10-fold range in different pretreatment leukemia specimens. When the 54 AML and 23 ALL samples that contained greater than 80% malignant cells were examined in greater detail, it was observed that pretreatment levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 correlated with each other (R = .44, P < .001 for AML and R = .79, P < .0001 for ALL). In addition, a weak negative correlation between Bax expression and age was observed in AML samples (R = -0.35, P < .02) but not ALL samples. There was no relationship between pretreatment levels of these polypeptides and response to initial therapy. However, examination of 19 paired samples (the first harvested before chemotherapy and the second harvested 23 to 290 days later at the time of leukemic recurrence) revealed a greater than or equal to twofold increase in Mcl-1 levels in 10 of 19 pairs (7 of 15 AML and 3 of 4 ALL) at recurrence. In contrast, 2 of 19 pairs contained twofold less Mcl-1 at the time of recurrence. Approximately equal numbers of samples showed twofold increases and decreases in Bcl-2 (5 increases, 3 decreases) and Bcl-xL (1 increase, 4 decreases) at recurrence. Bax levels did not show a twofold decrease in any patient. these results, coupled with recent observations that cells overexpressing Mcl-1 are resistant to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, raise the possibility that some chemotherapeutic regimens might select for leukemia cells with elevated levels of this particular apoptosis inhibitor.","['Kaufmann, S H', 'Karp, J E', 'Svingen, P A', 'Krajewski, S', 'Burke, P J', 'Gore, S D', 'Reed, J C']","['Kaufmann SH', 'Karp JE', 'Svingen PA', 'Krajewski S', 'Burke PJ', 'Gore SD', 'Reed JC']","['Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55357-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Feb 1;91(3):991-1000.,"['R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This effect closely correlates with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). A specific graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect separate from GVHD has been postulated but has been difficult to show. One possible target for specific GVL activity is the bcr-abl fusion protein characteristic of CML. We have investigated the use of normal peptide-pulsed dendritic cells for the generation of cytotoxic, bcr-abl-specific T cells from normal donors. T cells (CD3+, CD8+, TCR alpha beta+, and NK receptor-negative) generated from a normal donor (HLA A24, B52, B59, Cw1) after stimulation with autologous dendritic cells, primed with a 16 mer peptide spanning the b3a2 breakpoint of bcr-abl, lysed CML cells from the peripheral blood of seven patients with CML with the b3a2 breakpoint. CML cells from four patients with only the b2a2 breakpoint were not lysed. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts derived from peripheral blood of patients with CML were not lysed, suggesting that cytotoxicity was not due to alloreactivity. Blocking experiments with anti-HLA-A,B,C indicated that cytotoxicity was dependent on recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, although cytotoxicity was not MHC-restricted because not all patients shared HLA types with the T-cell donor. Specificity for bcr-abl and absence of alloreactivity was confirmed by the presence of lytic activity against autologous and allogeneic class I HLA-A matched monocytes pulsed with the 16 mer bcr-abl fusion peptide, but not against unpulsed monocytes or monocytes pulsed with other peptides. These results show that bcr-abl-specific T cells with marked cytotoxic activity against CML cells can be generated and amplified from normal donor peripheral blood. Recognition of HLA molecules is essential for cytotoxicity but strict HLA identity is not required.","['Nieda, M', 'Nicol, A', 'Kikuchi, A', 'Kashiwase, K', 'Taylor, K', 'Suzuki, K', 'Tadokoro, K', 'Juji, T']","['Nieda M', 'Nicol A', 'Kikuchi A', 'Kashiwase K', 'Taylor K', 'Suzuki K', 'Tadokoro K', 'Juji T']","['Japanese Red Cross Central Blood Center, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55355-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Feb 1;91(3):977-83.,,,,,,,,,,

The poor cellular uptake of ODN in primary cells still is a limiting factor that may contribute to the lack of functional efficacy. Various forms of cationic lipids have been developed for efficient delivery of nucleic acids into different cell types. We examined the two cationic lipids DOTAP and DOSPER to improve uptake of ODN into primary human hematopoietic cells. Using a radiolabeled 23-mer, ODN uptake into blood-derived mononuclear cells could be increased 42- to 93-fold by DOTAP and 440- to 1,025-fold by DOSPER compared with application of ODN alone. DOTAP was also effective for delivery of ODN into leukocytes within whole blood, which may resemble more closely the in vivo conditions. As assessed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated ODN both cationic lipids enhanced cytoplasmic accumulation of ODN in endosome/lysosome-like structures with a partial shift of fluorescence to the whole cytoplasm and the nucleus following an incubation of 24 hours. ODN uptake by cationic lipids into different hematopoietic cell subsets was examined by dual-color immunofluorescence analysis with subset-specific monoclonal antibodies. We found a cell type-dependent delivery of ODN with greatest uptake in monocytes and smallest uptake in T cells. CD34+ cells, B cells, and granulocytes took up ODN at an intermediate level. Uptake of ODN into isolated CD34+ cells could be increased 100- to 240-fold using cationic lipids compared with application of ODN alone. Stimulation of CD34+ cells by interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, and stem cell factor did not significantly improve cationic lipid-mediated ODN delivery. Sequence-specific antisense effects in clonogenic assays could be shown by transfection of bcr-abl oncogene-directed antisense ODN into primary cells of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia using this established protocol. In conclusion, cationic lipids may be useful tools for delivery of antisense ODN into primary hematopoietic cells. These studies provide a basis for clinical protocols in the treatment of hematopoietic cells in patients with hematologic malignancies and viral diseases by antisense ODN.","['Kronenwett, R', 'Steidl, U', 'Kirsch, M', 'Sczakiel, G', 'Haas, R']","['Kronenwett R', 'Steidl U', 'Kirsch M', 'Sczakiel G', 'Haas R']","['Klinische Kooperationseinheit Molekulare Hamatologie/Onkologie and Forschungsschwerpunkt Angewandte Tumorvirologie, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cations', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Lipids/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55341-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Feb 1;91(3):852-62.,,,,,,,,,,

The functional significance of WT1 expression in leukemias, in addition to tissues and cell lines of hematopoietic origin, has not been determined. Using the murine myeloblastic leukemia cell line M1 as a model for macrophage differentiation, expression of WT1 is shown to be activated in M1 cells 24 hours after differentiation induction by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Upregulation of WT1 in these cells is associated with cellular differentiation, coinciding with expression of the monocyte/macrophage marker c-fms, and the appearance of mature cells. WT1 isoforms lacking the KTS insert are unable to be ectopically expressed in M1 cells. Stable expression of the WT1 isoforms containing the KTS insert leads to spontaneous differentiation of the M1 myeloblasts through the monocytic differentiation pathway. These cells express c-fms, in addition to the myeloid-specific cell surface marker Mac-1. Exposure of these cells to LIF results in the rapid onset of terminal macrophage differentiation, accompanied by apoptotic cell death.

Immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects constitute the major benefit of allogeneic BMT. Therefore, we have introduced the use of relatively nonmyeloablative conditioning before allogeneic BMT aiming for establishing host-versus-graft tolerance for engraftment of donor immunohematopoietic cells for induction of GVL effects to displace residual malignant or genetically abnormal host cells. Our preliminary data in 26 patients with standard indications for allogeneic BMT, including acute leukemia (n = 10); chronic leukemia (n = 8), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 2), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1), multiple myeloma (n = 1), and genetic diseases (n = 4) suggest that nonmyeloablative conditioning including fludarabine, anti-T-lymphocyte globulin, and low-dose busulfan (8 mg/kg) is extremely well tolerated, with no severe procedure-related toxicity. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized blood stem cell transplantation with standard dose of cyclosporin A as the sole anti-graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis resulted in stable partial (n = 9) or complete (n = 17) chimerism. In 9 patients absolute neutrophil count (ANC) did not decrease to below 0.1 x 10(9)/L whereas 2 patients never experienced ANC < 0.5 x 10(9)/L. ANC > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L was accomplished within 10 to 32 (median, 15) days. Platelet counts did not decrease to below 20 x 10(9)/L in 4 patients requiring no platelet support at all; overall platelet counts > 20 x 10(9)/L were achieved within 0 to 35 (median 12) days. Fourteen patients experienced no GVHD at all; severe GVHD (grades 3 and 4) was the single major complication and the cause of death in 4 patients, occurring after early discontinuation of cyclosporine A. Relapse was reversed by allogeneic cell therapy in 2/3 cases, currently with no residual host DNA (male) by cytogenetic analysis and polymerase chain reaction. To date, with an observation period extending over 1 year (median 8 months), 22 of 26 patients (85%) treated by allogeneic nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation are alive, and 21 (81%) are disease-free. The actuarial probability of disease-free survival at 14 months is 77.5% (95% confidence interval, 53% to 90%). Successful eradication of malignant and genetically abnormal host hematopoietic cells by allogeneic nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation represents a potential new approach for safer treatment of a large variety of clinical syndromes with an indication for allogeneic BMT. Transient mixed chimerism which may protect the host from severe acute GVHD may be successfully reversed postallogeneic BMT with graded increments of donor lymphocyte infusions, thus resulting in eradication of malignant or genetically abnormal progenitor cells of host origin.","['Slavin, S', 'Nagler, A', 'Naparstek, E', 'Kapelushnik, Y', 'Aker, M', 'Cividalli, G', 'Varadi, G', 'Kirschbaum, M', 'Ackerstein, A', 'Samuel, S', 'Amar, A', 'Brautbar, C', 'Ben-Tal, O', 'Eldor, A', 'Or, R']","['Slavin S', 'Nagler A', 'Naparstek E', 'Kapelushnik Y', 'Aker M', 'Cividalli G', 'Varadi G', 'Kirschbaum M', 'Ackerstein A', 'Samuel S', 'Amar A', 'Brautbar C', 'Ben-Tal O', 'Eldor A', 'Or R']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",1998/02/03 00:00,1998/02/03 00:01,['1998/02/03 00:00'],"['1998/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)55329-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Feb 1;91(3):756-63.,,,,,,,,,,

Implications for intrinsic antifolate resistance and directional orientation of the transporter within the plasma membrane of tumor cells.,2526-31,"The apparent Km, but not Vmax, for influx of methotrexate (MTX) mediated through the plasma membrane of S180 cells by the one-carbon, reduced folate transporter as well as the KD for binding to the transporter were 4-fold higher than in L1210 cells correlating with the greater intrinsic resistance of the former to this folate analogue. In contrast, no difference was observed between each cell type with regard to efflux of [3H]MTX mediated by this same transporter in ATP-depleted cells. The difference in influx Km in the case of this 10-methyl substituted N1O analogue of folic acid was not seen with more effective permeants, such as the unsubstituted N1O aminopterin or C1O analogues. Thus, values for influx Km for aminopterin, which were 1-1.2 microM in each cell type, increased as a result of substitution at N1O (MTX) 3-fold in L1210 cells but 12-fold in S180 cells. Nucleotide sequencing of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-generated cDNA and of polymerase chain reaction-generated genomic DNA identified a single nucleotide difference between each cell type at +890 within exon 3 of the RFC-1 gene. This was in the form of a G (L1210 cells) to A (S180 cells) transition. Codon 297, the site of this transition, encodes either Ser or Asn in L1210 or S180 cells, respectively, which is located between the seventh and eight membrane-spanning helices. This amino acid difference had no effect on the electrophoretic mobility or amount of the transporter in each cell type that was shown by Western blotting with anti-RFC-1 peptide antibodies to migrate as 46 kDa in each case. Proof that this nucleotide difference alone accounted for the alteration in influx between each cell type was obtained by S180 RFC-1 cDNA versus L1210 RFC-1 cDNA transfection of an L1210 cell variant with undetectable MTX influx and RFC-1 gene expression. In this case, the higher Km for MTX influx associated with S180 cells was duplicated only in the S180 RFC-1 transfectants. These results appear to document the first example of a nucleotide alteration within the RFC-1 gene, which influences the interaction of MTX with the encoded plasma membrane transporter. An analysis of topology, in addition to other considerations, suggests that the site of the amino acid difference found in the transporter from L1210 and S180 cells occurs within or near the binding site on the external plasma membrane surface.","['Roy, K', 'Tolner, B', 'Chiao, J H', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Roy K', 'Tolner B', 'Chiao JH', 'Sirotnak FM']","['Program in Molecular Pharmacology Memorial, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'PXJ16PPE04 (10-deazaaminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aminopterin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sarcoma 180', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/28 00:00,1998/02/28 00:01,['1998/02/28 00:00'],"['1998/02/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.5.2526 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)94927-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Jan 30;273(5):2526-31. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.5.2526.,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56517/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['GENBANK/U38180'],,

Among many possible mechanisms of drug resistance (biological, biochemical, kinetic or pharmacological), both typical and atypical multidrug-resistance (MDR) have been extensively studied. Multidrug resistance is the phenomenon whereby the development of resistance to one drug is accompanied by the simultaneous development of resistance to a variety of structurally unrelated drugs. Typical MDR seems to depend on the expression of an 170 KD protein, the P-170 or P-glycoprotein, that acts as an energy-dependent pump removing possible toxic agents, including antiblastic drugs, from the cell. High levels of the mdr1 expression have been found in normal adrenal gland, kidney, colon, jejunum and liver, whereas low levels were detected in skin, muscle, brain, nervous system and bone marrow, where CD34+ stem cells are P-170 positive. Moreover, heat shock proteins or oncogene transfection, cell differentiation or proliferation could modulate the P-glycoprotein expression: low protein levels were described in resting B lymphocytes and monoblast cells, whereas plasma cells and monocytes express higher P-170 levels. On the contrary, more differentiated myeloid cells show a low MDR1 expression. METHODS: Since normal kidney and haematopoietic cells physiologically express P-170 protein, 20 renal cell carcinomas at the surgery and many hematological patients were evaluated in this study, including acute leukemias, chronic myeloid, chronic lymphocytic leukemias and multiple myeloma. Moreover we evaluated the MDR expression in 23 non small cell lung cancers. The MDR1 gene expression was showed by RT-PCR assays, whereas the P-170 protein was detected by immunological and cytofluorometric reactions employing the C-219 and JSB1 monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of the 32 acute leukemia patients, 15 (47%) resulted P-170 positive; 14 out of the 15 positive, but 12 out of the 17 negative cases were resistant to the chemotherapy, with an higher positivity in monoblastic types; on the contrary, all lymphoblastic leukemias resulted P-170 negative and only 2 of 13 patients resulted drug resistant. A very high MDR expression was showed in chronic disorders: in the lymphocytic ones, only samples CD5/CD19 negative (3 of 42) resulted P-170 negative, confirming the basal MDR phenotype expression. In these cases, nevertheless, the protein expression was not related to the treatment response. Also in the multiple myeloma patients, no relations between clinic parameters and P-170 expression were found; however a significant relationship between treatment response and P170 expression was found. In kidney and lung cancer samples examined, a low percentage of positive samples was detected without any relationship to the evaluated clinical parameters.","['Petrini, M', 'Galimberti, S']","['Petrini M', 'Galimberti S']","['U.O.

According to these results, a new lymphocyte gating procedure was established by adding CD14(PE) and three-color measurement by CD45/CD14/CD20 staining of peripheral blood using erythrocyte lysis. The established gating procedure leads to a crucial discrimination and quantification of abnormal and normal lymphocytes per one measurement, whereas the 'leucogate' as defined by CD45/CD14 staining alone was insufficient for correct lymphocyte gate setting. In conclusion, the different staining of CD45 and CD20 in leukemic peripheral blood should be considered when fluorescence intensity or atypical peaks occurred in flow cytometric histograms suggesting for abnormal cell populations. In addition, it is possible to use this information to classify low-grade lymphomas.","['Hoffkes, H G', 'Schmidtke, G', 'Schmucker, U', 'Brittinger, G']","['Hoffkes HG', 'Schmidtke G', 'Schmucker U', 'Brittinger G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Med Res,European journal of medical research,9517857,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1996/01/19 00:00,1998/01/31 00:01,['1996/01/19 00:00'],"['1996/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/31 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Med Res. 1996 Jan 19;1(4):215-22.,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Children whose treatment for malignancy included placement of a CVL that had been removed at least 2 months previously were studied during scheduled follow-up that included contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Spiral volume acquisition was used to obtain 3-mm images from the chest apices through the right hilum, and three-dimensional reconstruction of angiograms was performed. Thrombosis/occlusion was defined as narrowing, obstruction, or filling defect of the deep venous system, with or without the formation of collateral veins. Charts were reviewed to document patient characteristics, previous CVL complications, administration of hyperalimentation, use of urokinase, and family history of venous thrombosis. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients treated for solid tumors and 2 treated for B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma were studied. Lines had been in place from 0.2 to 36 months (median, 7.4) and were removed at 2.3 to 121.8 months (median, 32.5) before study. Nine patients received hyperalimentation for periods ranging from 2 to 38 weeks (median, 12). Four patients had required urokinase instillations, and one developed superior vena cava syndrome; 4 had a CVL-related infection (two superficial and two Candida line infections). Occlusion was seen on computed tomography angiograms in 3 of the 25 patients (12%; 95% confidence interval: 4.5-31%). One of the patients with occlusion had superior vena cava syndrome; none had a family history of thrombosis, use of a double lumen CVL, or multiple instillations of urokinase. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent asymptomatic vascular occlusion does occur as a late complication of CVL placement for treatment of childhood malignancies, although the frequency appears low among patients treated primarily for solid tumors. Prospective studies of large numbers of patients with a broader spectrum of diagnoses are necessary to define the incidence of and risk factors for this complication and to assess the need for prevention with anticoagulation or other therapy. Pediatricians caring for patients with a history of cancer and CVLs should be aware that these patients may have persistent vascular occlusion that could predispose them to recurrent thrombosis or postphlebitic syndrome.","['Wilimas, J A', 'Hudson, M', 'Rao, B', 'Luo, X', 'Lott, L', 'Kaste, S C']","['Wilimas JA', 'Hudson M', 'Rao B', 'Luo X', 'Lott L', 'Kaste SC']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Catheters, Indwelling/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Embolism/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1998/01/31 00:00,1998/01/31 00:01,['1998/01/31 00:00'],"['1998/01/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1542/peds.101.2.e7 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatrics. 1998 Feb;101(2):E7. doi: 10.1542/peds.101.2.e7.,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Prolonged cell stimulation causes the translocation of 5-LO to the nuclear envelope and the synthesis of LT, with subsequent inactivation and persistent membrane association of 5-LO. In this study, we examined whether persistent membrane association of 5-LO, as well as the inactivation of 5-LO, could be prevented by shortening the length of cell stimulation or by blocking LT synthesis. As expected, stimulation of rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells, a mast cell model, or alveolar macrophages (AMs) with calcium ionophore for 15 min caused 5-LO translocation, LT generation and the inactivation and persistent membrane association of 5-LO. When RBL cells or AMs instead were stimulated for 0.5-5 min, translocation of 5-LO and synthesis of LT still occurred. However, after washing and resting, the 5-LO enzyme returned to its original intracellular distribution. Furthermore these cells showed a retained capacity for LT synthesis on subsequent re-stimulation. Similar results were obtained when cells were stimulated with either formyl peptide or zymosan, instead of ionophore. In contrast, blockade of LT synthesis during the initial stimulation, with the selective inhibitors zileuton or MK-886, did not inhibit 5-LO translocation, inactivation or persistent membrane association resulting from prolonged cell stimulation. We conclude that, in long-lived immune cells, 5-LO translocation is reversible when cell stimulation is short, but persistent after prolonged stimulation. In addition 5-LO remains active and LT synthetic capacity is retained after transient stimulation, whereas significant inactivation of 5-LO occurs after prolonged stimulation. Finally, results with LT synthesis inhibitors indicate that inactivation and persistent membrane association of 5-LO can result independently of 5-LO activation.","['Brock, T G', 'McNish, R W', 'Peters-Golden, M']","['Brock TG', 'McNish RW', 'Peters-Golden M']","['Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0652, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'V1L22WVE2S (zileuton)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hydroxyurea/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Leukotrienes/*biosynthesis', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/07 00:00,1998/03/07 00:01,['1998/03/07 00:00'],"['1998/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3290519 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1998 Feb 1;329 ( Pt 3):519-25. doi: 10.1042/bj3290519.,"['P50 HL46487/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL47391/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL07749/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC1219072,,,

A series of single amino acid substitutions were introduced into this region, and the resulting proteins were examined for their abilities to be properly processed and transported to the cell surface and to induce syncytia in cells expressing the ecotropic receptor. One substitution in the hydrophobic core and several substitutions in the glycine/threonine-rich region that prevented both cell-cell fusion and the transduction of NIH 3T3 cells when incorporated into retroviral vector particles were identified. In addition, one mutation that enhanced the fusogenicity of the resulting envelope protein was identified. The fusion-defective mutants trans dominantly interfered with the ability of the wild-type envelope protein to cause syncytium formation in a cell-cell fusion assay, although no trans-dominant inhibition of transduction was observed.

It is, however, less potent than F-MuLV cl.57 in inducing erythroleukemia upon inoculation into newborn NMRI mice. Nucleotide sequence analysis shows a high degree of homology between the two viruses. Single point mutations are scattered over both the gag and the env encoding regions. The most notable mutations are the deletion of one direct repeat and a few single point mutations occurring in the binding sites for cellular transcriptional factors in the FIS-2 long terminal repeat region (LTR). To define the genetic determinants responsible for the pathogenic properties of FIS-2, we constructed six chimeras between FIS-2 and F-MuLV cl.57. Adult mice were infected with the chimeras, and their primary antibody responses against SRBC were investigated. The results showed that the fragment encompassing the FIS-2 env encoding region SU is responsible for the increased immunosuppressive activity in adult mice. A leukemogenicity assay was also performed by infecting newborn mice with the chimeras. Consistent with the previous studies, it showed that the deletion of one direct repeat in the FIS-2 LTR is responsible for the long latent period of erythroleukemia induced by FIS-2 in newborn-inoculated mice. However, studies of cell type-specific transcriptional activities of FIS-2 and F-MuLV cl.57 LTRs using LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs showed that the deletion of one direct repeat does not reduce the transcriptional activity of the FIS-2 LTR. The activity is either comparable to or higher than the transcriptional activity of the F-MuLV cl.57 LTR in the different cell lines that we used, even in an erythroleukemia cell line. It seems that the high transcriptional strength of the FIS-2 LTR is not sufficient to give FIS-2 a high leukemogenic effect. This suggestion is inconsistent with the previous suggestion that the transcriptional strength of an LTR in a given cell type is correlated with the leukemogenic potential in the corresponding tissue. In other words, these data indicate that the direct repeats in the F-MuLV LTR may play other roles besides transcriptional enhancer in the leukemogenesis of F-MuLV.","['Dai, H Y', 'Troseth, G I', 'Gunleksrud, M', 'Bruland, T', 'Solberg, L A', 'Aarset, H', 'Kristiansen, L I', 'Dalen, A']","['Dai HY', 'Troseth GI', 'Gunleksrud M', 'Bruland T', 'Solberg LA', 'Aarset H', 'Kristiansen LI', 'Dalen A']","['Unigen Center for Molecular Biology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim. hong.dai@unigen.ntnu.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, Viral', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*virology', 'Mice', 'Point Mutation', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology']",1998/01/28 00:00,1998/01/28 00:01,['1998/01/28 00:00'],"['1998/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.2.1244-1251.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Feb;72(2):1244-51. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.2.1244-1251.1998.,,,,,,,PMC124602,,,

The previously determined homologous recombination rate in one retroviral replication cycle is 4% for markers 1.0 kb apart in spleen necrosis virus (SNV). This has often been used to suggest that approximately 30 to 40% of the replication-competent viruses with 7- to 10-kb genomes undergo recombination. These estimates were based on the untested assumption that a linear relationship exists between recombination rates and marker distances. To delineate this relationship, we constructed three sets of murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vectors containing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo) and the hygromycin phosphotransferase B gene (hygro). Each set contained one vector with a functional neo and an inactivated hygro and one vector with a functional hygro and an inactivated neo. The two inactivating mutations in the three sets of vectors were separated by 1.0, 1.9, and 7.1 kb. Recombination rates after one round of replication were 4.7, 7.4, and 8.2% with markers 1.0, 1.9, and 7.1 kb apart, respectively. Thus, the rate of homologous recombination with 1.0 kb of marker distance is similar in MLV and SNV. The recombination rate increases when the marker distance increases from 1.0 to 1.9 kb; however, the recombination rates with marker distances of 1.9 and 7.1 kb are not significantly different. These data refute the previous assumption that recombination is proportional to marker distance and define the maximum recombining population in retroviruses.","['Anderson, J A', 'Bowman, E H', 'Hu, W S']","['Anderson JA', 'Bowman EH', 'Hu WS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown 26506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['*Genome, Viral', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1998/01/28 00:00,1998/01/28 00:01,['1998/01/28 00:00'],"['1998/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.2.1195-1202.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Feb;72(2):1195-202. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.2.1195-1202.1998.,['CA-58345/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC124596,,,

HTLV-1 transforms lymphocytes, and there is increasing evidence that the virus-encoded protein, Tax, plays a primary role in viral transformation. We have shown that wild-type p53 in HTLV-1-transformed cells is stabilized. This study was initiated to directly analyze whether the p53 in HTLV-1-transformed cell lines was transcriptionally active and to identify the viral gene product responsible for stabilization and inactivation. Transfection experiments using a p53-responsive reporter plasmid and gamma-irradiation studies demonstrate that the wild-type p53 in HTLV-1-transformed cell lines is not fully active. Further, we demonstrate that the HTLV-1-transforming protein, Tax, stabilizes and inactivates p53 function. Cotransfection of Tax with p53 results in a greater than 10-fold reduction in p53 transcription activity. Using Ga14-p53 fusion proteins, we demonstrate that Tax inhibition of p53 transactivation function is independent of sequence-specific DNA binding. Moreover, Tax inhibits p53 function by interfering with the activity of the N-terminal activation domain (amino acids 1 to 52). We conclude that Tax is involved in the inactivation of p53 function and stabilization of p53 in HTLV-1-infected cells. The functional interference of p53 function by Tax may be important for transformation and leukemogenesis.","['Pise-Masison, C A', 'Choi, K S', 'Radonovich, M', 'Dittmer, J', 'Kim, S J', 'Brady, J N']","['Pise-Masison CA', 'Choi KS', 'Radonovich M', 'Dittmer J', 'Kim SJ', 'Brady JN']","['Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",1998/01/28 00:00,1998/01/28 00:01,['1998/01/28 00:00'],"['1998/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.2.1165-1170.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Feb;72(2):1165-70. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.2.1165-1170.1998.,,,,,,,PMC124592,,,

The generated prepackaging cell lines constitutively express the gag-pol genes and contain an inducible transcriptional unit for the VSV-G gene. From this unit, the introduced Cre recombinase excised both a neomycin resistance (Neo(r)) gene and a poly(A) signal flanked by a tandem pair of loxP sequences and induced transcription of the VSV-G gene from the same promoter as had been used for Neo(r) expression. By inserting an mRNA-destabilizing signal into the 3' untranslated region of the Neo(r) gene to reduce the amount of Neo(r) transcript, we were able efficiently to select the clones capable of inducing VSV-G at high levels. Without the introduction of Cre recombinase, these cell lines produce neither VSV-G nor any detectable infectious virus at all, even after the transduction of a murine leukemia virus-based retrovirus vector encoding beta-galactosidase. They reproducibly produced high-titer virus stocks of VSV-G-pseudotyped retrovirus (1.0 x 10(6) infectious units/ml) from 3 days after the introduction of Cre recombinase. We also present evidence that VSV-G-producing cells are still fully susceptible to transduction by VSV-G pseudotypes. However, in this vector-producing system, which regulates VSV-G pseudotype production in an all-or-none manner, the integration of vector DNA into packaging cell lines would be minimized. We further show that heparin significantly inhibits retransduction of VSV-G pseudotypes in the culture fluids of packaging cell lines, leading to a two- to fourfold increase in the yield of the pseudotypes after induction. This vector-producing system was very stable and should be advantageous in human gene therapy.","['Arai, T', 'Matsumoto, K', 'Saitoh, K', 'Ui, M', 'Ito, T', 'Murakami, M', 'Kanegae, Y', 'Saito, I', 'Cosset, F L', 'Takeuchi, Y', 'Iba, H']","['Arai T', 'Matsumoto K', 'Saitoh K', 'Ui M', 'Ito T', 'Murakami M', 'Kanegae Y', 'Saito I', 'Cosset FL', 'Takeuchi Y', 'Iba H']","['Department of Gene Regulation, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Integrases/*genetics', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', '*Viral Proteins']",1998/01/28 00:00,1998/01/28 00:01,['1998/01/28 00:00'],"['1998/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.2.1115-1121.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Feb;72(2):1115-21. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.2.1115-1121.1998.,,,,,,,PMC124585,,,

The LTR of FeLV-945 is unusual in that it contains only a single copy of the transcriptional enhancer followed 25 bp downstream by a 21-bp sequence in triplicate in tandem. Infectivity of MoFe2-MuLV was demonstrated in vitro in SC-1 cells and in vivo in neonatal NIH-Swiss mice. Tumors occurred in MoFe2-MuLV-infected animals following a latency period of 4 to 10 months (average, 6 months). The results of Southern blot analysis of the T-cell receptor beta locus demonstrated that all tumors were lymphomas of T-cell origin. MoFe2-MuLV LTRs were amplified by PCR from tumor DNA and were characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis. LTRs from the tumors that occurred with relatively shorter latency predominantly retained the original MoFe2-MuLV sequence intact and unaltered. Tumors that occurred with relatively longer latency contained LTRs that also retained the 21-bp sequence triplication characteristic of the original virus but had acquired various duplications of enhancer sequences. The repeated identification of enhancer duplications in late-appearing tumors suggests that the duplication affords a selective advantage, although apparently not in the efficient induction of T-cell lymphoma. Proto-oncogenes known to be targets of insertional mutagenesis in the majority of Mo-MuLV-induced tumors or in feline non-T-cell, non-B-cell lymphomas were shown not to be rearranged in any tumor examined. Mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) proviral DNA was readily detectable in some, but not all, tumors. The presence or absence of MCF did not correlate with the kinetics of tumor induction. These studies indicate that the single-enhancer, triplication-containing FeLV LTR, typical of non-T-cell, non-B-cell lymphomas in cats, is competent in the induction of T-cell lymphoma in mice. The findings suggest that the mechanism of MoFe2-MuLV-mediated lymphomagenesis may differ from that of Mo-MuLV-mediated disease, considering the possible involvement of novel oncogenes and the variable presence of MCF recombinants.","['Starkey, C R', 'Lobelle-Rich, P A', 'Granger, S W', 'Brightman, B K', 'Fan, H', 'Levy, L S']","['Starkey CR', 'Lobelle-Rich PA', 'Granger SW', 'Brightman BK', 'Fan H', 'Levy LS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*virology', 'Mice', 'Reassortant Viruses/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Virulence/genetics']",1998/01/28 00:00,1998/01/28 00:01,['1998/01/28 00:00'],"['1998/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.2.1078-1084.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Feb;72(2):1078-84. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.2.1078-1084.1998.,"['R01 CA032455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC124580,,"['J Virol. 2007 Jun;81(11):6158.

PML was shown to interfere with VSV mRNA and protein synthesis. Compared to the IFN mediator MxA protein, PML had less powerful antiviral activity.

However, the current vectors are still not fully optimized for gene expression and viral titer, and many genetic and biochemical features of MLV-based vectors are poorly understood. We have previously reported that the retroviral vector MFG, where the gene of interest is expressed as a spliced mRNA, is superior in the level of gene expression with respect to other vectors compared in the study. As one approach to developing improved retroviral vectors, we have systematically performed mutational analysis of the MFG retroviral vector. We demonstrated that the entire gag coding sequence, together with the immediate upstream region, could be deleted without significantly affecting viral packaging or gene expression. To our knowledge, this region is included in all currently available retroviral vectors. In addition, almost the entire U3 region could be replaced with the heterologous human cytomegalovirus immediately-early promoter without deleterious effects. We could also insert internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and multicloning sites into MFG without adverse effects. Based on these observations, we have constructed a series of new, improved retroviral constructs. These vectors produced viral titers comparable to MFG, expressed high levels of gene expression, and stably transferred genes to the target cells. Our vectors are more convenient to use because of the presence of multicloning sites and IRESs, and they are also more versatile because they can be readily converted to various applications. Our results have general implications regarding the design and development of improved retroviral vectors for gene therapy.","['Kim, S H', 'Yu, S S', 'Park, J S', 'Robbins, P D', 'An, C S', 'Kim, S']","['Kim SH', 'Yu SS', 'Park JS', 'Robbins PD', 'An CS', 'Kim S']","['Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics, and Department of Biology, Seoul National University, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1998/01/28 00:00,1998/01/28 00:01,['1998/01/28 00:00'],"['1998/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.2.994-1004.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Feb;72(2):994-1004. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.2.994-1004.1998.,"['P01 DK044935/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK44935/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC124570,,,

In an attempt to understand how the virus causes Epo independence, we have been studying signal transduction pathways activated by Epo to determine if SFFV exerts its biological effects by constitutively activating any of these pathways in the absence of Epo. We previously demonstrated that Stat proteins, the downstream components of the Epo-induced Jak-Stat pathway, are constitutively activated in SFFV-infected cells. In this study, we demonstrate that SFFV also activates Raf-1, MEK and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, the downstream components of the Raf-1/MAP kinase pathway. This pathway was activated in cells infected with the polycythemia-inducing strain of SFFV, which induces both proliferation and differentiation of erythroid cells in the absence of Epo, as well as in cells infected with the anemia-inducing strain of the virus, which still require Epo for differentiation. Inhibition of Raf-1 by using antisense oligonucleotides led to a partial inhibition of the Epo-independent proliferation of SFFV-infected cells. Expression of the transcription factors c-Jun and JunB, but not c-Fos, was induced in SFFV-infected cells in the absence of Epo, suggesting that constitutive activation of the Raf-1/MAP kinase pathway by the virus may result in deregulation of AP-1 activity. We conclude from our studies that infection of erythroid cells with SFFV leads to the constitutive activation of signal transduction molecules in both the Jak-Stat and Raf-1/MAP kinase pathways and that both of these pathways must be activated to achieve maximum proliferation and differentiation of erythroid cells in the absence of Epo.","['Muszynski, K W', 'Ohashi, T', 'Hanson, C', 'Ruscetti, S K']","['Muszynski KW', 'Ohashi T', 'Hanson C', 'Ruscetti SK']","['Intramural Research Support Program, SAIC Frederick, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)'],IM,"['Anemia/virology', 'Animals', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polycythemia/virology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', '*Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*metabolism']",1998/01/28 00:00,1998/01/28 00:01,['1998/01/28 00:00'],"['1998/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.2.919-925.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Feb;72(2):919-25. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.2.919-925.1998.,,,,,,,PMC124561,,,

Overexpression of Fli-1 inhibits the retinoic acid-induced activation of genes carrying a functional retinoic acid response element (RARE). Conversely, RAR alpha is able to repress Fli-1-mediated transcriptional activation. Transfection analysis of RAR alpha and Fli-1 mutants in cultured cells demonstrate that the DNA binding domain of RAR alpha and the N-terminal region of Fli-1 are required for repression. Gel retardation analysis demonstrates that RAR alpha cannot bind to the Fli-1 binding site in the E74 promoter and the expression of Fli-1 does not affect RAR alpha binding to DNA. Furthermore, the data suggest an indirect interaction between Fli-1 and RAR alpha mediated by a 'bridging' factor(s) present in nuclear extracts from RM10 erythroleukemia cells. Fli-1 also interferes with the action of receptors for thyroid or glucocorticoid hormone in several hematopoietic cell lines.

After intravenous (i.v.) injection ALL-PO spread systemically involving the hematopoietic organs and the central nervous system (CNS) of all mice. The homing and the progression of the disease are evaluated by histological analysis and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of the t(4;11) translocation in the bone marrow, spleen and CNS of SCID mice at different times after engraftment. Occult leukemia was detectable by PCR in the bone marrow of SCID mice as early as three days after the i.v. injection of leukemic cells whereas the first signs of involvement of the spleen and CNS appeared after 14 days; after 24 days all the mice were euthanized because they were moribund and the bone marrow, spleen and CNS showed ample infiltration by leukemic cells. The sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy was tested in this model. ALL-PO in SCID mice did not respond to treatment with vincristine or idarubicin but cyclophosphamide (150 mg kg(-1) i.v., single injection) significantly increased the survival of the mice. The efficacy of such a treatment was more evident when cyclophosphamide was given in the early stages of the disease (detectable only by molecular analysis) but much less effective when the drug was administered when the disease could be detected by conventional histological analysis. The biological behavior and molecular characteristics of ALL-PO make it a good model for studying novel therapeutic strategies for a better control of minimal residual disease.","['Gobbi, A', 'Di Berardino, C', 'Scanziani, E', 'Garofalo, A', 'Rivolta, A', 'Fontana, G', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Giavazzi, R', 'Biondi, A']","['Gobbi A', 'Di Berardino C', 'Scanziani E', 'Garofalo A', 'Rivolta A', 'Fontana G', 'Rambaldi A', 'Giavazzi R', 'Biondi A']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/01/28 00:00,1998/01/28 00:01,['1998/01/28 00:00'],"['1998/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00092-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Nov-Dec;21(11-12):1107-14. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00092-1.,,,,,,,,,,

Although SCF acts synergistically with a variety of cytokines, the mechanism of growth factor-cooperation remains to be determined. To analyze the synergism between SCF and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), we established a new megakaryoblastic cell line, HML-2, by culture in the presence of both SCF and GM-CSF. While SCF alone or GM-CSF alone supported modest cell growth, SCF and GM-CSF together induced substantial growth of this cell line. SCF alone tyrosine-phosphorylated several bands including the 145 kDa subunit of c-kit. GM-CSF alone did not cause the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 145 kDa subunit, but markedly up-regulated the expression of the 145 kDa subunit of c-kit. The combination of SCF and GM-CSF resulted in a synergistic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the 145 kDa subunit of c-kit. Several proliferation inhibitors which removed the two-factor interaction on the growth of the HML-2 cells down-regulated the 145 kDa subunit of c-kit. Thus, a synergistic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the 145 kDa subunit of c-kit may be one possible mechanism underlying the cooperation of SCF and GM-CSF on the HML-2 cell growth.","['Kamijo, T', 'Koike, K', 'Takeuchi, K', 'Higuchi, T', 'Sawai, N', 'Kikuchi, T', 'Tsumura, H', 'Akiyama, H', 'Koike, T', 'Ishii, E', 'Komiyama, A']","['Kamijo T', 'Koike K', 'Takeuchi K', 'Higuchi T', 'Sawai N', 'Kikuchi T', 'Tsumura H', 'Akiyama H', 'Koike T', 'Ishii E', 'Komiyama A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1998/01/28 00:00,1998/01/28 00:01,['1998/01/28 00:00'],"['1998/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00086-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Nov-Dec;21(11-12):1097-106. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00086-6.,,,,,,,,,,

Up to 250 nmol peroxides and 6 nmol malondialdehyde were formed per mg LDL protein within 30 h of oxidation. This oxidized LDL is effectively taken up by AML cells of the FAB type M3 and M5 indicating the presence of scavenger receptors on these cells.

Respectively, DUNATIS and SILVANUS display an early pre-B cell and a pre-B cell phenotype. Spontaneous DNA replication of both cell lines was strongly inhibited by IL-4. This effect was directly mediated by IL-4 and exerted through the CD124 IL-4 receptor chain. Notably, IL-4 was associated with rapid cell death and reduction of cellularity in DUNATIS, whereas these parameters were considerably less pronounced and only observed after longer-term exposure of the SILVANUS cells to IL-4. In addition to these differences, although both cell lines expressed FES oncoprotein, a 100 kDa protein associated with FES was strikingly found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-4 exclusively in DUNATIS cells.

Of these, 345 (72%) had normal karyotypes and 135 (28%) had clonal chromosome abnormalities: trisomy 12 (+12) was found in 40 cases, 20 as +12 alone (+12single), 20 as +12 with additional abnormalities (+12complex). Other frequent findings included abnormalities of 14q, chromosome 17, 13q and 6q. The immunophenotype was typical for CLL in 358 patients (CD5+, Slg(weak), mainly FMC7-) and atypical for CLL in 122 patients (25%) (CD5-, or Slg(strong) or FMC7+). Chromosome abnormalities were found significantly more often in patients with atypical (48%) than in patients with typical CLL phenotype (22%) (P < 0.00005). Also +12complex, 14q+, del6q, and abnormalities of chromosome 17 were significantly more frequent in patients with atypical CLL phenotype, whereas +12single was found equally often in patients with typical and atypical CLL phenotype. The cytomorphology of most of the +12 patients was that of classical CLL irrespective of phenotype. In univariate survival analysis the following cytogenetic findings were significantly correlated to a poor prognosis: chromosome 17 abnormalities, 14q+, an abnormal karyotype, +12complex, more than one cytogenetic event, and the relative number of abnormal mitoses. In multivariate survival analysis chromosome 17 abnormalities were the only cytogenetic findings with independent prognostic value irrespective of immunophenotype. We conclude that in patients with typical CLL immunophenotype, chromosome abnormalities are somewhat less frequent at the time of diagnosis than hitherto believed. +12single is compatible with classical CLL, and has no prognostic influence whereas chromosome 17 abnormalities signify a poor prognosis. In patients with an atypical CLL immunophenotype, chromosome abnormalities including +12complex, 14q+, del 6q and chromosome 17 are found in about 50% of the patients, and in particular chromosome 17 abnormalities suggest a poor prognosis.","['Geisler, C H', 'Philip, P', 'Christensen, B E', 'Hou-Jensen, K', 'Pedersen, N T', 'Jensen, O M', 'Thorling, K', 'Andersen, E', 'Birgens, H S', 'Drivsholm, A', 'Ellegaard, J', 'Larsen, J K', 'Plesner, T', 'Brown, P', 'Andersen, P K', 'Hansen, M M']","['Geisler CH', 'Philip P', 'Christensen BE', 'Hou-Jensen K', 'Pedersen NT', 'Jensen OM', 'Thorling K', 'Andersen E', 'Birgens HS', 'Drivsholm A', 'Ellegaard J', 'Larsen JK', 'Plesner T', 'Brown P', 'Andersen PK', 'Hansen MM']","['Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Trisomy']",1998/01/28 00:00,1998/01/28 00:01,['1998/01/28 00:00'],"['1998/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00095-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1997 Nov-Dec;21(11-12):1011-23. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(97)00095-7.,,,,,,,,,,

This report presents quantitative comparisons between betaIVS-II mutants at physiological levels of expression from within a natural chromatin context in vivo which further defines it's function. In marked contrast to a beta-globin gene lacking a second intron, two mutants defective in splicing (small size or a splice donor mutation), still undergo essentially normal levels of 3'-end formation and in the absence of exon skipping. Therefore, 3' cleavage of beta-globin transcripts requires the presence of betaIVS-II sequences, but not the splicing reaction. The placement of betaIVS-II in the IVS-I position did not reduce the efficiency of 3' cleavage indicating that the distance between the necessary element(s) in this intron and the polyadenylation recognition site is not a crucial factor. Subsequent placement of betaIVS-I in the intron II position, reduced the efficiency of 3'-end formation to only 16% of normal. A direct replacement of intron II by the heterologous introns betaIVS-I or alpha-globin IVS-II, only partially substitute (16 and 30% respectively) for betaIVS-II. Hybrid introns show that efficient 3'-end formation is strongly enhanced by the presence of the terminal 60 nt of betaIVS-II. These data imply that the last intervening sequence of multiple intron containing genes is a principal determinant of the efficiency of 3'-end formation and may act as a post-transcriptional regulatory step in gene expression.","['Antoniou, M', 'Geraghty, F', 'Hurst, J', 'Grosveld, F']","['Antoniou M', 'Geraghty F', 'Hurst J', 'Grosveld F']","[""Department of Experimental Pathology, UMDS, Guy's Hospital, London Bridge, London SE1 9RT, UK. m.antoniou@umds.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Point Mutation', 'RNA Splicing/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/03/14 00:00,1998/03/14 00:01,['1998/03/14 00:00'],"['1998/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['gkb166 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/26.3.721 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Feb 1;26(3):721-9. doi: 10.1093/nar/26.3.721.,,,,,,,PMC147328,,,

Thus, this protein does confer a multidrug resistant phenotype to cancer cells, similar to P-glycoprotein (Pgp). The substrate specificity of both transporter proteins is partly overlapping but is otherwise very distinct; because MRP is a multiple organic anion transporter, it transports certain glutathione conjugates and may be partly dependent on intracellular glutathione levels for the transport of anthracyclines. We have studied the transport kinetics of a series of anthracyclines in MRP and Pgp that overexpress tumor cell lines to obtain information on the substrate specificity of these proteins. The anthracyclines have modifications in the sugar moiety. The mean active efflux coefficient Ka, used to characterize the efficiency of the active efflux, was very similar for DNR and one of its 4'-deoxy-derivatives (eso-DNR) for MRP and Pgp [10-20 x 10(-10)/sec/(cells/ml)]. The permanently neutral derivatives 3'-deamino-3'-hydroxy-doxorubicin (OH-DOX) and 3'-deamino-3'-hydroxy-daunorubicin (OH-DNR) were effluxed by both proteins but had a lower Ka [2 x 10(-10) and 6 x 10(-10)/sec/(cells/ml) (OH-DOX)] and 2 x 10(-10) and 5 x 10(-10)/sec/(cells/ml) (OH-DNR)] for MRP and Pgp. Two anthracyclines, the doxorubicin derivative pirarubicin and 2'-bromo-4'-epi-DNR seemed to have a slightly higher Ka value for Pgp than for MRP. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (K(m)) and maximal efflux rates (VM) for the active transport were within a narrow range for both transporters, except for OH-DOX and OH-DNR, which had a lower VM in the case of MRP-mediated transport, suggesting a role of the amino group in the interaction with glutathione. Determination of the Hill coefficient (nH) of the MRP-mediated efflux gave most values close to 2, which suggests cooperativity of the transport of anthracyclines as reported before for Pgp. In conclusion, the transport kinetics of anthracyclines by MRP and Pgp are very similar.","['Marbeuf-Gueye, C', 'Broxterman, H J', 'Dubru, F', 'Priebe, W', 'Garnier-Suillerot, A']","['Marbeuf-Gueye C', 'Broxterman HJ', 'Dubru F', 'Priebe W', 'Garnier-Suillerot A']","['Laboratoire de Physicochimie Biomoleculaire et Cellulaire (URA Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2056), Universite Paris Nord, Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins']",1998/01/28 00:00,1998/01/28 00:01,['1998/01/28 00:00'],"['1998/01/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.53.1.141 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1998 Jan;53(1):141-7. doi: 10.1124/mol.53.1.141.,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the increased therapeutic efficacy of acylfulvene analogs, we compared them with the illudin compounds in terms of their in vitro cytotoxicity, cellular accumulation and DNA incorporation. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of various acylfulvene analogs was tested in vitro against a variety of tumor cell lines. Radiolabelled acylfulvene analog was prepared and used for cellular accumulation and DNA incorporation studies. RESULTS: The prototype acylfulvene analog retained selective histiospecific toxicity towards myeloid leukemia and various carcinoma cell lines. In vitro killing of tumor cells by acylfulvene required up to a 30-fold increase in molecules per cell, as compared with illudin S, indicating that acylfulvene was less toxic on a cellular level. At equitoxic concentrations, acylfulvene incorporation into genomic tumor cell DNA was equivalent to illudin S suggesting that cellular metabolism has a role in acylfulvene cytotoxicity. Analysis of cellular accumulation of acylfulvene into tumor cells revealed a markedly higher Vmax for tumor cells, and a lower Vd for diffusion accumulation into other cells. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of higher Vmax and lower Vd may explain the increased in vivo efficacy of acylfulvene.","['Kelner, M J', 'McMorris, T C', 'Montoya, M A', 'Estes, L', 'Uglik, S F', 'Rutherford, M', 'Samson, K M', 'Bagnell, R D', 'Taetle, R']","['Kelner MJ', 'McMorris TC', 'Montoya MA', 'Estes L', 'Uglik SF', 'Rutherford M', 'Samson KM', 'Bagnell RD', 'Taetle R']","['Department of Pathology, UCSD Medical Center, San Diego, CA 92103, USA. mkelner@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Polycyclic Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '0 (acylfulvene)', 'EWJ0GY2H7X (illudin S)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Polycyclic Sesquiterpenes', 'Sesquiterpenes/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Spiro Compounds/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism']",1998/01/27 00:00,1998/01/27 00:01,['1998/01/27 00:00'],"['1998/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050734 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1998;41(3):237-42. doi: 10.1007/s002800050734.,,,,,,,,,,

Their mechanism of action remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a series of APC on three human leukemic cell lines: K-562, HL-60, and U-937. The tetrazolium dye-reduction (MTT) assay and cell counting were used to determine the cytotoxicity of the APC used. DNA gel electrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection of oligonucleosomes were performed to identify and quantify DNA fragmentation. Electron and phase-contrast microscopy were used to detect morphologic changes specific for programmed cell death. HL-60 and U-937 cells were found to be sensitive, but K-562 cells were relatively resistant to APC exposure. APC with long alkyl chains exerted stronger cytotoxicity than did those with short alkyl chains. DNA fragmentation was found after treatment with APC in HL-60 and U-937 cells but not in K-562 cells. In HL-60 cells the increase in mono- and oligonucleosome formation as measured by ELISA was correlated with the length of the alkyl chains at 14 h of exposure to APC but plateaued at 20 h. The morphologic alterations in HL-60 and U-937 cell lines, such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and formation of apoptotic bodies, confirmed the induction of apoptosis after APC exposure. It is concluded that programmed cell death plays an important role in the cytotoxicity of APC against certain human leukemic cell lines. The antineoplastic profiles of APC with long alkyl chains render them attractive for further therapeutic application.","['Konstantinov, S M', 'Eibl, H', 'Berger, M R']","['Konstantinov SM', 'Eibl H', 'Berger MR']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Sofia, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1998/01/27 00:00,1998/01/27 00:01,['1998/01/27 00:00'],"['1998/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050730 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1998;41(3):210-6. doi: 10.1007/s002800050730.,,,,,,,,,,

It is currently being investigated for efficacy in the treatment and prevention of various types of cancer. One of the factors limiting its use is the observed increase in ATRA clearance and elimination which occurs shortly after treatment is started, leading to reduced levels of drug in the body and loss of effectiveness. ATRA efficacy may be enhanced if this autoinduction of metabolism can be overcome, for example through the inhibition of the activity of the induced specific metabolizing enzyme(s). This requires the identification of this induced enzyme(s) and development of approaches to selectively inhibit its activity. METHODS: In the course of a phase II evaluation of ATRA in prostate cancer, we investigated the activities of five specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) (CYPs 1A2, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) and N-acetyltransferase enzymes using a newly developed five-drug cocktail involving caffeine, mephenytoin, debrisoquine, chlorzoxazone and dapsone respectively. Enzyme activities were assessed in 17 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer before the initiation of ATRA therapy, after 14 days of continuous ATRA administration and 7 days after cessation of drug therapy. RESULTS: After 14 days of ATRA therapy, the activities of CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone hydroxylase) and N-acetyltransferase (in fast acetylators only) were increased by 83% and 29% (P < 0.05), respectively. Both activities returned to baseline by 7 days after cessation of therapy and the profiles were similar to the changes seen in the clearance of ATRA itself. There were no changes in the activities of any of the other enzymes investigated. CONCLUSION: This study shows that ATRA selectively modulates the activities of specific metabolizing enzymes and that this approach may be useful in identifying enzymes that can be explored in an attempt to mitigate ATRA autoinduction through selective modulation of enzyme activities. Further investigations are required to determine whether the elevated enzymes are also responsible for the increased clearance and elimination of ATRA.","['Adedoyin, A', 'Stiff, D D', 'Smith, D C', 'Romkes, M', 'Bahnson, R C', 'Day, R', 'Hofacker, J', 'Branch, R A', 'Trump, D L']","['Adedoyin A', 'Stiff DD', 'Smith DC', 'Romkes M', 'Bahnson RC', 'Day R', 'Hofacker J', 'Branch RA', 'Trump DL']","['Center for Clinical Pharmacology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/blood/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Phenotype', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1998/01/27 00:00,1998/01/27 00:01,['1998/01/27 00:00'],"['1998/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050719 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1998;41(2):133-9. doi: 10.1007/s002800050719.,"['CA59834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-000818-01/FD/FDA HHS/United States', 'P30CA47904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Oryzalin inhibited vasopressin, bradykinin and platelet-derived growth factor [Ca2+]i signalling in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with IC50 values of 14, 16 and 18 microM, respectively. 45Ca2+ uptake into nonmitochondrial stores of saponin-permeabilized Swiss 3T3 cells was inhibited by oryzalin with an IC50 of 34 microM. Oryzalin inhibited colony formation of HT-29 colon carcinoma cells with an IC50 of 8 microM and inhibited the growth of a number of other cancer cell lines and primary human tumors in vitro with IC50 values in the range 3 to 22 microM. A number of oryzalin analogues were studied and an association was found between the ability to inhibit [Ca2+]i signalling and inhibition of the growth of HT-29 human colon cancer cells (P = 0.001) and of CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells (P = 0.016). Oryzalin at doses up to 600 mg/kg administered orally or subcutaneously daily to mice for 3 to 10 days beginning a day after tumor inoculation inhibited the growth of murine B16 melanoma by 63% but showed no appreciable activity when administered subcutaneously or intraperitoneally to mice beginning a number of days after tumor inoculation against a variety of human tumor xenografts. The peak plasma concentration of oryzalin following repeated subcutaneous administration of oryzalin at 600 mg/kg per day to mice was 37 microM and of its major metabolite N-depropyl oryzalin was 53 microM. CONCLUSION: It is unlikely that the absence of significant antitumor activity of oryzalin is a result of the inability to achieve adequate plasma concentrations.","['Powis, G', 'Gallegos, A', 'Abraham, R T', 'Ashendel, C L', 'Zalkow, L H', 'Dorr, R', 'Dvorakova, K', 'Salmon, S', 'Harrison, S', 'Worzalla, J']","['Powis G', 'Gallegos A', 'Abraham RT', 'Ashendel CL', 'Zalkow LH', 'Dorr R', 'Dvorakova K', 'Salmon S', 'Harrison S', 'Worzalla J']","['Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724-5024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Dinitrobenzenes)', '0 (Herbicides)', '0 (Sulfanilamides)', '662E385DWH (oryzalin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*drug effects', 'Carcinosarcoma/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colonic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Dinitrobenzenes/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Herbicides/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', '*Sulfanilamides']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/01/27 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050703 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1997;41(1):22-8. doi: 10.1007/s002800050703.,"['CA17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42286/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA52995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

BCL-X expression was detected in several human myeloma cell lines, as well as in CD38-sorted bone marrow cells obtained from some patients. Only the antiapoptotic long form of BCL-X (BCL-X-L), was detected. Because BCL-X-L expression can protect tumor cells from apoptotic death induced by chemotherapeutic agents, we tested the clinical relevance of expression in 55 archival bone marrow biopsies. The biopsies were stained by immunohistochemistry, and BCL-X expression was correlated with the subsequent response to treatment. BCL-X expression in malignant plasma cells strongly correlated with decreased response rates in patient groups treated with either melphalan and prednisone or vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone. Response rates were 83-87% in non-BCL-X-expressing cases and 20-31% in BCL-X-expressing cases. In addition, BCL-X expression was more frequent in specimens taken from patients at relapse (77%), when compared to those at initial diagnosis (29%). Further support for the association of drug resistance with BCL-X-L expression came from studies of the 8226 dox-40 cell line. This line, which expresses p-glycoprotein and serves as a model of multidrug resistance in multiple myeloma cells, demonstrated an up-regulated expression of BCL-X-L, which was relatively specific, in that BCL-2 or BAX expression was not altered. In addition, dox-40 cells demonstrated a generalized resistance to apoptosis that was induced by several different agents. These results indicate that malignant plasma cells can express BCL-X-L and that such expression may be a marker of chemoresistant disease.","['Tu, Y', 'Renner, S', 'Xu, F', 'Fleishman, A', 'Taylor, J', 'Weisz, J', 'Vescio, R', 'Rettig, M', 'Berenson, J', 'Krajewski, S', 'Reed, J C', 'Lichtenstein, A']","['Tu Y', 'Renner S', 'Xu F', 'Fleishman A', 'Taylor J', 'Weisz J', 'Vescio R', 'Rettig M', 'Berenson J', 'Krajewski S', 'Reed JC', 'Lichtenstein A']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Affairs West Los Angeles Hospital and University of California at Los Angeles Medical School, 90073, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloma Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloma Proteins/*metabolism', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-X Protein']",1998/01/27 00:00,1998/01/27 00:01,['1998/01/27 00:00'],"['1998/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Jan 15;58(2):256-62.,['CA-60181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

(1995): Nucleic Acids Res 23:4907-4912]. Using TIEG specific polyclonal antibody and immunoprecipitation methods in normal human fetal osteoblast cells (hFOB cells), we have now demonstrated that TIEG encodes a 72-kDa protein whose levels are transiently increased at as early as 2 h of TGF-beta treatment. Polarized confocal microscopic analysis of hFOB cells shows a nuclear localized TIEG protein in untreated cells under the conditions described under Methods. Interestingly, the levels of TIEG protein in the nuclei increase when the cells are treated with TGF-beta 1 for 2 h. In contrast, similar analyses of untreated human keratinocytes show a cytoplasmic localized TIEG protein that appears to be translocated to the nucleus after H2O2 treatment. Additional immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that TIEG protein is expressed in epithelial cells of the placenta, breast, and pancreas, as well as in osteoblast cells of bone and selected other cells of the bone marrow and cerebellum with some cells showing a cytoplasmic localization and others a nuclear localization. All cells of the kidney display negative staining for this protein. Interestingly, a stage specific expression of TIEG protein is found in a dozen breast cancer biopsies, using immunohistochemistry. The cells in normal breast epithelium displays a high expression of TIEG protein, those in the in situ carcinoma display less than one-half of the levels, and those in the invasive carcinoma show a complete absence of the TIEG protein. TIEG has been localized to chromosome 8q22.2 locus, the same locus as the genes involved in osteopetrosis and acute myeloid leukemia and close to the c-myc gene locus and a locus of high polymorphism in cancer biopsies. The correlation between the levels of TIEG protein and the stage of breast cancer, its prime location in human chromosome 8q22.2, and past studies with pancreatic carcinoma, suggests that TIEG may play a role in tumor suppressor gene activities, apoptosis, or some other regulatory function of cell cycle regulation.","['Subramaniam, M', 'Hefferan, T E', 'Tau, K', 'Peus, D', 'Pittelkow, M', 'Jalal, S', 'Riggs, B L', 'Roche, P', 'Spelsberg, T C']","['Subramaniam M', 'Hefferan TE', 'Tau K', 'Peus D', 'Pittelkow M', 'Jalal S', 'Riggs BL', 'Roche P', 'Spelsberg TC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Early Growth Response Transcription Factors)', '0 (KLF10 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Early Growth Response Transcription Factors', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, Immediate-Early/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Osteoblasts/chemistry/cytology/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1998/01/27 05:24,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/01/27 05:24'],"['1998/01/27 05:24 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/01/27 05:24 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19980201)68:2<226::AID-JCB9>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1998 Feb 1;68(2):226-36.,"['AR43627/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK07352/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

All mutations were found in introns and were previously unreported. Immunocytochemical studies revealed accumulation of TP53 in blood cells of samples both from chronic phase and blast crisis patients. Since these samples had no TP53 mutations, we believe that wild type TP53 accumulates in blood cells of CML patients. Our results, therefore, indicate that molecular changes in coding regions of the TP53 gene are rare. The significance of the abundance of intronic changes should be investigated further.

The mutagenic and carcinogenic nature of these compounds have been related to their potential of being reactive to genetic material and production of reactive oxygen species. Here we have analyzed the action of aziridinyl steroid on calf thymus DNA and human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 under in vitro conditions. Calf thymus DNA when treated with various doses of aziridinyl steroid induced a high degree of stand separation and sensitivity/susceptibility to S1 nuclease hydrolysis. The treatment also induced an increasing number of strand breaks per molecule of DNA as determined by alkaline unwinding assay. Relatively higher doses of steroid, however, displayed a reduced susceptibility to S1 nuclease hydrolysis and did not increase the number of strand breaks in DNA. Moreover, the high dose treatments result increased melting temperature and an enhanced rate of reanealing after thermal denaturation, indicating that interstrand crosslinks are induced at higher doses of steroid treatment. Moreover, steroid treatment caused cell death in human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and induced DNA degradation, characteristic of apoptosis. The test steroid has the ability to produce reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) as determined by chemical methods. Incorporation of oxygen radical scavengers into the system blocked the damaging effect of steroid in calf thymus DNA and HL-60 cells. These observations strongly suggest that aziridinyl steroid, a pharmaceutical, damages mammalian DNA and induces apoptosis by the production of ROI in the test system.","['Quadri, S A', 'Islam, S', 'Qadri, A N', 'Ahmad, M']","['Quadri SA', 'Islam S', 'Qadri AN', 'Ahmad M']","['Department of Environmental Health, Boston University Medical Center, MA 02118, USA. qshafat@bu.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Mol Biol Int,Biochemistry and molecular biology international,9306673,"['0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Cholestanols)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '118517-20-7 (3-acetoxycholestanol(5,6-b)(N-phthalimido)aziridine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.1.30.1 (Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aziridines/*toxicity', 'Cattle', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Cholestanols/*toxicity', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases/metabolism']",1998/01/27 00:00,1998/01/27 00:01,['1998/01/27 00:00'],"['1998/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15216549700205171 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1997 Dec;43(6):1353-65. doi: 10.1080/15216549700205171.,,,,,,,,,,

Originally described as an autoantigenic target in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, they are now also known to play a role in development of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and possibly other forms of neoplasia. Size, number and composition of NDs are regulated throughout the cell cycle. Infection with herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr-virus, influenza virus and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV I) strongly modifies ND structure through viral regulatory proteins. Due to this finding and because at least three of the cellular ND proteins are highly interferon-inducible, a function of NDs in early viral infection or in antiviral response has been postulated. Functional data are currently available only for two of the ND-associated proteins. The Sp100 protein seems to have transcriptional transactivating property, whereas the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) was reported to suppress growth and transformation. Here, we give a brief overview of the data currently available on NDs.

When the cells are stimulated with LPS a second time then little TNF is produced, i.e. the cells are tolerant. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrates that this tolerance is not due to a downregulation of the CD14 cell surface receptor. Analysis of proteins binding to the -516 NF-kappa B motif of the murine TNF promoter reveals that constitutive p50p50 and LPS stimulation lead to mobilization of a heterodimer consisting of p65/c-rel. In tolerant cells less of the p65/c-rel heterodimer is mobilized but there is a strong upregulation of p50p50.

The special features of this stage of development in all living beings is therefore an increased sensitivity for the exposure with ionizing radiation. Radiation exposure during the prenatal development can therefore lead to various impairments, which can be short-termed or long-termed, showing effects even in the postnatal period. The pattern of radiation induced effects is dependent upon the radiation dose on the one hand and upon the stage of fetal development when radiation exposure occurs on the other hand. Radiation induced effects can be growth retardation, malformations, functional impairments or death as well as increased occurrence of cancer and leukemia during childhood. The main effects of a radiation exposure in the fetal period are: 1) lethal effects for the embryo, 2) malformations and changes in growth or other functional changes, 3) mental retardation, 4) induction of malignomas including leukemia. Lethal effects can be induced experimentally in animals by relatively low radiation doses of 10 cGy, administered before or immediately after the implantation of the embryo. Malformations can be induced if the exposure occurs during the period of organogenesis especially if the radiation exposure occurs during the active stage of increased cell formation and cell differentiation of a specific organ. For many types of effects of ionizing radiation especially for the death of the embryo or fetus and for macroscopic anatomical malformation a dose-effect relationship with certain threshold doses can be supposed. This threshold dose is not smaller than 5 cGy if the exposure results from a low level radiation with low LET> Radiation exposure at the end of the organogenesis and during the following fetal period can induce growth retardation and functional disturbances, which are characterized by abnormalities in the postnatal period. Of special importance are the abnormalities of the CNS, like mental retardation particularly if the radiation exposure occurred during the interval between the 8th and 15th week of pregnancy. During that time period cell formation for the development of the frontal brain occurs. The induction of this type of abnormalities as well as of other malformations is due to non stochastic effects. A threshold dose of 5 cGy ist discussed. The induction of malignancies and leukemia as a consequence of a radiation exposure in the prenatal period is to be seen as a deterministic (non stochastic) radiation effect. The sensitivity of the fetus for these effects ist 2 to 3 times higher than that of adults.","['Ogris, E']",['Ogris E'],"['Abteilung fur Nuklearmedizinische Diagnostik und Therapie, Donauspitals der Stadt Wien.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Austria,Acta Med Austriaca,Acta medica Austriaca,7501997,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Abnormalities, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*radiation effects', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/01/24 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Austriaca. 1997;24(4):150-3.,,,10,Exposition mit radioaktivem Jod in der Schwangerschaft: Bedeutung fur Mutter und Kind.,,,,,,

The immunophenotype list mode files were exhaustively evaluated by combined lymphocyte, monocyte, and granulocyte (LMG) analysis. The results were introduced into databases and automatically classified in a standardized way. The resulting triple matrix classifiers are laboratory and instrument independent, error tolerant, and robust in the classification of unknown test samples. Practically 100% correct individual patient classification was achievable, and most manually unclassifiable patients were unambiguously classified. It is of interest that the single lambda/CD19/5 antibody triplet provided practically the same information as the full set of the five antibody triplets. This demonstrates that standardized classification can be used to optimize immunophenotype panels. On-line classification of test samples is accessible on the Internet: http://www.biochem.mpg.de/valet/leukaem1.html Immunophenotype panels are usually devised for the detection of the frequency of abnormal cell populations. As shown by computer classification, most the highly discriminant information is, however, not contained in percentage frequency values of cell populations, but rather in total antibody binding, antibody binding ratios, and relative antibody surface density parameters of various lymphocyte, monocyte, and granulocyte cell populations.","['Valet, G K', 'Hoffkes, H G']","['Valet GK', 'Hoffkes HG']","['Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany. valet@biochem.mpg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis/immunology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Databases, Factual', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/diagnosis/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*classification/diagnosis/immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology']",1998/01/24 05:06,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/01/24 05:06'],"['1998/01/24 05:06 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/01/24 05:06 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19971215)30:6<275::AID-CYTO3>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19971215)30:6<275::aid-cyto3>3.0.co;2-f [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1997 Dec 15;30(6):275-88. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19971215)30:6<275::aid-cyto3>3.0.co;2-f.,,,,,,,,,,

MP (LDMTX/IVMP) for prevention of relapse in children with lower-risk B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven hundred nine patients were entered onto the study. Vincristine, prednisone, and asparaginase were used for remission induction. Patients were randomized to receive intensification with either IVMTX 1,000 mg/m2 plus IVMP 1,000 mg/m2 (regimen A) or LDMTX 30 mg/m2 every 6 hours for six doses with IVMP 1,000 mg/m2 (regimen B). Twelve courses were administered at 2-week intervals. Triple intrathecal therapy (TIT) was used for CNS prophylaxis. Continuation therapy included standard oral MP, weekly MTX, and TIT every 12 weeks for 2 years. RESULTS: Six hundred ninety-nine (99%) patients achieved remission. Three hundred forty-nine were assigned to regimen A and 350 to regimen B. The estimated 4-year continuous complete remission (CCR) rate for patients treated with regimen A is 80.3% (SE = 2.9%) and with regimen B is 75.9% (SE = 3.1%). By log-rank analysis, regimen A demonstrated superior CCR (P = .013). Transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, bacterial sepsis, neurotoxicity, stomatitis, and hospitalizations were more frequent among patients treated on regimen A. CONCLUSION: Intensification with IVMTX/IVMP is more effective than LDMTX/IVMP for prevention of relapse in children with B-precursor ALL at lower risk for relapse.","['Mahoney, D H Jr', 'Shuster, J', 'Nitschke, R', 'Lauer, S J', 'Winick, N', 'Steuber, C P', 'Camitta, B']","['Mahoney DH Jr', 'Shuster J', 'Nitschke R', 'Lauer SJ', 'Winick N', 'Steuber CP', 'Camitta B']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, USA. dmahoney@msmail.his.Tch.Tmc.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antidotes)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antidotes/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Sex Factors', 'Treatment Failure']",1998/01/24 05:06,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/01/24 05:06'],"['1998/01/24 05:06 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/01/24 05:06 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.1.246 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jan;16(1):246-54. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.1.246.,"['CA-03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-11233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jun;16(6):2283-5.

We report a dose escalation study of 131I-MIBG to define dose-limiting toxicity without and with autologous bone marrow support. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with relapsed neuroblastoma were treated in groups of six with escalating doses of 3 to 18 mCi/kg of 131I-MIBG. After rapid escalation in the first three patients treated at 3 to 6 mCi/kg, treatment was escalated in 3-mCi/kg increments from 9 to 18 mCi/kg. Autologous tumor-free bone marrow was cryopreserved in all patients receiving 12 mCi/kg and more. Toxicity and response were assessed. RESULTS: Eighty percent of patients who received 12 mC/kg or more experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia and/or neutropenia. Dose-limiting hematologic toxicity was reached at 15 mCi/kg, at which level two of five assessable patients required bone marrow reinfusion for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 200/microL for more than 2 weeks, and four of nine at the 18-mCi/kg level. Prolonged thrombocytopenia was common, with failure to become platelet-transfusion independent in nine patients. One patient with extensive prior treatment developed secondary leukemia and three became hypothyroid. Responses were seen in 37% of patients, with one complete response (CR), 10 partial response (PR), three mixed response, 10 stable disease, and six progressive disease. The minimum dose of 131I-MIBG for 10 of the 11 responders was 12 mCi/kg. CONCLUSION: Treatment with 131I-MIBG has mainly hematologic toxicity, which can be abrogated with bone marrow rescue. The high response rate in refractory disease suggests that this agent may be useful in combination with myeloablative chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell rescue to improve outcome in advanced neuroblastoma.","['Matthay, K K', 'DeSantes, K', 'Hasegawa, B', 'Huberty, J', 'Hattner, R S', 'Ablin, A', 'Reynolds, C P', 'Seeger, R C', 'Weinberg, V K', 'Price, D']","['Matthay KK', 'DeSantes K', 'Hasegawa B', 'Huberty J', 'Hattner RS', 'Ablin A', 'Reynolds CP', 'Seeger RC', 'Weinberg VK', 'Price D']","['Department of Pediatrics and the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, USA. katekm@itsa.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '35MRW7B4AD (3-Iodobenzylguanidine)']",IM,"['3-Iodobenzylguanidine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/therapy', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1998/01/24 00:00,1998/01/24 00:01,['1998/01/24 00:00'],"['1998/01/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.1.229 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jan;16(1):229-36. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.1.229.,"['2MO1 RR01271/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-000250/FD/FDA HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group.,78-85,"PURPOSE: We conducted a multicenter study of differentiation therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) followed by intensive chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and analyzed the prognostic factors for predicting complete remission (CR), event-free survival (EFS), and disease-free survival (DFS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients received ATRA until CR. If patients had an initial leukocyte count greater than 3.0 x 10(9)/L, they received daunorubicin (DNR) and behenoyl cytarabine (BHAC). During therapy, if patients showed blast and promyelocyte counts greater than 1.0 x 10(9)/L, they received additional DNR and BHAC. After achieving CR, patients received three courses of consolidation and six courses of maintenance/intensification chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of 198 registered, 196 were assessable (age range, 15 to 86 years; median, 46) and 173 (88%) achieved CR. Multivariate analysis showed that no or minor purpura at diagnosis (P = .0046) and age less than 30 years (P = .0076) were favorable factors for achievement of CR. Predicted 4-year overall survival and EFS rates were 74% and 54%, respectively, and the 4-year predicted DFS rate for 173 CR patients was 62%. Multivariate analysis showed that age less than 30 years (P = .0003) and initial leukocyte count less than 10 x 10(9)/L (P = .0296) were prognostic factors for longer EFS, and initial leukocyte count less than 10.0 x 10(9)/L was a sole significant prognostic factor for longer DFS (P = .0001). CONCLUSION: Our results show that age, hemorrhagic diathesis, and initial leukocyte count are prognostic factors for APL treated with ATRA followed by intensive chemotherapy.","['Asou, N', 'Adachi, K', 'Tamura, J', 'Kanamaru, A', 'Kageyama, S', 'Hiraoka, A', 'Omoto, E', 'Akiyama, H', 'Tsubaki, K', 'Saito, K', 'Kuriyama, K', 'Oh, H', 'Kitano, K', 'Miyawaki, S', 'Takeyama, K', 'Yamada, O', 'Nishikawa, K', 'Takahashi, M', 'Matsuda, S', 'Ohtake, S', 'Suzushima, H', 'Emi, N', 'Ohno, R']","['Asou N', 'Adachi K', 'Tamura J', 'Kanamaru A', 'Kageyama S', 'Hiraoka A', 'Omoto E', 'Akiyama H', 'Tsubaki K', 'Saito K', 'Kuriyama K', 'Oh H', 'Kitano K', 'Miyawaki S', 'Takeyama K', 'Yamada O', 'Nishikawa K', 'Takahashi M', 'Matsuda S', 'Ohtake S', 'Suzushima H', 'Emi N', 'Ohno R']","['Kumamoto University Hospital, Japan. ktcnasou@kaiju.medic.kumamoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1998/01/24 00:00,1998/01/24 00:01,['1998/01/24 00:00'],"['1998/01/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.1.78 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jan;16(1):78-85. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.1.78.,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bryostatin 1 was delivered by 72-hour continuous infusion every 2 weeks to patients with relapsed NHL or CLL, at doses that ranged from 12 microg/m2 to 180 microg/m2 per course. Correlative investigations included evaluations of total protein kinase C (PKC) in peripheral blood and lymphoid differentiation in patient tumor tissue. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were treated, including three patients with CLL and 26 with NHL. Generalized myalgia was the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and occurred in two of three patients treated with bryostatin 1 at 180 microg/m2 per course. Myalgias were dose-related and cumulative, and often started in the thighs and calves, improved with activity, were somewhat responsive to analgesics, and often took weeks to resolve once taken off study. Six patients were treated at the MTD of 120 microg/m2 per course. Myalgia, headache, and fatigue were common. Hematologic toxicity was uncommon. Total cumulative doses of bryostatin 1 up to 1,134 microg/m2 have been administered without untoward toxicity. Eleven patients achieved stable disease for 2 to 19 months. An in vitro assay for total PKC evaluation in patient peripheral-blood samples demonstrated activation within the first 2 hours with subsequent downregulation by 24 hours, which was maintained throughout the duration of the 72-hour infusion. CONCLUSION: This phase I study defined the MTD and recommended phase II dose of bryostatin 1, when administered over 72 hours every 2 weeks, to be 120 microg/m2 (40 microg/m2/d for 3 days). Generalized myalgia was the DLT. Future studies will define the precise activity of bryostatin 1 in subsets of patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies and its efficacy in combination with other agents.","['Varterasian, M L', 'Mohammad, R M', 'Eilender, D S', 'Hulburd, K', 'Rodriguez, D H', 'Pemberton, P A', 'Pluda, J M', 'Dan, M D', 'Pettit, G R', 'Chen, B D', 'Al-Katib, A M']","['Varterasian ML', 'Mohammad RM', 'Eilender DS', 'Hulburd K', 'Rodriguez DH', 'Pemberton PA', 'Pluda JM', 'Dan MD', 'Pettit GR', 'Chen BD', 'Al-Katib AM']","['Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA. varterasian@oncgate.roc.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bryostatins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Macrolides', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscular Diseases/chemically induced', 'Pain/chemically induced', 'Recurrence']",1998/01/24 00:00,1998/01/24 00:01,['1998/01/24 00:00'],"['1998/01/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.1.56 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jan;16(1):56-62. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.1.56.,"['CA 22453-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA62487-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 737 patients with previously untreated stages III2A, IIIB, IVA, or IVB Hodgkin's disease and patients in first relapse after radiotherapy were prospectively randomized to sequential MOPP-ABV or MOPP/ABV hybrid. Of 691 eligible patients, 344 received the sequential regimen and 347 received the hybrid. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 95%, with complete responses (CRs) in 79%: 83% on the MOPP/ABV hybrid and 75% on the sequential MOPP-ABVD arm (P = .02). With a median follow-up time of 7.3 years, the 8-year failure-free survival (FFS) rates were 64% for MOPP/ABV hybrid and 54% far sequential MOPP-ABVD (P = .01; 0.69 relative risk of failure, comparing MOPP/ABV hybrid v MOPP-ABVD). The 8-year overall survival rate was significantly better for the MOPP/ABV hybrid (79%) as compared with sequential MOPP-ABVD (71%) (P = .02; relative risk, 0.65). MOPP/ABV hybrid had significantly more life-threatening or fatal neutropenia and pulmonary toxicity than the sequential MOPP-ABVD arm, which was associated with significantly greater thrombocytopenia. Nine cases of acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplasia were reported on the sequential regimen as compared with only one on the hybrid (P = .01). CONCLUSION: MOPP/ABV hybrid chemotherapy was significantly more effective than sequential MOPP-ABVD. FFS and overall survival were significantly improved on the hybrid arm, which was also associated with a lower incidence of acute leukemia or myelodysplasia.","['Glick, J H', 'Young, M L', 'Harrington, D', 'Schilsky, R L', 'Beck, T', 'Neiman, R', 'Fisher, R I', 'Peterson, B A', 'Oken, M M']","['Glick JH', 'Young ML', 'Harrington D', 'Schilsky RL', 'Beck T', 'Neiman R', 'Fisher RI', 'Peterson BA', 'Oken MM']","['University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center, Philadelphia 19104-4283, USA. glickjh@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1998/01/24 00:00,1998/01/24 00:01,['1998/01/24 00:00'],"['1998/01/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.1.19 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jan;16(1):19-26. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.1.19.,"['CA15488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jun;16(6):2283.

We conducted a prospective analysis on 49 patients with CML in chronic phase treated with IFN-A in order to identify the effect of therapy on different lymphocyte subpopulations as determined by flow cytometric quantification and whether this effect is associated with the response to IFN-A. The absolute number of lymphocytes was similar in all patients regardless of response to IFN-A. In patients achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCGR) there was a rebound of the absolute count of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocytes after discontinuation of therapy with IFN-A. Patients with resistant disease, as well as patients with hematologic response but no cytogenetic response, showed a lower absolute number of CD19+ cells than patients with any cytogenetic response. Patients who achieved a CCGR had a higher absolute number of CD56+ cells than patients with lesser response or no response to IFN-A, and this persisted after discontinuation of therapy. We conclude that an increase in absolute number of CD19+ and CD56+ lymphocytes is observed in CML patients achieving a CCGR with IFN-A compared to patients with lesser responses.

In the present study, we studied the regulatory mechanism of the expression of NET-mRNA in cultured neurons from newborn rat superior cervical ganglia (SCG) and in clonal rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) SCG neurons in culture expressed a high level of NET-mRNA, which was further increased 2.5-5 fold from day 1 to day 13. Treatment of SCG neurons with the cholinergic differentiation factor (CDF)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), neurokines known to induce the switch from adrenergic to cholinergic phenotype in SCG neurons, led to the suppression of the level of NET-mRNA in a concentration dependent manner, concomitantly with the suppression of mRNA for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), an adrenergic marker enzyme in cultured SCG neurons. On the other hand, retinoic acid, a compound which is also known to increase the expression of choline acetyltransferase, a cholinergic marker enzyme, and suppress the expression of TH in the cultured SCG neurons and PCI2 cells, rather increased the level of NET-mRNA in these two cell populations. Alterations of the Na(+)-dependent norepinephrine transport activity which paralleled the changes in the NET-mRNA levels were confirmed by the [3H]norepinephrine uptake assay. These results indicate that cell extrinsic factors regulate the expressions of NET and TH genes by a common as well as by distinct mechanisms.","['Matsuoka, I', 'Kumagai, M', 'Kurihara, K']","['Matsuoka I', 'Kumagai M', 'Kurihara K']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan. matsuoka@pharm.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Norepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Slc6a2 protein, rat)', '0 (Symporters)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Neurons/chemistry/cytology/*physiology', 'Norepinephrine/*genetics/pharmacokinetics', 'Norepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins', 'PC12 Cells', 'Presynaptic Terminals/chemistry/enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology', '*Symporters', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/genetics']",1998/01/24 00:00,1998/01/24 00:01,['1998/01/24 00:00'],"['1998/01/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-8993(97)01016-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-8993(97)01016-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 1997 Nov 21;776(1-2):181-8. doi: 10.1016/s0006-8993(97)01016-0.,,,,,,,,,,

It was recently reported that after lesion of sciatic nerve, mRNA for cholinergic differentiation factor (CDF)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is induced in nonneuronal cells in the nerve. However, the source of LIF-mRNA and the mechanism of LIF-mRNA regulation have remained largely unknown. In the present study, we searched for factors regulating the LIF-mRNA expression in cultured Schwann cells isolated from newborn rat sciatic nerve. Among various growth factors and cytokines tested, TGF beta-1 exerted the most prominent effect on the induction of LIF-mRNA in the cultured Schwann cells. The effect of TGF-beta 1 on the increase of LIF-mRNA levels was suppressed by either staurosporine or H-7 suggesting the role of PKC or PKC-like protein kinase activity in the induction of LIF-mRNA. The induction of LIF mRNA by TGF-beta 1 was suppressed in the co-culture of the Schwann cells with embryonic rat DRG neurons. The addition of ascorbic acid, which is known to promote myelination in this co-culture system, further suppressed the TGF-beta 1 induction of LIF-mRNA. These results suggest that Schwann cells respond to TGF-beta 1 in a lesion situation to produce LIF, which supports neuronal survival and regeneration. The re-establishment of neuron-Schwann cell interaction would in turn suppress the LIF production to terminate its action during the lesion situation.","['Matsuoka, I', 'Nakane, A', 'Kurihara, K']","['Matsuoka I', 'Nakane A', 'Kurihara K']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan. matsuoka@pharm.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Axons/physiology', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Nerve Regeneration/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Neurons/cytology/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Schwann Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Sciatic Nerve/cytology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology']",1998/01/24 00:00,1998/01/24 00:01,['1998/01/24 00:00'],"['1998/01/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-8993(97)01015-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-8993(97)01015-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 1997 Nov 21;776(1-2):170-80. doi: 10.1016/s0006-8993(97)01015-9.,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies by sequence analysis of the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (VH) have shown that CD5+ B-cell malignancies such as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells represent pre-germinal center (pre-GC) stage B cells in contrast with the post-GC stage of most DLBLs, which show somatic hypermutations in VH genes. In the present study, we investigated the VH sequence of de novo CD5+ DLBL to clarify whether CD5+ DLBL represents the pre-GC stage, as do other CD5+ B-cell malignancies, or the post-GC stage, as is typical of DLBL. All eight cases (four CD5+ DLBL and four CD5-negative (CD5-) DLBL) examined by us showed somatic hypermutations in the VH segment and two of the CD5- DLBL cases showed intra-clonal diversity, suggesting that CD5+ DLBLs were derived from the same maturation stage as CD5- DLBL, but were distinct from the other indolent CD5+ B-cell lymphomas of B-CLL and MCL. These data suggest that de novo CD5+ DLBLs do not merely lie within a continuous spectrum with B-CLL and MCL, but represent a biologically distinct variant within the diagnostic framework of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","['Kume, M', 'Suzuki, R', 'Yatabe, Y', 'Kagami, Y', 'Miura, I', 'Miura, A B', 'Morishima, Y', 'Nakamura, S', 'Seto, M']","['Kume M', 'Suzuki R', 'Yatabe Y', 'Kagami Y', 'Miura I', 'Miura AB', 'Morishima Y', 'Nakamura S', 'Seto M']","['Laboratory of Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'CD5 Antigens/*analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1998/01/24 00:00,1998/01/24 00:01,['1998/01/24 00:00'],"['1998/01/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505097801007 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1997.tb00333.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1997 Nov;88(11):1087-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1997.tb00333.x.,,,,,,,PMC5921312,,,

Overexpression of multidrug resistance gene and decreased activity of topoisomerase II alpha are suggested as two important mechanisms for this resistance. METHODS: We used immunohistochemical method to determine the expressions of both topoisomerase II alpha (topo II alpha) and p-glycoprotein (gp-170) in bone marrow biopsy specimens from 68 cases of acute leukemia. Patients were divided into four groups: (1) leukemia cells with high score for topo II alpha and negative for gp-170; (2) leukemia cells with high score for topo II alpha and positive for gp-170; (3) leukemia cells with low score for topo II alpha and negative for gp-170; and (4) leukemia cells with low score for topo II alpha and positive for gp-170. The clinical responses were then followed as routine, and the clinical correlation was evaluated by analysis of variance and Pearson Chi-Square test. RESULTS: The measure of the single parameter (either topo II alpha or gp-170 alone) did not show a significant difference in the overall survival. However, the complete response rate was much higher in the first group patients whose bone marrow reading score was high in topo II alpha and negative for gp-170 expression. Survival duration increased with the increase in the complete response rate. CONCLUSIONS: Combined parameters of topo II alpha and gp-170 are more useful than any individual parameter for the prognosis of acute leukemia.","['Chiu, C F', 'Chow, K C', 'Lin, F M', 'Lin, C K', 'Liu, S M', 'Chen, K Y']","['Chiu CF', 'Chow KC', 'Lin FM', 'Lin CK', 'Liu SM', 'Chen KY']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei),Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed,0005327,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate']",1998/01/24 00:00,1998/01/24 00:01,['1998/01/24 00:00'],"['1998/01/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei). 1997 Oct;60(4):184-90.,,,,,,,,,,

TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis seems to be mediated by a signaling pathway termed 'sphingomyelin-ceramide' pathway, which consists of the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and the production of its breakdown product ceramide. Our study shows that KG1a cells, which are inherently resistant to TNF-alpha and do not produce ceramide upon cytokine stimulation, can be sensitized by the use of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor PSC833. Coincubation with 1 microM of this cyclosporin derivative restored the apoptotic potential of 10 ng/ml TNF-alpha. This effect was associated with the restoration of ceramide generation (315%) and activation of neutral, but not acid sphingomyelinase activity (143%). Furthermore, we demonstrate that treatment of KG1a cells with 1 microM PSC833 led to a threefold increase in inner plasma membrane sphingomyelin content and basal neutral sphingomyelinase activity. These results support the hypothesis whereby resistance to TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis of certain leukemic cells is linked to the disposability of the sphingomyelin pool. These data also suggest a role for P-glycoprotein in sphingomyelin transverse plasma membrane asymmetry.","['Bezombes, C', 'Maestre, N', 'Laurent, G', 'Levade, T', 'Bettaieb, A', 'Jaffrezou, J P']","['Bezombes C', 'Maestre N', 'Laurent G', 'Levade T', 'Bettaieb A', 'Jaffrezou JP']","['CJF INSERM 9503, Centre Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1998/01/23 00:00,1998/01/23 00:01,['1998/01/23 00:00'],"['1998/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fasebj.12.1.101 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 1998 Jan;12(1):101-9. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.12.1.101.,,,,,,,,,,

A decrease of natural anticoagulants, in particular protein C (PC), has been assumed to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. We determined PC and antithrombin III (AT III) levels in two patients undergoing BMT and subsequent liver transplantation due to VOD. Additionally, in one of the patients protein S (PS) levels were also measured. Normal baseline (day-8) PC levels (86 and 89%) were markedly reduced in both patients at the time of VOD manifestation on day 20 and 40, respectively (26 and 31%). PS levels lay within the normal range from day-8 (before myeloablative chemotherapy) until one week after clinical onset of VOD when substitution therapy with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was initiated. AT III levels decreased moderately during the second and third posttransplant week, but were normal in the patient with a late clinical manifestation of VOD. In both patients PC and PS levels lay within the normal range after liver transplantation which was performed on day 41 and 79, respectively. AT III was substituted several times. Both patients died due to infectious complications on day 141 and 101, respectively. The data confirm previous reports that a decrease of PC is observed in BMT recipients and can be associated with hepatic vein occlusion. Whereas the relevance of AT III is uncertain, PS does not seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of VOD. Liver transplantation lead to normalization of PC levels, but its significance remains to be discussed in terms of ethical justifiability, medical feasibility and costs.","['Salat, C', 'Holler, E', 'Gohring, P', 'Poley, S', 'Kolb, H J', 'Pihusch, R', 'Reinhardt, B', 'Kramling, H J', 'Haller, M', 'Hiller, E']","['Salat C', 'Holler E', 'Gohring P', 'Poley S', 'Kolb HJ', 'Pihusch R', 'Reinhardt B', 'Kramling HJ', 'Haller M', 'Hiller E']","['Med.

Instead of the macro CK, the high level of CK-BB was detected in electrophoresis. In the medical examination, especially in screening tests, the CK-MB was generally assayed with use of the immunoinhibition method in automated analyzers. The method principle was based on the absence of CK-BB in the patient serum.

The PBMC, IgM positive cells accounted for 77.8% +/- 6.8, while both CD5 and BLV-gp51 were detected simultaneously on 52.0% +/- 2.4 of the IgM+ cells, while the CD5 marker and BLV-gp51 antigen were detected independently on 35.0% +/- 1.9 and in 9.0% +/- 3.1, respectively of the IgM+ cells. Of the CD5+ cells (equivalent to 75.5% +/- 9.0 of the PBMC), 54.7% +/- 4.7 expressed simultaneously IgM and BLV-gp51, while BLV-gp51 and IgM were expressed separately by 3.0% +/- 0.5 and 37.8% +/- 3.3, respectively. An association between the B-cell phenotype and BLV tropism might exist. It is also possible that cells bearing both IgM and CD5 markers are the main target cells for BLV infection.","['Meirom, R', 'Moss, S', 'Brenner, J']","['Meirom R', 'Moss S', 'Brenner J']","['Division of Virology, Kimron Veterinary Institute, Bet-Dagan, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Biomarkers', 'CD5 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology']",1998/01/23 00:00,1998/01/23 00:01,['1998/01/23 00:00'],"['1998/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(97)00056-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2427(97)00056-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1997 Oct 6;59(1-2):113-9. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2427(97)00056-1.,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier studies have shown that metabolic oxidation to reactive 1,4-quinone or/and 5,8-diiminequinone intermediates may be an important mechanism of activation of this agent, pertinent to its cytotoxic action in vivo. Here we report that in the presence of nitrite ions (NO2-), MXH2 undergoes oxidation by the mammalian enzyme lactoperoxidase (LPO) and hydrogen peroxide and that the process proceeds at a rate that is proportional to NO2- concentration. In contrast, when MXH2 was exposed to LPO/H2O2 in the absence of nitrite, oxidation of the drug was either completely absent or markedly inhibited. These experiments were carried out using concentrated solutions of MXH2 (approximately 100 microM) at near neutral pH where dimers of the drug predominate. We propose that oxidation of MXH2 is mediated by an LPO/ H2O2 metabolite of NO2-, most likely the .NO2 radical. Because in mitoxantrone therapy the drug is administered intravenously, it is directly exposed to nitrogen oxides and other free radicals produced by blood components. It is therefore possible that the ability of mitoxantrone to react with the nitrogen dioxide radical may be relevant to the biological action of the drug in vivo.","['Reszka, K J', 'Matuszak, Z', 'Chignell, C F']","['Reszka KJ', 'Matuszak Z', 'Chignell CF']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology and Chemistry, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences/NIH, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA. reszka@niehs.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Nitrates)', '8M4L3H2ZVZ (sodium nitrate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Lactoperoxidase)', 'S7G510RUBH (Nitrogen Dioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Free Radicals', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactoperoxidase/*metabolism', 'Mitoxantrone/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nitrates/administration & dosage', 'Nitrogen Dioxide/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",1998/01/23 00:00,1998/01/23 00:01,['1998/01/23 00:00'],"['1998/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/tx970039q [doi]', 'tx970039q [pii]']",ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 1997 Dec;10(12):1325-30. doi: 10.1021/tx970039q.,,,,,,,,,,

In cell-attached, outside-out and whole-cell experiments two types of voltage-insensitive Na-permeable channels were identified with different selectivities for monovalent cations, referred to as channels of high (HS) and low (LS) selectivity. The unitary conductance was similar for both channel types being 12 pS (145 mmol/l Na, 23 degrees C). The relative permeability PNa/PK estimated from the extrapolated reversal potential values were 10 and 3 for HS and LS channels, respectively. Both HS and LS channels were found to be impermeable to bivalent cations (Ca2+ or Ba2+). The activity of HS and LS channels displayed a tendency to increase with depolarization. Both channel types were not blocked by tetrodotoxin and were insensitive to amiloride in the concentration range of up to 100 mumol/l. At higher concentrations (0.1-2 mmol/l), amiloride reversibly inhibited HS channels only. The results obtained lead us to conclude that, under physiological conditions, both types of Na-permeable channels may provide sodium influx in leukemic cells.

A synergistic activity was observed when IFN was combined with chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo. These observations led to a series of randomized trials comparing chemotherapy alone with the combination of IFN and chemotherapy which yielded controversial results. Ludwig et al have analyzed presently available data of randomized trials in a systematic overview. In 16 trials, 2286 patients were randomized either for induction therapy with chemotherapy or IFN combined with chemotherapy. The IFN dose ranged between 4.8 and 18.7 MU/week. The overall response rate was 45.9% for patients treated with chemotherapy alone compared to 54.4% for patients treated with IFN alpha and chemotherapy. The gain of relapse-free survival was 6 months and the gain of overall survival was 5 months for IFN-treated patients. Advances in treatment were due to the expense of more severe side-effects in IFN-treated patients expressed by hematological side-effects, fever, nausea and neurological as well as psychological alterations. IFN maintenance therapy was evaluated from eight trials comprising 929 patients randomized for IFN-treatment or 'wait and see'. IFN maintenance treatment prolonged the average relapse-free survival by 7 months and prolonged the average overall survival by 5 months. Younger patients, patients in good performance status and patients with lower tumor burden seem to benefit most from the addition of IFN to chemotherapy or from IFN maintenance therapy. In conclusion, IFN shows a minor beneficial effect on response rates, progression-free and overall survival in the above mentioned patient group and might be applied when high-dose chemotherapy with transplantation is not feasible. IFN has been shown to be effective for maintenance therapy in patients with lower tumor burden who have responded to induction therapy.","['Gisslinger, H']",['Gisslinger H'],"['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Survival Rate']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Dec;11 Suppl 5:S52-6.,,,36,,,,,,,

Therefore methods to reduce the tumor load of LP by CD34+ selection are envisaged. However, there is controversy as to whether the CD34+ cell is already involved in the malignant process. We have established a PCR assay with allele-specific oligonucleotide primers (ASO) complementary to the CDR3-hypervariable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene of each patient's myeloma clone. Using this ASO-PCR, 43 LP of 10 patients with MM eligible for high-dose therapy were assessed for malignant cells. Furthermore, in an experimental setting we have examined 10 CD34+ and four CD19+ fractions obtained from PCR-positive LP by sequential preparative magnetic and fluorescence activated cell sorting (purity >96%) for the presence of the tumor-specific CDR3 region. The majority of LP harbored cells of the myeloma clone (93%), while all CD34+ fractions were PCR-negative. In all CD19+ fractions malignant cells were detected. These results confirm that CD34+ selection can be considered for LP in MM. The sensitivity of the ASO-PCR (up to 10[-5]) enables us further to monitor the efficacy of CD34+ enrichment protocols in the clinical setting.","['Cremer, F W', 'Kiel, K', 'Sucker, C', 'Wacker, J', 'Atzberger, A', 'Haas, R', 'Goldschmidt, H', 'Moos, M']","['Cremer FW', 'Kiel K', 'Sucker C', 'Wacker J', 'Atzberger A', 'Haas R', 'Goldschmidt H', 'Moos M']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukapheresis/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Dec;11 Suppl 5:S41-6.,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-patients received Z-Dex (median age 56 years, range 46-66 years) including 24 patients with previously untreated disease. The overall response rate was 75% with a CR rate of 16.7% and PR rate of 75.7% in patients with previously untreated disease. We compared four mobilisation regimens: low-dose (LD) cyclophosphamide, high-dose (HD) cyclophosphamide, cis-platin/VP16 and cis-platin, Ara-C and dexamethasone (DHAP). Failure to mobilise optimal numbers of PBPCs (>1.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg and >20 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg) was seen in two patients who received LD cyclophosphamide, in two patients who received HD cyclophosphamide and three patients who received cis-platin/VP16.

In previously untreated patients, DHAP mobilised significantly more PBPC than LD cyclophosphamide (P=0.02), HD cyclophosphamide (P=0.0015) and cis-platin/VP16 (P=0.021). This study demonstrates the efficacy of Z-Dex in inducing tumour responses in patients with multiple myeloma without limiting PBPC mobilisation in subsequent dose-intensive schedules.

With the support of autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cells, it has been possible to reduce the hematoxicity of these dose-escalated treatments. The transplantation of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells results in faster hematopoietic reconstitution with decreased high-dose therapy-related morbidity compared to autologous bone marrow. The randomized French myeloma trial and the pair-mate analysis of the results of the 'total therapy' including double autografting of the Barlogie group with data from the South Western Oncology Group (SWOG) showed a significant survival advantage for patients following autologous transplantation. Although a graft-versus-myeloma effect was described, the benefit of high-dose treatment with allogeneic transplantation is less clear, mainly due to the high transplantation-related mortality rate.

These perspectives are somewhat hampered by the large variation in bioavailability between individual patients and the obvious requirement to monitor plasma concentration and area-under-the-curve values (AUC) for an appropriate adjustment of idarubicin dose. In this study we describe the pharmacokinetics of idarubicin and its main metabolite idarubicinol in 12 patients after oral application of 20 mg/m2 idarubicin on 3 consecutive days and demonstrate that the 24 h trough levels show a high correlation with AUC and may thus allow a rapid and easy determination of individual drug concentrations and an appropriate dose adjustment. The average terminal half-life was 30.5 h for idarubicin and 66.9 h for idarubicinol. The AUC for idarubicin and its main metabolite idarubicinol revealed a substantial interpatient variation with AUC values ranging from 25.7 to 114 ng x h/ml (average 58.1 ng x h/ml) for idarubicin and from 109.4-445.2 ng x h/ml (average 287.3 ng x h/ml) for idarubicinol. However, the ratio of idarubicin/idarubicinol differed only two folds from 1:3.7 to 1:7.7 with an average of 1:5.1. Both idarubicin and idarubicinol concentrations were highly reproducible, however, upon measurements after repeated applications within individual patients. Moreover, idarubicinol and idarubicin AUCs showed a good correlation with r = 0.78, indicating that the interindividual variation of idarubicin AUC reflects differences in absorption rather than in metabolism. In order to describe the interindividual bioavailability of idarubicin - represented by the respective AUC - measurement of a single data point with a high correlation with the AUC would be ideal. Our study demonstrates that the 24 h trough level shows such an excellent correlation (r = 0.96) with AUC, making it the perfect candidate for fast estimates of the individual bioavailability in a given patient. On this basis, the longitudinal measurement of the 24 h trough level may allow assessment of the impact of interindividual variations in AUC on clinical outcome and toxicity.","['Schleyer, E', 'Kuhn, S', 'Ruhrs, H', 'Unterhalt, M', 'Kaufmann, C C', 'Kern, W', 'Braess, J', 'Straubel, G', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Schleyer E', 'Kuhn S', 'Ruhrs H', 'Unterhalt M', 'Kaufmann CC', 'Kern W', 'Braess J', 'Straubel G', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '86189-66-4 (idarubicinol)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*drug therapy', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Regression Analysis']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Dec;11 Suppl 5:S15-21.,,,,,,,,,,

P-gp expression in the myeloma cells was determined using monoclonal antibody 4E3.16 and the rhodamine 123 functional test. The percentage of patients with P-gp overexpression at primary diagnosis ranged between 0 and 41% in the literature vs 32% in our study. The percentage of P-gp positive patients at relapse or PD ranged between 29 and 59% in the literature vs 33% in this analysis. All P-gp positive patients had a functional P-gp, ie a pumping P-gp. A significant difference concerning response (50 vs 58.3%) to VAD treatment and median survival (10 vs 12.5 months) between P-gp positive and P-gp negative patients could not be determined. Six of 12 P-gp negative MM patients at relapse or PD developed after VAD therapy a relapse combined with P-gp overexpression. These results do not confirm the suggestions that P-gp overexpression influences response to VAD treatment.

Persistence of cells above these cut-off values was interpreted as persistence of the mutated clone. A total of 36 samples at different disease stages were tested. Interphase cytogenetics detected the translocation at the onset and relapse in the BM or the PB of 14 AML patients with t(8;21). The technique appears to be an alternative tool to both conventional cytogenetics and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the monitoring of disease during patients' follow-up. By enabling the analysis of individual cells, interphase FISH is ideal for clonality studies both for clinical and experimental applications.","['Hagemeijer, A', 'de Klein, A', 'Wijsman, J', 'van Meerten, E', 'de Greef, G E', 'Sacchi, N']","['Hagemeijer A', 'de Klein A', 'Wijsman J', 'van Meerten E', 'de Greef GE', 'Sacchi N']","['Center for Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400896 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jan;12(1):96-101. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400896.,,,,,,,,,,

Eighty-two bone marrow biopsies from 41 patients in chronic phase CML were stained with Snook's reticulin stain for argyrophilic fibers. Grading of reticulin fibrosis (scale of 1 to 4) was according to the quantity and pattern of distribution of reticulin. The interval between biopsies was a median of 25 months (range 12 to 40 months). Patients had been treated with IFN-alpha for at least 12 months, were still on IFN-alpha therapy during the study, and had achieved at least a complete hematological response. Before the start of IFN-alpha therapy, reticulin fibrosis was grade 1-2 in 23 patients (56%) and grade 3-4 in 18 (44%). During IFN-alpha therapy, reticulin fibrosis in bone marrow did not worsen or was reduced in 33 patients (80%) and increased by one grade in eight patients (20%). Only five patients (12%) with limited fibrosis (grade 1-2) before start of IFN-alpha therapy showed an increase towards significant fibrosis (grade 3-4), while eight of the 18 patients (44%) with grade 3-4 fibrosis achieved a decrease of fiber content in bone marrow. In summary, IFN-alpha was not associated with an enhancing effect on myelofibrosis in patients with CML and may have prevented increasing fibrosis in patients who respond to therapy.","['Wilhelm, M', 'Bueso-Ramos, C', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Pierce, S', 'Keating, M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Wilhelm M', 'Bueso-Ramos C', ""O'Brien S"", 'Pierce S', 'Keating M', 'Talpaz M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400885 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jan;12(1):65-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400885.,,,,,,,,,,

To date, no factor is available which is able to reliably stimulate megakaryopoiesis in vivo. Recently, the ligand of the mpl receptor was cloned and found to be thrombopoietin (TPO). We measured endogenous TPO serum levels in 69 patients suffering from MDS using an TPO receptor-based ELISA. Twenty-six of the patients suffered from refractory anemia (RA), 12 from RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), 25 from RAEB in transition (RAEBt), and six from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). This assay uses a chimeric molecule consisting of the human TPO receptor fused to the Fc portion of human IgG as the capture reagent. Biotinylated antibody to TPO IgG was used for detection and the lower detection limit in serum was found to be 160 pg/ml. Samples obtained from healthy individuals with a normal platelet number were shown to be below detectable levels. In patients with RA, high endogenous serum TPO concentrations correlated with low platelet count and significantly elevated TPO concentrations were only found when megakaryopoiesis was absent or decreased in the bone marrow. This correlation was not detected in RAEB and RAEBt patients and no detectable TPO serum concentrations were found in six CMML patients whether they showed decreased or normal platelet count. Our data show that endogenous TPO production is upregulated by decreased circulating platelet count only in patients with refractory anemia. In the more advanced stages of MDS where the leukemic clone has further progressed, an inadequate TPO response occurs, possibly due to overexpression of the mpl receptor by the malignant clone.","['Zwierzina, H', 'Rollinger-Holzinger, I', 'Nuessler, V', 'Herold, M', 'Meng, Y G']","['Zwierzina H', 'Rollinger-Holzinger I', 'Nuessler V', 'Herold M', 'Meng YG']","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*blood/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Platelet Count', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400901 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jan;12(1):59-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400901.,,,,,,,,,,

The appearance of autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor and anti-DNA antibody) tended to increase after 2 years, however, there was no relationship between CD5+ B cells and the frequency of rheumatoid factor. These findings demonstrate that patients in CR have a low number of CD4+ and CD45RA+ CD4+ T cells at an early period after chemotherapy and that each subset recovered to a normal level in 2 years. %CD5+ B and CD56+ cells gradually decreased and returned to their normal level after 4 years.

Specific features were seen in five ANLL entities: M0 or M1/B lineage antigen positivity/t(9;22) or del(11)(q23); M2/CD13-/t(8;21); M4/CD13+, CD34+, CD36+/inv(16); M4 or M5/lack of B lineage antigen/del(11)(q23) or t(9;11). More practically, and although the relationships demonstrated only represent a fraction of homogeneous immunophenotypic subgroups, identification of such immunophenotypic features should prompt careful karyotypic examination, eventually using molecular biology analysis on non-growing cells.","['Casasnovas, R O', 'Campos, L', 'Mugneret, F', 'Charrin, C', 'Bene, M C', 'Garand, R', 'Favre, M', 'Sartiaux, C', 'Chaumarel, I', 'Bernier, M', 'Faure, G', 'Solary, E']","['Casasnovas RO', 'Campos L', 'Mugneret F', 'Charrin C', 'Bene MC', 'Garand R', 'Favre M', 'Sartiaux C', 'Chaumarel I', 'Bernier M', 'Faure G', 'Solary E']","['Hematologie Clinique, CHU Le Bocage, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400893 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jan;12(1):34-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400893.,,,,,,,,,,

It has been found that only typical and generally balanced 11q23 chromosomal anomalies involve the MLL gene while atypical and generally unbalanced do not. To determine whether these two categories of AML patients had different initial characteristics and evolution, supporting different pathogenetic mechanisms, we analyzed clinical and biologic characteristics of newly diagnosed AML patients with balanced 11q23 breakpoint and/or MLL rearrangement seen over a 10-year period in our institution and compared them to cases with unbalanced 11q23 anomaly seen over the same period. These two categories of patients were compared with newly diagnosed patients with normal karyotype and no MLL rearrangement when tested, seen over the same period of time and treated similarly. Over this period, 442 newly diagnosed adult (> 15 years) AML seen in our institution had a successful karyotype performed before any therapy. Thirty-six cases (8%) had a chromosome 11q23 breakpoint including 19 cases with a balanced translocation or inversion and 17 cases with an unbalanced anomaly. Eighty-seven recently diagnosed cases of AML, for whom frozen cellular material was available, were analyzed by Southern blot for the presence of MLL gene rearrangement. Fourteen cases (16% of the tested cases) had a rearrangement of the MLL gene, including seven cases with an apparently successful karyotype not showing any 11q23 breakpoint and two cases with no available karyotype. The only case with unbalanced 11q23 chromosomal anomaly which was tested had no MLL rearrangement. There was a clear-cut clinical difference between the 28 patients having a balanced 11q23 anomaly/MLL rearrangement and the 17 patients having an unbalanced chromosomal anomaly: AML with unbalanced 11q23 anomalies occurred in older patients (P = 0.07) tended to be less frequently associated with previous exposure to topoisomerase II-active drugs and with M4/M5 FAB cytological subtypes, were always associated with other chromosomal anomalies (P < 0.0001), expressed more frequently the CD34 antigen (P = 0.05) and were of considerably poorer prognosis for achievement of CR (P = 0.005) and survival (P = 0.0005). When compared to the control population, patients with balanced anomalies had more frequent history of toxic exposure (P = 0.0003) particularly to topoisomerase II-active drugs, tended to be more frequently of M4/M5 FAB subtypes (P = 0.07), expressed more frequently HLA-DR antigen (P = 0.02) and had shorter DFS (P = 0.02). Patients with unbalanced anomalies had more frequent splenomegaly (P = 0.009), lower WBC count (P = 0.04), and much poorer prognosis for CR achievement (P = 0.0001), survival (P < 0.0001) and DFS (P = 0.01). This study confirms the high frequency of 11q23 chromosomal breakpoint/MLL rearrangement in adult AML and the probable existence of two different entities with different clinical features according to the presence of a balanced or unbalanced cytogenetic abnormality, the latter being not associated with MLL rearrangement.","['Archimbaud, E', 'Charrin, C', 'Magaud, J P', 'Campos, L', 'Thomas, X', 'Fiere, D', 'Rimokh, R']","['Archimbaud E', 'Charrin C', 'Magaud JP', 'Campos L', 'Thomas X', 'Fiere D', 'Rimokh R']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics/mortality/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Survival Rate', '*Transcription Factors', 'Zinc Fingers']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400853 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jan;12(1):25-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400853.,,,,,,,,,,

In four ST patients, tumor tissue was also available. For comparative analysis, MNCs from healthy donors (n = 53) were analyzed. Telomerase was evaluated using a modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay, and telomere length by terminal restriction fragment (TRF) analysis. At diagnosis, high telomerase activity was detected in MNCs from all leukemia patients, which was similar to the activity from ST biopsy specimens. This exceeded by 10- to 20-fold the activity in PB MNCs from ST patients and healthy donors (P < 0.05). Granulocyte fractions lacked telomerase activity in all groups. BM MNCs in leukemia patients revealed a four-fold higher telomerase activity than PB (P = 0.005). After induction chemotherapy and response to treatment, telomerase activity decreased to borderline or undetectable levels in PB MNCs in leukemia (P < 0.01). Average telomeres in PB MNCs from pediatric patients were significantly longer (n = 25; 10.9 kbp) than telomeres in PB and BM MNCs from adult healthy donors (7.45 kbp) (P < 0.0001). At diagnosis, telomeres were shorter from BM compared to PB specimens in leukemia (P < 0.05), and two peak TRFs were observed corresponding to the malignant and normal cell clones. With the attainment of remission, the lower TRF peak, reflecting the leukemic population, was lost. In leukemia patients, mean TRFs increased on average 2.2 kbp after induction chemotherapy, but decreased thereafter on consolidation and maintenance chemotherapy (1 kbp). This was comparable to an average telomere loss of 1.2 kbp in PB specimens from ST patients after chemotherapy. In all patients, telomere loss in granulocytes as compared to MNCs was more pronounced with 1.8 vs 1 kbp, respectively (P = 0.014). Our results demonstrate that at diagnosis, telomerase was consistently and highly upregulated in BM and PB specimens in leukemia, decreased after induction therapy, and correlated with remission. BM specimens in leukemia had higher telomerase activity, probably due to the greater leukemic burden than in PB. Telomeres were significantly longer in children than in adults, but shortened as a consequence of chemotherapy with repeated cycles of hematopoietic regeneration. In acute leukemia, with the loss of the leukemic burden after induction chemotherapy, longer mean TRFs were found, a reflection of the repopulation with normal cells. Our findings suggest that telomerase activity may be useful in the management of childhood malignancies. The significance of telomere length shortening in pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy and possible telomere regeneration after myelosuppressive treatment remain to be determined.","['Engelhardt, M', 'Ozkaynak, M F', 'Drullinsky, P', 'Sandoval, C', 'Tugal, O', 'Jayabose, S', 'Moore, M A']","['Engelhardt M', 'Ozkaynak MF', 'Drullinsky P', 'Sandoval C', 'Tugal O', 'Jayabose S', 'Moore MA']","['James Ewing Laboratory of Developmental Hematopoiesis, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/enzymology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Telomerase/blood/*metabolism', '*Telomere']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2400889 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Jan;12(1):13-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400889.,['U9 CA 67842-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In three cell lines that synthesized biologically active IL-3 (FIJ1, FIJ4D and FIJ10D) insertion of an IAP sequence into the IL-3 gene was detected by PCR analysis and the insertions were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of PCR or RT-PCR fragments. In the four cell lines in which no IL-3 expression was detected no IAP insertions were detected. Rearrangements of the GM-CSF gene were detected in three factor-independent cell lines and an insertion of an IAP into the GM-CSF gene was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of PCR fragments. In contrast to results with IL-3, insertion of an IAP into the GM-CSF gene did not correlate with GM-CSF expression. In one cell line that contained an IAP insertion into the GM-CSF gene, no GM-CSF was detected by biological assay nor by RT-PCR.

When exposed to 200 microM glutamate, despite an observed difference in the rates of glutamate accumulation in control and GAD67-expressing astrocytes, similar proportions of glutamate taken up were detected. In GAD67-expressing astrocytes, the glutamate was mainly converted into GABA, suggesting GAD transgene activity to be dominant over other glutamate metabolic pathways, such as glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase. Moreover, rapid GABA release into the cell medium was also observed, suggesting the involvement of reverse GABA transporters. The use of the GFAP promoter might be able to take advantage of its activation in response to factors inducing reactive gliosis observed in pathological insults.

These include small-lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, the follicle center cell lymphomas, mantle cell lymphoma, and nodal and extranodal marginal zone lymphomas, including mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. There is still a great deal to be learned about the basic biology and treatment of these disorders.

Unfortunately, because of the inadequacy of current treatment, the majority of patients with indolent lymphoma will not be cured.

In the present study, all-trans-retionic acid (ATRA) elevated the level of AFP and inhibited the growth of KU-MT cells in vitro. ATRA also arrested the cell cycle in G1 and reduced the percentage of the S phase cell in terms of wild type p53, leading to apoptosis in part. Retinoids, especially retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-alpha specific agonists induced laminin production, a marker of endodermal differentiation; whereas arotinoid, a retinoid not bound to RAR-alpha, did not affect laminin expression.

When THP-1 cells were incubated over 4-7 days in 10% supernatant from lectin-activated human lymphocytes, their capacity to synthesize 5-lipoxygenase products was significantly increased. In contrast, the supernatant from nonactivated lymphocytes had no effect. The increase in capacity to synthesize 5-lipoxygenase products was mimicked by the addition of either granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3. These increases in synthetic capacity reflected increased enzymatic activity. Increased immunoreactive protein and mRNA for the enzymes 5-lipoxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein were also found in cells conditioned with activated lymphocyte supernatants. Furthermore, the increase in mRNA for both enzymes was not blocked by cycloheximide, suggesting that the effect on steady-state mRNA levels does not require the synthesis of new protein. The increase in mRNA could be reproduced by GM-CSF. We conclude that lymphocytes can regulate the expression of 5-lipoxygenase in THP-1 cells over a period of days via the release of soluble factors.","['Ring, W L', 'Riddick, C A', 'Baker, J R', 'Glass, C K', 'Bigby, T D']","['Ring WL', 'Riddick CA', 'Baker JR', 'Glass CK', 'Bigby TD']","['Department of Medicine, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Diego, California 92161, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (ALOX5AP protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*biosynthesis', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects/immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1997.273.6.C2057 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1997 Dec;273(6):C2057-64. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1997.273.6.C2057.,['HL-01888/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,10.1152/ajpcell.1997.273.6.C2057 [doi]

However, the mechanisms underlying the synergistic antitumor responses are still unclear. The purpose of this study was (a) to evaluate the antitumor response to CTX and adoptive immunotherapy in mice bearing four different syngeneic tumors (two responsive in vivo to CTX and two resistant); and (b) to define the mechanism(s) of the CTX-immunotherapy synergism. Tumor-bearing DBA/2 mice were treated with a single injection of CTX followed by an intravenous infusion of tumor-immune spleen cells. In all the four tumor models, a single CTX injection resulted in an impressive antitumor response to the subsequent injection of spleen cells from mice immunized with homologous tumor cells independently of the in vivo response to CTX alone. Detailed analysis of the antitumor mechanisms in mice transplanted with metastatic Friend leukemia cells revealed that (a) the effectiveness of this combined therapy was dependent neither on the CTX-induced reduction of tumor burden nor on CTX-induced inhibition of some putative tumor-induced suppressor cells; (b) the CTX/immune cells' regimen strongly protected the mice from subsequent injection of FLC, provided the animals were also preinoculated with inactivated homologous tumor together with the immune spleen cells; (c) CD4(+) T immune lymphocytes were the major cell type responsible for the antitumor activity; (d) the combined therapy was ineffective in mice treated with antiasialo-GM1 or anti-IFN-alpha/beta antibodies; (e) spleen and/ or bone marrow cells from CTX-treated mice produced soluble factors that assisted in proliferation of the spleen cells. Altogether, these results indicate that CTX acts via bystander effects, possibly through production of T cell growth factors occurring during the rebound events after drug administration, which may sustain the proliferation, survival, and activity of the transferred immune T lymphocytes. Thus, our findings indicate the need for reappraisal of the mechanisms underlying the synergistic effects of CTX and adoptive immunotherapy, and may provide new insights into the definition of new and more effective strategies with chemotherapy and adoptive immunotherapy for cancer patients.","['Proietti, E', 'Greco, G', 'Garrone, B', 'Baccarini, S', 'Mauri, C', 'Venditti, M', 'Carlei, D', 'Belardelli, F']","['Proietti E', 'Greco G', 'Garrone B', 'Baccarini S', 'Mauri C', 'Venditti M', 'Carlei D', 'Belardelli F']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome 00161, Italy. proietti@virus1.net.iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/02/07 00:00,1998/02/07 00:01,['1998/02/07 00:00'],"['1998/02/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI1348 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1998 Jan 15;101(2):429-41. doi: 10.1172/JCI1348.,,,,,,,PMC508583,,,

The HTLV transcriptional transactivator, Tax, is known to exert its effect through protein-protein interaction with several transcription factors that activate genes in T cell proliferation. The pathogenic mechanism in the CNS is less defined. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a specific Tax-binding protein as the neuronal specific intermediate filament protein, alpha-internexin. Tax binds to the domain corresponding to the rod region of alpha-internexin, which is essential for neurofilament assembly. The Tax domains involved in binding are separable from those involved in transactivation. TxBP-1/alpha-internexin and Tax are expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, when expressed alone, but in coexpressing cells, colocalization of both proteins was observed in a perinuclear, punctate distribution. This in vivo interaction also resulted in a dramatic reduction in Tax transactivation and the network formation by alpha-internexin. The specific interaction of Tax and a neuronal specific intermediate filament protein may provide a clue to the pathogenesis of TSP/HAM.","['Reddy, T R', 'Li, X', 'Jones, Y', 'Ellisman, M H', 'Ching, G Y', 'Liem, R K', 'Wong-Staal, F']","['Reddy TR', 'Li X', 'Jones Y', 'Ellisman MH', 'Ching GY', 'Liem RK', 'Wong-Staal F']","['Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0665, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (alpha-internexin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Sequence Alignment']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.2.702 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Jan 20;95(2):702-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.2.702.,"['P41 RR004050/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI31378/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR04050/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI36612-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC18484,,,

Hodgkin disease (n = 1), and 4 of these 9 patients treated for solid tumors (group II): neuroblastoma (n = 1), retinoblastoma (n = 1), Wilms tumor (n = 1), and central nervous system germinoma (n = 1). RESULTS: All the patients had topoisomerase II inhibitors as part of treatment of their first malignancy, but only 5 patients received epipodophyllotoxins. Alkylating agents were part of primary therapy in 8 of 9 patients. The latency period for the development sAML was 26.5 (range = 2-55) months. The morphologic FAB features of sAML were M5 (n = 5), M4 (n = 3), and M2 (n = 1). Cytogenetic studies showed r11q23 in 3 patients, all of them with prior hematological malignancies. Initial therapy for sAML in all cases was chemotherapy (including cytarabine in combination with idarubicin and etoposide or doxorubicin or mitoxantrone). Three patients died during induction and 6 achieved complete hematologic response. Three of these patients remain disease free at +15, +51, and +99 months post-remission (including one post allogeneic BMT). The remaining 3 patients died, 1 in complete remission one month after diagnosis and 2 relapsed and died with progressive disease (one post allogeneic BMT). CONCLUSIONS: Secondary AML is a sequela of oncologic treatments with specific cytogenetic abnormalities and poor outcome. A few patients can achieve long-term survival even with standard chemotherapy.","['Felice, M S', 'Zubizarreta, P A', 'Chantada, G L', 'Alfaro, E', 'Cygler, A M', 'Gallego, M', 'Rossi, J', 'Sackmann-Muriel, F']","['Felice MS', 'Zubizarreta PA', 'Chantada GL', 'Alfaro E', 'Cygler AM', 'Gallego M', 'Rossi J', 'Sackmann-Muriel F']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hospital de Pediatria SAMIC Prof. Dr. J.P.

As the data were limited mainly to adult patients, this study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of this procedure in pediatric patients and donors. Eleven children aged 2-16 years received allogeneic PBSC transplant for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 4), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 1), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1), severe aplastic anemia (n = 3), and thalassemia (n = 2). Nine donors were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings and the other two were one antigen mismatched family members. Eight donors were younger than 18 years old (10 months to 17 years). Donors were primed with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) at 10-16 micrograms/kg for 4-5 days. Aphereses were performed on 1 or 2 consecutive days, and the patients received a mean of 14.4 x 10(8)/kg nucleated cells, 6.9 x 10(6)/kg CD34 cells, and 6.9 x 10(8)/kg T cells. All patients achieved neutrophil counts of > 0.5 x 10(9)/l at a median of 16 days. Nine patients achieved platelet counts of > 20 x 10(9)/l at a median of 13 days. Grade II acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD) occurred in only one patient. Chronic GVHD was not observed in the seven patients with follow-up of more than 3 months. Eight patients remained in continuous complete remission after transplant ranged from 2 to 26 months. Allogeneic PBSC transplant appears safe in pediatric patients and donors, and it seems not to be associated with increase of acute GVHD or chronic GVHD.","['Li, C K', 'Yuen, P M', 'Chik, K W', 'Shing, M M', 'Li, K', 'Tsang, K S', 'Wong, A', 'Leung, T F', 'Lai, H']","['Li CK', 'Yuen PM', 'Chik KW', 'Shing MM', 'Li K', 'Tsang KS', 'Wong A', 'Leung TF', 'Lai H']","['Department of Paediatrics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong. ckli@cuhk.edu.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/01/22 18:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/01/22 18:02'],"['1998/01/22 18:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/01/22 18:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199803)30:3<147::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-H [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199803)30:3<147::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-h [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1998 Mar;30(3):147-51. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199803)30:3<147::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-h.,,,,,,,,,,

Because male germ cells are known to express many genes that are not expressed in other normal adult tissues, we wished to determine whether most of these genes are occasionally activated in tumor cells. Representational difference analysis was used to obtain testis-specific transcripts. The expression of 15 testis-specific cDNA sequences was tested by RT-PCR in a series of tumor cell lines. Only one cDNA sequence showed a significant level of expression in some tumor cell lines. Remarkably, this cDNA clone proved to be a new gene of the MAGE family. These results suggest that MAGE, BAGE, and GAGE genes belong to a minor subset of testis-specific genes that is often activated in tumors of various types, whereas most testis-specific genes are either never or very rarely activated in tumors.","['De Smet, C', 'Martelange, V', 'Lucas, S', 'Brasseur, F', 'Lurquin, C', 'Boon, T']","['De Smet C', 'Martelange V', 'Lucas S', 'Brasseur F', 'Lurquin C', 'Boon T']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell', 'Choriocarcinoma', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Melanoma', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'Sarcoma', 'Testis/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(97)97868-2 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.7868 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Dec 29;241(3):653-7. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.7868.,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF012349', 'GENBANK/AF012350', 'GENBANK/AF012351', 'GENBANK/AF012352', 'GENBANK/AF012353', 'GENBANK/AF012354', 'GENBANK/AF012355', 'GENBANK/AF012356', 'GENBANK/AF012357', 'GENBANK/AF012358', 'GENBANK/AF012359', 'GENBANK/AF012360', 'GENBANK/AF012361', 'GENBANK/AF012362', 'GENBANK/AF012363', 'GENBANK/AF012364', 'GENBANK/AF012365', 'GENBANK/AF012366', 'GENBANK/AF012367', 'GENBANK/AF012368', 'GENBANK/AF012369', 'GENBANK/AF012370', 'GENBANK/AF012371', 'GENBANK/AF012372', 'GENBANK/AF012373', 'GENBANK/AF012374', 'GENBANK/AF012375', 'GENBANK/AF012376', 'GENBANK/AF012377', 'GENBANK/AF012378', 'etc.']",,

In this study we have analyzed the transcriptional regulatory activity of PML using chimeric GAL4/PML constructs and GAL4-responsive reporter plasmids. The data presented demonstrate that PML, when fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (GAL4/PML), inhibits transcription from GAL4-responsive promoters. The magnitude of this repression is cell type and promoter dependent, and deletion studies show that the putative coiled-coil and part of the serine-rich regions of PML are required for this activity. These regions are also shown to be responsible for the repression of transcription activity from the EGFR promoter. The data presented also demonstrate that GAL4/PML can recruit PMLRAR alpha resulting in the retinoid-inducible transcriptional activation of a GAL4-responsive promoter, a function dependent on the presence of the coiled-coil region of PMLRAR alpha.","['Vallian, S', 'Gaken, J A', 'Trayner, I D', 'Gingold, E B', 'Kouzarides, T', 'Chang, K S', 'Farzaneh, F']","['Vallian S', 'Gaken JA', 'Trayner ID', 'Gingold EB', 'Kouzarides T', 'Chang KS', 'Farzaneh F']","[""Department of Molecular Medicine, Rayne Institute, King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dimerization', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/01/22 00:00,1998/01/22 00:01,['1998/01/22 00:00'],"['1998/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(97)93801-5 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3801 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 Dec 15;237(2):371-82. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3801.,,,,,,,,,,

K562 cells produced PAF under calcium ionophore stimulation. Lyso PAF and acetyl-CoA (the acetate donor molecule for the acetylation of lyso PAF into PAF) had no effect on the amounts of PAF produced by ionophore-stimulated cells. The metabolism of PAF and lyso PAF by K562 cells was compared to that of freshly-isolated human bone marrow erythroblasts and blood erythrocytes. K562 cells rapidly metabolized [3H]PAF and [3H]lyso PAF with 1-alkyl analogue of phosphatidylcholine as the major metabolic product. In contrast, blood erythrocytes did not. PAF acetylhydrolase activity levels in K562 cells and bone marrow erythroblasts were similar and higher than in blood erythrocytes. PAF (1-100 nM) stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in K562 cells grown in low serum concentration, a non-metabolizable PAF agonist being more potent than PAF to stimulate thymidine incorporation. PAF receptor mRNA was detected in K562 cells by polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcripts. The present study demonstrates that K562 cells produce and metabolize PAF and underlines the putative role of erythroid precursors in the modulation of bone marrow PAF concentrations.

In this study, we investigated the possible effects of various bioactive substances, which are present at high concentrations in the human pregnant uterus, on PAF-AH secretion from decidual macrophages using a monocyte-macrophage model system, human myelocytic leukaemia cells (HL-60). By treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), HL-60 cells were transformed to macrophage-like cells, which secreted PAF-AH into the culture medium time- and dose-dependently. After treatment with 10(-8) M TPA, the effects of various substances on the secretion of PAF-AH were examined. Among the substances examined, cortisol and TGF-beta suppressed PAF-AH secretion from TPA-stimulated HL-60 cells in a significant and dose-dependent way. Endothelin, epidermal growth factor, and brain natriuretic peptide had no significant effect on PAF-AH secretion from TPA-stimulated HL-60 cells. These results suggest that local PAF concentrations in the pregnant uterus might be regulated, at least partly, by cortisol and TGF-beta; thus these substances may play a role in the initiation of parturition via regulation of local PAF concentrations.","['Okumura, K K', 'Sagawa, N', 'Ihara, Y', 'Kobayashi, F', 'Itoh, H', 'Mori, T']","['Okumura KK', 'Sagawa N', 'Ihara Y', 'Kobayashi F', 'Itoh H', 'Mori T']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.47 (1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Decidua/metabolism', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology']",1998/01/20 00:00,1998/01/20 00:01,['1998/01/20 00:00'],"['1998/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/molehr/3.11.927 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 1997 Nov;3(11):927-32. doi: 10.1093/molehr/3.11.927.,,,,,,,,,['Mol Hum Reprod 1998 Jul;4(7):731'],

METHODS: Complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the V-D-J (third complementarity-determining region [CDR3]) region of T cell receptor beta chain was amplified by Vbeta family polymerase chain reaction. T cell clonotypes were detected by a single-strand conformational polymorphism method, and sequence analysis of the CDR3 region was performed. RESULTS: Distinct oligoclonal T cell expansion was observed in arthritic joints, and a conserved amino acid motif in the CDR3 region was found in T cells infiltrating joints. Moreover, several intraarticular T cells recognized HTLV-I Env and Tax proteins. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HTLV-I Env and Tax proteins act as autoantigens that are recognized by autoreactive T cells in inflamed arthritic lesions in the HTLV-I env-pX transgenic mouse. Thus, some T cells infiltrating the joint recognize Env or Tax protein. These cells may trigger chronic arthritis in HTLV-I env-pX transgenic mice.","['Fujisawa, K', 'Okamoto, K', 'Asahara, H', 'Hasunuma, T', 'Kobata, T', 'Kato, T', 'Sumida, T', 'Nishioka, K']","['Fujisawa K', 'Okamoto K', 'Asahara H', 'Hasunuma T', 'Kobata T', 'Kato T', 'Sumida T', 'Nishioka K']","['St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics/immunology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/immunology/virology', 'Autoantigens/*genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/immunology', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Synovial Membrane/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology']",1998/01/20 00:00,1998/01/20 00:01,['1998/01/20 00:00'],"['1998/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1529-0131(199801)41:1<101::AID-ART13>3.0.CO;2-L [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1998 Jan;41(1):101-9. doi: 10.1002/1529-0131(199801)41:1<101::AID-ART13>3.0.CO;2-L.,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-seven patients presented with typical M3, five with variant form (M3v), and three with intermediate form. Seven patients died before any chemotherapy could be given. Thirty-five patients received one course of chemotherapy combining anthracyclines and cytarabine without (n = 22) or with ATRA (n = 13), according to different protocols. One elderly patient received only ATRA, and two patients received only low-dose cytarabine. Nine patients died within 4 weeks of relapse. A complete remission (CR) was achieved in 29 of the 38 patients retreated after first relapse or primary failure (76.3%, 95% CI: 60-89%). Among relapsed patients, four of five patients who had initially received ATRA therapy achieved a second CR when retreated by ATRA. The median second disease-free survival (DFS) was 23.3 months. Overall median survival was 7.8 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 29% (95% CI: 14-44%). Parameters found to be associated with decreased second CR rate were presence of hemorrhages and hemostatic disorder, and high levels of GGT at the time of relapse. Factors associated with short survival were WHO performance status > 1, high serum LDH levels, and coagulopathy at time of relapse. Use of ATRA at time of relapse (n = 14) was significantly associated with higher CR rates (p = 0.008), longer DFS (median not reached versus 7.9 months; p = 0.05), and longer survival after first relapse (median 32.3 months versus 4.4 months; p = 0.003). In the multivariate analysis, the only factor predictive of poor prognosis for overall survival was the absence of ATRA therapy at relapse. We conclude that ATRA is effective in the treatment of relapsed or refractory APL and appears superior to chemotherapy alone.","['Thomas, X', 'Anglaret, B', 'Thiebaut, A', 'Belhabri, A', 'Treille-Ritouet, D', 'Fiere, D', 'Archimbaud, E']","['Thomas X', 'Anglaret B', 'Thiebaut A', 'Belhabri A', 'Treille-Ritouet D', 'Fiere D', 'Archimbaud E']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1998/01/20 00:00,1998/01/20 00:01,['1998/01/20 00:00'],"['1998/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050342 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1997 Nov-Dec;75(5-6):195-200. doi: 10.1007/s002770050342.,,,,,,,,,,

This study sought to examine the biochemical changes that are involved when germ cells are cocultured with Sertoli cells in vitro preceding the establishment of specialized Sertoli-germ cell junctions. While isolated germ cells were allowed to attach to Sertoli cells, media from both the apical and basal compartments of bicameral units were collected to assess serine and cysteine protease activity. The expression of selected serine and cysteine proteases and their corresponding inhibitors in these Sertoli-germ cell cocultures was also examined by RT-PCR. Using an [125I]-collagen film assay, a transient but significant increase in serine protease activity was noted in both the apical and basal compartments when germ cells began to settle onto the Sertoli cell monolayer preceding the formation of intercellular junctions. A specific tryptase (RNK-Tryp 2, a serine protease formerly cloned from a rat granular lymphocyte leukemia cell line, RNK-16, cDNA expression library) was shown to be expressed exclusively by Sertoli cells and not germ cells. Furthermore, Sertoli cell tryptase expression as well as urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA, also a serine protease) increased significantly when germ cells were adhering to Sertoli cells. The decline in total serine protease activity when Sertoli-germ cell junctions were being formed was accompanied by a concomitant increase in alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2-MG, a nonspecific protease inhibitor) expression. No significant changes in cysteine protease activity in either the apical or basal compartment were noted. However, there was a transient but significant increase in cathepsin L expression when germ cells were adhering to Sertoli cells preceding cell junction formation. The subsequent reduction in cathepsin L expression after this transient increase was accompanied by a concomitant increase in cystatin C expression. These results suggest that proteases and their corresponding inhibitors are working synergistically and are likely to be involved in the adherence of germ cells to Sertoli cells and the subsequent formation of intercellular junctions.","['Mruk, D', 'Zhu, L J', 'Silvestrini, B', 'Lee, W M', 'Cheng, C Y']","['Mruk D', 'Zhu LJ', 'Silvestrini B', 'Lee WM', 'Cheng CY']","['The Population Council, Center for Biomedical Research, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Androl,Journal of andrology,8106453,"['0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (alpha-Macroglobulins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.1 (Cathepsin C)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (chymase 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tpsab1 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tpsb2 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.15 (Cathepsin L)', 'EC 3.4.22.15 (Ctsl protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cathepsin C', 'Cathepsin L', 'Cathepsins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chymases', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/analysis/metabolism', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Germ Cells/chemistry/cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Protease Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Serine Endopeptidases/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Sertoli Cells/chemistry/cytology/*metabolism', 'Testis/cytology/enzymology', 'Tight Junctions/*metabolism', 'Tryptases', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/genetics/metabolism', 'alpha-Macroglobulins/genetics/metabolism']",1998/02/12 00:00,1998/02/12 00:01,['1998/02/12 00:00'],"['1998/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Androl. 1997 Nov-Dec;18(6):612-22.,['HD-13541/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Response was evaluated by qualitative nested and quantitative competitive RT-PCR for BCR-ABL mRNA at various time intervals before and after DLT. The probability of attaining molecular remission at 2 years was 61% (95% CI 42-78%). Disease state at the time of DLT was significantly associated with response: molecular remission was achieved for 9/10 (90%) patients treated early (cytogenetic or molecular relapse) compared to only 8/20 (40%) patients treated late (haematological relapse; P = 0.009). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of molecular remission at 2 years post DLT for patients treated in early or late relapse were 86.6% and 47.3% respectively (P = 0.004). The median time interval from DLT to molecular remission was 11.0 months (range 2.5-32). Molecular remissions were durable for most (15/17) patients (median follow-up 21.2 months; range 0-55). Two patterns of molecular response were found: a very rapid decline after an initial lag phase or a more gradual decline over a period of several months.

In this study we determined the frequency and the level of Evi-1 expression in juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) and in normal haemopoiesis. Using RT-PCR and Southern blot hybridization mRNA of Evi-1 could be detected in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MNC) of normal donors. In JMML 12/20 patients examined expressed elevated levels of Evi-1 compared to normal controls. In these samples over-expression of the gene was correlated with a higher percentage of blasts (P = 0.02). Expression levels in BFU-E and CFU-GM derived colonies from BM of JMML patients were lower than those in the corresponding MNC samples. Analysis of CD34+ and CD34- cells demonstrated that Evi-1 is primarily expressed in the CD34+ cell population of both JMML and normal donors. These findings suggest that Evi-1 expression is linked to the early stages of haemopoiesis. Studies on the regulation of Evi-1 expression in CD34+ cells will elucidate its function in progenitor cells and clarify its possible role in the pathogenesis of JMML.,"['Gerhardt, T M', 'Schmahl, G E', 'Flotho, C', 'Rath, A V', 'Niemeyer, C M']","['Gerhardt TM', 'Schmahl GE', 'Flotho C', 'Rath AV', 'Niemeyer CM']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Freiburg, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/01/31 00:00,1998/01/31 00:01,['1998/01/31 00:00'],"['1998/01/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.4983304.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Dec;99(4):882-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.4983304.x.,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of Fas-R in freshly isolated leukaemic cells was qualitatively and quantitatively different between each disease; faint in B-CLL, moderate in HCL-v and strong in ATL. Both full-length and alternatively spliced truncated forms of Fas mRNA were detected even in CLL B cells with faint to negative Fas-R, and Fas mRNA was also shown to be capable of increasing in vitro expression, i.e. the message was functional. In contrast, Fas-R expression on ATL cells was heterogenous and usually intense with a mean density approximately 3-fold higher than that of normal T cells. Fas-R was confirmed to have the potential function for anti-Fas monoclonal antibody-mediated cell death in vitro in Fas-R+ ATL cells. The expression level of Fas-R on the cells was higher in chronic than acute ATL (10,360 v 6260 antibody-binding capacity per cell, mFasABC; P<0.05) and was inversely correlated with serum LDH activity, suggesting that the strong Fas-R accounts for the slow progression of chronic ATL and the negative Fas-R protects from Fas-mediated cell death. These results show that Fas-R expression on leukaemic cells is valuable in their characterization and perhaps their function, and may contribute to the progression and immune evasion of malignant clones.","['Kamihira, S', 'Yamada, Y', 'Hirakata, Y', 'Tsuruda, K', 'Sugahara, K', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Maeda, T', 'Tsukasaki, K', 'Atogami, S', 'Kobayashi, N']","['Kamihira S', 'Yamada Y', 'Hirakata Y', 'Tsuruda K', 'Sugahara K', 'Tomonaga M', 'Maeda T', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Atogami S', 'Kobayashi N']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",1998/01/31 00:00,1998/01/31 00:01,['1998/01/31 00:00'],"['1998/01/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.4963301.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Dec;99(4):858-65. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.4963301.x.,,,,,,,,,,

The extent of inactivation of p53 was examined by assessing loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 17p13.3, by sequencing the highly conserved region (exons 5-9) of the p53 gene and by analysing p53 protein expression. LOH was detected in 8/28 (29%) cases, p53 mutations in 5/32 (16%) cases and p53 expression in 5/27 (19%) cases. Overall 11 cases (30%) had p53 abnormalities of which eight cases had CLL/PL. There was a significant association between CLL/PL and p53 abnormalities (P=0.05); 75% of cases with LOH, 80% of p53 mutations and 80% of cases positive for p53 protein had CLL/PL. Thus, p53 inactivation is the first gene abnormality identified so far to be involved in the development of CLL/PL. All the cases with typical CLL and p53 abnormalities had only one allele affected whereas 4/6 CLL/PL had both alleles inactivated. This difference in the extent of p53 inactivation suggests that accumulation of p53 abnormalities may be associated with progression of CLL to CLL/PL. CLL cases with p53 abnormalities were characterized by a higher incidence of stage C (P<0.025), a higher proliferative rate (P=0.05), short survival (P<0.005) and resistance to first-line therapy (P<0.02) but not to nucleoside analogues. Analysis of the correlation between p53 status and incidence of trisomy 12 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that trisomy 12 was more frequent in cases without p53 abnormalities, suggesting that trisomy 12 and p53 may represent different pathways of transformation in CLL.","['Lens, D', 'Dyer, M J', 'Garcia-Marco, J M', 'De Schouwer, P J', 'Hamoudi, R A', 'Jones, D', 'Farahat, N', 'Matutes, E', 'Catovsky, D']","['Lens D', 'Dyer MJ', 'Garcia-Marco JM', 'De Schouwer PJ', 'Hamoudi RA', 'Jones D', 'Farahat N', 'Matutes E', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Institute of Cancer Research, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/genetics/pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",1998/01/31 00:00,1998/01/31 00:01,['1998/01/31 00:00'],"['1998/01/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.4723278.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Dec;99(4):848-57. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.4723278.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Report of a case and review of the literature.,1282-6,"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is a monoclonal T-cell neoplasm associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) that occurs almost exclusively in adults. This report concerns a Romanian girl who had recurrent skin eruptions since infancy, subcutaneous tumors in childhood, and peripheral blood lymphocytosis, which initially developed at the age of 12 years. The circulating lymphocytes were of helper T-cell immunophenotype. Serologic studies demonstrated a number of HTLV-1 antigens in the child and her mother, and molecular analyses revealed monoclonal T-cell-receptor gamma gene rearrangement and detectable HTLV-1 proviral DNA. Conventional cytogenetic studies revealed a t(3;6)(q23;q27) chromosome translocation in most of the neoplastic cells. The patient initially responded well to interferon alfa therapy and showed regression of skin lesions and diminished lymphocytosis, but 4 years later, she developed massive lymphadenopathy and leukemic infiltration of the breast. At last clinical follow-up, at the age of 17 years, the patient had stable low-level peripheral lymphocytosis and subcutaneous tumors while being continuously treated with interferon alfa. Our review of the literature revealed six additional children with HTLV-1-associated T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, including one case with a similar clinical presentation and ethnic background. To our knowledge, the t(3;6)(q23;q27) translocation identified in this patient's neoplasm has not been previously reported in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cases and may explain the early onset of disease. Although adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is rare in Romania, the identification of healthy carriers and vertical transmission raise the possibility that Romania might be an endemic region for HTLV-1 infection.","['Lin, B T', 'Musset, M', 'Szekely, A M', 'Alexandre, J', 'Fraitag, S', 'Bodemer, C', 'Charpentier, A', 'Frenoy, N', 'Misset, J L', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Rappaport, H']","['Lin BT', 'Musset M', 'Szekely AM', 'Alexandre J', 'Fraitag S', 'Bodemer C', 'Charpentier A', 'Frenoy N', 'Misset JL', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Rappaport H']","['Division of Anatomic Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, Calif. 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antigens)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier State/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Child', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/chemistry/genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus Antigens/analysis', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology/*virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*diagnosis/pathology/*virology', 'Romania/epidemiology', 'Skin/chemistry/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1998/02/07 00:00,1998/02/07 00:01,['1998/02/07 00:00'],"['1998/02/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/07 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/07 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1997 Dec;121(12):1282-6.,,,19,,,['Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1998 Jul;122(7):582-3.

In the present study, we isolated a subtype of THP-1 cells that failed to accumulate esterified cholesterol when cultivated in the presence of Ac-LDL. The cells had negligible amounts of cell association and degradation of Ac-LDL compared with the parent THP-1 cells. The subtype THP-1 cells did not express ScR mRNA as well as that of lipoprotein lipase. In contrast, the expression of apolipoprotein E mRNA was greater than that found in parent THP-1 cells. The culture medium of subtype THP-1 cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate inhibited the uptake of Ac-LDL and the expression of ScR in parent THP-1 cells. After a 48-h incubation in the culture medium containing 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, the culture medium of differentiated subtype THP-1 cells contained 6.9 ng/ml transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, while that of parent THP-1 cells secreted below detection level, which was less than 3 ng/ml. This inhibitory effect of the conditioned medium on the expression of ScR in parent THP-1 cells was abolished by pretreatment of the culture medium with anti-TGF-beta 1 antibodies. Parent THP-1 cells expressed as much TGF-beta 1 mRNA as sTHP-1 cells after stimulation of differentiation. Although the precursor forms of TGF-beta 1 that were synthesized in both parent and subtype THP-1 cells were of similar size and were expressed at similar levels, latent TGF-beta 1-binding protein, which is necessary for the secretion of TGF-beta 1, could only be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-TGF-beta 1 antibody from subtype THP-1 cells. This suggests that subtype THP-1 cells secrete TGF-beta 1 into the medium by forming a functional complex with the latent TGF-beta 1-binding protein. We conclude that subtype THP-1 cells could not take up Ac-LDL because ScR was inhibited (leading to a loss of function) caused by the secreted TGF-beta 1.","['Nishimura, N', 'Harada-Shiba, M', 'Tajima, S', 'Sugano, R', 'Yamamura, T', 'Qiang, Q Z', 'Yamamoto, A']","['Nishimura N', 'Harada-Shiba M', 'Tajima S', 'Sugano R', 'Yamamura T', 'Qiang QZ', 'Yamamoto A']","['Department of Etiology and Pathophysiology, National Cardiovascular Center Research Institute, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Latent TGF-beta Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Lipoprotein)', '0 (Receptors, Scavenger)', '0 (Scarb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class B)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Latent TGF-beta Binding Proteins', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Lipoprotein', 'Receptors, Scavenger', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class B', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/*metabolism']",1998/01/27 00:00,1998/01/27 00:01,['1998/01/27 00:00'],"['1998/01/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.3.1562 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)89538-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Jan 16;273(3):1562-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.3.1562.,,,,,,,,,,

GH stimulated the rapid, transient induction of SOCS-3 mRNA, peaking 30 min after the initiation of GH exposure and declining to basal levels by 2 h. Expression of the other SOCS genes (SOCS-1, SOCS-2, CIS) was also up-regulated by GH, although to a lesser extent than SOCS-3 and with differing kinetics. SOCS-3 expression was also strongly induced in 3T3-F442A cells treated with leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), with weaker induction of SOCS-1 and CIS being observed. The preferential induction of SOCS-3 mRNA was also observed in hepatic RNA isolated from the livers of mice that had received a single supraphysiological dose of GH intraperitoneally.

Recently, CD66 molecules have been characterized as receptors for Opa52-expressing gonococci on human neutrophils. Here we show that Opa52-expressing gonococci or Escherichia coli or F(ab) fragments directed against CD66, respectively, activate a signalling cascade from CD66 via Src-like protein tyrosine kinases, Rac1 and PAK to Jun-N-terminal kinase. The induced signal is distinct from Fcgamma-receptor-mediated signalling and is specific for Opa52, since piliated Opa- gonococci, commensal Neisseria cinerea or E.coli do not stimulate this signalling pathway. Inhibition of Src-like kinases or Rac1 prevents the uptake of Opa52 bacteria, demonstrating the crucial role of this signalling cascade for the opsonin-independent, Opa52/CD66-mediated phagocytosis of pathogenic Neisseria.","['Hauck, C R', 'Meyer, T F', 'Lang, F', 'Gulbins, E']","['Hauck CR', 'Meyer TF', 'Lang F', 'Gulbins E']","['Max-Planck-Institut fur Biologie, Abteilung Infektionsbiologie, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins)', '0 (CD66 antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Opsonin Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '156319-92-5 (Opa protein, Neisseria)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*physiology', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Induction', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Neisseria gonorrhoeae/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/enzymology/physiology', 'Opsonin Proteins', '*Phagocytosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stress, Physiological/enzymology/microbiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins', 'src Homology Domains/*physiology']",1998/02/28 00:00,1998/02/28 00:01,['1998/02/28 00:00'],"['1998/02/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/17.2.443 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1998 Jan 15;17(2):443-54. doi: 10.1093/emboj/17.2.443.,,,,,,,PMC1170395,,,

METHODS: The therapeutic agent used was the tumor-specific anti-HER2/neu monoclonal antibody AE1 conjugated to 212Pb, 212Bi being the daughter and thus the source of the alpha-particle and beta emissions. A bifunctional derivative of tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid (p-SCN-Bz-DOTA) was used to couple 212Pb to the anti-HER2/neu monoclonal antibody AE1. The chelating agent did not alter the binding affinity to its antigenic target or the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of the AE1 antibody. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of 212Pb-AE1 were evaluated in nude mouse ascites or solid tumor models, wherein SK-OV-3 cells were administered i.p. or s.c., respectively. RESULTS: The dose-limiting acute toxicity after i.v. administration of 212Pb-AE1 was bone marrow suppression, which was observed at doses above 25 microCi. Therefore, doses of 10 and 20 microCi were used in efficacy trials. The i.p. administration of 212Pb-AE1 3 days after i.p. tumor inoculation led to a significant (P2 = 0.015) prolongation of tumor-free survival. In a second model, i.v. treatment with 212Pb-AE1 3 days after s.c. tumor inoculation prevented subsequent tumor development in all animals treated with 10 or 20 microCi of 212Pb-AE1 (P2 = 0.002 compared to control groups). This efficacy in the adjuvant setting was antibody specific because treatments with equivalently labeled control antibody or unlabeled AE1 antibody or no treatment were less effective. The rate of growth of small (mean tumor volume, 15 mm3) SK-OV-3 tumors was modestly inhibited. However, tumor growth was not inhibited in mice bearing larger (mean tumor volume, 146 mm3) SK-OV-3 tumors by the administration of a single dose of 10 or 20 microCi of 212Pb-AE1. CONCLUSION: Lead-212-AE1 as an intact radiolabeled monoclonal antibody may be of only modest value in the therapy of bulky solid tumors due to the short physical half-life of 212Pb and time required to achieve a useful tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of radionuclide after administration. However, the radiolabeled monoclonal antibody may be useful in therapy of tumors in the adjuvant setting. Furthermore, 212Pb may be of value in select situations, including treatment of leukemia, intercavitary therapy or strategies that target vascular endothelial cells of tumors.","['Horak, E', 'Hartmann, F', 'Garmestani, K', 'Wu, C', 'Brechbiel, M', 'Gansow, O A', 'Landolfi, N F', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Horak E', 'Hartmann F', 'Garmestani K', 'Wu C', 'Brechbiel M', 'Gansow OA', 'Landolfi NF', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Lead Radioisotopes)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lead Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution']",1998/01/16 00:00,1998/01/16 00:01,['1998/01/16 00:00'],"['1998/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Nucl Med. 1997 Dec;38(12):1944-50.,,,,,,,,,,

The phenotype of the DP thymocytes in SCID-bg mice was CD44- heat-stable antigen (HSA)+CD25-, and they did not express CD69. Interestingly, the expression of thymus leukaemia (TL) antigen was observed in the DP thymocytes of SCID-bg mice but not in their CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) fraction. Fas expression was higher and bcl-2 expression was down-regulated in the DP thymocytes as compared to the DN thymocytes in SCID-bg mice, suggesting that they are not immortalized cells having escaped from apoptosis. Taken together, these results show that the phenotype of the DP thymocytes in SCID-bg mice is similar to that of the earliest phase of the DP thymocytes in normal mice, although the expression of the molecules in the pre-TCR complex is absent.","['Shibata, S', 'Asano, T', 'Noguchi, A', 'Kimura, H', 'Hashimoto, N', 'Hayakawa, J', 'Ogura, A', 'Doi, K']","['Shibata S', 'Asano T', 'Noguchi A', 'Kimura H', 'Hashimoto N', 'Hayakawa J', 'Ogura A', 'Doi K']","['Department of Veterinary Science, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan. shibata@nih.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD4 Antigens/*analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/*analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor gamma', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1998/01/16 00:00,1998/01/16 00:01,['1998/01/16 00:00'],"['1998/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/icb.1997.73 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1997 Oct;75(5):472-7. doi: 10.1038/icb.1997.73.,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated human LIF production and action on human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secretion at different stages of gestation. Decidual and chorionic tissues were obtained at the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, and at term. Decidual and trophoblast cells were isolated and cultured separately and medium LIF or hCG levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Decidual cells derived from the first and second trimester, and term were cultured for 72 h in serum-containing medium and produced 374 +/- 162 (mean +/- SEM), 140 +/- 14 and 466 +/- 134 ngLIF/mg protein, respectively. Pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (10 U/ml) did not affect LIF production from first-trimester decidual cells, but inhibited second-trimester LIF production to 37% of that of controls (p < 0.05), and stimulated LIF production from term decidual cells to 125% of that of controls (p < 0.05). First-trimester trophoblast cells treated with 10 nmol/l hLIF for 72 h in serum-free medium increased hCG secretion by 125% (p = 0.05). Conversely, hLIF dose-dependently inhibited basal and cAMP-stimulated hCG secretion in trophoblasts derived during the second trimester and at term, as well as in cultured JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. LIF exhibited more potent inhibitory action in the second trimester, maximally reducing hCG production by 37% from that of control values (p < 0.05) at a dose of 10 nmol/l. These findings indicate that (1) LIF is produced by decidual cells throughout pregnancy and may play a different regulatory role of hCG production at different stages of gestation; and (2) gonadotropin synthesized in trophoblasts may, in part, regulate LIF production through a paracrine pathway.","['Ren, S G', 'Melmed, S', 'Braunstein, G D']","['Ren SG', 'Melmed S', 'Braunstein GD']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Early Pregnancy,Early pregnancy : biology and medicine : the official journal of the Society for the Investigation of Early Pregnancy,9508879,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', 'Decidua/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Trophoblasts/drug effects/metabolism']",1997/06/01 00:00,1998/01/16 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Early Pregnancy. 1997 Jun;3(2):102-8.,['DK 42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

To study TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, we isolated and characterized a novel TNF-alpha-resistant variant, U937/TNF clone UA, from human monocytic leukemia U937 cells. The UA cells resist apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha and anti-Fas antibody but not by anticancer drugs, such as VP-16 and Ara-C. Somatic cell hybridization between U937 and UA showed that apoptosis resistance to TNF-alpha in UA was genetically recessive. The hybridization analysis also showed that UA and another recessive mutant clone, UC, belong to different complementation groups in TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis signaling. In UA cells, TNF-alpha-induced disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and CPP32 activation were abrogated. Expression of TNFR, Fas, and Bcl-2 family proteins was not changed in UA cells. These results suggest that the apoptosis resistant UA cells could have a functional defect in apoptosis signaling from the TNFR to mitochondria and interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) family protease activation.

Myeloma cells were also tested for their ability to attach to RGD-containing fibronectin fragments, a property of activated (but not resting) alpha4beta1. Two cell lines adhered to these fragments and this was inhibited by anti-alpha5 but not by anti-alpha4 mAbs.

Cellular alpha-tocopherol levels increased more than 5000-fold over constitutive levels without reaching saturation when P388D1 cells were cultured in vitamin-E-supplemented fetal calf serum. The uptake of alpha-tocopherol was accompanied by accumulation of alpha-[3H]tocopherol and [14C]cholesterol in these cells. Human unmodified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) inhibited the uptake of alpha-[3H]tocopherol and [14C]cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner and with very similar IC50. Acetylated, Cu2+-oxidized and aggregated human LDL and human very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL) were similarly potent, whereas human HDL was at least tenfold less effective than human LDL when inhibitory activity was correlated to lipoprotein protein levels. The rate of vitamin E uptake by P388D1 cells, however, always correlated with the extracellular alpha-tocopherol/cholesterol ratio. Efflux of alpha-[3H]tocopherol from labeled P388D1 cells required extracellular acceptors and was accompanied by the concomitant release of [14C]cholesterol. Both human LDL and HDL could serve as acceptors. Changes in the cellular alpha-tocopherol level appear to be the direct consequence of changes in the extracellular alpha-tocopherol/cholesterol ratio due to a rapid exchange of lipids between P388D1 cells and their extracellular environment. While the transfer of alpha-tocopherol from LDL, VLDL, and fetal calf serum into P388D1 cells appears to occur mainly by diffusion, HDL-stimulated efflux of alpha-tocopherol may underlie a different mechanism. The alpha-tocopherol/cholesterol ratio of the extracellular environment may be a critical factor in determining cellular vitamin E levels in vivo.","['Asmis, R']",['Asmis R'],"['Institute of Biochemistry, University of Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins/*metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/pharmacology', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Vitamin E/*metabolism']",1998/01/15 00:00,1998/01/15 00:01,['1998/01/15 00:00'],"['1998/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.0600a.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1997 Dec 1;250(2):600-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.0600a.x.,,,,,,,,,,

High levels of polyamines induce a +1 ribosomal frameshift in the translation of the rat antizyme message leading to the expression of a full-length protein. We have studied whether the regulation of antizyme expression occurs only at the level of translation or whether polyamine levels also affect the transcription of the antizyme gene. Thus, we have cloned and sequenced the mouse homologues of the rat ODC-antizyme gene and cDNA. Northern blot analysis shows that although high concentrations of polyamines do not affect the steady-state levels of antizyme message in L1210 leukemia cells, polyamine depletion using 2-(difluoromethyl)ornithine [Orn(F2Me)] leads to a marked decrease in mRNA levels. Results of transient transfections of luciferase-reporter-gene constructs driven by antizyme promoter fragments in untreated and Orn(F2Me)-treated Balb/C 3T3 cells indicate that the transcription of the antizyme gene is altered upon polyamine depletion. The amount of antizyme protein on Western blots was also altered by polyamine depletion and addition, and the polysomal distribution of antizyme message suggests a general translational increase of the message when polyamine concentrations are high.

Thus, assessment of karyotypes at the onset of chronic myeloid leukemia blast crisis appears to be of prognostic significance for both remission duration and survival.","['Griesshammer, M', 'Heinze, B', 'Bangerter, M', 'Heimpel, H', 'Fliedner, T M']","['Griesshammer M', 'Heinze B', 'Bangerter M', 'Heimpel H', 'Fliedner TM']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,,IM,"['Blast Crisis/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis']",1998/01/15 00:00,1998/01/15 00:01,['1998/01/15 00:00'],"['1998/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s001090050173 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 1997 Nov-Dec;75(11-12):836-8. doi: 10.1007/s001090050173.,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the authors examined the long term psychosocial functioning of childhood ALL survivors who had been treated on a Phase III clinical protocol (Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] 7611) between 1976 and 1979, in which they were randomized to receive either 2400 centigray of cranial radiation (CRT) with intrathecal methotrexate (IT-MTX) or intermediate dose systemic methotrexate (IV-MTX) with IT-MTX. METHODS: One hundred ten survivors of childhood ALL (mean age, 20.8 years) treated on CALGB 7611 who were age 14 years or older and disease free for at least 1 year were studied a mean of 14.7 years after their entry on CALGB 7611. In a telephone interview, a psychosocial assessment battery was administered to the patients, consisting of measures that assessed psychologic, sexual, social, and vocational functioning as well as any delayed physical effects. RESULTS: Survivors who had received CRT + IT-MTX had significantly poorer academic achievement (P = 0.0001), poorer self-images with regard to their bodies (P = 0.001), and greater psychologic distress (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Cranial radiation used to treat children with ALL has significant long term sequelae in terms of poorer academic achievement and psychosocial functioning. These data add weight to the conclusion that CRT prophylaxis should only be used to treat children who are at high risk of CNS relapse.","['Hill, J M', 'Kornblith, A B', 'Jones, D', 'Freeman, A', 'Holland, J F', 'Glicksman, A S', 'Boyett, J M', 'Lenherr, B', 'Brecher, M L', 'Dubowy, R', 'Kung, F', 'Maurer, H', 'Holland, J C']","['Hill JM', 'Kornblith AB', 'Jones D', 'Freeman A', 'Holland JF', 'Glicksman AS', 'Boyett JM', 'Lenherr B', 'Brecher ML', 'Dubowy R', 'Kung F', 'Maurer H', 'Holland JC']","['University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark 07103-2714, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Behavior', 'Body Image', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', '*Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Self Concept', 'Sexual Behavior', '*Social Adjustment', 'Social Behavior', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Telephone']",1998/01/15 04:20,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/01/15 04:20'],"['1998/01/15 04:20 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/01/15 04:20 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980101)82:1<208::AID-CNCR26>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Jan 1;82(1):208-18.,['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The somatosensory potentials evoked by stimulation of the median nerve and posterior tibial nerve were recorded in 31 children with ALL after 3 years of therapy. All patients were examined clinically. The 14 standard risk patients had been treated with chemotherapy according to the Nordic regimen, and the 17 intermediate risk or high risk patients had been treated with chemotherapy and cranial irradiation according to the ALL BFM-83 protocol. RESULTS: A decrease in amplitudes was observed at the brachial plexus and spinal cord (C7) in the median SEP, and at the knee, spinal cord (Th12), and cortex in the tibial SEP, indicating axonal injury within the entire CNS in the patients with ALL compared with healthy age-, gender-, and height-matched controls. Prolongation of the SEP latencies was found within the spinal cord, indicating demyelination. These SEP changes had persisted for 2 years since the last injection/infusion of vincristine or methotrexate, which are the principal neurotoxic drugs used in chemotherapy for ALL. Clinical signs of nerve injury such as depressed deep tendon reflexes and gross or fine motor difficulties were found in approximately 33% of the patients and dysdiadochokinesia in 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ALL in children principally with vincristine and methotrexate causes long-standing axonal injury throughout the nervous system and demyelination within the spinal cord. These changes are associated with clinical neurologic findings.","['Harila-Saari, A H', 'Vainionpaa, L K', 'Kovala, T T', 'Tolonen, E U', 'Lanning, B M']","['Harila-Saari AH', 'Vainionpaa LK', 'Kovala TT', 'Tolonen EU', 'Lanning BM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Axons/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Brachial Plexus/drug effects/physiopathology/radiation effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Demyelinating Diseases/diagnosis/etiology', 'Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Median Nerve/drug effects/physiopathology/radiation effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Motor Skills/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Psychomotor Disorders/etiology/physiopathology', 'Reflex, Stretch/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Spinal Cord/drug effects/physiopathology/radiation effects', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Tibial Nerve/drug effects/physiopathology/radiation effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1998/01/15 04:20,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/01/15 04:20'],"['1998/01/15 04:20 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/01/15 04:20 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980101)82:1<200::AID-CNCR25>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19980101)82:1<200::aid-cncr25>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Jan 1;82(1):200-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19980101)82:1<200::aid-cncr25>3.0.co;2-5.,,,,,,,,,,

The interaction between rIL-2-activated lymphoid cells and EC is a possible mechanism of this systemic toxicity. Taurine, a beta-amino acid, is known to have several physiologic actions, including the modulation of calcium homeostasis. The aims of this study were to analyze the effects of taurine on rIL-2-activated, lymphocyte-mediated EC and tumor cell cytotoxicity and to investigate the mechanisms of its action. METHODS: IL-2-activated cytotoxicity, mediated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, against susceptible tumor cell lines and against EC (fresh EC and an EC cell line) in the presence of taurine was assessed. The effects of taurine on lymphocyte [Ca2+]i were assessed by flow cytometry, and the effects of taurine on granzyme activity were assessed by spectrophotometry. RESULTS: The authors' findings indicated that the addition of taurine significantly reduced rIL-2-activated EC cytotoxicity mediated by natural killer cells, without reducing antitumor response. Taurine was also shown to reduce significantly EC lysis mediated by lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, while also significantly increasing tumor cytotoxicity. The authors demonstrated the importance of calcium in the role played by taurine in lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity and found that LAK [Ca2+]i following conjugation to EC was enhanced by taurine. They also found that taurine enhanced Ca2+-dependent granzyme exocytosis from LAK cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that taurine may play a dual role in rIL-2 immunotherapy, due to its ability to reduce the vascular injury associated with this therapy while enhancing its antineoplastic activity.","['Finnegan, N M', 'Redmond, H P', 'Bouchier-Hayes, D J']","['Finnegan NM', 'Redmond HP', 'Bouchier-Hayes DJ']","['Department of Surgery, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '1EQV5MLY3D (Taurine)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.78 (GZMA protein, human)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blood', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects/immunology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Exocytosis/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granzymes', 'Homeostasis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Serine Endopeptidases/analysis/drug effects', 'Spectrophotometry', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'Taurine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/01/15 04:20,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/01/15 04:20'],"['1998/01/15 04:20 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/01/15 04:20 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980101)82:1<186::AID-CNCR24>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19980101)82:1<186::aid-cncr24>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Jan 1;82(1):186-99. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19980101)82:1<186::aid-cncr24>3.0.co;2-y.,,,,,,,,,,

The evolution towards a Richter's syndrome is more frequent and it can exhibit CD30 positive Reed-Sternberg like cells.

These structures are disrupted in APL cells, and retinoic acid (RA) can trigger their reorganization, correlating with its therapeutic effect in this type of leukemia. Recently, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) was identified as a potent antileukemic agent which, similarly to RA, induces complete remissions in APL patients. Here we show that, in APL cells, As2O3 triggers rapid degradation of PML-RARalpha and provokes the restoration of intact nuclear bodies. In non-APL cells, the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1 is covalently attached to a subset of wild-type PML in a reversible and phosphorylation-dependent manner. The unmodified form of PML is found in the soluble nucleoplasmic fraction, whereas the SUMO-1-polymodified forms of PML are compartmentalized exclusively in the PML nuclear bodies. As2O3 administration strikingly increases the pool of SUMO-1-PML conjugates that, subsequently, accumulate in enlarged nuclear bodies. In contrast to PML-RARalpha, the overall amount of PML seems to remain unaltered up to 36 h following As2O3 treatment. These findings indicate that the conjugation of PML with SUMO-1 modulates its intracellular localization and suggest that post-translational modification by SUMO-1 may be more generally involved than previously suspected in the targeting of proteins to distinct subcellular structures. They provide additional evidence that the role of 'ubiquitin-like' post-translational modification is not limited to a degradation signal.","['Muller, S', 'Matunis, M J', 'Dejean, A']","['Muller S', 'Matunis MJ', 'Dejean A']","['Unite de Recombinaison et Expression Genetique, INSERM U 163, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Dr Roux, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",1998/02/28 00:00,1998/02/28 00:01,['1998/02/28 00:00'],"['1998/02/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1998/02/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/17.1.61 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 1998 Jan 2;17(1):61-70. doi: 10.1093/emboj/17.1.61.,,,,,,,PMC1170358,,,

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor did not increase the level of leukemic or residual normal engraftment. Assessment of differential engraftment of normal and leukemic cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with bcr and abl probes showed that a median of 35% (range, 5% to 91%) of engrafted cells present in the murine BM were leukemic. BM engraftment was multilineage with myeloid, B-cell, and T-cell engraftment, whereas T cells were the predominant cell type in the spleen. BM morphology showed evidence of eosinophilia and increased megakaryocytes. We also assessed the ability of selected CD34+ CML blood cells to engraft NOD/SCID mice and showed engraftment with cell doses of 7 to 10 x 10(6) cells. CD34- cells failed to engraft at cell doses of 1.2 to 5 x 10(7). CD34+ cells produced myeloid and B-cell engraftment with high levels of CD34+ cells detected. Thus, normal and leukemic stem cells are present in CD34+ blood cells from CML patients at diagnosis and lead to development of the typical features of CML in murine BM.

The leukemogenic risk associated to treatment with hydroxyurea in ET, on the other hand, is generally considered to be relatively low. Between 1970 and 1991, we diagnosed ET in 357 patients, who were monitored until 1996. One or several therapeutic agents had been administered to 326 patients, including hydroxyurea (HU) in 251 (as only treatment in 201), pipobroman in 43, busulfan in 41, and 32P in 40. With a median follow-up duration of 98 months, 17 patients (4.5%) had progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML; six cases) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; 11 cases). Fourteen of these patients had received HU, as sole treatment in seven cases, and preceded or followed by other treatment in seven cases, mainly pipobroman (five cases). The remaining three leukemic progressions occurred in patients treated with 32P (two cases) and busulfan (one case). The incidence of AML and MDS after treatment, using 32P alone and 32P with other agents, busulfan alone and with other agents, HU alone and with others agents, and pipobroman alone and with other agents was 7% and 9%, 3% and 17%, 3.5% and 14%, and 0% and 16%, respectively. Thirteen of 17 patients who progressed to AML or MDS had successful cytogenetic analysis. Seven of them had rearrangements of chromosome 17 (unbalanced translocation, partial or complete deletion, isochromosome 17q) that resulted in 17p deletion. They also had a typical form of dysgranulopoiesis combining pseudo Pelger Huet hypolobulation and vacuoles in neutrophils, and p53 mutation, as previously described in AML and MDS with 17p deletion. Those seven patients had all received HU, as the only therapeutic agent in three, and followed by pipobroman in three. The three patients who had received no HU and progressed to AML or MDS had no 17p deletion. A review of the literature found cytogenetic analysis in 35 cases of AML and MDS occurring after ET, 11 of whom had been treated with HU alone. Five of 35 patients had rearrangements that resulted in 17p deletion. Four of them had been treated with HU alone. These results show that treatment with HU alone is associated with a leukemic risk of approximately 3.5%. A high proportion of AML and MDS occurring in ET treated with HU (alone or possibly followed by pipobroman) have morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics of the 17p- syndrome. These findings suggest that widespread and prolonged use of HU in ET may have to be reconsidered in some situations, such as asymptomatic ET.","['Sterkers, Y', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Lai, J L', 'Demory, J L', 'Caulier, M T', 'Wattel, E', 'Bordessoule, D', 'Bauters, F', 'Fenaux, P']","['Sterkers Y', 'Preudhomme C', 'Lai JL', 'Demory JL', 'Caulier MT', 'Wattel E', 'Bordessoule D', 'Bauters F', 'Fenaux P']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU Lille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antisickling Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antisickling Agents/*adverse effects', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Thrombocytosis/chemically induced/*genetics']",1998/01/15 00:00,1998/01/15 00:01,['1998/01/15 00:00'],"['1998/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54856-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jan 15;91(2):616-22.,,,,,,"['Blood. 1998 Aug 15;92(4):1459-60; author reply 1460-1.

These studies evaluated timing of induction therapy and compared postremission chemotherapy with marrow transplantation in 1,206 children. One-hundred eighteen (9.8%) had DS, a fourfold increase in 20 years. DS patients were younger, had lower white blood cell and platelet counts, more antecedent MDS, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia or undifferentiated AML, and an under-representation of chromosomal translocations (P < .001 for each variable). Four-year event-free survival in DS was 69% versus 35% in others (P < .001). Intensively timed induction conferred significantly higher mortality in DS patients; bone marrow transplantation offered no advantage. Conventional induction followed by chemotherapy achieved an 88%, 4-year, disease-free survival in DS patients versus 42% in others (P < .001). Megakaryoblastic leukemia was unfavorable in others but prognostically neutral in DS. AML in DS is demographically and biologically distinct from AML in other children. It is singularly responsive to conventional chemotherapy and may warrant even less therapy.

In vitro and in vivo studies to determine the adhesive and invasive properties of delta SH3 BCR/ABL-expressing cells showed their decreased interaction to collagen IV- and laminin-coated plates and their reduced capacity to invade the stroma and to seed the bone marrow and spleen. The decreased interaction with collagen type IV and laminin was consistent with a reduced expression of alpha 2 integrin by delta SH3 BCR/ABL-transfected 32Dcl3 cells. Moreover, as compared with wild-type BCR/ABL, which localizes primarily in the cytoskeletal/membrane fraction, delta SH3 BCR/ABL was more evenly distributed between the cytoskeleton/membrane and the cytosol compartments. Together, the data indicate that the SH3 domain of BCR/ABL is dispensable for in vitro transformation of hematopoietic cells but is essential for full leukemogenic potential in vivo.","['Skorski, T', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, M', 'Wlodarski, P', 'Wasik, M', 'Trotta, R', 'Kanakaraj, P', 'Salomoni, P', 'Antonyak, M', 'Martinez, R', 'Majewski, M', 'Wong, A', 'Perussia, B', 'Calabretta, B']","['Skorski T', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Wlodarski P', 'Wasik M', 'Trotta R', 'Kanakaraj P', 'Salomoni P', 'Antonyak M', 'Martinez R', 'Majewski M', 'Wong A', 'Perussia B', 'Calabretta B']","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/*genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'src Homology Domains/*genetics']",1998/01/15 00:00,1998/01/15 00:01,['1998/01/15 00:00'],"['1998/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54832-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Jan 15;91(2):406-18.,,,,,,,,,,

Given its intensive treatment regimen and improved survival during the past 20 years, it is likely that a cohort of survivors will result who may incur consequences of therapy, including a second cancer. We used population-based data from the United States and Sweden to estimate risks of second neoplasms in patients with histologically confirmed medulloblastoma (n = 1,262). Overall, there was a 5.4-fold excess of second neoplasms (95 percent confidence interval = 3.3-8.4) based on 20 observed and 3.7 expected cancers. The second cancers occurred eight to 432 months after initial diagnosis (median, 73 months) with significantly elevated ratios for all intervals examined except for less than one year after initial diagnosis. Significantly elevated risks were seen for cancers of the salivary glands, cervix uteri, brain and CNS, thyroid gland, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Of the 15 second cancers with treatment data, seven occurred in the radiation field or within areas of scatter while two others may have been radiation-related. Although based on small numbers of second cancers, the results suggest that as survival increases, some patients with medulloblastoma will have an increased risk of a second cancer, particularly a radiation-related cancer. Thus, as survival improves, late-occurring consequences of diagnosis and treatment will need to be carefully assessed. Identification of patients hypersensitive to radiation therapy, such as those with Gorlin Syndrome, should also be attempted in order to reduce the sequelae from intensive radiation exposure.","['Goldstein, A M', 'Yuen, J', 'Tucker, M A']","['Goldstein AM', 'Yuen J', 'Tucker MA']","['Genetic Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-7372, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Rate', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",1998/01/14 00:00,1998/01/14 00:01,['1998/01/14 00:00'],"['1998/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1018464328836 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1997 Nov;8(6):865-71. doi: 10.1023/a:1018464328836.,,,,,,,,,,

TF-1 cells normally require the presence of exogenous cytokines to proliferate in vitro. TF-1 cells were transfected with constructs containing either the germline granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene or the GM-CSF gene linked to the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) long terminal repeat. The Mo-MuLV-LTR, which contains a strong transcriptional enhancer, was added to stimulate the constitutive expression of the GM-CSF gene. Transfection with the germline GM-CSF gene did not abrogate the cytokine dependence of TF-1 cells, indicating that inheritance of an extra copy did not result in sufficient GM-CSF expression to abrogate cytokine dependence. In contrast, transfection with the LTR-modified GM-CSF gene resulted in the isolation of cells that proliferated in the absence of exogenous GM-CSF. The LTR increased nascent transcription and accumulation of GM-CSF mRNA transcripts, which had a normal half-life. This increase in GM-CSF expression led to secretion of sufficient GM-CSF to support the growth of the parental TF-1 cells. These results indicate that the deregulated expression of human cytokine genes induced by certain retroviral LTRs can result in their conversion into hematopoietic-specific oncogenes. These modified human cell lines provide a model to investigate autocrine transformation and therapy of acute myelogenous leukemia as well as other hematopoietic disorders.","['Hoyle, P E', 'Steelman, L S', 'McCubrey, J A']","['Hoyle PE', 'Steelman LS', 'McCubrey JA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther,"Cytokines, cellular & molecular therapy",9713367,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Autocrine Communication', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytokines/genetics/pharmacology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Viral/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/01/14 00:00,1998/01/14 00:01,['1998/01/14 00:00'],"['1998/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther. 1997 Sep;3(3):159-68.,['R01CA51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Its role, and especially that of soluble IFN-gamma receptor (sIFN-gamma R), in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has not been established. We evaluated the sera of 27 patients following BMT. Fourteen of them underwent uneventful BMT, whereas 13 developed transplant-related complications, including acute GVHD (n = 5), early rejection (n = 4), or relapse of basic disease (n = 4). Soluble IFN-gamma R and IFN levels were evaluated at day -10 (preconditioning), day 0 (day of BMT), day of engraftment, and during BMT-related complications using sIFN-gamma R-specific monoclonal antibodies (McAB) followed by double-sandwich ELISA, and a sensitive radioimmunoassay respectively. In normal controls (n = 80) sIFN-gamma R and IFN-gamma levels in the sera were 0.5 +/- 0.05 and 0.3 +/- 0.04 ng/ml respectively. Soluble IFN-gamma R levels increased in direct correlation with engraftment (0.63 +/- 0.11 ng/ml at the day of BMT to 1.43 +/- 0.16 ng/ml at the day of engraftment; n = 14; P < 0.001). IFN-gamma levels increased in direct correlation with engraftment (0.37 +/- 0.03 ng/ml at the day of BMT to 5.69 +/- 1.64 ng/ml at the day of engraftment; n = 14; P < 0.001).

Similarly, IFN-gamma levels increased from 0.43 +/- 0.08 ng/ml at the day of BMT to 3.03 +/- 0.5 ng/ml at the time of GVHD (P < 0.05). Both graft rejection and early relapse were associated with an elevation of IFN-gamma levels. In short, both s-IFN-gamma R and IFN-gamma were found to be significantly elevated during engraftment and GVHD. Hence these cytokines may be used as a tool for assessing engraftment and AGVHD.","['Toren, A', 'Barak, V', 'Novick, D', 'Nagler, A']","['Toren A', 'Barak V', 'Novick D', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther,"Cytokines, cellular & molecular therapy",9713367,"['0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*blood', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Receptors, Interferon/*blood', 'Solubility', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/01/14 00:00,1998/01/14 00:01,['1998/01/14 00:00'],"['1998/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther. 1997 Sep;3(3):153-8.,,,,,,,,,,

The gene for methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), a purine and methionine metabolic enzyme, resides approximately 100 Kb telomeric to the p16INK4a gene and is frequently co-deleted with the tumor suppressor gene in a variety of cancers. This enzyme deficiency can be exploited for selective chemotherapy with de novo purine synthesis inhibitors and/or methionine depletion. To determine whether ATL can be a candidate for selective chemotherapy based on genetic alterations on chromosome 9p21, we analyzed the MTAP gene in 41 samples from ATL patients (27 acute type and 14 chronic type ATL) and 3 cell lines established from ATL patients. Five samples from the acute type had deletions of the MTAP gene (4 total deletions and 1 partial deletion of exons 6-8). The MTAP gene was always co-deleted with p16INK4a. No deletion of the MTAP gene was detected in samples from the chronic type. Of 3 cell lines, 2 showed partial deletions of exons 5-8 of the MTAP gene, and 1 lost all exons. The p16INK4a gene was deleted in all cell lines. In conclusion, deletions of the MTAP gene were found in 5 of 27 acute type ATL samples. Acute type ATL with MTAP deficiency can be a good candidate for selective chemotherapy by depleting purines and/or methionine.","['Hori, Y', 'Hori, H', 'Yamada, Y', 'Carrera, C J', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Kamihira, S', 'Carson, D A', 'Nobori, T']","['Hori Y', 'Hori H', 'Yamada Y', 'Carrera CJ', 'Tomonaga M', 'Kamihira S', 'Carson DA', 'Nobori T']","['Department of Medicine, Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, USA. yayuyu@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)""]",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*genetics']",1998/01/14 03:34,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/01/14 03:34'],"['1998/01/14 03:34 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/01/14 03:34 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19980105)75:1<51::AID-IJC9>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980105)75:1<51::aid-ijc9>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1998 Jan 5;75(1):51-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19980105)75:1<51::aid-ijc9>3.0.co;2-0.,['CA64976/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,
