(1993) J. Leukocyte Biol. 53, 208-212; Kotani et al. (1994) Hum. Gene Ther. 5, 19-28). Centrifugation was investigated as a means of increasing the transduction of a retroviral vector for gene transfer into cells with the potential for transplantation and engraftment in human patients suffering from genetic disease, i.e., gene therapy. It was found that centrifugation significantly increased the rate of transduction into adherent murine fibroblasts and into non-adherent human hematopoietic cells, including primary CD34+ enriched cells. The latter samples include cells capable of reconstitution of hematopoiesis in myeloablated patients. As a step toward optimization of this method, it was shown that effective transduction is: (1) achieved at room temperature; (2) directly related to time of centrifugation and to relative centrifugal force up to 10,000 g; (3) independent of volume of supernatant for volumes > or = 0.5 ml using non-adherent cell targets in test tubes, but dependent upon volume for coverage of adherent cell targets in flat bottom plates; and (4) inversely related to cell numbers per tube using non-adherent cells. The results support the proposal that centrifugation increases the reversible binding of virus to the cells, and together with results reported by Hodgkin et al. (Hodgkin et al. (1988) J. Virol. Methods 22, 215-230), these data support a model in which the centrifugal field counteracts forces of diffusion which lead to dissociation during the reversible phase of binding.","['Bahnson, A B', 'Dunigan, J T', 'Baysal, B E', 'Mohney, T', 'Atchison, R W', 'Nimgaonkar, M T', 'Ball, E D', 'Barranger, J A']","['Bahnson AB', 'Dunigan JT', 'Baysal BE', 'Mohney T', 'Atchison RW', 'Nimgaonkar MT', 'Ball ED', 'Barranger JA']","['Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['DK 43709/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 44935/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Line', '*Centrifugation', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0166-0934(95)00035-S [pii]', '10.1016/0166-0934(95)00035-s [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 1995 Aug;54(2-3):131-43. doi: 10.1016/0166-0934(95)00035-s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By immunoblot analysis, rHDC74 and rHDC54 were shown to be localized predominantly in the particulate and soluble fractions, respectively. rHDC74 exhibited histamine-synthesizing activity equivalent to that of rHDC54. The existence of 74- and 54-kDa HDCs was also confirmed in the particulate and supernatant fractions of the cell lysate, respectively, from the human basophilic leukemia cell line KU-812-F. The ratio of HDC activity to immunoreactivity was similar for the two forms of the enzyme. The specific activity of purified rHDC54 (1.12 mumol/mg/min) was comparable to those of HDCs from other mammalian tissues or cells. The purified rHDC54 was eluted as a monomer form from a Superdex-200 column; the molecular mass of the enzyme was approximately 54 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without 2-mercaptoethanol. The HDC activity of rHDC54 significantly decreased on dialysis against buffer without pyridoxal 5'-phosphate; addition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to the dialysate readily increased in the enzyme activity to the original activity. Taken together, these results suggest that human HDC functions as both 74- and 54-kDa forms having equivalent HDC activity, which are localized in the particulate and soluble fractions, respectively, and that the latter form exhibits its activity as a monomer form.","['Yatsunami, K', 'Tsuchikawa, M', 'Kamada, M', 'Hori, K', 'Higuchi, T']","['Yatsunami K', 'Tsuchikawa M', 'Kamada M', 'Hori K', 'Higuchi T']","['Pharmaceutical Basic Research Laboratories, Japan Tobacco, Inc., Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 4.1.1.22 (Histidine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA Primers', 'Histidine Decarboxylase/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Spodoptera', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/22 00:00,1995/12/22 00:01,['1995/12/22 00:00'],"['1995/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.51.30813 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)31204-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Dec 22;270(51):30813-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.51.30813.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we report on the identification and characterization of several conformationally restricted retinoids, which selectively bind and activate RX receptors. Under the influence of retinoids, HL-60 myelocytic leukemia cells differentiate into granulocytes. This effect is mediated by RAR alpha, as has been demonstrated through the use of a selective RAR alpha antagonist (Apfel, C., Bauer, F., Crettaz, M., Forni, L., Kamber, M., Kaufmann, F., LeMotte, P., Pirson, W., and Klaus, M. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 7129-7133). Here, we show that conformationally restricted RXR-specific retinoids, at doses that are per se inactive, are able to potentiate by up to one order of magnitude the pro-differentiating effects of all-trans retinoic acid and an RAR alpha-selective synthetic retinoid. We also present evidence that these RXR-selective ligands are able to bind to a DNA RXR.RAR heterodimer complex. This finding demonstrates that agonists for RARs and RXRs can synergistically promote HL-60 differentiation, which could be mediated through a heterodimer of these receptors.","['Apfel, C M', 'Kamber, M', 'Klaus, M', 'Mohr, P', 'Keidel, S', 'LeMotte, P K']","['Apfel CM', 'Kamber M', 'Klaus M', 'Mohr P', 'Keidel S', 'LeMotte PK']","['Department of Dermatology, F.

Three of the peptides, HP-1, HP-2, and HP-3, differ by only one amino acid, and it is thought that HP-2 may represent a proteolytic product of HP-1 and/or HP-3. To help determine the relationship of these three proteins, we isolated a nearly full-length cDNA encoding HP-1 with a sequence very similar to, but different from, the previously isolated HP-1 and -3 cDNAs. Gene copy number experiments established that there were at least two but fewer than five defensin genes with a high level of similarity to the HP-1 cDNA (HP-1/3-like). Three genomic clones were isolated that contained two different configurations of the HP-1/3-like sequences. Sequencing established that one encoded the HP-1 peptide, whereas the other encoded HP-3. Analysis of DNAs obtained from 18 unrelated individuals by Southern blot analysis revealed the expected fragments as well as additional fragments that were not present in the genomic clones. This suggested the possibility of alleles; however, when DNAs from families were examined, these fragments did not segregate in an obvious Mendelian fashion. The HP-1/3-like defensin genes are on human chromosome 8. Surprisingly, somatic cell hybrid mapping showed that the number of HP-1/3-like genes on isolated copies of chromosome 8 was variable. We conclude that individuals can inherit versions of chromosome 8 harboring either two or three copies of the genes that encode the HP-1, HP-2, and/or HP-3 peptides.","['Mars, W M', 'Patmasiriwat, P', 'Maity, T', 'Huff, V', 'Weil, M M', 'Saunders, G F']","['Mars WM', 'Patmasiriwat P', 'Maity T', 'Huff V', 'Weil MM', 'Saunders GF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Defensins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (alpha-Defensins)', '0 (human neutrophil peptide 1)', '0 (human neutrophil peptide 2)', '0 (human neutrophil peptide 3)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Bactericidal Activity/*genetics', 'Blood Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'DNA/blood/isolation & purification', 'DNA Primers', 'Defensins', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Library', 'Hominidae/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Nuclear Family', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/isolation & purification', '*alpha-Defensins']",1995/12/22 00:00,1995/12/22 00:01,['1995/12/22 00:00'],"['1995/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.51.30371 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)31142-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Dec 22;270(51):30371-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.51.30371.,['GENBANK/X52053'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether GM-CSF activates signaling pathways through a protein kinase A-dependent or -independent pathway, we measured cAMP levels following GM-CSF or forskolin treatment of TF-1 cells. Forskolin but not GM-CSF stimulation resulted in an increase in cAMP levels. Transient transfection assays with TF-1 cells were also performed with a -116-nucleotide egr-1 promoter construct and the protein kinase inhibitor, PKI.

Here, we demonstrate that the Fc receptor gamma chain associates with Fc alpha R in transfected IIA1.6 B lymphocytes. Fc alpha R could be expressed at the surface of IIA1.6 B cells by itself, but was devoid of signaling capacity. Upon co-expression of FcR gamma chain, a physical interaction with Fc alpha R could be demonstrated. This association proved crucial for the triggering of both proximal (intracellular calcium increase and tyrosine phosphorylation), as well as distal (IL-2 release), signal transduction responses. We next tested the hypothesis that a positively charged arginine residue (Arg209) within the transmembrane domain of Fc alpha R promotes association with FcR gamma chain. We therefore constructed Fc alpha R molecules where Arg209 was mutated to either a positively charged histidine, a negatively charged aspartic acid, or an uncharged leucine. A functional association between Fc alpha R and FcR gamma chain was observed only with a positively charged residue (Arg209 or His209) present within the Fc alpha R transmembrane domain. These data show that transmembrane signal transduction by the Fc alpha R is mediated via FcR gamma chain, and that Fc alpha R requires a positively charged residue within the transmembrane domain to promote functional association.","['Morton, H C', 'van den Herik-Oudijk, I E', 'Vossebeld, P', 'Snijders, A', 'Verhoeven, A J', 'Capel, P J', 'van de Winkel, J G']","['Morton HC', 'van den Herik-Oudijk IE', 'Vossebeld P', 'Snijders A', 'Verhoeven AJ', 'Capel PJ', 'van de Winkel JG']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Fc(alpha) receptor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Arginine', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression', 'Histidine', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Fc/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/15 00:00,1995/12/15 00:01,['1995/12/15 00:00'],"['1995/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.50.29781 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)45787-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Dec 15;270(50):29781-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.50.29781.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax also activates the transcription of cellular genes such as interleukin 2, interleukin 2 receptor (IL2R), GM-CSF, vimentin, c-fos, c-jun as well as the major histocompatibility complex class I genes. Tax does not bind DNA directly, but seems to activate transcription indirectly by enhancing the activity of the transcription factors that recognize responsive elements located in the promoters of the Tax-responsive genes, or by forming ternary complexes with these factors and DNA. One class of target sites for Tax are the kappa B sequences which are bound by members of the rel/NF-kappa B family. It has been previously shown that Tax is able to induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B. The activity of the NF-kappa B transcription factor is normally controlled through cytoplasmic retention by either of two types of molecules: the inhibitor I kappa B alpha/MAD3 or the p105 and p100 precursors of the p50 and p52 DNA-binding subunits. Treatment of cells with classical NF-kappa B inducers like TNF, IL-1, PMA or LPS results in MAD-3 degradation followed by nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B. On the other hand, the mechanisms involved in the dissociation of the cytoplasmic p105/p100-containing complexes are largely unknown. We demonstrate here that Tax can induce translocation of members of the NF-kappa B family retained in the cytoplasm through interaction with either p105 or p100. On the other hand Tax induces no apparent degradation of MAD-3. These results suggest that Tax activates NF-kappa B essentially through the p105/p100-retention pathway.","['Munoz, E', 'Israel, A']","['Munoz E', 'Israel A']","[""Unite de Biologie Moleculaire de l'Expression Genique, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*immunology']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(11)80535-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0171-2985(11)80535-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1995 Jul;193(2-4):128-36. doi: 10.1016/s0171-2985(11)80535-8.,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these cells, erythropoietin stimulation led to the rapid phosphorylation of several proteins including the erythropoietin receptor and proteins with molecular masses around 45 kDa which could be mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Separation of cytosol from resting or erythropoietin-stimulated UT-7 cells by anion-exchange chromatography revealed two peaks of myelin basic protein kinase activity. The kinase activity of the first peak was independent of erythropoietin treatment of the cells and corresponded to an unidentified 50-kDa kinase, whereas the second peak was only present in erythropoietin-stimulated cells and corresponded to three forms of MAP kinases with molecular masses of 45, 44 and 42 kDa. The three forms were separated by hydrophobic chromatography and were shown to be activated in erythropoietin-stimulated cells. The 44-kDa and 42-kDa forms corresponded to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1 and ERK-2, respectively. Evidence was obtained showing that the 45-kDa form is not a shifted form of ERK-1 but corresponded to a less well defined form of MAP kinase which may be the previously described ERK-4. MAP kinase activation was detected after 1 min erythropoietin stimulation and remained detectable after more than 1 hour. A role for MAP kinase activation in erythropoietin-stimulated cell proliferation was suggested by the simultaneous inhibition of erythropoietin-induced MAP kinase stimulation and cell proliferation. The potential activator of MAP kinase, RAF-1, was hyperphosphorylated in erythropoietin-stimulated cells and its autophosphorylation activity was strongly increased. The protein adaptor Shc was heavily phosphorylated in UT-7 erythropoietin-stimulated cells and associated strongly with a unidentified 145-kDa protein. However, Shc bound poorly to the activated erythropoietin receptor and most Shc proteins were cytosolic in both unstimulated and erythropoietin-stimulated cells. In contrast, Grb2 associated efficiently with the activated erythropoietin receptor and a significant part of Grb2 was associated to a particulate subcellular fraction upon erythropoietin stimulation.","['Gobert, S', 'Duprez, V', 'Lacombe, C', 'Gisselbrecht, S', 'Mayeux, P']","['Gobert S', 'Duprez V', 'Lacombe C', 'Gisselbrecht S', 'Mayeux P']","['Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire (ICGM), Institut de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM U363), Universite Rene Descartes, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1995/11/15 00:00,1995/11/15 00:01,['1995/11/15 00:00'],"['1995/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.075_c.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1995 Nov 15;234(1):75-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.075_c.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Osmotic diuresis: the importance of counting the number of osmoles excreted.,401-5,"Polyuria is usually the result of a water diuresis or an osmotic diuresis. Traditionally, the assessment of the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume and the concentration of Na+ in plasma is sufficient to differentiate between the two. We present a case and our approach, which is based on calculations and quantitation of osmoles, to demonstrate the utility of this approach. A patient with diabetes mellitus, human T-cell lymphocyte virus, type 1 (HTLV-1) associated lymphoma, and hypercalcemia presented with marked ECF volume contraction and polyuria. A spot urine osmolality was 567 mOsm/kg H2O in the face of urine output of approximately 6 L/d. The initial diagnosis was an osmotic diuresis. However, a quantitative analysis revealed the enormous number of osmoles could not be accounted for physiologically. Hence, we postulated a water diuresis to be the cause of the polyuria. To confirm this hypothesis, we found that at different times during his hospitalization, the urine specific gravity ranged from 1.005 to 1.022, and urine output varied markedly over 8-h periods. Despite a plasma sodium of 147 mmol/L, the patient did not complain of thirst. Taken together, this suggested the presence of a hypothalamic lesion which caused central diabetes insipidus with variable output of antidiuretic hormone together with a blunted thirst response.

This suggests that these cytokines might share common signaling pathways. We previously reported that CNTF augments the levels of corticosterone (CS) and of IL-6 induced by IL-1 and induces the production of the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA). Since the elevation of serum CS is an important feedback mechanism to limit the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor (TNF), we have investigated the effect of CNTF on both TNF production and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To induce serum TNF levels, LPS was administered to mice at 30 mg/kg i.p. and CNTF was administered as a single dose of 10 micrograms/mouse i.v., either alone or in combination with its soluble receptor sCNTFR alpha at 20 micrograms/mouse. Serum TNF levels were the measured by cytotoxicity on L929 cells. In order to measure the effects of CNTF on LPS-induced TNF production in the brain, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with 2.5 micrograms/kg LPS. Mouse spleen cells cultured for 4 hr with 1 microgram LPS/ml, with or without 10 micrograms CNTF/ml, were also analyzed for TNF production. RESULTS: CNTF, administered either alone or in combination with its soluble receptor, inhibited the induction of serum TNF levels by LPS. This inhibition was also observed in the brain when CNTF and LPS were administered centrally. In vitro, CNTF only marginally affected TNF production by LPS-stimulated mouse splenocytes, but it acted synergistically with dexamethasone (DEX) in inhibiting TNF production. Most importantly, CNTF administered together with sCNTFR alpha protected mice against LPS-induced mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CNTF might act as a protective cytokine against TNF-mediated pathologies both in the brain and in the periphery.","['Benigni, F', 'Villa, P', 'Demitri, M T', 'Sacco, S', 'Sipe, J D', 'Lagunowich, L', 'Panayotatos, N', 'Ghezzi, P']","['Benigni F', 'Villa P', 'Demitri MT', 'Sacco S', 'Sipe JD', 'Lagunowich L', 'Panayotatos N', 'Ghezzi P']","['Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Serum Amyloid A Protein)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Corticosterone/blood', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nerve Growth Factors/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Serum Amyloid A Protein/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",1995/07/01 00:00,1995/07/01 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Med. 1995 Jul;1(5):568-75.,,,PMC2229956,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The t(14,18) chromosomal translocation, which results in a fusion messenger RNA containing the entire coding region of BCL-2 and a portion of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, is commonly found in follicular lymphoma and appears to play a role in lymphomagenesis by inhibiting cell death. We tested the hypothesis that downregulation of BCL-2 would decrease accumulation of follicular lymphoma cells by treating the t(14,18)-carrying follicular lymphoma cell line WSU-FSCCL in vitro with antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) directed against BCL-2. We found dose-dependent, sequence-specific inhibition of cell accumulation by an antisense unmodified ODN directed at codons 2 to 7, which downregulated BCL-2 protein levels.

The pre-B leukemia cell line REH showed no sequence-specific growth inhibition by the antisense ODN at these concentrations, and BCL-2 protein levels were not altered.

When mice with J2E erythroleukemias were treated with MuIFNs in vivo, an extension of their life span was observed. Moreover, numerous necrotic lesions of infiltrating leukemic cells were detected in the spleens of these mice. Finally, ex vivo treatment of leukemic bone marrow cells with Epo and MuIFNs delayed mortality even further.

The mAb 12/1-2 has previously been shown to react with HTLV-I p19, HTLV-II p22, and antigens of normal human thymic epithelium, placenta, and foreskin, whereas mAb 13B12 binds only to the carboxyl terminus of HTLV-I p19. In the present study, mAb 12/1-2 bound to a subset of Triton X-100-insoluble intermediate filaments in human thymic epithelium also recognized by antikeratin antibodies AE1 and AE3. The mAb 12/1-2 also reacted in Western blot assays with proteins of 54, 46, and 40 kDa present in extracts of human thymic epithelium and with hexameric peptides containing overlapping sequences of HTLV-I p19 with the amino acids IPP (amino acids 117-119). In contrast, the HTLV-I-specific mAb 13B12 did not bind to human thymic epithelium and reacted with a single hexameric peptide containing the carboxy-terminal HTLV-I p19 sequence IPPPYV (amino acids 117-122). Binding of mAb 12/1-2 to thymic epithelium could be inhibited by adsorption with peptide SP-79 containing a C-terminal sequence (amino acids 112-125) of p19. The crossreactive IPP site is within a region of p19 that has been previously shown to be highly immunogenic in HTLV-I-infected individuals and that is also encoded by genes or mRNA of human cytokeratin 17, keratin 4, epidermal cytokeratin 2, and 50-kDa type I epidermal keratin. Thus, our studies define the sequence of a cross-reactive antigen on HTLV-I p19 that is also associated with keratin intermediate filaments from human thymic epithelium and other normal human tissues and that could serve as a focus of an autoimmune response during HTLV-I infection.","['Palker, T J', 'Singer, K H', 'Vahlne, A']","['Palker TJ', 'Singer KH', 'Vahlne A']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],['CA40660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,9501482,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p19 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cross Reactions/immunology', 'Epithelium/immunology', 'Epitopes/chemistry/immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Antigens/chemistry/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Keratins/chemistry/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rabbits', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00042560-199601010-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1996 Jan 1;11(1):10-9. doi: 10.1097/00042560-199601010-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mast cells and differentiated HL-60 human leukemic cells are useful model systems for the analysis of receptor-independent G-protein activation. We compared the effects of 2-phenylhistamines which are cationic-amphiphilic, too, and of MP on G-protein activation in dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated HL-60 cells and in the rat basophilic leukemia cell line, RBL 2H3. In HL-60 cells, 2-phenylhistamines show stimulatory effects which resemble those of formyl peptide receptor agonists but which cannot be attributed to agonism at classical receptors. 2-phenylhistamines do not, however, activate RBL 2H3 cells and various other myeloid cell types, pointing to cell type-specificity of receptor-independent G-protein activation. In HL-60 cells, MP shows effects on G-protein activation which differ substantially from those of formyl peptides. In RBL 2H3 membranes, MP shows similar effects on G-protein activation as in HL-60 membranes. We develop a model according to which receptor-independent G-protein activation can be subdivided into direct and indirect receptor-independent G-protein activation. In case of the former mechanism, substances like 2-phenylhistamines interact with G-protein alpha-subunits and in case of the latter mechanism, substances like MP interact with nucleoside diphosphate kinase which catalyzes the formation of GTP.

Twelve additional patients were administered methotrexate (MTX) + CsA+antibody LO-Tact-1, 0.4 mg/kg/day from day -1 to day +28. The antibody was well tolerated. Engraftment was not affected.

GVHD contributed to death in four patients who were administered CsA+LO-Tact-1 and in one patient who was administered MTX+CsA+LO-Tact-1. Chronic GVHD occurred in two patients who were treated with CsA+LO-Tact-1 and in two patients treated with MTX+CsA+LO-Tact-1. Throughout therapy, serum levels of LO-Tact-1 ranged from 2 to 10 mg/l. There was no correlation between serum levels of LO-Tact-1 and the occurrence of GVHD. GVHD occurred in 10 patients during LO-Tact-1 prophylaxis. There was no significant difference between relapse or survival rates among the patient groups.

Twenty-eight children underwent respiratory function tests regularly at all scheduled times (pre-BMT, +6 months, +1, +2, +3, +4 years after BMT). Vital capacity and total lung capacity showed a slight continuous decrease which was significant at 4 years after BMT (P = 0.015 and P = 0.003 respectively). The decline of forced expiratory volume in 1 s observed 1 year after BMT (P = 0.002) was roughly maintained over time. However, no children complained of symptoms attributable to respiratory dysfunction, and all indices studied were always within normal limits in almost all patients.

Twenty-eight out of 76 cytaphereses collected in 15 patients with CML proved to contain Ph-ve cells only (six patients), 21 showed only Ph+ve cells (five patients), and 27 a mixture of Ph+ve and Ph-ve cells (four patients). In cytaphereses containing Ph-ve cells only, we found variable numbers of LTC-ICs, more consistently when we mobilized patients in the first 3 months from diagnosis. In three cases cytogenetic analysis on LTC-ICs and CFU-GM confirmed results obtained on fresh samples. Ph-positive collections were devoid of LTC-ICs except for 2/21 samples. However, their cytogenetic analysis revealed a small number of Ph-negative progenitors. LTC-ICs were randomly detected in mixed (Ph+ve and Ph-ve) collections. In conclusion these data indicate that, in a consistent proportion of chronic myeloid leukemia patients, intensive chemotherapy is able to recruit Ph-ve LTC-ICs in to the peripheral blood. Moreover these data provide the biological basis for developing autografting programs with Ph-negative cells.","['Podesta, M', 'Piaggio, G', 'Frassoni, F', 'Sessarego, M', 'Benvenuto, F', 'Figari, O', 'Pitto, A', 'Vassallo, F', 'Soracco, M', 'Pollicardo, N']","['Podesta M', 'Piaggio G', 'Frassoni F', 'Sessarego M', 'Benvenuto F', 'Figari O', 'Pitto A', 'Vassallo F', 'Soracco M', 'Pollicardo N', 'et al.']","['Hematology and Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['*Cytapheresis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1995 Oct;16(4):549-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the mutational status of the N-ras gene and the FLR exon of codons 1371-1423 of the open reading frame of the full-length NF1 cDNA, which has a strong homology with the mammalian ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP), especially for a stretch of three consecutive amino acids (F, L, R), by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing in samples from patients with AML. Of 48 AML patients, 10 (21%) had point (missense) mutations of the N-ras gene involving codons 12, 13 and 61. However, mutations in the FLR exon of the NF1 gene were not detected in any of the AML samples. We also examined the difference of clinical response to induction therapy between AML patients with and without N-ras mutation. A significantly lower rate of complete remission was noted in individuals with N-ras gene mutations. These results suggest that mutation of the NF1 gene, at least in the FLR exon, is very rare in AML and the NF1 gene probably is not a functional complement of the N-ras gene mutation.

Expression of mdr-1 mRNA in CMK11-5 cells, a well differentiated subline, was higher than in CMK6 cells, a poorly differentiated subline. The level of P-glycoprotein was also higher in CMK11-5 cells. The cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), GM-CSF and IL-3, which were shown to induce megakaryocytic differentiation of CMK cells, enhanced the expression of the mdr-1 mRNA and levels of P-glycoprotein. These results imply that differentiated megakaryocytic cells may have higher levels of the P-glycoprotein expression, suggesting a possible normal physiological function of P-glycoprotein in mature megakaryocytes.","['Sato, T', 'Ota, S', 'Kakuda, H', 'Miura, N', 'Niimi, H', 'Ito, M', 'Asai, T', 'Tsuruo, T', 'Fuse, A']","['Sato T', 'Ota S', 'Kakuda H', 'Miura N', 'Niimi H', 'Ito M', 'Asai T', 'Tsuruo T', 'Fuse A']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Chiba University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509059654 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Aug;18(5-6):515-20. doi: 10.3109/10428199509059654.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in exons 20 to 24 of the RB-1 gene (exons where mutations predominate in retinoblastoma and other solid tumors) were analyzed by single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP). RB-1 protein was studied in bone marrow plasma cells by immunocytochemistry (ABC peroxidase technique) with a specific monoclonal antibody. Southern blot analysis of RB-1 gene was also performed in 20 of the patients. Twenty two patients analyzed had advanced disease (stage III or, in one case, plasma cell leukemia) and cytogenetic analysis (performed in 31 cases) found monosomy 13 in 9 patients. No rearrangement of the RB-1 gene was found by Southern analysis. Absent or greatly reduced RB-1 protein level was found in plasma cells in 4 of the patients (11%), whereas normal levels were seen in the remaining cases. No point mutation in exons 20 to 24 and their flanking introns were found in any of the 35 patients. Three of the 4 patients with absent or reduced RB-1 protein expression had advanced MM (stage III: 2 cases; plasma cell leukemia: 1 case); all 4 patients were resistant to treatment (as compared to 7 of the 31 patients with normal RB-1 protein levels); only one of them was subsequently found to have monosomy 13 (as compared to 9 of the 28 other karyotyped patients). Our findings suggest that abnormalities of the RB-1 gene and its expression are rare in MM. Absent or reduced expression of RB-1 protein was not significantly correlated to monosomy 13 and was not associated with gross rearrangements of the RB-1 gene by Southern analysis or point mutations in exons 20 to 24 of the gene. Reduced expression of RB-1 protein may be associated with advanced disease and poor response to treatment, although larger numbers of patients will be required for more adequate conclusions.","['Zandecki, M', 'Facon, T', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Vanrumbeke, M', 'Vachee, A', 'Quesnel, B', 'Lai, J L', 'Cosson, A', 'Fenaux, P']","['Zandecki M', 'Facon T', 'Preudhomme C', 'Vanrumbeke M', 'Vachee A', 'Quesnel B', 'Lai JL', 'Cosson A', 'Fenaux P']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, A, C.H.U.

Here, the clinical experience and side effects with FAMP are reported in 77 patients with pretreated CLL (59 B-CLL, 2 T-CLL) and low-grade NHLs (9 immunocytic lymphomas including 5 Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, 2 centrocytic (cc) and 5 centroblastic-centrocytic (cb-cc) NHLs). 70/77 patients are evaluable for response. All except 8 patients were pretreated with one to four different regimens and had progressive disease. FAMP was administered at a dosage of 25 mg/m2 daily for 5 days as 30 minute infusion every fifth week. Partial (PR) or complete remission (CR) was achieved in 38/56 (68%) and 3/56 (5%) of evaluable patients with CLL, respectively. In 7/8 (1 x CR, 6 x PR) evaluable patients with immunocytic lymphoma and in 3/6 (3 x PR) patients with cc or cb-cc lymphoma remissions were obtained. The probability of progression-free survival was 66% and the event-free survival was 25% and 22% at 12 and 18 months. The median progression-free survival until relapse or death, however, was only 7 months (2-20+). Major toxic effects included infections in 22 patients (grade 3 and 4 WHO), granulocytopenia (mainly grade 3) and nausea in 8 patients (mainly grade 1). 19/22 patients were in PR at the time of occurrence of infectious complications. Meanwhile, 14 patients died due to septicaemia, pneumonia or other infections. Nine patients developed severe septicaemia, 4 patients had pneumocystis carinii or aspergillus pneumonias. The high infection rate may not only be due to hypogammaglobulinaemia and granulocytopenia induced by FAMP but also to a remarkable decrease of CD4+ cells from a median of 2479 to 241 CD4+ cells/microliters after 6 cycles of FAMP. In one case a tumor lysis syndrome was observed. No CNS toxicity was noted. It is concluded that FAMP is effective even in patients with advanced CLL and low-grade NHLs refractory to multiple chemotherapy regimens. However, FAMP has a marked suppressive effect on granulocytes and T-lymphocytes, predominantly CD4+ lymphocytes.","['Fenchel, K', 'Bergmann, L', 'Wijermans, P', 'Engert, A', 'Pralle, H', 'Mitrou, P S', 'Diehl, V', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Fenchel K', 'Bergmann L', 'Wijermans P', 'Engert A', 'Pralle H', 'Mitrou PS', 'Diehl V', 'Hoelzer D']","['Medical Clinic III, J.

Therapy-associated modulation of T cell and NK reactivity was monitored for one year from initiation in autologous mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell reactions and cytotoxicity directed against autologous CML cells, respectively. During the course of IFN-therapy, NK activity against autologous CML cells increased steadily, whereas T cell reactivity fluctuated randomly. Despite the high level of T cell reactivity to autologous tumor cells in short-term (6 days) culture, 1) they failed to respond to synthetic peptides corresponding to the bcr/abl fusion sequence of the patient, and 2) only one proliferative T cell clone (TCC) was isolated which specifically recognized HLA-DR-matched CML cells. This TCC appeared not to recognize synthetic peptides corresponding to the bcr/abl fusion sequence of the patient; the antigen to which it responds remains unknown. To assess potential immunogenicity of bcr/abl peptides, it was attempted to sensitize T cells from normal donors in vitro. Of 109 cell lines obtained from seven different donors, eleven showed peptide-dependent proliferation. Therefore, although these results show that it is possible to isolate apparently CML-specific T cells from patients, as well as to prime T cells against tumor-specific peptide in vitro, the frequency of such T cell-mediated reactivity appears low and its relevance to anti-leukemic effects questionable. On the other hand, the strong time-dependent enhancement of natural killing of autologous CML blasts during IFN-alpha treatment, a phenomenon not observed for T cell reactivity, suggests that natural immunity may be more important in controlling disease.","['Pawelec, G', 'Da Silva, P', 'Max, H', 'Kalbacher, H', 'Schmidt, H', 'Bruserud, O', 'Zugel, U', 'Baier, W', 'Rehbein, A', 'Pohla, H']","['Pawelec G', 'Da Silva P', 'Max H', 'Kalbacher H', 'Schmidt H', 'Bruserud O', 'Zugel U', 'Baier W', 'Rehbein A', 'Pohla H']","['Section for Transplantation Immunology and Immunohematology, University of Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Peptides)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509059647 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Aug;18(5-6):471-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199509059647.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structure of DTK suggests that it may function as a cell adhesion molecule, and mediate cell-to-cell or cell-matrix interactions between hematopoietic cells and their respective microenvironments.","['Crosier, P S', 'Hall, L R', 'Vitas, M R', 'Lewis, P M', 'Crosier, K E']","['Crosier PS', 'Hall LR', 'Vitas MR', 'Lewis PM', 'Crosier KE']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Teratoma/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509059643 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Aug;18(5-6):443-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199509059643.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-glycoprotein was determined by Western blot analysis. Samples from 14 patients (9 AML, 5 ALL) had undetectable mdr1 RNA levels at initial analysis. Only two of these had detectable levels after chemotherapy. Ten patients (8 AML, 2 ALL) had detectable mdr1 RNA levels at initial analysis (median 1.0 transcript per cell, range 0.2-1.4). Increase of mdr1 RNA levels after chemotherapy were observed in cells from 3 patients, one patient had a lower level after chemotherapy and the 6 remaining patients had essentially unchanged mdr1 RNA levels in their leukemic cells. Samples from 13 patients were sequentially analysed for P-glycoprotein expression. In one patient, no P-glycoprotein was detectable at initial analysis but was weakly positive after chemotherapy. In the remaining 12 patients, P-glycoprotein levels stayed stable during disease progression. In conclusion, combination chemotherapy seems only rarely to be associated with an increase of mdr1 gene expression in residual leukemic cells. The addition of resistance modifiers to chemotherapy in order to overcome P-glycoprotein mediated resistance might therefore be more effective in chemotherapy naive patients since it is possible that during later disease progression additional mechanisms of resistance may be more operative.","['Gruber, A', 'Arestrom, I', 'Albertioni, F', 'Bjorkholm, M', 'Peterson, C', 'Vitols, S']","['Gruber A', 'Arestrom I', 'Albertioni F', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Peterson C', 'Vitols S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509059642 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Aug;18(5-6):435-42. doi: 10.3109/10428199509059642.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect is further increased by addition of other cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL3, IL4, Stem cell factor (SCF), while Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) seem to exert an inhibitory activity. An autocrine production of G-CSF by AML cells, a paracrine production by accessory cells and a protective effect displayed by G-CSF against programmed cell death could partially contribute to explain the pathogenesis of AML. In vivo, G-CSF has been used after chemotherapy in AML, in order to improve hemopoietic recovery in patients at high risk of infection.

This holds true not only for in-vitro model systems, but has also been elegantly shown in-vivo, as in colorectal cancer. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most frequent leukemia in Western countries and occurs mainly in elderly patients, suggesting that in this form of leukemia, cumulative molecular lesions may be necessary for transformation. However, the molecular background is unknown in most cases. Cytogenetic aberrations may be used as markers for genes involved in the process of malignant transformation. In CLL, the most frequently observed structural cytogenetic lesion is a deletion/translocation involving the long arm of chromosome 13, a region where the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb-gene) has been mapped (13q14). Many groups have studied the question as to whether alterations of the Rb-gene play a causal role in the pathogenesis of CLL. This review deals with recent data indicating that i) the Rb-gene may be altered in a minority of CLL cases, and ii) there may be another gene localized on chromosome 13q14 that may be important in the molecular biology of CLL.","['Neubauer, A', 'Richiero, K', 'Huhn, D']","['Neubauer A', 'Richiero K', 'Huhn D']","['Abteilung fur Innere Medizin mS Hamatologie/Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Freien Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509059637 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Aug;18(5-6):399-404. doi: 10.3109/10428199509059637.,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In normal cells, it is the most ubiquitously expressed protein in the B lymphocyte lineage. CD19 expression is induced at the point of B lineage commitment during the differentiation of the hematopoietic stem cell, and its expression continues through preB and mature B cell differentiation until it is finally down-regulated during terminal differentiation into plasma cells. CD19 expression is maintained in B-lineage cells that have undergone neoplastic transformation, and therefore CD19 is useful in diagnosis of leukemias and lymphomas using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and flow cytometry. Interestingly, CD19 is also expressed in a subset of acute myelogenous leukemias (AMLs) indicating the close relationship between the lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Because B lineage leukemias and lymphomas rarely lose CD19 expression, and because it is not expressed in the pluripotent stem cell, it has become the target for a variety of immunotherapeutic agents, including immunotoxins. Treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) with anti-CD19 mAbs coupled to biological toxins has proven to be effective in vitro and in animal models, and has shown some promising results in Phase I clinical trials. Recently, the analysis of anti-CD19 effects on lymphoma cell growth has highlighted a novel mechanism of immunotherapy. Engagement of cell surface receptors like CD19 by mAbs can have anti-tumor effects by the activation of signal transduction pathways which control cell cycle progression and programmed cell death (apoptosis).","['Scheuermann, R H', 'Racila, E']","['Scheuermann RH', 'Racila E']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9072, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD19/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cell Cycle', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199509059636 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995 Aug;18(5-6):385-97. doi: 10.3109/10428199509059636.,,94,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent finding that genes for the IL-3 and GM-CSF receptor alpha chain subunits colocalise to a small region of the pseudoautosomal region and the observation that the LIF receptor locus is present in a cluster of receptor genes on chromosome 5 suggest the possibility that subsets of cytokine receptor genes may be organised into clusters. This possibility is discussed and the potential significance of cytokine receptor gene clusters is assessed. Several of the receptor genes are known to be involved in inherited disorders and there is evidence to suggest lesions in cytokine receptor genes could have a role in leukaemia.

In this cell line, Fc gamma RII stimulation induced mobilization of free intracellular calcium and actin polymerization. Yet, no significant histamine release was observed, nor did blood basophils stimulated by anti-Fc gamma RII monoclonal antibody IV.3 and by a secondary antibody release histamine. These data indicate that Fc gamma RII stimulation induces cellular signaling events such as calcium mobilization in human basophils. However, these events do not lead to histamine release.","['Kawata, N', 'Takata, M', 'Suwaki, T', 'Tanimoto, Y', 'Soda, R', 'Takahashi, K', 'Kimura, I']","['Kawata N', 'Takata M', 'Suwaki T', 'Tanimoto Y', 'Soda R', 'Takahashi K', 'Kimura I']","['Department of Medicine II, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', '*Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, IgG/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000237228 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 1996 Jan;109(1):27-34. doi: 10.1159/000237228.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their utility for these purposes has been circumscribed by the limited host range and relatively low titer of available producer clones. Pseudotyping of MuLV particles with the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope protein (VSV-G), expressed transiently in cells producing MuLV Gag and Pol proteins, has yielded vector preparations with a broader host range that can be concentrated by ultracentrifugation. We have explored the use of steroid-inducible and tetracycline-modulated promoter systems (necessary because the VSV-G protein is toxic to cells when constitutively expressed) to derive stable producer cell lines capable of substantial production of VSV-G pseudotyped MuLV particles. A packaging cell line and producer clones capable of expressing a chimeric transcription factor, composed of the tetracycline repressor (tetR) and the VP16 trans-activating sequences of herpes simplex virus VP16 gene and containing the VSV-G coding sequences linked to a minimal promoter having seven tandem copies of the tetracycline responsive operator (tetO), exhibited high levels of VSV-G protein expression when cultured in the absence of tetracycline. Vector particles, produced at titers of 10(5)-10(6) infectious colony forming units per ml (cfu/ml), could be concentrated effectively by ultracentrifugation yielding vector preparations having a titer of 10(9) cfu/ml. These cell lines grew normally when VSV-G protein expression was repressed by tetracycline.

We recently detected an MLL gene rearrangement in a patient with typical T-cell ALL (CD2+, CD4+, CD5+, CD7+, CD8+, HLA DR-) and an apparently normal karyotype (46,XX). The rearrangement was cloned and characterized; a DNA fragment distal to the breakpoint was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to 19p13, indicating that the leukemic blasts had undergone a cytogenetically undetected rearrangement involving chromosomes 11 and 19. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay demonstrated an in-frame fusion mRNA between the amino terminus of MLL and the carboxy terminus of ENL (also known as MLLT1 or LTG19), a gene that has been mapped to 19p13. In addition, MLL sequences distal (telomeric) to the breakpoint were deleted from the genome, which precludes the formation of a reciprocal ENL/MLL fusion protein. These findings suggest that an MLL/ENL fusion protein (and not a reciprocal ENL/MLL fusion) was likely to be pathogenic in this patient, and they reinforce previous studies showing that leukemic blasts with apparently normal karyotype may harbor MLL rearrangements. Additionally, this report provides the first conclusive evidence of an MLL/ENL gene fusion characterized at a molecular level in a patient with T-cell ALL.","['Chervinsky, D S', 'Sait, S N', 'Nowak, N J', 'Shows, T B', 'Aplan, P D']","['Chervinsky DS', 'Sait SN', 'Nowak NJ', 'Shows TB', 'Aplan PD']","['Department of Pediatrics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],['600333/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.2870140114 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1995 Sep;14(1):76-84. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870140114.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rates of accumulation of the mercaptopurine (MP) metabolites thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) and methylmercaptopurine nucleotides (MeMPs) were measured in the cell fractions from the start of MP continuing chemotherapy. 3. TGNs and MeMP metabolites were present in all the red cell fractions after 3 days oral MP. There was no significant difference between the metabolite concentrations measured in either young, middle-aged or old cells (Mann-Whitney P = 1.0 to 0.12). 4. These observations suggest that MP metabolites do not enter red cells at the stem cell level at the start of therapy. 5. With respect to the monitoring of therapy, these results suggest that the concentration of TGNs after 7 to 10 days MP could be used to predict eventual steady-state concentrations using a simple model.","['Rostami-Hodjegan, A', 'Lennard, L', 'Lilleyman, J S']","['Rostami-Hodjegan A', 'Lennard L', 'Lilleyman JS']","['University of Sheffield Department of Medicine and Pharmacology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)'],IM,"['Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy', '*Erythrocyte Aging', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2125.1995.tb05776.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 1995 Sep;40(3):217-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1995.tb05776.x.,,,PMC1365100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Y124D.hIL-4 antagonizes the proliferative effects of hIL-4 on human phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Y124D.hIL-4 is a potent stimulator for CT.h4S cells. Molecular modelling studies were performed to investigate the stability of different conformations of residue 124 as well as the efficiency of different molecular mechanics force fields in homology modelling. We suggest that the aspartate substitution alters the C-terminal end of the D-helix in such way that the analogue still binds to the human IL-4 receptor alpha-chain and signals through the murine gamma c-chain. In contrast, the Y124D.hIL-4/IL-4 receptor complex cannot signal through the human gamma c-chain.","['Davis, I D', 'Treutlein, H R', 'Friedrich, K', 'Burgess, A W']","['Davis ID', 'Treutlein HR', 'Friedrich K', 'Burgess AW']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Melbourne Tumour Biology Branch, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/metabolism', '*Cell Division', 'Computer Graphics', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Receptors, Interleukin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Water']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08977199509003215 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 1995;12(1):69-83. doi: 10.3109/08977199509003215.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, germ-line mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene has been implicated in this familial disorder. We report a case of a 25-year old woman who presented with bilateral breast cancer and uterine leiomyoma. Her mother had died of early-onset bilateral breast cancer. And her younger sister had breast carcinoma as well, which was identified at the age of 22, indicating her strong familial history. To test for the presence of the p53 germ-line mutation, we analyzed the genomic DNA from the peripheral blood of the proband and her sister by PCR-SSCP analysis of exon 5 through exon 8 of the p53 gene. As a result, a p53 mutation in exon 7 was detected in an allele, and it was shared with her sister as the same pattern. Sequencing analysis determined the altered nucleotide at codon 248(CGG > TGG) which is one of the most frequent mutation sites related to LFS. Therefore, this patient has the most consistent characteristic features of LFS phenotype and it is believed that this case is the first report of a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome carrying the p53 germ-line mutation in Korea.","['Bang, Y J', 'Kang, S H', 'Kim, T Y', 'Jung, C W', 'Oh, S M', 'Choe, K J', 'Kim, N K']","['Bang YJ', 'Kang SH', 'Kim TY', 'Jung CW', 'Oh SM', 'Choe KJ', 'Kim NK']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Korea', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pedigree', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3346/jkms.1995.10.3.205 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 1995 Jun;10(3):205-10. doi: 10.3346/jkms.1995.10.3.205.,,,PMC3054118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell treatment with antisense oligonucleotides, at a concentration of 20 microM, followed by hexamethylenebisacetamide induction, produced a specific 2-fold increase in the differentiation rate of both slowly and rapidly differentiating murine erythroleukaemia cell clones. Cell permeabilization by a cationic lipid resulted in a decrease of one order of magnitude in the amounts of antisense oligonucleotides necessary to elicit the maximal response, and accelerated the kinetics of the stimulatory effect. These changes in murine erythroleukaemia cell differentiation rates, observed in both cell clones, were associated with 60% and 50% decreases, respectively, in delta PKC immunoreactive protein in slowly and rapidly differentiating cells. The present results indicate strongly that basal levels of delta PKC in murine erythroleukaemia cells are essential in regulating the initial differentiation rate of these cells in response to chemical induction, and provide further evidence that this PKC isoform plays a fundamental role in maintaining the undifferentiated phenotype of murine erythroleukaemia cells.","['Pessino, A', 'Passalacqua, M', 'Sparatore, B', 'Patrone, M', 'Melloni, E', 'Pontremoli, S']","['Pessino A', 'Passalacqua M', 'Sparatore B', 'Patrone M', 'Melloni E', 'Pontremoli S']","['Institute of Biological Chemistry, University of Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'Protein Kinase C/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3120549 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Dec 1;312 ( Pt 2):549-54. doi: 10.1042/bj3120549.,,,PMC1136297,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This receptor, isolated from platelets, has an apparent molecular mass on SDS/PAGE of 252 kDa and is chromatographed by gel filtration as an oligomer of about 1 x 10(6) kDa. [3H]InsP3 bound to a single class of sites on the purified receptor protein with a Kd of 27 nM and a Bmax. of 2.2 nmol/mg of protein. The platelet InsP3 receptor, like the rodent cerebellar receptors, was identified immunochemically as a type 1 receptor, but unlike its brain counterparts bound poorly to concanavalin A and other lectins and was not significantly phosphorylated by protein kinase A. All cultured megakaryocytic leukaemia cell lines (e.g. Dami, CHRF-288 and Meg-01) and HEL cells were also immunopositive for type 1 receptor, which was substantially increased in some cases by DMSO or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) which induce further megakaryocytic differentiation. Normal mixed lymphocyte and granulocyte fractions and an enriched T-cell fraction from human blood had measurable InsP3-binding activity, but no detectable type 1 protein. In contrast, Jurkat E6-1 (T-cell lymphoma) cells and the transformed B-cell line RPMI 8392 were immunopositive for type 1 receptor. HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukaemia) cells had no detectable type 1 receptor unless they were stimulated to differentiate along monocyte/macrophage lines by PMA. We conclude that: (1) of the major normal blood cells only platelets contain type 1 InsP3 receptors; (2) some neoplastic transformed blood cell lines also express type 1 receptors, in contrast to their normal counterparts; and (3) increased levels of type 1 InsP3 receptor are induced in some transformed cells under conditions that favour their further terminal differentiation.","[""O'Rourke, F"", 'Matthews, E', 'Feinstein, M B']","[""O'Rourke F"", 'Matthews E', 'Feinstein MB']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington 06030, USA.']",['eng'],"['HL 18937/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 42454-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (ITPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium Channels/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cerebellum/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3120499 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Dec 1;312 ( Pt 2):499-503. doi: 10.1042/bj3120499.,,,PMC1136290,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer and Leukemia Group B Thoracic Surgeons.",1337-40,"BACKGROUND: Lymph node metastasis has been shown to be an important prognosticator in esophageal cancer. A prospective, multiinstitutional study of thoracoscopic lymph node staging in patients with biopsy-proven esophageal cancer was undertaken at University of Maryland, Medical University of South Carolina, and Brigham and Women's Hospital. METHODS: Forty-nine patients underwent thoracoscopic staging between September 1991 and August 1993. Five procedures were incomplete due to adhesions. Preoperative computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, esophageal ultrasound, and bronchoscopy were performed. After our initial experience with the left side of the chest, thoracoscopic staging was done through the right side of the chest unless specific indications dictated otherwise. Beginning in January 1993 routine laparoscopic/mini-laparotomy lympho node staging of the celiac axis was performed. RESULTS: Satisfactory thoracoscopic lymph node staging was achieved in 44 patients (95%). Of 33 patients undergoing esophageal resection, 29 were correctly staged (88%). Since initiating concomitant laparoscopic lymph node staging, we have correctly staged all of the last 9 patients with regard to celiac lymph nodes as well. Information regarding T status obtained at thoracoscopy was as follows: 3 patients were correctly ""downstaged"" to T3 despite preoperative noninvasive tests suggesting T4. In 2 patients thoracoscopy correctly predicted T4 invasion, whereas in 2 patients, thoracoscopy missed T4 lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracoscopy is a valuable tool for staging intrathoracic tumors. Preoperative staging of esophageal cancer may allow better allocation of adjuvant therapy. This pilot study suggests that thoracoscopic staging can correctly predict thoracic lymph node status with high accuracy and aid in better defining T status.","['Krasna, M J', 'Reed, C E', 'Jaklitsch, M T', 'Cushing, D', 'Sugarbaker, D J']","['Krasna MJ', 'Reed CE', 'Jaklitsch MT', 'Cushing D', 'Sugarbaker DJ']","['Department of Surgery, University of Maryland Medical System, Baltimore 21201, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Netherlands,Ann Thorac Surg,The Annals of thoracic surgery,15030100R,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*pathology/surgery', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology/surgery', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Preoperative Care', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Thoracoscopy/methods']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003497595006407 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-4975(95)00640-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Thorac Surg. 1995 Nov;60(5):1337-40. doi: 10.1016/0003-4975(95)00640-7.,,,,['Ann Thorac Surg. 1996 Oct;62(4):1237-9.

Taking into account clinical and biological informations is necessary to deal with difficult cases, in using in addition to microscopic observations, a compromise of analytic data which must be rapidly available in a data bank by cross references research. In comparison with other pathological applications, the sampling problem is specially crucial in hematologic cases, for which it is necessary to observe at high resolution a fairly high number of microscopic fields, from the peripheral blood and bone marrow smears, in addition to samples of histopathologic sections from bone marrow and/or lymph-node. A previous teleconsultation of an extensive data bank appears as being one of the best way to reduce the procedure of telediagnosis to the only difficult cases, for which clear responses cannot be found in the data bank. A link between the access to the data bank and the telediagnosis procedures appears to be a fundamental approach.

Possible explanations for the relationship between these two disorders are discussed.","['Vasef, M A', 'Zaatari, G S', 'Chan, W C', 'Sun, N C', 'Weiss, L M', 'Brynes, R K']","['Vasef MA', 'Zaatari GS', 'Chan WC', 'Sun NC', 'Weiss LM', 'Brynes RK']","['Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['*Dendritic Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*complications', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*complications/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/chemistry/*complications/pathology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/104.6.696 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1995 Dec;104(6):696-701. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/104.6.696.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in vivo and in vitro studies has demonstrated that in pharmacological doses it can differentiate leukemic cells in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). ATRA has been shown to induce complete remission (CR) rates of approximately 90% in newly diagnosed and first relapsing APL. However, CR induced by ATRA alone are usually not sustained and intensive antileukemic consolidation therapy is required to prolong remission. ATRA followed by intensive chemotherapy has improved the outcome of newly diagnosed APL, by increasing the CR rate and by reducing the risk of relapse.

The hybrid tyrosinase-LTR was transferred to the proviral 5' LTR following viral packaging and infection of target cell lines. Hybrid tyrosinase-LTR-driven IL-2 production was barely above background levels in infected nonmelanoma cell lines containing intact provirus, whereas infected melanoma cell lines expressed high levels of IL-2 and the larger tyrosinase promoter/enhancer fragment directed higher levels of transgene expression. By replacing the viral enhancer with the tyrosine promoter/enhancer sequences, promoter interference effects which we have previously observed when the tyrosinase promoter was included as an internal promoter within a similar retroviral vector were effectively abolished. Our data show that the hybrid tyrosinase-LTR behaves as a tightly regulated melanocytic-specific regulatory element when embedded in an enhancer-deleted Mo-MLV LTR. The use of other heterologous cellular promoter/enhancer elements in similar vectors should allow the development of simpler, targeted retroviral vectors for the expression of genes in selected cell types and may eventually provide for the development of safer, more efficient vectors for use in human gene therapy.","['Vile, R G', 'Diaz, R M', 'Miller, N', 'Mitchell, S', 'Tuszyanski, A', 'Russell, S J']","['Vile RG', 'Diaz RM', 'Miller N', 'Mitchell S', 'Tuszyanski A', 'Russell SJ']","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratory of Cancer Gene Therapy, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', 'EC 1.14.18.1 (Monophenol Monooxygenase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Monophenol Monooxygenase/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682285799230 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1995.9923 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1995 Dec 1;214(1):307-13. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.9923.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FB29 led to only very mild neurological dysfunctions with longer incubation periods. Pathological alterations were characterized by mild (FB29) to extensive (NT40) noninflammatory spongiform degeneration, mainly of brain-stem areas. Infectious center assays revealed that viral titers in brain tissues of NT40-infected rats were 100-fold higher than those of FB29-infected animals. Employing immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and flow cytometry, NT40 was found to infect many endothelial cells of brain blood vessels and microglia, whereas FB29 infected only microglia and those to a lower extent. However, when isolated from adult diseased rats, microglial cells turned out in both cases to be nonproductively infected with either FB29 or NT40. Of peripheral organs, we found enhanced levels of NT40 in peritoneal macrophages but not in spleen, thymus, or serum when compared to FB29.

Here we describe the interactions of recombinant BLV Tax with cellular bZip proteins. The recombinant BLV Tax, tagged at the carboxy terminus with a hexahistidine extension, was prepared by solubilization in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and renaturation on the Ni(2+)-chelating Sepharose gel matrix. The renatured BLV TaxH6 activates the BLV LTR when introduced into HeLa cells by scrape loading. Furthermore, the purified BLV TaxH6 enhances binding of members of the CREB/ATF family of bZip proteins to CRE motifs by interacting with their bZip domains in vitro. Chemical cross-linking indicates that dimerization of bZip proteins such as CREB becomes greatly facilitated in the presence of BLV Tax. These results suggest that BLV Tax interacts directly with CREB/ATF-like factors to activate viral mRNA transcription.","['Boros, I M', 'Tie, F', 'Giam, C Z']","['Boros IM', 'Tie F', 'Giam CZ']","['Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA48709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (G-Box Binding Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (transactivator protein p38(tax))']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cattle', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'G-Box Binding Factors', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(85)79939-4 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1995.9939 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1995 Dec 1;214(1):207-14. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.9939.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recognition of antigen/MHC complexes by the T cell receptor delivers the first signal, while a second signal, delivered by the cell surface receptors CD80 and/or CD86 binding to the T cell surface molecule CD28, has been shown to be effective for the initiation of effective T cell responses. While some of the cytoplasmic effector molecules involved in T cell receptor signaling is known, little is known regarding those involved in the co-stimulation of T cells by CD28. Using the T cell leukemic cell line Jurkat as a model for T cell activation, we demonstrate that cross-linking CD28 using monoclonal antibodies causes tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase/ERK. This activation was rapid, peaking at approximately 5 minutes post CD28 cross-linking, and transient. Activation of MAP kinase/ERK occurred 3 fold less efficiently in a Jurkat line lacking functional p56lck (JCAM.1), and was almost undetectable in a line lacking CD45 (J45.01). These results suggest that CD28 cross-linking can activate intracellular signaling pathways via several different tyrosine kinases. Thus CD28 signaling can activate src family kinases lck and fyn, as well as the Tec family kinase emt/itk. Activation of any one or a combination of these tyrosine kinases may be sufficient for the activation of MAPK following CD28 cross-linking.

Similar responses have been observed in B-cells following stimulation of MHC class II molecules, including the increased production of intracellular cAMP. In this report, we demonstrate that the ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase is a responsive signaling element following cross-linking of HLA-DR in class II+ T-cells, and that the homologous tyrosine kinase p72syk is stimulated in B-cells following ligation of class II antigens. Antibody mediated co-ligation of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR/CD3) with class II molecules resulted in augmented tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70. Comparable to antibody induced receptor ligation, bacterial superantigen (SEA and SEB) treatment of HLA-DR+ T-cells stimulated ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation, consistent with class II transmembrane signaling by ligation of HLA-DR and V beta in cis. Modulation of the TCR/CD3 led to abrogation of class II induced ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation, but did not result in sequestering of ZAP-70 from the cellular cytoplasm. Hyperphosphorylated ZAP-70 was associated with TCR/CD3 zeta-chain following cross-linking of HLA-DR, suggesting a mechanism for the TCR/CD3-dependence of class II induced signals in alloantigen-activated human T-cells. In both tonsillar B-lymphocytes and B-cell leukemia lines, p72syk was rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following HLA-DR cross-linking. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p72syk induced through ligation of either the B-cell antigen receptor or class II molecules was potently inhibited by herbimycin A. MHC class II ligation on B-lymphocytes resulted in cell death, which was both qualitatively distinct from Fas-induced apoptosis and partially protected by herbimycin A pretreatment. Thus, ligation of MHC class II molecules expressed on human lymphocytes stimulates the ZAP-70/p72syk family of tyrosine kinases, leading functionally to a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway of receptor-induced cell death.","['Kanner, S B', 'Grosmaire, L S', 'Blake, J', 'Schieven, G L', 'Masewicz, S', 'Odum, N', 'Ledbetter, J A']","['Kanner SB', 'Grosmaire LS', 'Blake J', 'Schieven GL', 'Masewicz S', 'Odum N', 'Ledbetter JA']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Enzyme Precursors/*analysis/chemistry/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/chemistry/immunology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*analysis/chemistry/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Syk Kinase', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1995.tb03113.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1995 Sep;46(3 ( Pt 1)):145-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1995.tb03113.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technique and results in a series of 27 cases.,924-7,"Between early 1992 and December 1994, laparoscopic splenectomy was performed in 27 patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP), hairy-cell leucemia, HIV, or Hodgkin's disease. In all cases medical treatment, especially cortisone therapy, failed. In Hodgkin's disease the splenectomy was combined with liver biopsies and dissection of parailiacal, paraaortic, and mesenteric lymph nodes for abdominal staging. The operation was performed using four trocars; the splenic vessels were divided by a linear stapler. In general the spleen was removed in a bag through a slightly enlarged trocar incision or after morcellation. Three patients needed a small laparotomy for the removal (laparoscopic assisted). In a recent case of Hodgkin's disease the intact spleen was removed via posterior colpotomy. In 22 of 27 cases (81%) the operation was finished laparoscopically. Five times a conversion to conventional laparotomy was necessary because of bleeding of enlarged lymph nodes at the hilum. Wound infections occurred in two cases. In one patient with ITP the platelet count did not improve and continuous blood loss led to relaparotomy at the 1st postoperative day. No surgical bleeding was found. All patients tolerated a fluid diet at the 1st postoperative day and hospitalization time was 4.4 days (range 3-14). Regarding the low complication rate and the advantages of a smaller abdominal trauma in the postoperative period, the laparoscopic approach for elective splenectomy and laparoscopic abdominal staging has a substantial benefit for the patients.","['Emmermann, A', 'Zornig, C', 'Peiper, M', 'Weh, H J', 'Broelsch, C E']","['Emmermann A', 'Zornig C', 'Peiper M', 'Weh HJ', 'Broelsch CE']","['Chirurgische Klinik, Universitatskrankenhaus Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Surg Endosc,Surgical endoscopy,8806653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/surgery', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenectomy/*methods', 'Thrombocytopenia/surgery']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Surg Endosc. 1995 Aug;9(8):924-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcr-Abl enhances JNK function as measured by transcription from Jun responsive promoters and requires Ras, MEK kinase (MAPK/ERK kinase kinase), and JNK to do so.

These hairpins, which are variations on a sequence found in the reverse transcript of the human T-cell leukemia virus 2 (HLV2), show elevated melting points and high chemical stability toward denaturation by urea. Hairpins with the 5'-CGXYAG configuration have melting points 18-20 degrees higher than hairpins with 5'-CAXYGG or 5'-GGXYAC configurations. The identities of the looping bases, X and Y above, play a negligible role in determining the stability of this DNA hairpin stability. This is very different from G-A based loops in RNA, where the third base must be a purine for high stability [the GNRA loops; V.P. Antao, S.Y. Lai and I. Tinoco, Jr (1991) Nucleic Acids Res., 19, 5901-5905]. We show that these properties are associated with a four base helix unit that contains both a sheared GA base pair and a Watson-Crick CG base pair upon which it is stacked. As an understanding of the significance of AG base pairs has become increasingly important in the structural biology of nucleic acids, we compute an 0.7-0.9 A precision ensemble of NMR solution structures using iterative relaxation matrix methods. Calculations performed on NMR-derived structures indicate that neither base-base electrostatic interactions, nor base-solvent dispersive interactions, are significant factors in determining the observed differences in hairpin stability.

Among these proteins is a 130-kDa protein, identified as p130cas, that forms a stable complex in vivo with v-Crk. We have explored the role of endogenous Crk proteins in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells. In the K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, p130cas is not tyrosine phosphorylated or bound to Crk. Instead, Crk proteins predominantly associate with the tyrosine-phosphorylated proto-oncogene product of Cbl. In vitro analysis showed that this interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of Crk and can be inhibited with a phosphopeptide containing the Crk-SH2 binding motif. In NIH 3T3 cells transformed by Bcr-Abl, c-Cbl becomes strongly tyrosine phosphorylated and associates with c-Crk. The complex between c-Crk and c-Cbl is also seen upon T-cell receptor cross-linking or with the transforming, tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl. These results indicate that Crk binds to c-Cbl in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner, suggesting a physiological role for the Crk-c-Cbl complex in Bcr-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated transformation.","['Ribon, V', 'Hubbell, S', 'Herrera, R', 'Saltiel, A R']","['Ribon V', 'Hubbell S', 'Herrera R', 'Saltiel AR']","['Department of Physiology, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor 48109, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Protein v-crk)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Cbl protein, mouse)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Protein v-crk', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'src Homology Domains']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.1.45 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Jan;16(1):45-52. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.1.45.,,,PMC230977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eventually, activation in presumably very few cells initiates rapid superinfection leading to viremia and leukemia, but the processes leading to provirus activation are unknown. Differences in the onset and development of viremia between several mouse strains carrying an endogenous Mo-MuLV (Mov lines) are attributed to a chromosomal position effect, but neither cell type nor stage of provirus activation is known for any strain. We have now monitored the appearance of viral transcripts and particles in the Mov13 strain, which carries the Mo-MuLV provirus in inverted orientation in the first intron of a collagen gene (Col1a1) with well-characterized transcriptional activity. We report obligatory tissue- and stage-specific virus activation in osteoblasts and odontoblasts. The significance of this activation pattern is indicated by the fact that of the great variety of cells expressing the wild-type collagen gene, only these two cell types can also transcribe the mutant allele including its viral insert. We propose that this transcription of the proviral genome, albeit in the opposite direction, leads to the activation of the viral promoter.","['Moser, T', 'Harbers, K', 'Kratochwil, K']","['Moser T', 'Harbers K', 'Kratochwil K']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone and Bones/virology', 'Collagen/genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/*growth & development', 'Odontoblasts/virology', 'Osteoblasts/virology', 'Pregnancy', 'Proviruses/*genetics/*growth & development', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Activation/*genetics', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.16.1.384 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Jan;16(1):384-9. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.1.384.,,,PMC231013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to their distinct activities in vivo, however, most homeodomain proteins bind indiscriminately to potential target sites in vitro, suggesting the involvement of cofactors which specify target site selection. One such cofactor, termed extradenticle, has been shown to influence segmental morphogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster by binding cooperatively with certain homeodomain proteins to target regulatory elements. Here we demonstrate that STF-1, an orphan homeodomain protein required for pancreatic development in mammals, binds cooperatively to DNA with Pbx, the mammalian homolog of extradenticle. Cooperative binding with Pbx requires a pentapeptide motif (FPWMK) which is well conserved among a large subset of homeodomain proteins. The FPMWK motif is not sufficient to confer Pbx cooperativity on other homeodomain proteins, however; the N-terminal arm of the STF-1 homeodomain is also essential. As cooperative binding with Pbx occurs on only a subset of potential STF-1 target sites, our results suggest that Pbx may specify target gene selection in the developing pancreas by forming heterodimeric complexes with STF-1.","['Peers, B', 'Sharma, S', 'Johnson, T', 'Kamps, M', 'Montminy, M']","['Peers B', 'Sharma S', 'Johnson T', 'Kamps M', 'Montminy M']","['Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology, Salk Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 protein)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster/physiology', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Islets of Langerhans/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Morphogenesis', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Somatostatin/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.12.7091 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 Dec;15(12):7091-7. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.12.7091.,,,PMC230964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, activation of the signalling pathway controlled by the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase prevents apoptosis and promotes cell division of a number of different cell types in vivo. We have investigated the consequences of activating the Kit signalling pathway by its ligand Steel factor on these opposing functions of the p53 protein in Friend erythroleukemia cells. A temperature-sensitive p53 allele (Val-135) was introduced into the Friend erythroleukemia cell line (DP-16) which lacks endogenous p53 expression. At 38.5 degrees C, the Val-135 protein maintains a mutant conformation and has no effect on cell growth. At 32 degrees C, the mutant protein assumes wild-type properties and induces these cells to arrest in G1, terminally differentiate, and die by apoptosis. We demonstrate that Steel factor inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis and differentiation but has no effect on p53-mediated G1/S cell cycle arrest. These results demonstrate that Steel factor functions as a cell survival factor in part through the suppression of differentiation and apoptosis induced by p53 and suggest that cell cycle arrest and apoptosis may be separable functions of p53.","['Abrahamson, J L', 'Lee, J M', 'Bernstein, A']","['Abrahamson JL', 'Lee JM', 'Bernstein A']","['Program in Molecular Biology and Cancer, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Valine']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.12.6953 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 Dec;15(12):6953-60. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.12.6953.,,,PMC230950,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was controlled over 14 years and presented multiple infectious episodes, in various locations, throughout the evolution, some being very severe and generally caused by gram-negative germs. Likewise, during this time the patient received different treatments (oxymetholone, prednisone and lithium carbonate) with no hematologic response being observed. The leukocyte count remained around 3 x 10(9)/L with a mean proportion of neutrophils of 12% with no variations being found in the bone marrow aspirates carried out throughout the evolution (total of 9). At 14 years the diagnosis of MDS evolved to ANLL. The patient died shortly after the acute transformation due to respiratory failure secondary to bilateral pneumonia. In this case three peculiar features are of note: the almost exclusive involvement of the granulopoietic series without either anemia or thrombocytopenia, the long evolution of AREB, with acute transformation 14 years after diagnosis and the severity of the infections, among which recurrent lingual granulopenic ulcers were of note.","['Las Heras, G', 'Marti, J M', 'Villamor, N', 'Ribera, J M', 'Feliu, E', 'Rozman, C']","['Las Heras G', 'Marti JM', 'Villamor N', 'Ribera JM', 'Feliu E', 'Rozman C']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona.']",['spa'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/complications/*diagnosis', 'Neutropenia/blood/complications/*diagnosis', 'Recurrence']",1995/11/11 00:00,1995/11/11 00:01,['1995/11/11 00:00'],"['1995/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1995 Nov 11;105(16):619-21.,,12,,,Neutropenia intensa de 14 anos de duracion como unica manifestacion de un sindrome mielodisplasico.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical results and risk factors in 70 patients].,605-11,"BACKGROUND: The 10 year experience of a single center performing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in 70 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is analyzed. METHODS: Seventy patients transplanted for CML between November 1982 and October 1992 were evaluated. Fifty-two patients were in the first chronic phase (FC), 10 in an accelerated phase, 4 in blast crisis and 4 in the second chronic phase. The combination of cyclosporin and methotrexate was the most commonly used prophylactic schedule for graft versus host disease (GVHD) (60 cases) and T depletion was not performed in any case. The combination of cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and total body irradiation was used in 48 patients with the remaining patients received busulfan (16 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg). The estimation of survival was performed using the Kaplan-Meier limit product method. The prognostic factors influencing survival, disease free period and relapse were evaluated by Cox multivariate models of proportional risk. RESULTS: Actuarial survival at four years was 40% (95% Cl: 26-58%). Multivariate analysis selected variables associated with lower survival, the presence of acute GVHD (relative risk-RR-4.75), advanced disease phase (RR: 3.26) and age over 30 years (RR: 3.57). Eleven patients had relapsed. Multivariate analysis found the absence of chronic GVHD (RR: 5.3) and advanced phase (RR: 1.91) to be associated to a higher probability of relapse. In a separate analysis of the 48 patients transplanted in chronic phase who received cyclosporin and methotrexate, the disease free survival was longer for those under the age of 30 years (71.4% vs. 36%) without acute GVHD (68.8% vs. 39.6%) and those transplanted from a male donor (64.6% vs. 30%). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced phase of the disease, the presence of acute graft versus host disease and the age and female sex of the donor are the main factors associated to shorter survival in allogeneic bone marrow transplant for chronic myeloid leukemia. In contrast, the presence of chronic graft versus host disease decreases the possibilities of relapse.","['Tomas, J F', 'Penarrubia, M J', 'Garcia, J A', 'Figuera, A', 'Gomez-Garcia de Soria, V', 'Steegmann, J L', 'Arranz, R', 'Camara, R', 'Gabriel, R', 'Vazquez, L']","['Tomas JF', 'Penarrubia MJ', 'Garcia JA', 'Figuera A', 'Gomez-Garcia de Soria V', 'Steegmann JL', 'Arranz R', 'Camara R', 'Gabriel R', 'Vazquez L', 'et al.']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario La Princesa, Universidad Autonoma, Madrid.']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/11/11 00:00,1995/11/11 00:01,['1995/11/11 00:00'],"['1995/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1995 Nov 11;105(16):605-11.,,,,,Trasplante alogenico de medula osea en la leucemia mieloide cronica.

Our published work has shown that this nonresponsive state is specific and not due to clonal deletion or irreversible functional inactivation of antiviral CTL precursors. In the present study, an alternative mechanism based on the presence of inhibitory AKR.H-2b cells was examined. Irradiated or mitomycin C-treated AKR.H-2b spleen cells function as in vitro stimulator cells in the generation of C57BL/6 (B6) anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL, consistent with their expression of viral antigens. In contrast, untreated viable AKR.H-2b spleen cells functioned very poorly as stimulators in vitro. Viable AKR.H-2b spleen cells were also able to cause dramatic (up to > or = 25-fold) inhibition of antiviral CTL responses stimulated in vitro by standard AKR/Gross MuLV-induced tumor cells. This inhibition was specific: AKR.H-2b modulator spleen cells did not inhibit allogeneic major histocompatibility complex-specific CTL production, even when a concurrent antiviral CTL response in the same culture well was inhibited by the modulator cells. These results and those of experiments in which either semipermeable membranes were used to separate AKR.H-2b modulator spleen cells from AKR/Gross MuLV-primed responder cells or the direct transfer of supernatants from wells where inhibition was demonstrated to wells where there was antiviral CTL responsiveness argued against a role for soluble factors as the cause of the inhibition. Rather, the inhibition was dependent on direct contact of AKR.H-2b cells in a dose-dependent manner with the responder cell population. Inhibition was shown not to be due to the ability of AKR.H-2b cells to function as unlabeled competitive target cells. Exogenous interleukin-2 added at the onset of the in vitro CTL-generating cultures partially restored the antiviral response that was decreased by AKR.H-2b spleen cells. Positive and negative cell selection studies and the development of inhibitory cell lines indicated that B lymphocytes and both CD4- CD8+ and CD4+ CD8- T lymphocytes from AKR.H-2b mice could inhibit the generation of AKR/Gross virus-specific CTL in vitro. AKR.H-2b macrophages were shown not to be required to demonstrate AKR/Gross MuLV-specific inhibition, however, confirming that the inhibition by T-cell (or B-cell)-depleted spleen populations was dependent on the enriched B-cell (T-cell) population per se.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Rich, R F', 'Green, W R']","['Rich RF', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA.']",['eng'],['CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects/radiation effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.1.402-414.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Jan;70(1):402-14. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.1.402-414.1996.,,,PMC189830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the requirement for CD8+ T cells was overcome by inclusion of additional TH and B-cell epitopes in the immunizing protein. These additional epitopes primed for more rapid production of virus-neutralizing antibody which appeared to limit virus spread sufficiently to protect even in the absence of CD8+ T cells. Inclusion of an immunodominant CTL epitope in the vaccine was not sufficient to overcome dependence on CD4+ T cells.

Over 60% of the viral DNA from cytopathic infections bore deletions in pol. Characterization of DNA sequences adjoining the deletions revealed that the junctions were most often flanked by RNA splice donor and acceptor consensus motifs. A thymidine-to-cytidine mutation introduced at the +2 position of one RNA splice donor-like motif inhibited formation of the two most prevalent viral DNA species with deletions, confirming the origin of many proviruses with deletions from reverse transcription of aberrantly spliced viral RNA species. An example of deletion by misalignment was also characterized. Viral inocula obtained from cells recovered after cytopathic infections were attenuated in their ability to cause cytopathic effects (CPE) and were able to confer superinfection resistance to naive FeT-cells, despite maintaining envelope gene (env) sequences with full cytopathic potential. This suggested that viral genomes with deletions, rather than being required for cytopathicity, play a role in protecting cells from CPE.

We performed genetic analyses to examine the biochemical contribution of these residues in a productive virus-receptor interaction. Altered ATRC1 receptors bearing either a phenylalanine, a tryptophan, a histidine, or a methionine at position 235 mediated ecotropic virus entry comparable to that mediated by ATRC1. In contrast, altered ATRC1 receptors bearing alanine, threonine, serine, or proline at position 235 exhibited a 300- to 10,000-fold decrease in receptor capability. Furthermore, substitution of tyrosine or phenylalanine into the corresponding position (242) of the homologous human protein that lacks ecotropic virus receptor capability resulted in acquisition of ecotropic virus receptor function comparable to that of ATRC1. Substitution of a tryptophan or a histidine at that position of the human protein, however, resulted in a much-reduced receptor capability, suggesting a preference for a benzene ring in the hydrophobic side chain. A similar analysis of proteins substituted at position 237 revealed that aspartic acid, but not arginine or lysine, can functionally substitute for glutamic acid 237 in ATRC1 or at the corresponding position in the human protein. These results suggest a requirement for an acidic and a nearby hydrophobic amino acid for efficient ecotropic virus entry. Similar motifs have been identified in the virus binding sites of other retrovirus receptors, suggesting that the initial step of retrovirus entry may be governed by a common mechanism.","['Malhotra, S', 'Scott, A G', 'Zavorotinskaya, T', 'Albritton, L M']","['Malhotra S', 'Scott AG', 'Zavorotinskaya T', 'Albritton LM']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, College of Medicine, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163, USA.']",['eng'],['AI33410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Glutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', '*Receptors, Virus', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.1.321-326.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Jan;70(1):321-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.1.321-326.1996.,,,PMC189820,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive fusion of CD4-positive cells with the chimeric protein containing a truncated MuLV cytoplasmic tail was observed. In contrast, no cell fusion activity was found for the chimeric protein with a full-length MuLV cytoplasmic tail. We constructed another SIV-MuLV chimeric protein in which the MuLV R peptide was added to an SIV envelope protein cytoplasmic tail 17 amino acids from its membrane-spanning domain. No fusion activity was observed within this construct, while the corresponding truncated SIV envelope protein lacking the R peptide showed extensive fusion activity. No significant difference in the transport or surface expression was observed among the various SIV-MuLV chimeric proteins and the truncated SIV envelope protein. Our results thus demonstrate that the MuLV R peptide has profound inhibitory effects on virus-induced cell fusion, not only with MuLV but also in a distantly related retroviral envelope protein which utilizes a different receptor and fuses different cell types.","['Yang, C', 'Compans, R W']","['Yang C', 'Compans RW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI 28147/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 34242/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (p15E protein, Murine leukemia virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA, Viral', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/metabolism', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.70.1.248-254.1996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Jan;70(1):248-54. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.1.248-254.1996.,,,PMC189811,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite increasing participation in clinical trials, there is a clear need for pre-clinical models. Heterotransplantation of surgical specimens directly into the anterior chamber of the nude mouse eye has been demonstrated to produce evaluable xenografts. Drug access in this model is considered to mimic the blood-brain barrier. Five clinical specimens in 3 children with primitive neuroectodermal tumor/medulloblastoma were the sources of 293 intraocular xenografts (5 cohorts by source). Each tumor-bearing mouse received 1 of 5 drugs or normal saline, by intraperitoneal injection, weekly for 5 weeks. Response was monitored for up to 22 weeks, using a staging system which estimates the proportion of the anterior chamber filled by tumor. Results were analysed both as response rates (shrinkage in excess of 50%) at the conclusion of the treatment course and as time to tumor progression by the life table method. Comparison of response rates within cohorts by source of xenografts (exact chi-square test for overall and 2-sided Fisher's exact test for paired comparisons) indicated cyclophosphamide to be the most effective single agent. In logrank analyses cyclophosphamide achieved significantly longer delays to progression than all other drugs in one cohort and longer delays than all but diaziquone in 2 other cohorts. The intraocular xenograft model is a clinically relevant system for the study of therapeutic agents in brain tumors. The effectiveness of intensive dosage cyclophosphamide in a model dependent on access across the blood-aqueous barrier is important and consistent with recent clinical data.","['White, L', 'Sterling-Levis, K', 'Fisher, R', 'Tobias, V']","['White L', 'Sterling-Levis K', 'Fisher R', 'Tobias V']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eye', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive, Peripheral/drug therapy/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Transplantation, Heterotopic']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01054721 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 1995;25(1):39-47. doi: 10.1007/BF01054721.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, we calculated the sex-specific standardized incidence ratio (SIR), adjusted to age and time period, as an estimate of the relative risk (RR) of developing a second primary brain tumor following other cancers. RESULTS: We found an elevated RR of brain tumors after bladder cancer in both men (RR, 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 2.3) and women (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.8 to 3.2); this effect was present for both astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme. Elevated RRs of brain tumors were also found after sarcoma (RR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.8 to 9.0) and leukemia (RR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.6 to 4.8) in men, and after colorectal cancer (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.4) and endometrial cancer (RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.9) in women. The highest RR observed in this study was for CNS lymphoma following any first primary malignancy in men (RR, 7.9; 95% CI, 5.5 to 11.0).

Infection with LP-BM5 MuLV resulted in progressive increases in blood QUIN levels beginning 2 weeks after inoculation that peaked by 16 weeks postinfection. QUIN levels were also increased in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. In systemic tissues, QUIN levels were increased in lung, liver, and spleen. In contrast, infection with the ecotropic viral component of the LP-BM5 MuLV mixture was not associated with any changes in brain, blood, or systemic tissue QUIN levels, even though helper virus burdens were comparable to those in mice infected with LP-BM5 MuLV. Treatment of LP-BM5 MuLV-infected mice with the antiretroviral agent zidovudine (azidothymidine) significantly reduced blood and brain QUIN levels in association with reductions in viral load in brain and spleen. These observations suggest that elevated QUIN production is not attributable to productive infection with retrovirus per se but occurs in response to an agent or agents, such as cytokines, that are produced by the host in response to virus infection.","['Sei, Y', 'Paul, I A', 'Saito, K', 'Layar, R', 'Hartley, J W', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Skolnick, P', 'Heyes, M P']","['Sei Y', 'Paul IA', 'Saito K', 'Layar R', 'Hartley JW', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Skolnick P', 'Heyes MP']","['Laboratory of Neuroscience, National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'F6F0HK1URN (Quinolinic Acid)']",IM,"['*AIDS Dementia Complex', 'Animals', '*Brain Chemistry', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Defective Viruses/pathogenicity', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Helper Viruses/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*metabolism', 'Quinolinic Acid/*analysis/blood', 'Viscera/chemistry']",1996/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.66010296.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 1996 Jan;66(1):296-302. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.66010296.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The examination of a series of base-modified analogues of CldAdo has shown that several other compounds have similar inhibitor properties, and has indicated that 6-benzyloxy-2-chloro-9-(2'-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)purine is the most potent inhibitor with a Ki value of 0.5 microM, competitive with respect to inosine (Ino). CldAdo itself and its base-modified analogues, discounting those substituted at C(8), are also substrates for the E. coli PNP and undergo rapid glycosidic bond cleavage. CldAdo is degraded with substrate efficiency, i.e. Vmax/Km similar to that observed for Ino (130%), although the individual kinetic constants, Km and Vmax, are both approximately an order of magnitude lower than for Ino. All compounds tested are totally inactive as substrates and inhibitors for mammalian (calf spleen) PNP and therefore constitute a new class of potent selective, although cleavable, inhibitors of bacterial phosphorylases. 8-Bromo-2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine and 8-thio-2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine are the only base-modified CldAdo derivatives showing inhibitory activity against MOLT-3 (acute T-cell leukemia) and U-937 (histiocytic lymphoma) cells and, as shown in this study, are resistant to degradation by E. coli PNP. The above-mentioned results suggest that both analogues could be effective as oral cytotoxic agents that are noncleavable by enteric bacteria.","['Bzowska, A', 'Kazimierczuk, Z']","['Bzowska A', 'Kazimierczuk Z']","['Department of Biophysics, University of Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)']",IM,"['Cladribine/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.886_3.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1995 Nov 1;233(3):886-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.886_3.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The integrated response was biphasic in form: arachidonate liberated Ca2+ ions from the intracellular store first, resulting in a transient increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Ca2+ entry from the extracellular fluid was not evident for a further 1-2 min. At baseline, [Ca2+]i was 48.1 +/- 14.0 nM (SEM, n = 5). Upon addition of arachidonate (100 microM), [Ca2+]i rose to a transient peak level of 217 +/- 38.6 nM (SEM, n = 5) and a later plateau level of 427 +/- 118 nM (SEM, n = 5). Removal of added Ca2+ ions from the extracellular fluid in the presence of EGTA (1.0 mM) had no effect on the initial transient response but abolished the second phase of the response. In HL-60 cells that had been loaded with BAPTA/AM, the initial transient phase of the response was abolished but the elevation in [Ca2+]i due to Ca2+ entry from the extracellular fluid was unaffected. Undifferentiated HL-60 cells also responded to arachidonate (100 microM) with an increase in the release of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase. Arachidonate-induced beta-glucuronidase release from BAPTA-loaded cells or in control cells exposed to Ca(2+)-free solutions was inhibited by about 50%. In BAPTA-loaded cells that were incubated with Ca(2+)-free solutions, arachidonate-induced beta-glucuronidase release was inhibited by about 90%. Leukotriene B4 failed to elevate [Ca2+]i in the concentration range 0.01-1 microM and failed to activate beta-glucuronidase release in concentrations up to 10 microM. Furthermore, the cyclo-oxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor ETYA (100 microM) was without effect on secretion. Consistent with this finding, we found that a large number of unsaturated fatty acids could reproduce the effect of arachidonate on [Ca2+]i and beta-glucuronidase release. Fatty acids belonging to the omega-3, omega-6 and omega-7 unsaturated fatty acid families were effective in elevating [Ca2+]i and stimulating beta-glucuronidase release. However, three unsaturated fatty acids, all belonging to the omega-9 fatty acid family, were ineffective.","['Packham, D E', 'Jiang, L', 'Conigrave, A D']","['Packham DE', 'Jiang L', 'Conigrave AD']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Calcium,Cell calcium,8006226,"['0 (Cations)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cations', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Fura-2', 'Glucuronidase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/06/01 00:00,1995/06/01 00:01,['1995/06/01 00:00'],"['1995/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0143-4160(95)90086-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0143-4160(95)90086-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Calcium. 1995 Jun;17(6):399-408. doi: 10.1016/0143-4160(95)90086-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been shown that TZCs might have a role in the treatment of patients affected by acute myelogenous leukemias that express low levels of the DNA repair enzyme, O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (OGAT). In this report, we have evaluated the role of this DNA repair enzyme in the leukemic cell response to the xenogenizing and cytotoxic properties of TZCs. OGAT-deficient murine leukemic L1210 cells were transfected with a recombinant ecotropic retrovirus containing the coding region for the human OGAT protein. Selected clones expressed the human OGAT transcript and had greatly increased OGAT activity. Compared to OGAT-deficient cells, OGAT-expressing cells were considerably more resistant to the xenogenizing properties of 1-(p-chlorophenyl)-3,3- dimethyl-triazene, measured in terms of leukemia graft rejection, and were less susceptible to the cytotoxic activity of the TZCs 8-carbamoyl-3-methyl-imidazo [5,1-d]-1,2,3,5-tetrazin-4(3H)-one and 8-carbamoyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)imidazo [5,1-d]-1,2,3,5-tetrazin-4(3H)-one.

Exon skipping can give rise to dominant-positive receptors that are transcriptionally active in the absence of estrogen, or dominant-negative receptors that are themselves transcriptionally inactive but prevent the action of the normal receptor. ER splice variants similar to those in breast cancer have also been reported in human meningiomas. Androgen receptor (AR) variants have been detected in some prostate cancers that exhibit resistance to androgen therapy. In leukemia and lymphoma, mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) cause resistance to cell lysis by dexamethasone.

In this study we investigated the feasibility, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and preliminary efficiency of high-dose 67Ga injected intravenously (i.v.) in patients with acute leukaemia not responding to conventional therapy. Twelve doses of 36-105 mCi of Gallium67 citrate were administered as a push injection to eight patients with resistant leukaemia in a pilot study. All five patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) had resistant disease or resistant relapse. No (sub)acute toxicity was observed. Independent of the administered dose, whole-blood radioactivity levels 10 min after administration measured only 1.25 +/- 1.39 microCi ml-1, indicating a large volume of distribution. Urine excretion in the first 24 h ranged from 18% to 51.5% (median 29.5%) of the administered dose. Cellular uptake of 67Ga was less than in previous in vitro studies. Whole-body radiation dose was estimated to be 0.25 +/- 0.03 cGy mCi-1. Red marrow dose was estimated to be between 0.18 +/- 0.02 and 0.97 +/- 0.12 cGy mCi-1. One definite response was observed in an ALL patient with disappearance of skin lesions, normalisation of the enlarged spleen and profound leucopenia. Three other patients showed transient reductions in white blood cell counts without disappearance of blasts from the peripheral blood.

However, these agents are intrinsically cytotoxic against cells of normal tissue origin, including myelocytes and immunocytes. Here we show that a naturally occurring flavone of citrus origin, tangeretin (5,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone), induces apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 cells, whereas the flavone showed no cytotoxicity against human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The growth of HL-60 cells in vitro assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation or tetrazolium crystal formation was strongly suppressed in the presence of tangeretin; the IC50 values range between 0.062 and 0.173 microM. Apoptosis of HL-60 cells, assessed by cell morphology and DNA fragmentation, was demonstrated in the presence of > 2.7 microM tangeretin. Flow cytometric analysis of tangeretin-treated HL-60 cells also demonstrated apoptotic cells with low DNA content and showed a decrease of G1 cells and a concomitant increase of S and/or G2/M cells. Apoptosis was evident after 24 h of incubation with tangeretin, and the tangeretin effect as assessed by DNA fragmentation or growth inhibition was significantly attenuated in the presence of Zn2+, which is known to inhibit Ca(2+)-dependent endonuclease activity. Ca2+ and Mg2+, in contrast, promoted the effect of tangeretin. Cycloheximide significantly decreased the tangeretin effect on HL-60 cell growth, suggesting that protein synthesis is required for flavonoid-induced apoptosis. Tangeretin showed no cytotoxicity against either HL-60 cells or mitogen-activated PBMCs even at high concentration (27 microM) as determined by a dye exclusion test. Moreover, the flavonoid was less effective on growth of human T-lymphocytic leukaemia MOLT-4 cells or on blastogenesis of PBMCs. These results suggest that tangeretin inhibits growth of HL-60 cells in vitro, partially through induction of apoptosis, without causing serious side-effects on immune cells.","['Hirano, T', 'Abe, K', 'Gotoh, M', 'Oka, K']","['Hirano T', 'Abe K', 'Gotoh M', 'Oka K']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Tokyo College of Pharmacy, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'I4TLA1DLX6 (tangeretin)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', '*Flavones', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1995.518 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1995 Dec;72(6):1380-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1995.518.,,,PMC2034105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five different monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) (clones: 3B10#; VIM5*; 109#; 68#; 100#) were used in order to detect the distinct forms of this cellular receptor. Cell reactivity varied significantly from case to case, also depending on the MoAb used for the flow cytometry analysis. In brief, 3B10# and VIM5* MoAbs were found to be positive in more than 90% of monocytes and neutrophils from healthy subjects, while the number of positive cells was decreased (60%) using the 109# MoAb. However, either 68# and 100# MoAbs recognised only a low number of blood monocytes and neutrophils (8-20%), while lymphocytes were unreactive with all the five UPA-R MoAbs. ALL cells were found to be CD87 negative in all cases. Blasts from AML showed a heterogeneous pattern of expression for the UPA-R MoAbs, being the reactivity strictly dependent on the MoAb used, and, to a higher extent, on the degree and type of maturation of the blastic cells. The number of blasts recognising 3B10# and VIM5* MoAbs was significantly higher than that reacting with the remaining MoAbs irrespective of the FAB subtype. Since proteolytic enzymes, like UPA, play a key role in the dissolution of the extracellular matrix, and in facilitating the cell egress from the bone marrow, it is conceivable that the expression of the UPA-R could contribute to the invasive properties and, possibly, metastatic potential of leukemic cells.","['Castagnari, B', 'Moretti, S', 'Latorraca, A', 'Rigolin, G M', 'Balsamo, R', 'Lanza, F', 'Castoldi, G L']","['Castagnari B', 'Moretti S', 'Latorraca A', 'Rigolin GM', 'Balsamo R', 'Lanza F', 'Castoldi GL']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Boll Soc Ital Biol Sper,Bollettino della Societa italiana di biologia sperimentale,7506962,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/pathology', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*analysis']",1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Boll Soc Ital Biol Sper. 1995 May-Jun;71(5-6):141-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Codon 209 in the p53 gene may be a new hot-spot for p53 mutation in B-CLL disease. Four of the 42 (10%) reported B-CLL p53 mutations occurred at codon 209 versus none in 214 cases of other lymphoid malignancies screened for p53 mutations (P = 0.0006). Transversion mutations predominated at codon 273 rather than the transition mutations that are known to occur at this CpG site. Four of six (67%) B-CLL cases had transversions at codon 273 compared with two of 17 (12%) of all other lymphoid tumors examined (P = 0.02). In addition, over 65% of the p53 mutations detected in B-CLL showed a strand bias for p53 mutations on the untranscribed DNA strand. This feature of DNA strand bias is notable in cancers of the lung, esophagus, and head and neck, which may result from high exposure to carcinogens. This spectrum of p53 mutations in B-CLL together with the high frequency of transversion mutations and DNA strand bias may implicate environmental carcinogens associated with p53 gene damage in some B-CLL patients.","['Newcomb, E W', 'el Rouby, S', 'Thomas, A']","['Newcomb EW', 'el Rouby S', 'Thomas A']","['Department of Pathology, New York University Medical Center and Kaplan Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],['CA-53572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,['0 (Codon)'],IM,"['Codon', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Mutation']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.2940140402 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 1995 Dec;14(4):227-32. doi: 10.1002/mc.2940140402.,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, flow cytometry is rarely performed on cytologic specimens because most cytologist are more comfortable with direct microscopy and believe that there is inadequate cellularity for analysis. Paradoxically, cytologic material is usually cell suspensions making it ideal for flow cytometry. In order to evaluate the usefulness of immunophenotyping cytologic specimens by flow cytometry, we retrospectively reviewed all cytologic specimens submitted to our flow cytometry unit from 1988 to 1991. Thirty-one cerebrospinal fluid specimens were analyzed. There were inadequate cells for analysis in 15 cases. Five showed a monoclonal proliferation; 11 were nondiagnostic. A range (r) of one to six cell surface markers were performed. Thirty-two body cavity fluids were analyzed: 7 peritoneal, 19 pleural, 2 pericardial, and 4 bronchoalveolar lavage. There were cells to analyze in all cases. Seven had a monoclonal proliferation; 25 were nondiagnostic (r = 4-21 markers performed). One hundred eighteen fine needle aspirates (FNA) were reviewed; 58 FNA were radiologically guided, 60 were superficial lesions. There were inadequate cells for analysis in two cases. Sixty-one demonstrated a monoclonal proliferation; 55 were nondiagnostic (r = 1-22 markers performed). We conclude that immunophenotyping by flow cytometry is of limited value for cerebrospinal fluid analysis and that knowledge of previous immunophenotyping studies is essential for correct analysis; analysis of body cavity fluids is easily performed but less often demonstrates a monoclonal proliferation.

Conditions that lead to decreased redox potential more specifically predispose to infection with anaerobes. Included in this category are obstruction and stasis, tissue anoxia, tissue destruction, vascular insufficiency, prior aerobic infection, burns, foreign body implantation, and calcium salts in a wound (in association with fractures). Other specific clinical situations that predispose to anaerobic infections include leukaemia; oral, gastrointestinal, and female pelvic surgery; trauma at other sites; childbirth; aspiration pneumonia; human and animal bites; and therapy with agents with poor activity against anaerobes (e.g. aminoglycosides, quinolones). AIDS patients appear to be predisposed to severe periodontal disease and its complications.","['Finegold, S M']",['Finegold SM'],"['Research Service, VA Medical Center West Los Angeles, Wadsworth, CA 90073.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,FEMS immunology and medical microbiology,9315554,,IM,"['*Bacteria, Anaerobic/pathogenicity', '*Bacterial Infections/immunology/prevention & control', 'Diabetes Complications', 'Disease Susceptibility/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Risk Factors', 'Superinfection', 'Virulence', 'Wounds and Injuries/complications']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1574-695X.1993.tb00319.x [doi]'],ppublish,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 1993 Mar;6(2-3):159-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1574-695X.1993.tb00319.x.,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine their route of further metabolism, [11,12-3H]lipoxin A4 was prepared and incubated with human neutrophils, promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells, and adherent monocytes. Intact neutrophils and undifferentiated HL-60 cells did not significantly metabolize [11,12-3H]LXA4, while HL-60 cells differentiated with PMA to monocyte/macrophage lineage rapidly (< 15 s) transformed this eicosanoid. The major radiolabeled LXA4-derived metabolites were characterized by physical methods and were shown to be 15-oxo-LXA4, 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4, and 13,14-dihydro-LXA4. Substrate competition with cell-free supernatants from differentiated HL-60 cells suggests that lipoxins compete for 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase activity or an equivalent enzyme system. In addition, adherent monocytes exposed to [11,12-3H]LXA4 rapidly metabolized (> 60% within 30 s) the label to its oxo and dihydro derivatives. These results indicate that, unlike leukotrienes, LXA4 is subject to dehydrogenation and reduction of its conjugated tetraene to form triene-containing products. Moreover, they suggest that monocytes participate in lipoxin metabolism in their local milieu.","['Serhan, C N', 'Fiore, S', 'Brezinski, D A', 'Lynch, S']","['Serhan CN', 'Fiore S', 'Brezinski DA', 'Lynch S']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.""]",['eng'],['GM-38765/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Lipoxins)', '0 (lipoxin A4)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)']",IM,"['Alprostadil/metabolism', 'Biotransformation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/blood/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', '*Lipoxins', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/29 00:00,1993/06/29 00:01,['1993/06/29 00:00'],"['1993/06/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/29 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00076a002 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1993 Jun 29;32(25):6313-9. doi: 10.1021/bi00076a002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the endogenous c-myc gene has now been monitored during the differentiation, and associated loss of proliferation, of ML-1 human myeloblastic leukemia cells: c-myc mRNA remains detectable, at decreased levels, during differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage pathway induced with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. c-myc protein also remains present, at undiminished levels, in mature, nonproliferative cells (assessed by immunoblotting and flow cytometry). The protein is, however, readily detectable in the cytoplasm of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced cells, and some of this cytoplasmic c-myc exhibits a shift in electrophoretic mobility compared to the predominantly nuclear c-myc in uninduced cells. Furthermore, although c-myc protein continues to be synthesized in the mature cells (assessed by metabolic labeling/immunoprecipitation), loss of the protein from the cytoplasm and accumulation in the nucleus are slowed (assessed by pulse-chase metabolic labeling). These findings suggest that, during the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced differentiation and loss of proliferation of ML-1 cells, c-myc protein is regulated through alterations that affect its cytoplasmic/nuclear distribution rather than its total cellular content.","['Craig, R W', 'Buchan, H L', 'Civin, C I', 'Kastan, M B']","['Craig RW', 'Buchan HL', 'Civin CI', 'Kastan MB']","['Department of Physiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry', 'Cytoplasm/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1993 May;4(5):349-57.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the production of complement components C2, C4, and C9 by human monocytes/macrophages and by the pathologic cells of acute monocytic leukemia which represent a source of immature monocytic precursors. Human blood monocytes were collected and purified by cytapheresis and elutriation and leukemic cells by Ficoll gradient. Secretion of complement components was measured by a hemolytic assay. The evaluation of the mRNAs of the various complement components in the cells was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by adding 32P labeled deoxycytidinetriphosphate (dCTP) to the amplification step. Functional C2 was found to increase during in vitro maturation of macrophages up to the fourth week of culture. C2 mRNA was detected after amplification and increased during the maturation. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) mediated a marked increase of the C2 mRNA. We found a decrease in synthesis of C4 mRNA during in vitro differentiation of human monocytes. The effect of IFN-gamma resulted in an increase in C4 mRNA. C9 mRNA was not detected although it was detected in the HepG2 hepatoma-derived cell line. Functional C2 was not detected by leukemic cells after 24 h of culture but little functional C4 was present in the cell supernatants.

At an equitoxic dose, the antitumor activity of GP-11 was similar to that of etoposide (VP-16). However, the immunosuppressive effects of GP-11 were weaker than that of VP-16. In vitro, GP-11 and VP-16 inhibited the proliferation of human lymphoid leukemia Molt 4B cells and suppressed DNA and protein syntheses, but the effect of GP-11 and VP-16 on cell cycle progression was different. The mitotic index was increased by GP-11 and reduced by VP-16. On the basis of flow cytometric bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)/DNA analysis, GP-11 and VP-16 resulted in the accumulation of cells in the S and G2/M phases. G2/M arrest by GP-11 on cell cycle progression was stronger than that of VP-16, while S arrest was weaker than that of VP-16. After the removal of drugs, the arrest by GP-11 and VP-16 still existed and was irreversible.

Based on data from an ethidium displacement assay and CD studies, these compounds, along with the N-benzoyl mustards 6 and 7, were shown to have increased acceptance of GC-rich sequences over distamycin. Compounds 8-11 which contain an electron-donating group (sigma < 0) para to the bischloroethylamino moiety, were found to have significantly enhanced reactivity with DNA compared to the benzoyl mustards 6 and 7. Through dialysis experiments, the benzyl and chlorambucil mustards were shown to alkylate calf thymus DNA more readily than the benzoyl mustards, presumably due to destabilization of the aziridinium intermediate by the electron-withdrawing (sigma > 0) carboxamido group of the benzoyl compounds. Compounds 8-11 were found to alkylate guanine-N7 in the major groove, while compounds 6 and 7 did not, suggesting that they may have different modes of DNA interaction. Mustards 8-11 were also more efficient than 6 and 7 at producing DNA interstrand cross-links in isolated DNA. In general, for these compounds, the cytotoxicity against human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells and the panel of human tumor cell lines of the National Cancer Institute increased with the number of imidazole moieties. The IC50 values of compounds 7 and 8 were similar, even though the latter compound was at least 100-fold more efficient at forming DNA cross-links in isolated DNA. Similarly, compounds 9-11 were less cytotoxic than 6 and 7, although they were more efficient cross-linkers in isolated DNA. A direct comparison of the three imidazole-containing benzoyl mustard 7 with the corresponding chlorambucil-containing 11 for their ability to form interstrand cross-links in cells revealed that the former compound showed no cross-linking even at doses in excess of the IC50, whereas the latter produced extensive cross-linking. This further suggests that these compounds exert their biological activity through different mechanisms. It is proposed that the aromatic moiety of compounds 8-11, which bind to the minor groove, may be able to intercalate between GC base pairs and the protruding bischloroethylamino group would be positioned to alkylate and cross-link at guanine-N7 sites in the major groove. However, the benzoyl mustards, which have a rigid amino linkage between the imidazole and aromatic-mustard moieties, do not have the flexibility to intercalate into the DNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Lee, M', 'Rhodes, A L', 'Wyatt, M D', 'Forrow, S', 'Hartley, J A']","['Lee M', 'Rhodes AL', 'Wyatt MD', 'Forrow S', 'Hartley JA']","['Department of Chemistry, Furman University, Greenville, SC 29613.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['*Alkylating Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Base Sequence', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/chemistry', '*DNA Damage', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mechlorethamine', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1993 Jun;8(3):173-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphomas derived from cells of the germinal center are seen preferentially in so-called ""underdeveloped countries"", and large cell (immunoblastic) lymphomas appear rather characteristic of industrial areas. Besides genetic influences (rare chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in Asia as compared to Europe), the results suggest environmental cofactors in the pathogenesis of malignant lymphomas. CLL is more frequent in areas with rather low-dose chronic toxic influences such as from the use of fertilizers and pesticides in farming. Germinal center cell lymphomas tend to occur more frequently in countries with nutritional and hygienic deficiencies with frequent infectious diseases.

We have established several mouse or rat IgM anti-ganglioside GM2 and GD2 MoAbs and applied them in antigen-specific drug delivery. In the immunofluorescence assay, anti-GM2 MoAbs bound to neuroblastoma cells and leukemia cells, and anti-GD2 MoAb bound to neuroblastoma cells and melanoma cells. Sulfhydryl subunits of reduced IgM were directly coupled to maleimide groups on the surface of the liposomes followed by the incorporation of adriamycin by the use of Na+/K+ chemical gradient. The resultant immunoliposomes had a size of 86 nm-diameter containing approximately 400 molecules of adriamycin in its unilamellar structure and 17 molecules of the MoAb on its surface. Mouse anti-GM2 MoAb lost the binding specificity when covalently bound to the liposomes. The immunoliposome coupled with mouse anti-GD2 MoAb retained targeting activity to the antigen-positive neuroblastoma cells, IMR-32. However, it did not kill IMR-32 cells, probably because the amount of adriamycin taken up by the tumor cell was below the fatal amount. The immunoliposome coupled with rat anti-GM2 MoAbs delivered adriamycin to the neuroblastoma cells, IMR-32, and leukemia cells, TYH, in the antigen-specific manner. It also target-specifically suppressed the (3H)thymidine-uptake of the cells while the same concentration of adriamycin in the free form killed all the cell lines examined. IMR-32 cells had GM2 and GD2 in almost the same amounts, and interacted with either mouse anti-GD2 MoAb--immunoliposome or rat anti-GM2 MoAb-immunoliposome. The different cytotoxic activities of the two immunoliposomes against IMR-32 cells was probably due to the difference in the facility of internalization of the immunoliposomes after binding.","['Ohta, S', 'Igarashi, S', 'Honda, A', 'Sato, S', 'Hanai, N']","['Ohta S', 'Igarashi S', 'Honda A', 'Sato S', 'Hanai N']","['Division of Immunology, Tokyo Research Laboratories, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co, Ltd., Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Liposomes)', '19600-01-2 (G(M2) Ganglioside)', '65988-71-8 (ganglioside, GD2)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/metabolism', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'G(M2) Ganglioside/immunology', 'Gangliosides/*immunology', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Liposomes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1993 Mar-Apr;13(2):331-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kinetics and absorption assays in vitro revealed that the factor acts on PBMC during the very early growth phase. PBMC gained potent suppressor activity against autologous T cell growth after preculture with K562sup for 3 days in a dose-related manner. HLA class II negative and nylon wool-nonadherent subsets possessed higher suppressor potential than unfractionated PBMC. Treatment of K562sup-precultured PBMC with mAb followed by complement-lysing showed that the responsible suppressors belong to null cells expressing CD3-, CD4-, CD19-, CD14-, CD11b-, but partially CD2+. Exogenous IL-2 exhibited a synergistic effect on the activity of the suppressors committed by K562sup. However, K562sup inhibited IL-2-activated lymphocytes from generating anti-K562 cytolytic activity. Macrophages inhibited the induction of the suppressors, which was restored by adding indomethacin and/or IL-2. In conclusion, K562sup has the ability to induce efficient suppressor cells from human adult PBL, which belong to null cells without NK/lymphocyte-activated killer activity and are similar to natural suppressor cells.","['Hayamizu, K', 'Yahata, H', 'Fukuda, Y', 'Dohi, K']","['Hayamizu K', 'Yahata H', 'Fukuda Y', 'Dohi K']","['Second Department of Surgery, Hiroshima University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', '*Suppressor Factors, Immunologic', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199306000-00036 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1993 Jun;55(6):1403-8. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199306000-00036.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of probable TA-GVHD is reported in a 10-year-old child following transfusions of platelets and packed red cells that had been irradiated at a nominal dose of 15 Gy. The transfusions were given during treatment for relapse of acute myeloid leukemia. Although the child developed complications including exfoliative dermatitis, delayed bone marrow regeneration, renal failure requiring dialysis, and respiratory failure requiring assisted respiration, she recovered from the episode of TA-GVHD after treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone and antithymocyte globulin. However, her leukemia relapsed, and she died.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Of a series of 100 patients with CML diagnosed in the chronic phase and treated in the conventional way at the ""Farreras Valenti"" School of Haematology between 1969 and 1982, and followed-up for at least 10 years, those surviving more that 8-10 years since the diagnosis were considered eligible for this study. Their clinico-haematological characteristics at diagnosis were compared to those of the remaining patients by means of the Student's t and Mann-Whitney's U tests, plus chi square with the Yates correction. The actuarial survival in the series was assessed according to the Kaplan and Meier method. The Sokal prognostic index was calculated in the longest survivors. RESULTS: The median survival of the series was 45 months (range: 4-171). Ninety-one patients died, 2 are alive in chronic phase and in 7 others the follow-up has been lost in the chronic phase. Eight patients survived more than 10 years and 14 more than eight years. Of these, six were men and eight women, 10 were under 50 years of age, one-half lacked splenomegaly at diagnosis and only 2 had Ph' chromosome mosaicism. According to the Sokal prognostic index, six of these patients were in the low-risk group, four were of intermediate risk, and four others were in the high-risk group. None of them had aplasia due to busulphan during the follow-up. When comparing the initial features of the patients surviving 8-10 years with those of the remainders, only the presence of a lower percentage of blast-cells (p = 0.03) and a lower number of blasts in peripheral blood (p = 0.01) in the former achieved statistically significant difference.

LIF has been found to have pleiotropic actions that include the capacity to regulate cell differentiation, promote acute-phase protein synthesis and stimulate calcium release in bone explants. In view of its similarity to other cytokines that affect cartilage metabolism, the effects of LIF on proteoglycan resorption were examined in pig cartilage explants. Endotoxin-free recombinant mouse LIF was found to produce a dose-dependent increase in sulphated glycosaminoglycan (S-GAG) release (ED50 = 123 U/ml, approx. 25-50 pM). Statistically significant stimulation was observed with doses of 100 U/ml or greater. When pig cartilage was stimulated with maximum concentrations of LIF and either interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), in each case a significantly greater release of S-GAGs was observed than with the respective cytokines alone (P < 0.05). Comparison of the areas under the curves showed that the action of LIF was additive, and not synergistic with other catabolic cytokines. Dose-response studies showed that transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) produced a partial inhibition of LIF-stimulated release of S-GAGs (ED50 = 4.5 U/ml). Statistically significant inhibition was observed with doses of 2 U/ml or greater. These results showed that LIF stimulated proteoglycan resorption in vitro and that this effect was modulated by other cytokines. Whether LIF contributes to the progressive destruction of cartilage in septic or chronic inflammatory arthritis remains to be determined.","['Carroll, G J', 'Bell, M C']","['Carroll GJ', 'Bell MC']","['Department of Rheumatic Diseases and Research Centre, Royal Perth Hospital, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Rheumatol Int,Rheumatology international,8206885,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Absorption', 'Animals', 'Cartilage, Articular/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteoglycans/*metabolism', 'Swine', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00290327 [doi]'],ppublish,Rheumatol Int. 1993;13(1):5-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00290327.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PC alone, as well as pharmaceutical formulations containing PC, selectively inhibited the growth of productively infected lymphoid cells. The strongest growth inhibition was observed with formulations containing PC, glycerol and triglyceride together. The growth inhibition was dose-dependent for HIV-1-infected cells. Additionally, PC-containing formulations dramatically reduced antigen production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected in vitro with HIV-1. In vivo experiments with Rauscher-MuLV-infected mice showed that PC administered either intraperitoneally or orally was able to inhibit Rauscher-virus-induced splenomegaly. PC-containing formulations are currently used in man for supportive therapy at doses, which in vitro induced 50% growth inhibition of HIV-1-infected cells in vitro. Such doses have been used in man without side effects for many years. Thus, PC-containing formulations may be valuable for the treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals.","['Willer, A', 'Heinzmann, U', 'Mellert, W', 'Kleinschmidt, A', 'Goebel, F D', 'Erfle, V']","['Willer A', 'Heinzmann U', 'Mellert W', 'Kleinschmidt A', 'Goebel FD', 'Erfle V']","['GSF-Institut fur Molekulare Virologie, Neuherberg/Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Res Exp Med (Berl),Research in experimental medicine.

In this paper evidence is provided that their effects on murine erythroleukemia cells are modulated by various extracellular cations as a precise function of the cation effects on membrane surface potential. The interfacial effects of the inducers were directly measured on the charged electrode, showing that both dimethyl sulfoxide and hexamethylene-bisacetamide, at the effective concentrations for cell differentiation and within the physiological range of charge density, adsorb at the charged surface and produce a potential shift. A linear correlation was found between this shift and the inducer effects on cell differentiation. Besides offering a different interpretation of the mechanism of action of the inducers, these findings indicate that surface potential has a signaling function. They may also be relevant to cancer treatments based on tumor-cell commitment to terminal differentiation.","['Arcangeli, A', 'Carla, M', 'Del Bene, M R', 'Becchetti, A', 'Wanke, E', 'Olivotto, M']","['Arcangeli A', 'Carla M', 'Del Bene MR', 'Becchetti A', 'Wanke E', 'Olivotto M']","['Istituto di Patologia Generale, Universita di Firenze, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chlorides)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '660YQ98I10 (Potassium Chloride)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*physiology', 'Chlorides/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mathematics', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Potassium Chloride/*pharmacology', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Sodium Chloride/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.12.5858 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Jun 15;90(12):5858-62. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.12.5858.,,,PMC46822,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have isolated a fourth EWS-FLI1 fusion cDNA that is structurally distinct from the three forms previously described. To determine the transforming activity of this gene, alternative forms of the EWS-FLI1 fusion were transduced into NIH 3T3 cells. Cells expressing either type 1 or type 4 fusion constructs formed foci in culture and colonies in soft agar, indicating that EWS-FLI1 is a transforming gene. EWS-FLI1 deletion mutants were created to map functionally the critical regions within the chimera. Deletion of either the EWS domain or the FLI1 corresponding to the DNA-binding domain totally abrogated the ability for EWS-FLI1 to transform 3T3 cells. These data indicate that the oncogenic effect of the 11;22 translocation is caused by the formation of a chimeric transcription factor. Formation of chimeric transcription factors has now been demonstrated to promote tumors of both neuroectodermal and hematopoietic origin, suggesting that this may be a common mechanism in human carcinogenesis.","['May, W A', 'Gishizky, M L', 'Lessnick, S L', 'Lunsford, L B', 'Lewis, B C', 'Delattre, O', 'Zucman, J', 'Thomas, G', 'Denny, C T']","['May WA', 'Gishizky ML', 'Lessnick SL', 'Lunsford LB', 'Lewis BC', 'Delattre O', 'Zucman J', 'Thomas G', 'Denny CT']","['Department of Pediatrics, Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratories, University of California, Los Angeles 90024.']",['eng'],"['AI07126/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transformation, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Integration']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.12.5752 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Jun 15;90(12):5752-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.12.5752.,,,PMC46800,,,,,,,,"['EWS', 'FLI1']",,,,,,

To determine the location of genes on 5q that may be involved in leukemogenesis, we examined the deleted chromosome 5 homologs in a series of 135 patients with malignant myeloid diseases. By comparing the breakpoints, we identified a small segment of 5q, consisting of band 5q31, that was deleted in each patient. This segment has been termed the critical region. Distal 5q contains a number of genes encoding growth factors, hormone receptors, and proteins involved in signal transduction or transcriptional regulation. These include several genes that are good candidates for a tumor-suppressor gene, as well as the genes encoding five hematopoietic growth factors (CSF2, IL3, IL4, IL5, and IL9). By using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have refined the localization of these genes to 5q31.1 and have determined the order of these genes and of other markers within 5q31. By hybridizing probes to metaphase cells with overlapping deletions involving 5q31, we have narrowed the critical region to a small segment of 5q31 containing the EGR1 gene. The five hematopoietic growth factor genes and seven other genes are excluded from this region. The EGR1 gene was not deleted in nine other patients with acute myeloid leukemia who did not have abnormalities of chromosome 5. By physical mapping, the minimum size of the critical region was estimated to be 2.8 megabases. This cytogenetic map of 5q31, together with the molecular characterization of the critical region, will facilitate the identification of a putative tumor-suppressor gene in this band.","['Le Beau, M M', 'Espinosa, R 3rd', 'Neuman, W L', 'Stock, W', 'Roulston, D', 'Larson, R A', 'Keinanen, M', 'Westbrook, C A']","['Le Beau MM', 'Espinosa R 3rd', 'Neuman WL', 'Stock W', 'Roulston D', 'Larson RA', 'Keinanen M', 'Westbrook CA']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, IL 60637-1470.']",['eng'],['CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Interleukin-9)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA Probes', 'Genetic Markers', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-3/genetics', 'Interleukin-4/genetics', 'Interleukin-5/genetics', 'Interleukin-9/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.12.5484 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Jun 15;90(12):5484-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.12.5484.,,,PMC46745,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These lymphomas with less cytokines had also few or occasionally encountered IRCs, while H/Ms were frequently or occasionally present. Well-developed dendritic reticulum cells in some types of lymphoma had few cytokines. The population of cytokine-possessing cells was related with histologic type of lymphoma and the volume of IRCs. The IRCs might act as an important initiator of reactive cells against tumor cells. In addition, neoplastic T cells influenced the cytokines' possession of IRCs and H/Ms. Although lacunar, Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's disease and the neoplastic cells in peripheral T cell lymphoma showed weak positive reaction of TNF alpha in one third of the cases, lymphoma cells in the majority might have few cytokines, especially IL-1s and IL-6.","['Takeshita, M', 'Sumiyoshi, Y', 'Masuda, Y', 'Ohshima, K', 'Yoshida, T', 'Kikuchi, M', 'Muller, H']","['Takeshita M', 'Sumiyoshi Y', 'Masuda Y', 'Ohshima K', 'Yoshida T', 'Kikuchi M', 'Muller H']","['Pathology Laboratory, Fukuoka University Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', '*Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*analysis', 'Interleukin-6/*analysis', 'Lymph Nodes/*chemistry/pathology', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*analysis']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0344-0338(11)80112-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(11)80112-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1993 Feb;189(1):18-25. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(11)80112-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a drug, all-trans-retinoic acid has certain undesirable pharmacologic properties that might be overcome by the use of alternative retinoids, such as 9-cis-retinoic acid, that are equally active against acute promyelocytic leukemia cells in vitro. In addition to retinoids that selectively activate RARs or RXRs, other ligands of the steroid-thyroid receptor superfamily, such as vitamin D3, glucocorticoids, and sex steroids also have cytodifferentiating actions in model systems. Numerous other agents can effect differentiation of neoplastic cells in such systems, including sodium butyrate, hexamethylene bisacetamide and its analogues, colony-stimulating factors, and interferons. Each of these compounds apparently acts through different pathways, and their activity may be greatly amplified when they are used in combination. Just as the practical usefulness of all-trans-retinoic acid in combination with conventional treatments continues to evolve, the use of differentiation agents in combination represents a novel and promising approach for oncologic therapy in the next decade. Although acute promyelocytic leukemia remains an ""orphan"" disease, its importance as a model for human neoplasia should not be minimized. The specific molecular lesion of acute promyelocytic leukemia is not shared by other cancers, but the physiologic actions of retinoids, their documented cytodifferentiating activity against a variety of human cancer cells in vitro, and their usefulness in cancer chemoprevention are clearly not mediated by identifiable mutations of retinoid receptors. The insights into transformation and leukemogenesis gained in acute promyelocytic leukemia may be a harbinger of further clinical applications and offer a glimpse into the next generation of cancer therapy.","['Warrell, R P Jr', 'de The, H', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Degos, L']","['Warrell RP Jr', 'de The H', 'Wang ZY', 'Degos L']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University Medical College, New York 10021.']",['eng'],['FD-R-000764/FD/FDA HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Leukocytosis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/therapeutic use']",1993/07/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199307153290307 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1993 Jul 15;329(3):177-89. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199307153290307.,,152,,"['N Engl J Med. 1994 Jan 13;330(2):140-1.

Sometimes, however, this approach cannot be used because of an insufficient quantity of tissue or the unavailability of fresh tissue. Therefore, alternative strategies should be designed in order to overcome these limitations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One possible alternative is the identification of Ig VDJ products of normal and neoplastic B cells by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using mixed oligonucleotide primers recognizing the framework III region or Ig variable heavy chain leader sequences and universal Ig heavy chain joining region (JH) oligonucleotide primers. To determine whether the respective DNA samples are suitable for PCR amplification, control and unrelated genes should also be investigated (exon 5 of the p53 gene). In this study, genomic DNA was extracted from a well characterized panel of 139 human B cell lymphoid leukemias and NHLs derived from fresh (84) and/or paraffin-embedded (55) tissue, 19 normal peripheral lymphoid tissues, 9 Epstein-Barr virus infected lymphoblastoid cell lines and, as negative controls, 11 T cell LLs. Clonal Ig gene rearrangement products were assessed for the presence of a distinct PCR fragment after framework III-JH PCR amplification and electrophoretic separation and by DNA sequencing of the cloned PCR-Ig fragments. RESULTS: Eighty-eight of the 139 (63%) B-NHLs consisting of 53/84 (63%) fresh, unfixed and 35/55 (64%) formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, exhibited distinct PCR bands. Using this approach we were able to identify a single clonal B cell population mixed with 1,000 nonB cells or 5 polyclonal B cells. There was no difference in the detection of monoclonality among different B-NHL categories. PCR fragments were not identified in any of 27 normal lymphoid tissues or 11 T-lymphoid leukemias. To detect a larger number of Ig gene rearrangement products, genomic DNA of 12 B-NHL/lymphoblastoid cell lines were investigated using VH-specific leader and JH oligonucleotides by PCR. A single PCR product was obtained in 9 of 12 (75%) cases and their clonality was documented by DNA sequencing of the cloned PCR fragments. The clonality of 11 of the 12 (92%) cases could be demonstrated using both PCR approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the monoclonality of human neoplastic B cells can be efficiently evaluated by PCR equally well from fresh, unfixed and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. This technique should prove to be a powerful tool in clinical diagnosis and research as well as in the retrospective analysis of archival pathologic specimens.","['Inghirami, G', 'Szabolcs, M J', 'Yee, H T', 'Corradini, P', 'Cesarman, E', 'Knowles, D M']","['Inghirami G', 'Szabolcs MJ', 'Yee HT', 'Corradini P', 'Cesarman E', 'Knowles DM']","['Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['CA42836/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Formaldehyde', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tissue Fixation']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1993 Jun;68(6):746-57.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of both NF-kappa B DNA-binding proteins and NF-kappa B enhancer function was down-regulated by inhibitors of protein kinase C and protein tyrosine kinase, indicating a role for these protein kinases in the induction of NF-kappa B by MHC class II ligands.

These results indicate that induction of NF-kappa B by superantigens is up-regulated in part by an autocrine loop involving TNF-alpha.","['Trede, N S', 'Castigli, E', 'Geha, R S', 'Chatila, T']","['Trede NS', 'Castigli E', 'Geha RS', 'Chatila T']","[""Division of Immunology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['1R29AI30550-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 21163/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HDT32-07321/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Superantigens)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (enterotoxin F, Staphylococcal)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Antigens, Bacterial/*immunology', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Enterotoxins/*immunology', 'Genistein', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/physiology', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/immunology', '*Superantigens', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Jun 15;150(12):5604-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since various cytokines and growth factors can modify the production of MMP and TIMP-1, we explored the action of oncostatin M (OM), a unique lymphocyte- and monocyte-derived cytokine, on expression of these proteins. We examined the regulation of TIMP-1 expression in cultured human fibroblasts by cytokines including OM, IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and IL-1 alpha. When used at levels of 5 to 50 ng/ml, OM, IL-6, LIF, and IL-1 alpha elevated the TIMP-1 expression at the RNA level in fibroblasts of lung or synovial origin. Interestingly, OM stimulation resulted in highest levels of TIMP-1 RNA and protein synthesis. However, unlike IL-1 alpha, the cytokines OM, IL-6, and LIF did not induce MMP or PGE2 release. OM also enhanced TIMP-1 mRNA levels in the H2981 lung carcinoma and HepG2 hepatoma cell lines. The results suggest that OM as well as IL-6 and LIF, other cytokines acting through similar receptor pathways, may act to inhibit net MMP activity by specifically up-regulating TIMP-1 expression. The selective induction of TIMP-1 by OM may be influential in altering matrix destruction in chronic inflammation and tumor metastasis.","['Richards, C D', 'Shoyab, M', 'Brown, T J', 'Gauldie, J']","['Richards CD', 'Shoyab M', 'Brown TJ', 'Gauldie J']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Jun 15;150(12):5596-603.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunocytochemical labeling of tissue sections showed that these antibodies cross-react widely between different species (including ungulates, rodents, and marsupials), staining B or T cell areas selectively in lymphoid tissue. The specificity of these antibodies for the animal homologues of the human T and B cell markers was confirmed for the rat by Western blotting analysis. The broad cross-reactivity of these antibodies appears to be due to the fact that they were raised against intracytoplasmic peptide sequences that are highly conserved between humans and rodents, i.e., 80% for mb-1, 85% for CD5, and 100% for CD3 and B29.

The first retrovirus described in humans, HTLV-1, is causally related to the disease. In this study, we examined whether ATL cells die in vitro through programmed cell death (PCD), which has been shown to occur in cells affected by several other acute and chronic leukemias. When ATL cells from peripheral blood were cultured in serum-free complete medium, a substantial proportion of them spontaneously died by PCD. After 48 h of culture, approximately 30% of the total DNA was fragmented. Electrophoresis indicated that the DNA of the ATL cells had been cleaved into regular oligonucleosome fragments each comprising approximately 180-200 base pairs. This process was significantly promoted by methylprednisolone and the protein kinase A (PKA) activator Sp-cAMPS in at least some cases. Since all ATL cells possess interleukin-2 receptors on the cell membrane, the effect of IL-2 on spontaneous PCD was assessed. PCD after 48 h of culture was inhibited by 30-50% by 100 U/ml interleukin-2 (IL-2). This effect of IL-2 to prevent spontaneous PCD was dose- and time-dependent. These findings suggest that the viability of ATL cells in vivo is regulated positively and negatively by intrinsic IL-2, glucocorticoid and regulators of PKA activity.

These CTL efficiently killed HLA-matched leukemia cells of an ATL patient after overnight incubation. However, ATL cells immediately after isolation from the peripheral blood were only marginally susceptible to the CTL. This is not due to inappropriate expression of major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC)-class-I antigen on the leukemia cells. Addition of synthetic peptide, corresponding to the CTL epitope, to the assay enabled the CTL to kill the fresh ATL cells. Scarcity of HTLV-I antigens in the fresh ATL cells and induction of these antigens by in vitro incubation were demonstrated both on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm. Lectin stimulation augmented synthesis of HTLV-I antigens, but was not essential for the induction. The presence in the culture of human plasma containing a high titer of antibodies to HTLV-I did not affect the induction of HTLV-I expression in the ATL cells. Furthermore, significantly lower levels of HTLV-I tax mRNA were present in the fresh ATL cells than in the cultured ATL cells, whereas the levels of HTLV-I proviral tax gene did not differ among these cells. This suppression of HTLV-I transcription in fresh ATL cells accounts for resistance to the CTL, and could be a reason for the persistence of HTLV-I infection in vivo.","['Kannagi, M', 'Matsushita, S', 'Harada, S']","['Kannagi M', 'Matsushita S', 'Harada S']","['Department of Biodefence and Medical Virology, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Antigens/*analysis/immunology/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",1993/06/19 00:00,1993/06/19 00:01,['1993/06/19 00:00'],"['1993/06/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/19 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910540411 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 Jun 19;54(4):582-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910540411.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human hematopoietic cells express three biochemically distinct classes of Fc gamma receptors: Fc gamma RI (CD64), Fc gamma RII (CD32) and Fc gamma RIII (CD16). Complementary DNA (cDNA) clones for each of the human Fc gamma receptors have been isolated from myeloid and lymphoid cells. We describe the isolation and characterization of four Fc gamma RII clones from a cDNA library obtained from a megakaryocyte-like cell line, human erythroleukemia (HEL). Three clones encode the Fc gamma RIIA transmembrane (TM) form, while one novel clone lacks the TM region but retains the cytoplasmic domain. By conducting reverse transcription coupled to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we found transcripts coding for this unique form of receptor in RNA from platelets, HEL cells and a second megakaryocyte-like cell line, CHRF-288-11. These results were confirmed by RNase protection analysis of RNA from HEL cells. The structure of the novel cDNA suggested that it codes for a soluble form of Fc gamma RIIA. A soluble Fc gamma RII protein was detected in the conditioned medium from HEL cells but not from the Fc gamma RII-negative T cell line, Jurkat, by immunoprecipitation with the anti-Fc gamma RII monoclonal antibody (mAb), IV.3. The immunoprecipitated protein was of the expected size for a soluble Fc gamma RII lacking the TM region but retaining the cytoplasmic domain.

Here we show that this pattern was maintained in cell strains (""ST3"" and ""ST4"") propagated from the primary cultures, and that the presence of CSA was measured in ""ST4"" CM if the inhibitory > 100 kd fraction was removed. Two subclones of the ""ST3"" line, called 2A and 9D, were selected for high or low expression of the ST3 antigen, respectively. Both produced CSA, but only 9D produced the > 100 kd inhibitor. In the CM of cells cultured in the presence of hydrocortisone, there was less INH detected but CSA was not changed.

However, the high recurrence rate indicates that a subpopulation of leukemic cells escapes drug effect. This cellular heterogeneity in drug response may play a major role in chemotherapeutic outcome. We have recently developed the individual colony-formation assay (ICFA) to study drug effects on the kinetics of proliferation of individual cells and their progeny. Thus parameters of proliferation are calculated for individual colonies. Three categories of drug responses were defined, including immediate growth cessation, delayed growth cessation (growth stops several days after drug exposure) and growth slowdown (logarithmic growth at a reduced rate compared to control). In the experiments included in this report, murine leukemia (L1210) cells were exposed to various concentrations of Ara-C for 1, 6 or 24 hours, and their responses quantified. Regardless of the Ara-C concentration or exposure time, subpopulations of cells were observed in each of the three response categories: immediate or delayed arrest or growth slowdown. As expected, the fraction of cells exhibiting immediate growth cessation generally increased with increasing drug dose and was markedly increased with longer exposure time. Delayed arrest was most prevalent at intermediate drug concentrations at all exposure times. If exposure was limited to 1 hour, at least 30% of cells continued to grow, although at a reduced rate (71% control rate after exposure to 1 mM Ara-C). This limited effect was paralleled by saturation of Ara-C triphosphate (Ara-CTP) formation. Six-hour exposure left at least 6.4% of cells growing, with an average rate of 45% of control. Under these conditions, no saturation in Ara-CTP formation was observed. Even 24-hour exposure to 5 microM Ara-C left 4.8% of colonies growing, at 42% of control rate. Thus a subpopulation of cells continued to grow even after 24-hour exposure to a relatively high concentration of Ara-C.

The procedure involved four chromatographic steps: DEAE-Sepharose, casein-agarose, cibacron-blue--agarose and hexyl-agarose. The purification resulted in more than 1000-fold enrichment in angiotensin II phosphorylation activity. A gel-sizing experiment, labeling with [35S]ATP[gamma s] and autophosphorylation of the enzyme in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP, all led to the identification of a single protein species with a molecular mass of about 40 kDa. Western blot experiments showed that this protein does not belong to the src family and is not related to the abl and fes oncogene products. Phosphorylation of angiotensin II and casein by this 40-kDa human promyelocytic kinase was stimulated by high ionic strength especially from class IA metal salts. The Km for ATP was 2 microM and the Vmax 3.1 nmol.min-1.mg-1 using angiotensin II as a substrate. The kinase requires the presence of either Mn2+ or Mg2+ for full activity and utilizes ATP or dATP but not GTP as phosphate donor. Based on numerous biochemical observations, it was possible to demonstrate that kinase is different from any other tyrosine protein kinases described in the literature. This 40-kDa protein was used as a molecular tool for testing some tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors described in the literature. It is one of the rare tyrosine protein kinases purified from human cancer cells to date.","['Ernould, A P', 'Ferry, G', 'Barret, J M', 'Genton, A', 'Boutin, J A']","['Ernould AP', 'Ferry G', 'Barret JM', 'Genton A', 'Boutin JA']","['Departement de Cancerologie Experimentale, Institut de Recherches Servier, Suresnes, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Caseins)', '0 (Metals)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)', ""35094-46-3 (adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate))"", '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Angiotensin II/metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caseins/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Manganese/pharmacology', 'Metals/pharmacology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17948.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1993 Jun 1;214(2):503-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17948.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Wertheimer-Leeper coding method was modified by eliminating the distinction between thick and thin primaries, distinguishing only between open and spun secondaries, and reducing the number of categories from five to three. The association between the modified code and measured magnetic fields was similar to the association with the original wire code. The modified code was used to reanalyze data from a case-control study of childhood cancer in the Denver metropolitan area. In the original study, cases were diagnosed from 1976 to 1983 among children under age 15 and compared to controls selected through random digit dialing. Wire codes for the residence at diagnosis yielded imprecise elevations of two and above for very high current configuration homes or modest 1.5-fold elevations for a dichotomous wire code. In contrast, the modified Wertheimer-Leeper code generated risk estimates that were both precise and markedly elevated for the high wire code (HWC) compared to low wire code (LWC) classifications, with medium wire code (MWC) showing little or no increase in risk. High wire code yielded odds ratios of 1.9 for total cancers (95% CI: 1.1-3.2), 2.9 for leukemias (95% CI: 1.5-5.5), and 2.5 for brain cancer (95% CI: 1.1-5.5) that were not confounded by measured potential risk factors for childhood cancer. These risk estimates are larger than the dichotomized results and more precise than those from the original five-level wire code, though limitations in the original study remain, particularly potential control selection bias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Savitz, D A', 'Kaune, W T']","['Savitz DA', 'Kaune WT']","['School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Building Codes', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electric Wiring/*classification', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",1993/04/22 00:00,1993/04/22 00:01,['1993/04/22 00:00'],"['1993/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.9310176 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1993 Apr 22;101(1):76-80. doi: 10.1289/ehp.9310176.,,,PMC1519679,['Environ Health Perspect. 1993 Oct;101(5):368-70.

Parameters of the model were related to the binding capacity of effector and target cells, and to the lifetime of conjugates and free cells.

The CD25 antigen is expressed by lymphoid populations upon activation and by leukaemias and lymphomas with an activated membrane phenotype (Hodgkin's lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, adult T cell leukaemia). The bimAb-saporin mixture was tested on CD25+ targets at different bimAb and saporin concentrations. Saporin, in the presence of a bimAb concentration of 10(-9) M, inhibited protein synthesis by CD25+ neoplastic lymphocytes (L540 and MT2 cell lines) with IC50S (concentrations giving 50% of inhibition) ranging from 8 x 10(-12) M to 3 x 10(-11) M. The saporin-bimAb mixture was also effective in blocking the phytohaemagglutinin-driven proliferation of normal lymphocytes, whereas it displayed the same level of toxicity exerted by saporin alone on an irrelevant CD25-negative cell line (EBV-infected B lymphoblastoid cell line). From these results it is possible to envisage a clinical use of this bimAb as a cytotoxic agent for CD25+ leukaemias and lymphomas, as well as an immunosuppressive agent for severe immune disorders such as graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and transplanted organ rejection.","['Tazzari, P L', 'Zhang, S', 'Chen, Q', 'Sforzini, S', 'Bolognesi, A', 'Stirpe, F', 'Xie, H', 'Moretta, A', 'Ferrini, S']","['Tazzari PL', 'Zhang S', 'Chen Q', 'Sforzini S', 'Bolognesi A', 'Stirpe F', 'Xie H', 'Moretta A', 'Ferrini S']","['Istituto Nazionale per La Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology/pathology', 'Hybridomas/immunology/metabolism', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Plant Proteins/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Saporins', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tritium']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1993.233 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1993 Jun;67(6):1248-53. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1993.233.,,,PMC1968507,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues.,183-213,"In Denmark, 6.6% of all malignant neoplasms among men and 5.5% among women occur in the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues. Most are generalized when diagnosed, although lymphomas are sometimes confirmed to one region. Treatment has been predominantly by chemotherapy since the 1960s, and is often combined with radiation for lymphomas and myeloma. The five-year survival rates for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma improved by 20% between 1970 and 1987. An improvement in survival from Hodgkin's disease began earlier, with a relative five-year survival rate of about 30% in 1960 and of 72% in 1983-87. Survival was better for younger patients (< 50 years) with stage I-II disease, the relative five-year survival rates being 83-93% in 1983-87. For cases of leukaemia much of the improvement in survival rates was founded in 1960s on success in the treatment of childhood leukaemia (acute lymphatic leukaemia); the relative five-year survival rates for children under 10 years of age increased from 12% to 75-80%. Smaller improvements were seen in survival from other types of leukaemia, including the chronic forms. Thus, even for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, which has a favourable prognosis but is regarded as incurable, improvements in survival rates were seen, which may be attributed to chemotherapeutic treatment or earlier diagnosis. It was not surprising that the dramatic improvement in survival rates coincided with the introduction of chemotherapeutic treatment regimes, as reported previously in clinical series. Acute and chronic cytotoxic side-effects are of concern, and, since both cytotoxic drugs and radiation are potent carcinogens, second primary cancers have been reported to be induced by treatment of cancers (Storm & Prener, 1985). The improvements in the survival rates for the haematopoietic malignancies, however, outweigh the de novo cancer risk related to therapy.","['Strom, H H', 'Clemmensen, I H']","['Strom HH', 'Clemmensen IH']","['Danish Cancer Society, Division for Cancer Epidemiology, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Denmark,APMIS Suppl,APMIS.

In contrast, ara-C had no detectable effect on the gene coding for the cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that ara-C treatment is associated with an increased rate of jun-D transcription.

We tested various rodent and human immortalized and malignant bone cell lines and primary osteoblast-enriched cell cultures from fetal rat calvarial digests for expression of LIF mRNA and LIF protein. Both human and rodent immortalized and malignant cells expressed a single 4.4 kb mRNA transcript that hybridized to a human LIF cDNA probe in Northern blots. LIF mRNA was undetectable in unstimulated rodent osteoblast-like cells lines MC3T3-E1 and Py1a. However, treatment with LPS (10 micrograms/ml), TGF-beta (1 ng/ml), TNF-alpha (100 ng/ml) or inhibitors of protein synthesis (cycloheximide, emetine, puromycin, and anisomycin) induced the expression of LIF message in these cells. In contrast, primary osteoblast-enriched cells did not express LIF mRNA in Northern blot assays either constitutively or after treatment with TNF-alpha or cycloheximide. The human osteosarcoma cells lines U-2 OS and Saos-2 constitutively expressed LIF mRNA and did not respond to LPS treatment. However, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C, was a potent stimulator of LIF message in Saos-2 but not U-2 OS cells. The effects of PMA (0.5 ng/ml) on LIF mRNA in Saos-2 cells were detectable at 1 h and maximal at 6 h. TNF-alpha (100 ng/ml) and inhibitors of protein synthesis also increased LIF mRNA in both Saos-2 and U-2 OS cells. LIF protein was also detected constitutively in the conditioned medium from both Saos and U-2 OS cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Marusic, A', 'Kalinowski, J F', 'Jastrzebski, S', 'Lorenzo, J A']","['Marusic A', 'Kalinowski JF', 'Jastrzebski S', 'Lorenzo JA']","['Veterans Administration Medical Center, Newington, Connecticut.']",['eng'],"['AR31263/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR38933/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone and Bones/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbmr.5650080513 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1993 May;8(5):617-24. doi: 10.1002/jbmr.5650080513.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PNH may evolve to aplastic anemia or to acute leukemia. PNH cells are deficient in proteins attached to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol structure, called the GPI anchor, and the primary lesion in PNH is thought to be a defect in the biosynthesis of the GPI anchor. We have recently established permanent lymphoblastoid cell lines that have the PNH phenotype and we report now the isolation of human-human somatic cell hybrid clones obtained by fusing them with normal lymphoblastoid cells. In all of 21 hybrid clones, obtained from five different patients, the expression of three different GPI-linked proteins on the hybrid cells was normal. These findings indicate that the PNH mutant gene is recessive with respect to the normal allele and that a recessive mutation can cause a clonal preneoplastic disorder.","['Hillmen, P', 'Bessler, M', 'Bungey, J', 'Luzzatto, L']","['Hillmen P', 'Bessler M', 'Bungey J', 'Luzzatto L']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, U.K.']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Somat Cell Mol Genet,Somatic cell and molecular genetics,8403568,,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Hybrid Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01233528 [doi]'],ppublish,Somat Cell Mol Genet. 1993 Mar;19(2):123-9. doi: 10.1007/BF01233528.,,,,,,,,,,,['PNH'],,,,,,

Binding of IL-6 to IL-6R induced disulfide-linked homodimerization of gp130. Tyrosine kinase activity was associated with dimerized but not monomeric gp130 protein. Substitution of serine for proline residues 656 and 658 in the cytoplasmic motif abolished tyrosine kinase activation and cellular responses but not homodimerization of gp130. The IL-6-induced gp130 homodimer appears to be similar in function to the heterodimer formed between the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor (LIFR) and gp130 in response to the LIF or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). Thus, a general first step in IL-6-related cytokine signaling may be the dimerization of signal-transducing molecules and activation of associated tyrosine kinases.","['Murakami, M', 'Hibi, M', 'Nakagawa, N', 'Nakagawa, T', 'Yasukawa, K', 'Yamanishi, K', 'Taga, T', 'Kishimoto, T']","['Murakami M', 'Hibi M', 'Nakagawa N', 'Nakagawa T', 'Yasukawa K', 'Yamanishi K', 'Taga T', 'Kishimoto T']","['Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Haptoglobins)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Haptoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/18 00:00,1993/06/18 00:01,['1993/06/18 00:00'],"['1993/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.8511589 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1993 Jun 18;260(5115):1808-10. doi: 10.1126/science.8511589.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in pubertal-aged children with primary gonadal failure, gonadotropins increase to supranormal levels, suggesting that gonadal factors become more important in the control of gonadotropin secretion at that age. These gonadal factors have been poorly characterized so far. To clarify the relationship of inhibin and testosterone to the control of gonadotropin secretion during sexual maturation, we examined serum inhibin, testosterone, LH, and FSH concentrations in 10 boys with testicular defects and in nine healthy boys, in prepuberty and in early puberty. Serum was obtained at 15-min intervals for at least 6 h during the night. Prepubertal-aged boys with testicular defects had only slightly higher FSH levels than healthy boys, and their LH and inhibin levels were no different. In contrast, pubertal-aged boys with testicular defects had higher LH and FSH levels and lower inhibin levels than healthy boys. In prepubertal-aged boys, no correlation was found between individual mean inhibin level and mean FSH or LH level. In contrast, in pubertal-aged boys, an inverse nonlinear relationship between mean inhibin level and mean FSH and LH level was seen. The inverse value for inhibin correlated with FSH (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) and with LH (r = 0.81, p < 0.01). In conclusion, our results suggest that inhibin is a factor involved in the control of gonadotropin secretion in boys, at least in the pubertal period.","['Dunkel, L', 'Siimes, M A', 'Bremner, W J']","['Dunkel L', 'Siimes MA', 'Bremner WJ']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gonadotropins, Pituitary)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disorders of Sex Development/blood', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Gonadotropins, Pituitary/*blood', 'Growth Disorders/blood', 'Humans', 'Inhibins/*blood', 'Klinefelter Syndrome/blood', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Puberty/metabolism', 'Testicular Diseases/*blood/etiology', 'Testosterone/blood']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-199305000-00019 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 1993 May;33(5):514-8. doi: 10.1203/00006450-199305000-00019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By constructing recombinants between c- and v-abl retroviruses, we show that a point mutation in c-Abl is sufficient to change the myristoylated form of c-Abl into a protein able to transform fibroblasts, but not capable of transforming bone marrow or inducing Abelson disease. This activating mutation, which changes the phenylalanine at amino acid 420 to valine (F420V) found in the homologous position of v-Abl, is positioned outside of the SH3 domain, a region typically modified in transforming alleles of abl. Phenylalanine 420 is perfectly conserved among tyrosine kinases with N-terminal SH3 domains (the Src and Abl families). The equivalent position in other protein tyrosine kinases is a conserved hydrophobic residue that predicts the specific family to which that kinase belongs. Mutation of phenylalanine 420 to other hydrophobic residues activates c-Abl. Unlike other transforming variants of Abl, the F420V mutant protein is not highly phosphorylated on tyrosine. Mutation of the nearby proposed autophosphorylation site, tyrosine 412, shows that this tyrosine is not strictly required for fibroblast transformation in either F420V or SH3-deleted variants of c-Abl (IV).","['Jackson, P K', 'Paskind, M', 'Baltimore, D']","['Jackson PK', 'Paskind M', 'Baltimore D']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142.']",['eng'],['NCI CA51462-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Conserved Sequence', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, abl', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenylalanine', 'Phosphorylation', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/chemistry/*genetics', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tyrosine/physiology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Jul;8(7):1943-56.,,,,,,,,,,,['c-Abl'],,,,,,

IL-3, like granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), is produced by activated but not resting T cells, but although GM-CSF is constitutively expressed in HTLV-infected T cells IL-3 mRNA cannot be detected in either unstimulated or mitogen-stimulated HTLV-infected cells by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. In contrast, transient co-transfection studies with an IL-3 promoter-CAT reporter gene and an HTLV-II Tax expression construct demonstrate that Tax can transactivate the IL-3 promoter in HTLV-uninfected T cells. To determine whether differences in IL-3 promoter-binding proteins present in HTLV-infected and uninfected T cells account for this discrepancy, DNAase I footprinting of the IL-3 promoter was performed. Although crude nuclear extracts from both cell types protected the IL-3 sequences located between base pairs -168 and -125, the sequences between -125 and -103, which contain the lymphokine consensus sequences CK-1 and CK-2, were protected by extracts from HTLV-infected but not HTLV-uninfected T cells. Deletion of the region containing the CK-1 and CK-2 sequences from an IL-3 promoter CAT construct resulted in a sixfold rise in promoter activity in HTLV-infected but not uninfected T-cell lines, indicating that this region participates in the repression of IL-3 gene expression in HTLV-infected T cells.","['Wolin, M', 'Kornuc, M', 'Hong, C', 'Shin, S K', 'Lee, F', 'Lau, R', 'Nimer, S']","['Wolin M', 'Kornuc M', 'Hong C', 'Shin SK', 'Lee F', 'Lau R', 'Nimer S']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1678.']",['eng'],['DK 43025/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*microbiology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Jul;8(7):1905-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nature of tumor cells and/or the secondary effects of malignancy as anemia, hypercalcemia, and renal failure have shown to correlate with clinical behavior of MM. Prognostic variables include age, degree of anemia, morphologic subtypes, serum creatinine and calcium levels, Bence Jones proteinuria, plasma cell LI%, beta 2MG level, nucleolus-associated J chains and other laboratory prognostic factors. The plasma cell LI% is the most reliable predictor of survival. Analysis of the presenting features and the clinical characteristics indicates that there are several variants of MM with a poor prognosis, including juvenile myeloma, plasma cell leukemia, aggressive myeloma, high LDH myeloma, J chain myeloma, and amylase-producing myeloma. Four relapsing patterns have been pointed out. The appearance of an additional M-component (mutation escape) suggests the terminal or advanced stage of illness. A new lambda-type M-component can be found in patients with kappa-type myeloma. The prognostic significance of Bence Jones escape varies for different stage of illness. Bence Jones escape is an important predictor of the development of overt MM in patients with smoldering MM.

DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of outcome after bone marrow transplants for leukemia reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) among recipients 30 through 39 years, 40 through 44 years, 45 through 49 years, and 50 years of age and older. SETTING: Transplantations performed in 138 institutions worldwide and reported to the IBMTR. PATIENTS: A total of 2180 recipients of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplants for leukemia, divided into four cohorts based on age: 30 through 39 years (n = 1282), 40 through 44 years (n = 527), 45 through 49 years (n = 291), and 50 years and older (n = 80). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: Incidence of leukemia-free survival, graft-vs-host disease, and relapse was comparable among the four age cohorts. Patients with advanced leukemia aged 45 years or older had a slightly higher risk of treatment-related mortality, and the 45- through 49-year-old cohort had a higher risk of interstitial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that among leukemia patients over 30 years of age at the time of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, increasing age into the fifth decade does not adversely affect outcome after transplants from HLA-identical siblings.","['Ringden, O', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Gale, R P', 'Biggs, J C', 'Gajewski, J', 'Rimm, A A', 'Speck, B', 'Veum-Stone, J A', 'de Witte, T', 'Bortin, M M']","['Ringden O', 'Horowitz MM', 'Gale RP', 'Biggs JC', 'Gajewski J', 'Rimm AA', 'Speck B', 'Veum-Stone JA', 'de Witte T', 'Bortin MM']","['Huddinge Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],['P0L-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/surgery', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/07/07 00:00,1993/07/07 00:01,['1993/07/07 00:00'],"['1993/07/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/07 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/jama.1993.03510010063030 [doi]'],ppublish,JAMA. 1993 Jul 7;270(1):57-60. doi: 10.1001/jama.1993.03510010063030.,,,,['JAMA. 1993 Dec 1;270(21):2560.

This genetic change leads to the expression of enhanced steady-state levels of a truncated Tpl-2 RNA transcript which is predicted to encode a protein with an altered C-terminal domain. Tpl-2 is transcribed from two alternating promoters, P1 and P2. The RNA transcripts originating in the two promoters harbor different 5' untranslated regions derived from the alternate noncoding exons IA and IB. Utilization of the P2 promoter, which gives rise to exon IB containing Tpl-2 RNA transcripts, was detected primarily in tumor cells. The Tpl-2 protein was expressed in COS-1 cells as an N-terminal fusion with a 12-amino-acid hemagglutinin tag.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that Vpu functions to allow gp160 to be more efficiently processed by disrupting CD4-gp160 complexes generated by transfection of HeLa cells. We show here that the lack of expression of intact Vpu results in a 90% reduction in infectious virus produced over a single round of replication from HeLa cells in the absence of CD4 expression. This reduction persists when HIV-1 particles are pseudotyped with the HIV-2 or amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein. Pulse-chase analysis of HIV-1 capsid protein (p24) in the absence of CD4 and envelope glycoprotein demonstrates that the rate of virus release is reduced when Vpu is not expressed.

Transgenic progeny expressed a 3-kb Fv-4 env RNA in all of the organs and tissues examined, as well as an Fv-4 envelope antigen on the surface of thymocytes and spleen cells, similar to mice carrying the natural Fv-4 gene. One of the two transgenic strains (designated Fv4-2) expressed three to nine times as much transgene RNA and protein as the other strain (Fv4-11). When challenged with a Friend virus complex containing up to 10(4) XC PFU of Friend MuLV, Fv4-2 mice were completely resistant to development of splenomegaly and had no detectable ecotropic virus in the spleen or blood, confirming that the cloned Fv-4 gene is responsible for resistance to ecotropic MuLV in vivo.

Although the deduced dRec and mRec proteins differ at only four amino acid residues, we demonstrate that these changes account for the resistance of MDTF cells to Mo-MuLV infection. Our findings suggest that retroviruses in the same receptor class can exhibit different host ranges due to single amino acid differences in their cellular receptor.","['Eiden, M V', 'Farrell, K', 'Warsowe, J', 'Mahan, L C', 'Wilson, C A']","['Eiden MV', 'Farrell K', 'Warsowe J', 'Mahan LC', 'Wilson CA']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['N01-CO74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.7.4056-4061.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Jul;67(7):4056-61. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.7.4056-4061.1993.,,,PMC237773,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tagged a molecular chimera between the nonleukemogenic virus Akv and the leukemogenic mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) virus MCF 247 with an amber suppressor tRNA gene, supF. We injected the supF-tagged chimeric virus that contains all of the genes of MCF 247 except the envelope gene, which in turn is derived from Akv, into newborn AKR mice to evaluate its pathogenic potential. Approximately the same percentage of animals developed leukemia with similar latent periods when injected with either the tagged or nontagged virus. DNA from tumors induced in AKR mice by the tagged chimeric virus was analyzed by Southern blotting with the supF gene as a probe. One set of tumors contained the injected supF-tagged virus. Two kinds of supF-tagged proviruses were found in a second set of tumors. One group of supF-tagged viruses had a restriction map consistent with that of the injected virus, while the other group of proviruses had restriction maps that suggested that the proviruses had acquired an MCF virus-like envelope gene by recombination with endogenous viral sequences. These results demonstrate that injected viruses recombine in vivo with endogenous viral sequences. Furthermore, the progression to leukemia was accelerated in mice that develop tumors containing proviruses with an MCF virus env gene, emphasizing the importance of the role of the MCF virus env gene product in transformation.","['DiFronzo, N L', 'Holland, C A']","['DiFronzo NL', 'Holland CA']","[""Center for Virology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010-2970.""]",['eng'],"['CA-41510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI07272/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Genes, env', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*microbiology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*microbiology', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Thymoma/genetics/microbiology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.7.3763-3770.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Jul;67(7):3763-70. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.7.3763-3770.1993.,,,PMC237740,,,,,,,,"['env', 'supF']",,,,,,

The conjugates with sn-1 alkyl (< C18) and sn-2 fatty acyl (< C14) substituents of the thioglycerol were water-soluble, while those with the sn-1 alkyl (> C14) and the sn-2 fatty acyl (> C16) were sparingly soluble. The latter formed micelles upon sonication. Conjugate 7 containing the sn-1 tetradecyl and the sn-2 palmitoyl (C16) groups formed micelles by both sonication and shaking. The partition coefficients (1-octanol/PBS) of the water-soluble conjugates were about 20 times greater than that of ara-C. The water-insoluble showed a more than 40 times increase. A single dose of the micelle-forming conjugates 7 and 10 produced a significant increase in life span (ILS > 421%) with 50% long-term survivors (> 45 days) in mice bearing ip-implanted L1210 lymphoid leukemia. These results were comparable to those of previous micelle-forming conjugate 1 (Cytoros). In contrast, the water-soluble conjugates at single doses were less effective (ILS 81-386% with 0-33% long-term survivors). However, three divided doses of the water-soluble conjugates were found to be as effective as a single dose of micellar solution of the water-insoluble. The results indicate that conjugate 7 and most of the water-soluble derivatives warrant further investigation.","['Hong, C I', 'Nechaev, A', 'Kirisits, A J', 'Vig, R', 'West, C R']","['Hong CI', 'Nechaev A', 'Kirisits AJ', 'Vig R', 'West CR']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Micelles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', 'AAO1P0WSXJ (thioglycerol)', 'PDC6A3C0OX (Glycerol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Freeze Fracturing', 'Glycerol/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Micelles', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Water']",1993/06/11 00:00,1993/06/11 00:01,['1993/06/11 00:00'],"['1993/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00064a012 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1993 Jun 11;36(12):1785-90. doi: 10.1021/jm00064a012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook experiments to restore in bg/bg mice the marked anti-FLC metastatic effect of IFN alpha/beta observed in DBA/2 and +/bg mice. Adoptive transfer of spleen cells from normal syngeneic mice to IFN-treated bg/bg mice was ineffective, but the transfer of splenic T lymphocytes from FLC-immunized DBA/2 or +/bg mice markedly increased the survival time of FLC-injected bg/bg mice provided that these mice were also treated with IFN alpha/beta. Neither treatment alone resulted in an increase in survival time. As few as 1 x 10(7) immune spleen cells were effective in IFN-treated FLC-injected bg/bg mice. The T-cell immune response to FLC of bg/bg mice was diminished compared with that of +/bg mice.

Although less specific, the flow cytometric method is more informative than the enzymatic assay, allowing detection of fluorescence distributions, which we proved to be characteristic of each subline. In order to assess a procedure enabling a quantitative analysis to be made of intercellular GSH heterogeneity, we propose the use of appropriate thresholds and parameters of the mBCl flow cytometric distribution. By use of this analysis procedure, distinct types of alterations, with respect to the heterogeneity distribution of the parental L1210 cell line, have been evidenced in resistant cells. A uniform increase in mBCl fluorescence was observed among cells of the sublines resistant to L-PAM and FCE-24517. The mean mBCl fluorescence increase in sublines resistant to DX and DDP was due to a higher number of cells with fairly high mBCl fluorescence, but still within the range spanned by the parental cell line. A less heterogeneous mBCl fluorescence distribution was found in the L1210 subline resistant to FCE 23762, which was, however, similar to a cloned sensitive line.

The 9;22 chromosomal translocation in CML generates the bcr/abl fused gene coding P210bcr/abl that has enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. In 55 CML cases, Southern and RT-PCR analysis revealed that breakpoints of the bcr gene on chromosome 22q11 were clustered in M-bcr, except for one case and no obvious difference was observed between chronic and crisis phases. However, blast crisis cells displayed enhanced the expression of bcr/abl mRNA, when compared with those in chronic phase cells. By DNA transfection and PCR analysis, the point-mutational activation of N-ras oncogene was rarely identified, and no point-mutational activation of fms gene was found in the crisis phase cases. On the other hand, 2 out of 13 crisis cases contained gross alteration of p53 anti-oncogene. Furthermore, all 4 myeloid crisis cases and K562 cells showed disappearance of the P53 transcript, and MC3 cells derived from a myeloid crisis case showed an aberrant transcript, whereas chronic phase cases, Ph1-positive ALL cell lines and lymphoid crisis cases including NALM-1 cells showed normal expression of the P53 gene. At present, the precise mechanism associated with the blastic trans-formation in CML remain to be determined. The present study suggested one possibility that a selective and progressive process of Ph1 clone with high expression of the bcr/abl gene may be involved with the transformation into non-lymphoid crisis phases from chronic phases.

While numerous reports have also described effects of cannabinoids on the immune system, the observation of both mRNA and cannabinoid receptor has hitherto been exclusively confined to the brain, a reported detection in the testis being the sole example of its presence at the periphery. Here we report the expression of the cannabinoid receptor on human immune tissues using a highly sensitive polymerase-chain-reaction-based method for mRNA quantification. We show that, although present in a much lower abundance than in brain, cannabinoid receptor transcripts are found in human spleen, tonsils and peripheral blood leukocytes. The distribution pattern displays important variations of the mRNA level for the cannabinoid receptor among the main human blood cell subpopulations. The rank order of mRNA levels in these cells is B cells > natural killer cells > or = polymorphonuclear neutrophils > or = T8 cells > monocytes > T4 cells. Cannabinoid-receptor mRNA, which is also found in monocytic, as well as T and B leukemia cell lines but not in Jurkat cells, presents a great diversity of expression on these cells as well, B-cell lines expressing a much higher level than T-cell lines. The cannabinoid receptor PCR products from leukocytes and brain are identical both in size and sequence suggesting a strong similarity between central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors. The expression of this receptor was demonstrated on membranes of the myelomonocytic U937 cells using the synthetic cannabinoid [3H]CP-55940 as ligand. The Kd determined from Scatchard analysis was 0.1 nM and the Bmax for membranes was 525 fmol/mg protein. The demonstration of cannabinoid-receptor expression at both mRNA and protein levels on human leukocytes provides a molecular basis for cannabinoid action on these cells.","['Bouaboula, M', 'Rinaldi, M', 'Carayon, P', 'Carillon, C', 'Delpech, B', 'Shire, D', 'Le Fur, G', 'Casellas, P']","['Bouaboula M', 'Rinaldi M', 'Carayon P', 'Carillon C', 'Delpech B', 'Shire D', 'Le Fur G', 'Casellas P']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cannabinoid)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cannabis/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Lymphoid Tissue/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cannabinoid', 'Receptors, Drug/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17910.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1993 May 15;214(1):173-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17910.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate late sequelae of childhood leukemia, the muscle strength of 43 young female survivors was investigated and compared with that of 69 healthy age-matched women. The patients had been off therapy for 1 to 19 years. METHODS: The anthropometric characteristics measured were height and weight, and body mass index was calculated. The maximal isometric strengths for elbow flexion, knee extension, and hand grip were measured on a special dynamometer chair. Dynamic muscular endurance was measured by pushup and situp tests. RESULTS: The mean height of the patients was 6.5 cm shorter (P < 0.001) and their mean weight 4.8 kg lighter (P = 0.011) than that of the reference subjects. Muscle strength was in most tests poorer in the patients than in the reference subjects. The differences were statistically significant in elbow flexion and knee extension, and in both muscular endurance tests. There was an association between the maximal isometric strengths and the anthropometric characteristics. Even when allowance was made for the smaller size of the patients, however, they still had less muscle strength than the reference subjects. Of the various treatment modalities, radiation therapy to the cranial area and chemotherapy with L-asparaginase were independently associated with the lower muscle strength values. CONCLUSIONS: The muscle strength of female patients may be subnormal for many years after therapy for childhood leukemia. To compensate for these deficiencies, the possible benefits of prophylactic and individually planned exercise should be studied.","['Hovi, L', 'Era, P', 'Rautonen, J', 'Siimes, M A']","['Hovi L', 'Era P', 'Rautonen J', 'Siimes MA']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Height', 'Body Weight', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Isometric Contraction', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Muscles/*physiopathology', 'Reference Values', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930701)72:1<276::aid-cncr2820720148>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Jul 1;72(1):276-81. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930701)72:1<276::aid-cncr2820720148>3.0.co;2-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term follow-up of patients diagnosed between 1973 and 1985.,261-70,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), optimal therapy of the central nervous system (CNS) remains controversial. METHODS: Between 1973 and 1985, 540 children with ALL (199 standard risk and 341 high risk) were treated on four protocols. RESULTS: The 7-year event-free survival rate (+/- standard error) was 62.1% (+/- 2.1) for the entire group: 71.8% (+/- 3.2) for standard-risk and 56.4% (+/- 2.7) for high-risk patients. Five hundred eighteen of the children entered complete remission and received cranial irradiation with intrathecal methotrexate for CNS treatment; 197 had standard-risk ALL and 321 had high-risk ALL. Thirty-one patients (5 standard risk and 26 high risk) had a CNS relapse with or without concurrent bone marrow relapse as an initial event, the latest of which was observed 49 months after complete remission. The cumulative incidence of CNS relapse was 6.0% (+/- 1.1) for the entire group: 2.5% (+/- 1.1) for standard-risk and 8.2% (+/- 1.5) for high-risk patients (P = 0.01). CNS recurrence of leukemia, whether as an ""isolated"" site or a ""combined"" site of relapse, was a major adverse event. Only 4 of 31 patients were alive for 25+, 28+, 54+, and 71+ months after a CNS relapse. The median survival time after CNS relapse was 22 months: 21 months for the 20 patients who had an isolated CNS relapse, and 23 months for the 11 patients who had a CNS relapse concurrent with a recurrence in other sites. CONCLUSIONS: Although attempts to diminish CNS treatment-related morbidity are warranted for standard-risk patients, the authors recommend that intensive CNS treatment be enhanced for the high-risk patients because CNS relapses continue to occur in this population. Furthermore, CNS relapse after cranial irradiation was associated with a very poor prognosis and needs to be treated as intensively as a bone marrow relapse.","['Gelber, R D', 'Sallan, S E', 'Cohen, H J', 'Donnelly, M', 'Dalton, V', 'Tobia, F', 'Clavell, L A', 'Tarbell, N J']","['Gelber RD', 'Sallan SE', 'Cohen HJ', 'Donnelly M', 'Dalton V', 'Tobia F', 'Clavell LA', 'Tarbell NJ']","['Division of Biostatics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['CA 06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930701)72:1<261::aid-cncr2820720146>3.0.co;2-o [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Jul 1;72(1):261-70. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930701)72:1<261::aid-cncr2820720146>3.0.co;2-o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Hypercalcemia developing in childhood malignancies was studied retrospectively at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to determine its incidence, the timing of its presentation, and its response to therapy. RESULTS: Over a 29-year period, 25 children (median age, 9.5 years) had been diagnosed and treated for hypercalcemia that occurred during the course of their malignancy. These 25 represented 0.4% of the total number of children treated for cancer at the institution during that period. Their malignancies comprised acute leukemias (11; 0.6%), rhabdomyosarcoma (4; 1.2%), malignant rhabdoid tumor (2), Hodgkin disease (1), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1), hepatoblastoma (2), neuroblastoma (1), brain tumor (1), angiosarcoma (1), and a solid malignant tumor of undetermined type. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were more likely to present with hypercalcemia at the time of their initial diagnosis and to achieve resolution of this complication, whereas patients with solid tumors presented with hypercalcemia later in the course of their disease and had hypercalcemia that was more resistant to therapy.

The alkylating agents are often the causative agents, but a few reports have implicated cisplatin as an etiologic agent. Cisplatin has a significant impact on the treatment of a number of malignant neoplasms, including testicular and ovarian cancer, and is a part of several clinical trials for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region. Given its increasing use, a complication as significant as tMDS is potentially important. In this article, the authors describe the case of a patient who had myelodysplastic syndrome develop after successful treatment for laryngeal cancer with cisplatin. The treatment included cisplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil, followed by radiation therapy. The authors also present a review of articles in the literature regarding tMDS and tANLL occurrence after treatment with cisplatin-containing regimens.

METHODS: A randomized comparison of individualized induction therapy was conducted between daunorubicin, behenoyl cytarabine, 6-mercaptopurine, and prednisolone with or without VCR. After 3 courses of intensive consolidation therapy, maintenance-intensification therapy was randomized to 4 or 12 courses given every 6 weeks. RESULTS: Of 265 patients registered, 252 were evaluable. CR was obtained in 78%; 80% in 205 patients of age younger than 60 years, and 65% in 47 of age 60 years or older. Addition of VCR reduced the CR rate significantly (84% to 70%, P = 0.007). Predicted 4-year survival, continuing CR, and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of 196 CR patients are 45%, 41%, and 35%, respectively. Patients receiving 12 courses of maintenance-intensification showed better DFS. By multivariate analyses, significant factors for achievement of CR were performance status 0 to 2, age younger than 60 years, and no VCR; and those for longer DFS were achievement of CR by one course, age younger than 50 years, and French-American-British (FAB) classification M3 or M5. Among 131 patients randomized to the maintenance, the administration of 12 courses was the most important factor (P = 0.0040) for longer DFS, followed by FAB M3 or M5, and by achievement of CR by one course.

The total amount of LT bound to the HL-60 and K-562 cells, as determined by ELISA using anti-LT rabbit serum, was essentially the same for both cells. The percentage of bound LT decreased in the presence of phosphatidylcholine (PC) was also almost equal for both cells. In contrast, EGTA added in the presence of PC enhanced the decrease of bound LT significantly from HL-60, but not from K-562. By monitoring the fluorescence of Fura-2 and of fluorescein as a measure for the change in intracellular calcium ions ([Ca2+]i) and cytotoxic activity, respectively, we showed that the exposure of HL-60 to LT induced the [Ca2+]i increase followed by the cell death, whereas this was distinctly not the case for K-562. These results indicate that a Ca(2+)-dependent LT-binding mechanism is possibly the step characteristic to LT-susceptible HL-60 cells.","['Sato, N', 'Takahashi, K', 'Ohta, H', 'Kurihara, H', 'Fukui, K', 'Murayama, Y', 'Taniguchi, S']","['Sato N', 'Takahashi K', 'Ohta H', 'Kurihara H', 'Fukui K', 'Murayama Y', 'Taniguchi S']","['Department of Periodontology and Endodontology, Okayama University Dental School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Mol Biol Int,Biochemistry and molecular biology international,9306673,"['0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (leukotoxin)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans/*chemistry', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cytotoxins/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exotoxins/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Phosphatidylcholines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1993 Apr;29(5):899-905.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports from different groups point to the involvement of the hemostatic mechanism in the development of VOD. We measured the naturally occurring anticoagulants protein C, antithrombin III, and protein S in 45 patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies before cytoreductive therapy and after transplant. The aim of this prospective study was both to evaluate the status of the naturally occurring anticoagulant pathway in patients who develop VOD compared with patients who do not, and to find a predictive marker of VOD. In transplant patients, protein C decreased from before cytoreductive therapy to posttransplant, whereas protein S and antithrombin III did not. In a multivariate analysis, protein C was the only variable that could independently discriminate between VOD and non-VOD patients at all times. Discriminant function analysis established that low protein C levels before cytoreductive therapy predicted the occurrence of VOD with good sensitivity and specificity.","['Faioni, E M', 'Krachmalnicoff, A', 'Bearman, S I', 'Federici, A B', 'Decarli, A', 'Gianni, A M', 'McDonald, G B', 'Mannucci, P M']","['Faioni EM', 'Krachmalnicoff A', 'Bearman SI', 'Federici AB', 'Decarli A', 'Gianni AM', 'McDonald GB', 'Mannucci PM']","['Angelo Bianchi Bonomi Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center, I.R.C.C.S.

The reciprocal translocation constituting the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome [t(9;22)(q34;q11)] characterizes more than 90% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, in the remaining cases the Ph chromosome (genetically characterized by the fusion of the BCR-ABL genes) is thought to arise through complex translocations that are often not readily apparent using routine chromosome-banding analysis. For this reason we have developed unique band-specific probes for two-color FISH that detect unequivocally the Ph chromosome, and its derivatives. Results of the application of these probes are illustrated by analysis of 11 cases of CML (9 of which contain ""variant"" translocations). The probes were generated by chromosome microdissection and in vitro amplification of the bands involved in the Ph translocation, leading to an extremely fast and sensitive approach to identify this alteration in leukemic cell populations.","['Zhang, J', 'Meltzer, P', 'Jenkins, R', 'Guan, X Y', 'Trent, J']","['Zhang J', 'Meltzer P', 'Jenkins R', 'Guan XY', 'Trent J']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0668.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', '*DNA Probes', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71907-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jun 15;81(12):3365-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such bsabs have been shown to be more effective than monospecific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) at preventing tumor growth in animal models of B-cell malignancy. The current studies describe the production and preliminary evaluation of a bsab designed to induce the lysis of malignant human B cells by human T cells. The bsab was obtained from a hybrid-hybridoma cell line produced by fusing OKT3-secreting hybridoma cells with hybridoma cells that secrete 1D10. 1D10 is an MoAb that recognizes an antigen found on a majority of malignant human B cells that has not been detected to a significant degree on normal resting or activated lymphocytes. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to separate bsab from monospecific antibodies that were also present in the hybrid-hybridoma antibody product. The bsab was then evaluated in vitro for its ability to induce lysis of malignant B cells by activated T cells. The bsab consistently induced extensive lysis in vitro of 1D10 (+) cells, including both cell lines and cells obtained from patients with a variety of B-cell malignancies. No such effect was seen with activated T cells alone or activated T cells with monospecific antibody. No increased lysis was seen with 1D10 (-) cell lines. The bsab also mediated lysis of malignant B cells by autologous T cells. We conclude bsab containing an OKT3 arm and a 1D10 arm can induce T-cell-mediated lysis in a manner that is both potent and specific. This supports further evaluation of this bsab as a potential immunotherapy of B-cell malignancy.","['Link, B K', 'Weiner, G J']","['Link BK', 'Weiner GJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City.']",['eng'],['HL0734415/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71904-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jun 15;81(12):3343-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We derived a strain, HIV-WW, from the peripheral blood of an individual with severe thrombocytopenia and found the virus to be highly and specifically cytotoxic to CMK and DAMI megakaryocytic cells. CMK and DAMI cells were not permissive for the virus and HIV-WW induced cytopathicity for these megakaryocytic cells did not depend on viral replication.

A report on 77 cases.,235-40,"Seventy-seven elderly patients (median age 72, range 59-85) with de novo AML were treated with low-dose Ara C (10 mg/m2/12 h over 21 days, for one or two courses). Thirteen (17%) achieved complete remission (CR), 16 (21%) partial remission (PR); 28 (35%) had resistant leukemia, and 20 (26%) early death or death during hypoplasia. Most (86%) of the patients had severe pancytopenia and 58% were hospitalized. Overall median survival was 3 months. Median duration of CR was 9 months. Five CR were longer than 1 year, and two were longer than 4 years. All but one PR were < or = 9 months, and 12/16 were < or = 4 months. Karnofsky index and karyotype (the latter performed for 52 patients) were the only significant prognostic factors of response to treatment (including CR+PR) and survival: poor response rate (8%) and survival (median 0.7 months) were found in patients with Karnofsky index < 60, compared with 44% and 4 months, respectively, in patients with Karnofsky index > or = 60; likewise, patients with rearrangements of chromosome 5 and/or 7 or complex rearrangements had a response rate of 13% and median survival of 1.5 months, compared with 68% and 8 months, respectively, in patients with normal karyotype or single abnormalities (not involving chromosomes 5, 7, or 8). Patients with isolated trisomy 8 had a response rate of 37% but short median survival (2.5 months). Significantly longer survival was seen in responders. Our findings suggest that, overall, low-dose Ara C yields limited results in AML in the elderly.

The median follow-up was 26 months. The proliferative capacity of the leukemic progenitor cells was studied using colony-forming assays (number of colony-forming units, growth pattern, and spontaneous clonogenic growth capacity). The cell kinetic parameters of the bone marrow blasts were determined by in vivo labeling with iododeoxyuridine and subsequent flow cytometry: labeling index (LI), DNA synthesis time (Ts), potential doubling time. No or only weak relationships were observed between the experimental and clinical parameters such as age, sex, % blasts, white blood cell count, FAB subtype, cytogenetics, and % CD 34+ cells. This suggests that clonogenic growth and cell cycle kinetics of bone marrow blasts are independent cell biologic properties of AML. No association between the proliferation parameters and induction response rate was noticed. Analysis of the overall survival and event-free survival revealed trends to longer survival rates in patients with a below-median LI (< or = 7.6%) and below-median Ts value (< or = 14.3 h). These trends were more pronounced in the group of de novo AML (n = 23), where the prolonged event-free survival in patients with below-median Ts reached statistical significance (p = 0.02). None of the other parameters appeared significantly correlated with survival, although there was a trend to longer survival rates in patients who had no spontaneous clonogenic growth capacity (p = 0.13). In conclusion, proliferation parameters in leukemic cells provide additional information on the cell biologic characteristics of AML, and these parameters may have prognostic value for response and duration of survival in AML.","['Brons, P P', 'Haanen, C', 'Boezeman, J B', 'Muus, P', 'Holdrinet, R S', 'Pennings, A H', 'Wessels, H M', 'de Witte, T']","['Brons PP', 'Haanen C', 'Boezeman JB', 'Muus P', 'Holdrinet RS', 'Pennings AH', 'Wessels HM', 'de Witte T']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01738470 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1993 May;66(5):225-33. doi: 10.1007/BF01738470.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used K562 (leukemia cell line), MCF-7 (breast cancer cell line), LS180, HT29 (colon cancer cell lines), SH101 (gastric cancer cell line) and PH101 (pancreas cancer cell line). Expressions of TNF alpha, TNF beta and IL-2 mRNA were not detected in any of the tumor cell lines. However, 1.4 and 3.5 kilobases of the IL-2R alpha mRNA were expressed in the PH101 cells, but not in the other five cell lines. Furthermore, IL-2R alpha was detected on the cell surface of the PH101 cells by the flow-cytometric analysis with an anti-IL-2R alpha monoclonal antibody. Interestingly, the soluble IL-2R alpha (sIL-2R alpha) was found in the conditioned media obtained from the PH101 cell culture with a sandwich enzyme immunoassay. Moreover, the sIL-2R alpha secreted from the PH101 cells blocked the IL-2 dependent lymphocyte proliferation. These results indicate that the expression of IL-2R alpha on PH101 might suppress the IL-2 induced lymphocyte proliferation.","['Kawami, H', 'Yoshida, K', 'Yamaguchi, Y', 'Saeki, T', 'Toge, T']","['Kawami H', 'Yoshida K', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Saeki T', 'Toge T']","['Department of Surgery, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biotherapy,"Biotherapy (Dordrecht, Netherlands)",8903031,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*metabolism/physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01877384 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotherapy. 1993;6(1):33-9. doi: 10.1007/BF01877384.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) stimulated LIF production by chondrocyte monolayers and cartilage. LIF was generally not detected in unstimulated cultures. Northern blot analysis showed increased amounts of LIF messenger RNA in IL-1- and TNF alpha-treated chondrocyte cultures.

Proportionate mortality and proportionate cancer mortality ratios were calculated using deaths among nonfarmers from the same states to generate expected numbers. Among farmers there were 119,648 deaths among white men, 2,400 among white women, 11,446 among nonwhite men, and 2,066 among nonwhite women. Deficits occurred in all race-sex groups for infective and parasitic diseases, all cancer combined, lung cancer, liver cancer, diseases of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, and emphysema. As reported in other studies, white male farmers had excesses of cancer of the lymphatic and hematopoietic system, lip, eye, brain, and prostate. Excesses of cancers of the pancreas, kidney, bone, and thyroid were new findings. Regional patterns were evident, particularly among white men. Significant excesses for accidents, vascular lesions of the central nervous system (CNS), and cancers of the prostate tended to occur in most geographic regions, while excesses for mechanical suffocation, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cancers of the lip, brain, and the lymphatic and hematopoietic system were limited to the Central states. Increases among nonwhite men were similar to those in white men for some causes of death (vascular lesions of the CNS and cancers of the pancreas and prostate), but were absent for others (lymphatic and hematopoietic system, lip, eye, kidney, and brain). Women (white and nonwhite) had excesses for vascular lesions of the CNS, disease of the genitourinary system (white women only), and cancers of the stomach and cervix (nonwhite women only). Cancer of the buccal cavity and pharynx was slightly elevated among women, and white women had nonsignificant excesses of multiple myeloma and leukemia. Excesses for leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurred among white men and women, but not among nonwhites. Excesses for several types of accidental deaths were seen among all race-sex groups.","['Blair, A', 'Dosemeci, M', 'Heineman, E F']","['Blair A', 'Dosemeci M', 'Heineman EF']","['Occupational Studies Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"[""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/epidemiology/*mortality"", 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Racial Groups', 'United States/epidemiology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.4700230507 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1993 May;23(5):729-42. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700230507.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Use of the human cDNA as a probe demonstrates that this gene is interrupted in both infant and adult acute myeloid (AML) and lymphoid (ALL) leukemia patients with 11q23 translocations. The structure of the Htrx1 gene around the breakpoints shows that this part of the human gene is interrupted by nine introns. As a result of the rearrangement, zinc finger domains are translocated in both ALL and AML patients.

At cell densities > 2 x 10(5) cells per ml, CEM cells grow in serum-free medium, but at lower cell densities the cultures rapidly undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The viability of low-density CEM cells could be preserved by supplementing the serum-free medium with ""conditioned"" medium from high-density CEM cultures, but a variety of known growth factors and lymphokines were ineffective. Fractionation of conditioned medium by sequential chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, propyl agarose, chromatofocusing, and hydrophobic-interaction HPLC resulted in the isolation of a 60-kDa protein capable of sustaining CEM growth in the absence of serum. The active protein was identified as human catalase based on its amino acid sequence and composition and was subsequently shown to exhibit catalase activity and to be replaceable by human erythrocyte catalase or bovine liver catalase. Comparison of the level of intracellular catalase activity with the amount released into the culture medium demonstrated that the latter accounted for < 3% of the total catalase activity present in the cell culture. These findings show that, despite its low amount, the catalase released by CEM cells, and perhaps by T cells in general, provides a critical first line of defense against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) present in the extracellular milieu.","['Sandstrom, P A', 'Buttke, T M']","['Sandstrom PA', 'Buttke TM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858-4354.']",['eng'],['1 S10RR05554-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Growth Substances)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Apoptosis', 'Catalase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Extracellular Space/enzymology', 'Growth Substances/physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.10.4708 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 May 15;90(10):4708-12. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.10.4708.,,,PMC46582,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several cell types participate in the recognition and lysis of tumors, and appropriate immune stimulation provides therapeutic effects in malignancy. Foreign major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins also serve as a potent stimulus to the immune system. In this report, a foreign MHC gene was introduced directly into malignant tumors in vivo in an effort to stimulate tumor rejection. In contrast to previous attempts to induce tumor immunity by cell-mediated gene transfer, the recombinant gene was introduced directly into tumors in vivo. Expression of the murine class I H-2Ks gene within the CT26 mouse colon adenocarcinoma (H-2Kd) or the MCA 106 fibrosarcoma (H-2Kb) induced a cytotoxic T-cell response to H-2Ks and, more importantly, to other antigens present on unmodified tumor cells. This immune response attenuated tumor growth and caused complete tumor regression in many cases. Direct gene transfer in vivo can therefore induce cell-mediated immunity against specific gene products, which provides an immunotherapeutic effect for malignancy, and potentially can be applied to the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases in man.","['Plautz, G E', 'Yang, Z Y', 'Wu, B Y', 'Gao, X', 'Huang, L', 'Nabel, G J']","['Plautz GE', 'Yang ZY', 'Wu BY', 'Gao X', 'Huang L', 'Nabel GJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ann Arbor, MI.']",['eng'],['AI-29179/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Genetic Vectors', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunotherapy', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*therapy', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', '*Transfection']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.10.4645 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 May 15;90(10):4645-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.10.4645.,,,PMC46569,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 May 15;90(10):4332-3.

Study of a messenger RNA and complementary DNA from blood cells showed the abnormal mu chain to lack the entire variable region, likely due to a direct splicing of the leader peptide exon onto the CH1 exon.

Little is known about how its activities are regulated in vivo, but it has been suggested to play a regulatory role in the mechanisms involved in development of mice. In this study, we found that a single class of D-factor-binding substance is present in normal mouse serum and that it increases transiently in the late stage of pregnancy. It inhibits the induction of differentiation of mouse myeloid leukemic M1 cells by D-factor by blocking the binding of this factor to the cells. It is a heat-labile protein with an apparent molecular weight of 130,000-150,000. The binding of 125I-D-factor to the substance is specific since it was inhibited by excess unlabeled D-factor, but not by interleukin 6 or interferon gamma. The dissociation constant of the binding substance for mouse D-factor in normal mouse serum is 6.6-9.4 nM. In the late stage of pregnancy, the amount of the D-factor-binding substance in the serum apparently increases about 30-fold.

By comparison, there was no modification of the expression of CD4 antigen, which is expressed at high levels in these cells. After two days of treatment with 5 x 10(-8) M dexamethasone, CEM C7 cells showed a two-fold increase in suppressor activity compared to untreated cells. In contrast, there was no regulation by glucocorticoids of either the CD8 or CD4 antigens in the leukemic clone CEM C1.

High affinity binding is caused by the association of two chains, p80 alpha and p130 beta, whereas p80 alpha alone confers low affinity binding only. Furthermore interleukin-3 (IL-3) competes for the binding of GM-CSF to its high affinity receptor (for review see Nicola, N. A., and Metcalf, D. (1991) Cell 67, 1-4). In the present study, we took advantage of the perturbation of GM-CSF binding equilibrium by IL-3 to take a quantitative approach to analysis of the structure and dynamics of the GM-CSF receptor complex. First, cross-linking studies were performed at two concentrations of radioligand. At 200 pM, a concentration sufficient for near saturation of the high affinity binding site R1, the association between p80 alpha and p130 beta is stoichiometric, and the addition of IL-3 prevents the binding to both chains. At 5 nM, a concentration sufficient for half-occupancy of the low affinity binding site R2, IL-3 prevents cross-linking to the beta chain only. Second, GM-CSF saturation curves were analyzed both at equilibrium and under conditions of perturbation of the equilibrium by IL-3. In the presence of IL-3, the interaction of GM-CSF with its receptor is converted from high to low affinity binding. Computer modeling of binding data with a ternary complex model involving GM-CSF, p80 alpha, and p130 beta indicates that the model fits the data with accuracy and suggests that ligand binding stabilizes the interaction between p80 alpha and p130 beta by 3 orders of magnitude. Third, membrane solubilization dissociates p80 alpha and p130 beta whereas on ligand-stabilized preformed complexes, solubilization did not dissociate the two chains. Finally, upon addition of GM-CSF, there is an increase with time in the proportion of ligand bound to the high affinity receptor, at the expense of that bound to low affinity receptor, suggesting that stabilization of the ternary complex is a time-dependent process.","['Hoang, T', 'De Lean, A', 'Haman, A', 'Beauchemin, V', 'Kitamura, T', 'Clark, S C']","['Hoang T', 'De Lean A', 'Haman A', 'Beauchemin V', 'Kitamura T', 'Clark SC']","['Laboratory of Hemopoiesis and Leukemia, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Models, Biological', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/drug effects/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1993/06/05 00:00,1993/06/05 00:01,['1993/06/05 00:00'],"['1993/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)50282-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jun 5;268(16):11881-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antibody recognized two types of PTP1C (PTP1C-alpha and -beta) of which the molecular sizes were 66 (alpha) and 62 kDa (beta), respectively, and these two types were expressed differentially in various cell types. The immune complex phosphatase assay using the antibody demonstrated that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and a vitamin D metabolite increased the PTP activity of immunoprecipitated PTP1C to 230 and 150% of control, respectively. By contrast, neither dimethyl sulfoxide nor retinoic acid significantly affected the PTP activity of PTP1C in HL-60 cells. The time course increment by TPA of PTP1C activity was closely correlated with that of the acquisition by HL-60 cells of a macrophage-like phenotype. In addition, TPA increased the amount of PTP1C detected by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation and raised the level of expression of PTP1C mRNA in HL-60 cells. The increase of PTP1C mRNA induced by TPA treatment was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that new protein synthesis is required for the increase by TPA of PTP1C mRNA expression. Furthermore, TPA increased the rate of transcription of the PTP1C gene without affecting the stability of PTP1C mRNA. These results suggest that (i) two subtypes of PTP1C may exist and function in various cell types, and (ii) TPA stimulates the PTP activity of PTP1C by increasing the transcription rate of PTP1C gene expression. The possible role of PTP1C in the macrophage differentiation will be also discussed.","['Uchida, T', 'Matozaki, T', 'Matsuda, K', 'Suzuki, T', 'Matozaki, S', 'Nakano, O', 'Wada, K', 'Konda, Y', 'Sakamoto, C', 'Kasuga, M']","['Uchida T', 'Matozaki T', 'Matsuda K', 'Suzuki T', 'Matozaki S', 'Nakano O', 'Wada K', 'Konda Y', 'Sakamoto C', 'Kasuga M']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, src', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Stomach Neoplasms', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/05 00:00,1993/06/05 00:01,['1993/06/05 00:00'],"['1993/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)50277-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jun 5;268(16):11845-50.,,,,,,,,,,,"['c-fms', 'c-myc', 'src']",,,,,,

However, the specific members of the NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factor family involved in the LPS response, and the mechanisms through which LPS-generated signals are transduced remain unclear. Here we show that LPS induces nuclear expression of c-Rel/p50 heterodimers as well as p50/p65 (NF-kappa B) kappa B DNA-binding complexes in human monocytic THP-1 cells. Nuclear localization of these proteins occurred concomitantly with a rapid decrease in their cytosolic levels and was independent of phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C. Within 24 h following LPS stimulation there was a striking increase in the levels of c-Rel, p105, and p50 in the cytosol. The increased levels of these proteins correlated with increases in the amounts of their mRNAs during LPS activation of THP-1 cells. LPS activation of THP-1 cells resulted in phosphorylation of MAD3 (an I kappa B-like protein), a rapid increase in MAD3 mRNA, and an increase in MAD3 protein by 2 h. Thus, LPS activation of human monocytic cells results in nuclear expression of c-Rel/p50 and p50/p65 (NF-kappa B) and induces phosphorylation of MAD3.","['Cordle, S R', 'Donald, R', 'Read, M A', 'Hawiger, J']","['Cordle SR', 'Donald R', 'Read MA', 'Hawiger J']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232.']",['eng'],"['R37 HL30647/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-07186/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1993/06/05 00:00,1993/06/05 00:01,['1993/06/05 00:00'],"['1993/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)50271-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jun 5;268(16):11803-10.,,,,,,,,,,,"['c-rel', 'fos', 'hck', 'lyn', 'myc']",,,,,,

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), dot blotting, and direct double-stranded DNA sequencing were used to assess ras gene activation in human uveal melanomas for three candidate genes: c-Ha-ras1, c-Ki-ras2, and N-ras at codons 12, 13, and 61. METHODS: Samples of 49 human uveal melanomas were obtained. Amplifiable high molecular weight DNA was obtained from 39 of these. PCR amplification of regions centering on three candidate ras genes was performed. PCR-amplified DNA was evaluated by dot blot and double-stranded DNA sequencing utilizing standard methods. RESULTS: No point mutations were identified in screening the c-Ha-ras gene nor were any genetic alterations found in the c-Ki-ras2 gene at codons 12 and 13. Only wild-type sequences were found at codon 61. No ras mutations were detected in any uveal melanomas studied.

CENU generally alkylate G at the N7- and O6-positions, with the latter lesion being the precursor to the interstrand crosslink. In previous studies, we reported the synthesis of CENU appended by a C2H4 linker to the N-terminus of DNA minor groove binding dipeptides (lex, information reading peptides) based on N-methylpyrrole-carboxamide subunits. Because of the dipeptide structure, these CENU-lex's react with DNA at adenines associated with lex equilibrium binding sites. No other CENU has been reported to yield A adducts. The biological evaluation of these CENU-lex's show that they are somewhat less cytotoxic than their simpler counterparts. In addition, in vitro studies show that the minor groove binding CENU-lex's afford a lower level of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in 9L cells that are sensitive to CENU. There is no difference between CENU-lex in SCE induction in 9L-2 cells that are resistant to CENU. Formation of DNA interstrand crosslinks from the CENU-lex's is lower than for their nonaffinity binding analogs in low ionic strength buffer, but similar in the same buffer containing 200 mM NaCl. Salt inhibits crosslinking for all CENU, but distamycin, a competitive inhibitor of lex minor groove binding, uniquely enhances crosslinks for the CENU-lex's. These results are consistent with the novel minor groove adduction being a 'detoxification' pathway for the CENU-lex's since this lesion is formed at the expense of the cytotoxic major groove interstrand crosslink.","['Chen, F X', 'Zhang, Y', 'Church, K M', 'Bodell, W J', 'Gold, B']","['Chen FX', 'Zhang Y', 'Church KM', 'Bodell WJ', 'Gold B']","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198-6805.']",['eng'],"['CA13525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29088/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '2365-30-2 (1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinogens/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Carmustine/toxicity', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Dipeptides/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Ethylnitrosourea/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/toxicity', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', '*Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/14.5.935 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1993 May;14(5):935-40. doi: 10.1093/carcin/14.5.935.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uncovering this multicytokine resistance was made possible by the availability of cell lines established from early-stage radial growth phase or vertical growth phase primary melanomas as well as more advanced primary lesions and distant metastases. Because Oncostatin M (OSM) is also a member of the IL-6 family we evaluated the effects of this cytokine on the growth of human melanoma cell lines obtained from different stages of disease progression. The results showed that three different cell lines derived from early-stage melanomas were strongly growth inhibited by OSM, as they are by IL-6. Three cell lines, established from advanced-stage melanomas, were growth inhibited by OSM, but much higher concentrations (in the range of 10-fold) were required to obtain 50% growth inhibition; these cell lines were not inhibited by IL-6. Three other cell lines that were IL-6 resistant (two of which were advanced stage) were also found to be OSM resistant. Only one advanced-stage IL-6-resistant cell line was found to be highly sensitive to OSM-mediated growth inhibition. In addition, we found that variants isolated from early-stage WM35 melanoma cells that possess a much more aggressive tumorigenic phenotype in nude mice were significantly more resistant to both OSM- and IL-6-mediated growth inhibition. The results demonstrate that OSM can function as a growth inhibitor of human melanoma cells but that its ability to do so is progressively diminished or lost with disease progression. This finding is consistent with the concept of acquired ""multicytokine resistance"" during melanoma progression.","['Lu, C', 'Rak, J W', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Kerbel, R S']","['Lu C', 'Rak JW', 'Kobayashi H', 'Kerbel RS']","['Division of Cancer Research, Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['CA41233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Melanoma/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Jun 15;53(12):2708-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonal abnormalities were detected in 97 of the 124 patients in whom an adequate number of mitoses was obtained (78.2%). Neither sex, FAB classification, WBC, or the extent of bone marrow infiltrate affected the rate of chromosomal aberrations, whereas patients younger than 40 years had a greater proportion of normal karyotypes (p = 0.047). Two different chromosomal classifications were evaluated: the presence of normal and abnormal metaphases (NN-AN-AA classification), and a classification in cytogenetic categories, the latter being based on the frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities. Both classifications were found to correlate significantly with the clinical outcome. They also showed independent prognostic significance when age, sex, and FAB morphology were considered in a multivariate analysis. Two abnormalities were closely associated with specific clinical-pathologic subsets of AML. All the 15 patients with t(15;17) had acute promyelocytic leukemia; this translocation was not found in any other subset of AML. Eight of the nine patients presenting rearrangements at 11q23 belonged to a FAB subset with monocytic differentiation (M4 and M5). Our data suggest that cytogenetic findings should influence the therapeutic approach to AML. In particular, young patients with karyotypes associated with poor responses may be considered for more eradicating treatments, including allogenic bone marrow transplantation.","['Stasi, R', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Masi, M', 'Tribalto, M', 'Venditti, A', 'Papa, G', 'Nicoletti, B', 'Vernole, P', 'Tedeschi, B', 'Delaroche, I']","['Stasi R', 'Del Poeta G', 'Masi M', 'Tribalto M', 'Venditti A', 'Papa G', 'Nicoletti B', 'Vernole P', 'Tedeschi B', 'Delaroche I', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*epidemiology/genetics/mortality', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(93)90040-S [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(93)90040-s [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1993 May;67(1):28-34. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(93)90040-s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This could be shown in vivo by immunization with lethally-irradiated tumor cells. If the P388/Mitox was used for immunization before subsequent challenge with viable tumor cells of the same line, this resulted in a partial rejection of tumors and production of a substantial number of tumor-free survivors. For an effective immunization at least two primings s.c., i.v. or i.p. with at least 10(6) irradiated cells were necessary. This protected the recipient mice from a challenge of up to 10(8) viable cells over a period of at least 75 days. Treatment of BDF1 mice with the T-cell suppressor Cyclosporin A prevents immunization. In nude mice no immunization effect could be obtained. It was possible to transfer immunity adoptively with spleen cells from mice, which were treated with irradiated tumor cells of the P388/Mitox line. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with IL-2 resulted in a prolongation of survival both when it was administered prophylactically before transplantation of P388/Mitox and at an advanced stage (day 7-11). Also the alkyl-phosphocholine hexadecylphosphocholine was significantly effective in the resistant but not in the parent P388 leukemia. The data presented demonstrate that by development of a multidrug-resistance, concomitantly a xenogenization must have taken place which leads to a recognition of cells by immune mechanisms. In our model, T-lymphocytes and NK-/LAK-cells probably play a role in the immunologically conditioned rejection of tumor cells of the P388/Mitox leukemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Fichtner, I', 'Reipert, B', 'Becker, M', 'Lemm, M']","['Fichtner I', 'Reipert B', 'Becker M', 'Lemm M']","['Max-Delbruck-Centre of Molecular Medicine, Berlin-Buch, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,['BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'Phenotype']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1993 Jan-Feb;7(1):73-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At membrane potentials ranging from +20 mV to -120 mV, arginine influx obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. At concentrations from 0.01 to 1 mM, influx increased exponentially with membrane hyperpolarization (e-fold increase/-59 mV). Efflux from oocytes preloaded with arginine increased exponentially with depolarization (e-fold increase/+52 mV). Kinetic analysis based on an iso uni uni facilitated transport model suggests that the effect of voltage on steady-state flux arises largely from charge movement across the membrane field during the conformational transition of the unliganded transporter which switches the substrate binding site from one membrane face to the other. This charge movement would facilitate rapid increases in intracellular arginine concentrations in response to hyperpolarization, a property which could play a role in modulating nitric oxide synthesis in some types of cells.","['Kavanaugh, M P']",['Kavanaugh MP'],"['Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201.']",['eng'],"['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DA03160/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cations', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Computer Simulation', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Kinetics', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microelectrodes', 'Models, Biological', 'Oocytes/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Virus', 'Transfection', 'Xenopus']",1993/06/08 00:00,1993/06/08 00:01,['1993/06/08 00:00'],"['1993/06/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/08 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00073a009 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1993 Jun 8;32(22):5781-5. doi: 10.1021/bi00073a009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All were U.K. residents of West Indian extraction, and two are currently alive. Disease remained confined to the skin in two patients. Five patients with a cutaneous prodromal phase developed leukaemia after a median duration of 124 months (3 months-21 years), and in one of these combination chemotherapy produced a sustained clinical remission for 20 months. Two patients developed cutaneous disease after remission of their leukaemia. Cutaneous lesions were heterogeneous and included localized papules, a generalized papulonodular eruption, diffuse and localized erythematous plaques, pompholyx-like lesions on the palms and soles, and tumours. The histology of the skin lesions was also variable, and consisted of a heavy dermal infiltrate with lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils and cytologically atypical mononuclear cells. Epidermotropism was present in biopsies from five patients. Tumour cells with large, densely staining, pleomorphic nuclei, arranged in rows between collagen bundles, were present in the majority of cases. In one patient the infiltrate also consisted of epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells. Six cases were classified histologically as pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma, and two as cerebriform or mycosis fungoides type. Molecular studies revealed a clonal T-cell population associated with monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 provirus in tissue DNA from six patients. In two patients HTLV-1 integration was established retrospectively using enzymatic in vitro amplification of a specific HTLV-1 po1 gene sequence in DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded sections. This study indicates that the clinical and pathological features of HTLV-1-associated cutaneous disease are diverse. Patients may have disease confined to the skin for prolonged periods, either at presentation or following clinical relapse--cutaneous adult T-cell lymphoma. Molecular techniques allow distinction from other types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and provide an opportunity for retrospective studies of archival material.","['Whittaker, S J', 'Ng, Y L', 'Rustin, M', 'Levene, G', 'McGibbon, D H', 'Smith, N P']","['Whittaker SJ', 'Ng YL', 'Rustin M', 'Levene G', 'McGibbon DH', 'Smith NP']","[""St John's Dermatology Centre, St Thomas' Hospital, London, U.K.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/microbiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/genetics/microbiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/microbiology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2133.1993.tb00223.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 1993 May;128(5):483-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.1993.tb00223.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify the quality degree of medical care in patients with acute leukaemia who had fever and granulocytopenia during the hospitalization period. 2. To establish the relationship between the medical care process and the results in this concern. DESIGN: Retrospective survey. STUDY AREA: Children's Hospital of the Mexican Institute of Social Security. STUDY SUBJECTS: Twenty three patients with acute leukaemia were studied. Also, hospitalization episode of these patients, in which they suffered fever and granulocytopenia, was randomly selected. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Compliance of diagnostic and therapeutic process was measured during hospitalization, according to the protocolized recommendations made by consensus of the hospital expert group. In order to identify the quality degree of medical care, it was taken into account the protocol compliance besides the results observed in the patients. Results were assessed based on patients' survival to fever and granulocytopenia episode, as well as on fever's duration. The correlation was calculated by using Spearman's coefficient. RESULTS: The medical care quality of the hospital was ""adequate"" (85% on average). Compliance degree, including the total process was 71%; with diagnostic process 63%, and with therapeutic process 76%. The results observed in the patients were considered as ""adequate"" (89%). By evaluating individual cases, the medical care quality was considered excellent or adequate in 17 patients (74%) regular in five (22%) and poor in one (4%). Diagnostic process was adequate in 6 patients (26%) regular in 12 (53%) poor in three (13%) and very bad in two (8%). On the other hand, therapeutic process was excellent in 14 patients (60%) regular in one (4%) poor in six (26%) and very bad in two (9%). Results observed in 13 cases were excellent (57%) adequate in eight (35%) regular in one (4%) and very bad in one (4%). The relationship between process and result was 0.41 (P < 0.05) between diagnostic process and result 0.14 and, between therapeutic process and result 0.34. CONCLUSIONS: The medical care quality rendered to patients with leukaemia, who suffered a granulocytopenia episode and fever, was considered as adequate. Therapeutic recommendations were followed accurately, meanwhile, diagnostic process had a lower adherence. A positive relationship between process and result was observed.","['Delgado-Gonzalez, E E', 'Garduno-Espinosa, J', 'Martinez-Garcia, M C', 'Davila-Martinez, R', 'Benitez-Aranda, H', 'Trejo-Perez, J A', 'Munoz-Hernandez, O']","['Delgado-Gonzalez EE', 'Garduno-Espinosa J', 'Martinez-Garcia MC', 'Davila-Martinez R', 'Benitez-Aranda H', 'Trejo-Perez JA', 'Munoz-Hernandez O']","['Hospital de Pediatria, Unidad de Investigacion en Epidemiologia Clinica, Mexico, D.F.']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Mexico,Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,0414106,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Agranulocytosis/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Fever/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/*therapy', 'Male', '*Quality of Health Care', 'Random Allocation', 'Retrospective Studies']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex. 1993 May;50(5):302-9.,,,,,Granulocitopenia y fiebre en ninos con leucemia como indicador de calidad de la atencion medica.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is supported by the following experimental evidence. V3.17[44] MEL cell line, characterized by a very high rate of differentiation, contains an amount of delta-PKC protein one third lower than that present in the N23 MEL cell line, characterized by a very low rate of differentiation. A similar difference in the amount of delta-PKC mRNA is present in the two cell lines. In N23 cells, following addition of HMBA, the amount of delta-PKC protein and delta-PKC mRNA is down-regulated to one third its original value, which now corresponds to that constitutively present in V3.17[44] cells. Furthermore, in these cells the levels of delta-PKC protein and of its specific mRNA are unaffected by treatment with HMBA. Following introduction of homologous purified delta-PKC both MEL cell variants display a longer latent period before the onset of differentiation from 50 to 75 hours in N23 cell line and from 20 to 40 hours in V3.17[44] cells, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that a delta-PKC related signal plays a negative role in the early stages of MEL cell differentiation and that the level of the kinase is controlled through a down-regulation process upon exposure to the chemical inducer.","['Sparatore, B', 'Pessino, A', 'Patrone, M', 'Passalacqua, M', 'Melloni, E', 'Pontremoli, S']","['Sparatore B', 'Pessino A', 'Patrone M', 'Passalacqua M', 'Melloni E', 'Pontremoli S']","['Institute of Biological Chemistry, University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/28 00:00,1993/05/28 00:01,['1993/05/28 00:00'],"['1993/05/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/28 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(83)71612-8 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1993.1612 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1993 May 28;193(1):220-7. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1993.1612.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty nine children (14 boys, 15 girls) given BMT were classified according to their conditioning protocol: total body irradiation (TBI) given as a single exposure of 10 Grays (Gy, group I, 11 cases), or 8 Gy (group II, four cases), 12 Gy given as six fractionated doses (Group III, seven cases), or chemotherapy alone (group IV, seven cases). The arginine-insulin stimulated growth hormone peak, 2-7.5 years after BMT, was > 10 micrograms/l in all patients except four from group I (6.9-8.9 micrograms/l). A second growth hormone secretion evaluation was performed in 10 group I patients because of persistent low growth velocity despite a normal growth hormone peak. There were no significant changes in the mean (SEM) stimulated growth hormone peak (18.4 (2.2) v 20.1 (3.6) micrograms/l) at 3 (0.3) to 5.2 (0.6) years after BMT. The sleep growth hormone peaks and concentrations (n = 6) were normal. The mean cumulative height changes (SD) during the three years after BMT were: -1.4 (0.2) in group I, -0.1 (0.4) in group II, -0.4 (0.2) in group III, and 1.5 (0.5) in group IV; this was significant in groups I and IV. The final heights of two monozygotic twins (BMT donor and recipient) had differed by 17.5 cm, despite them both having normal growth hormone peaks and puberty. Eight patients, treated for congenital immune deficiency syndrome, were growth retarded at the time of BMT. Of these, only those conditioned by chemotherapy alone had significant catch up growth (2(0.6)SD) while those conditioned by a single Gy exposure did not (0(0.4)SD). It is concluded that the total radiation dose is critical for growth evolution, as is the fractionation schedule. For the TBI doses and the interval since BMT studied, there was no correlation between growth hormone peak and the height loss. The rapidity of decreased growth velocity after TBI and the comparison between the monozygotic twins suggest that radiation induced skeletal lesions are partly responsible for the decreased growth.","['Brauner, R', 'Fontoura, M', 'Zucker, J M', 'Devergie, A', 'Souberbielle, J C', 'Prevot-Saucet, C', 'Michon, J', 'Gluckman, E', 'Griscelli, C', 'Fischer, A']","['Brauner R', 'Fontoura M', 'Zucker JM', 'Devergie A', 'Souberbielle JC', 'Prevot-Saucet C', 'Michon J', 'Gluckman E', 'Griscelli C', 'Fischer A', 'et al.']","['Hopital et Faculte Necker Enfants Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,"['67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Growth/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Growth Disorders/etiology', 'Growth Hormone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.68.4.458 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1993 Apr;68(4):458-63. doi: 10.1136/adc.68.4.458.,,,PMC1029264,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By a conservative estimate, about three per cent of the pre-1987 cancer deaths of Hanford workers had occupational exposures to external radiation as the critical (induction) event. These radiogenic cancers were evenly distributed between five diagnostic groups, but as a result of there being much greater sensitivity to ""cancer induction by radiation"" after, rather than before, 50 years of age, they were concentrated among the cancers which proved fatal after 70 years of age. The reanalysis provides no support for the idea that radiation is more likely to cause leukemia than solid tumors, or the idea that there is reduced cancer effectiveness of radiation at low dose levels (dose rate effectiveness factor or DREF hypothesis), but the estimated proportion of radiogenic cancers was much higher for the 175 nonfatal cancers (which had other certified causes of death) than for the 1,732 fatal cases. Finally, according to the latest publication of the US Committee on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR V), dose rate is more important than exposure age, and even a single exposure to 10 rem would only increase the normal cancer risk by four percent. Nevertheless, for all recorded exposures of Hanford workers, the estimated doubling dose was close to 26 rem; for exposures after 58 years, it was close to 5 rem, and for exposures after 62 years, it was less than 1 rem.","['Kneale, G W', 'Stewart, A M']","['Kneale GW', 'Stewart AM']","['Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', '*Occupational Exposure', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Washington/epidemiology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.4700230302 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1993 Mar;23(3):371-89. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700230302.,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The possibility of vertical transmission of human T cell leukemia virus type I through cord blood was demonstrated using cord blood mononuclear cells from carrier mothers of this virus. In the study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, PCR was shown to be efficient, particularly in detecting this organism in extrapulmonary cases. Evidence of direct invasion into the central nervous system by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and the concomitant occurrence of mycoplasmaemia in the mycoplasmal central nervous system involvement was obtained using PCR. These results validated the potential of PCR in the clinical research of infectious diseases.","['Narita, M']",['Narita M'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Acta Paediatr Jpn,Acta paediatrica Japonica : Overseas edition,0370357,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Bacterial/*genetics', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*diagnosis/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pneumonia, Mycoplasma/*diagnosis/epidemiology/microbiology', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tuberculosis/*diagnosis/epidemiology/microbiology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1442-200x.1993.tb03015.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr Jpn. 1993 Apr;35(2):89-97. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-200x.1993.tb03015.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In parallel, the expression of the cell growth-associated gene--c-myc--in uninfected muscle cultures was drastically reduced with time, while in MSV-infected myoblasts, the amount of c-myc-specific RNA transcripts gradually increased with time after infection. Under these conditions we could demonstrate that the interferon-induced gene (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5A synthetase) was transiently activated in uninfected muscle culture reaching a peak activity on the third day. Infection of myoblasts with murine leukemia virus did not alter the pattern of 2-5 synthetase activity observed in uninfected cells. However, infection with MSV on the second day led to a slight reduction in activity followed by a significant increase on the sixth and seventh day.

Alpha chain disease is the most frequent. In its usual digestive form, the clinicopathologic pattern is uniform. The main clinical features are chronic diarrhea and severe malabsorption syndrome. At the initial stage, there is a diffuse lymphoplasmocytic infiltration of the small intestine and mesenteric nodes, sometimes reversible after treatment by antibiotics alone.

This strict specificity of integration sites suggests that Fli-1 and Spi-1 may be functionally distinct and transactivate different downstream genes during the progression of multistage Friend erythroleukemia. In this study, we show that the Fli-1 protein, like other Ets proteins, has DNA-binding activity and can act as a sequence-specific transcriptional activator. We also show that the Fli-1 and Spi-1 proteins are functionally distinct in that they recognize and transactivate through distinct DNA binding sites. Furthermore, we have identified an octanucleotide core sequence that is required in vitro for optimal binding of Fli-1 to the Drosophila E74 target and the promoter sequence of the human GPIIB gene.","['Zhang, L', 'Lemarchandel, V', 'Romeo, P H', 'Ben-David, Y', 'Greer, P', 'Bernstein, A']","['Zhang L', 'Lemarchandel V', 'Romeo PH', 'Ben-David Y', 'Greer P', 'Bernstein A']","['Division of Molecular and Developmental Biology, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Jun;8(6):1621-30.,,,,,,,,,,,"['Fli-1', 'Spi-1']",,,,,,

In vertebrates, the homologous p34cdc2 kinase is required for G2-to-M phase transitions but appears to be dispensable for DNA synthesis. We have investigated the function of a related kinase, p33cdk2, using serum-stimulated quiescent human fibroblasts. While the p33cdk2 protein was expressed at constant levels throughout the cell cycle, p33cdk2 kinase activity was first detected a few hours prior to the onset of DNA synthesis. Microinjection of anti-p33cdk2 antibodies blocked cells from entering S phase. Pre-adsorption of these antibodies with cdk2 protein abrogated their blocking effect suggesting that the G1 arrest caused by these antibodies is cdk2-specific. These results indicate that p33cdk2 is required for the G1-to-S phase transition in mammalian cells. We also show evidence to suggest that the cyclin E/p33cdk2 complex is likely to be required for entry into S phase since the timing of the cyclin E-associated kinase activity was coincident with that of p33cdk2 and preclearing of either component abolished the majority of the histone H1 kinase activity present in the lysates harvested from the late G1.","['Tsai, L H', 'Lees, E', 'Faha, B', 'Harlow, E', 'Riabowol, K']","['Tsai LH', 'Lees E', 'Faha B', 'Harlow E', 'Riabowol K']","['Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Charlestown 02129.']",['eng'],['CA55339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Western', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'Cyclins/immunology', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/immunology', 'Protein Kinases/analysis/*metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'S Phase', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Jun;8(6):1593-602.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of reciprocal translocations involving 13q14 in 10-15% of cases pinpoints the location of a gene important in leukaemogenesis. In order to characterise the exact location of the 13q14 breakpoint, somatic cell hybrids were constructed between mouse 3T3 cells and leukaemic cells from 5 patients with translocations involving chromosome 13. Hybrid pairs were isolated which carried either of the two derivative chromosomes carrying subsections of 13 and the position of the breakpoint investigated using a series of probes along the length of the chromosome. In all cases breakpoint region associated with rhabdomyosarcoma tumours and proximal to the D13S31 locus which lies in 13q14.3. In three translocations the RB1 gene was deleted as a result of the translocation but in at least one other case the BCLL breakpoint did not involve the RB1 gene, which consistently cosegregated in hybrids carrying other proximal markers. The D13S25 probe, which lies between RB1 and D13S31, however, was deleted in the translocation retaining RB1. It appears therefore that deletion of a gene(s) in this 2Mbp region is a critical event in some cases of BCLL tumorigenesis.","['Hawthorn, L A', 'Chapman, R', 'Oscier, D', 'Cowell, J K']","['Hawthorn LA', 'Chapman R', 'Oscier D', 'Cowell JK']","['ICRF Oncology Group, Institute of Child Health, London.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Jun;8(6):1415-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This induction can be inhibited by glucocorticoids, e.g. dexamethasone. All globin and other erythroid-specific genes tested contain GATA response elements (GATA-RE) and can be transactivated by GATA-1, a transcription factor. GATA-1 is highly expressed in erythroid cells, including MEL cells. We noted a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) response element motif near a GATA-RE motif in the promoter region of the mouse beta-major and beta-minor globin genes and about 130 bases away from a GATA-RE in the alpha 1-globin gene promoter and, therefore, investigated the possibility that the dexamethasone-induced inhibition of induced MEL cell differentiation may involve effects of the GR on GATA-1 activity. Evidence obtained from transfection assays and DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicates that the GR binds GATA-1 and interferes with its function before any interaction with DNA, but that the presence of a glucocorticoid response element near a GATA-RE augments the GR effect. The N-terminal 106-amino acid domain of the GR was found to be essential for the effect, possibly by binding to GATA-1. Since GATA-1 is autoregulatory, i.e. it has been shown by others to bind to its own promoter and up-regulate its own transcription, the finding that activated GR can interfere with GATA-1 function may provide an explanation for the inhibition by glucocorticoids of the entire program of erythroid differentiation in MEL cells. That is, by interfering with GATA-1 function, the GR inhibits not only the expression of erythroid structural genes, but may also inhibit the expression of a primary erythroid regulatory gene, GATA-1. It was also shown that the GATA-RE in each of the beta-globin promoters responds to mouse GATA-1 in a functional transfection assay.","['Chang, T J', 'Scher, B M', 'Waxman, S', 'Scher, W']","['Chang TJ', 'Scher BM', 'Waxman S', 'Scher W']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Graduate School of Biological Sciences, City University of New York, New York 10029.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Deletion', 'Globins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend.7.4.8502237 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 1993 Apr;7(4):528-42. doi: 10.1210/mend.7.4.8502237.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Mol Endocrinol 1993 Jun;7(6):786'],,,,,

The expression of myeloid antigens in ALL was seen in 25% of the cases. All B-lineage ALL had rearrangements and/or deletions of the Ig genes whereas TCR beta, gamma, and delta genes were rearranged in 21%, 52%, and 71%, respectively. TCR delta, gamma and/or beta were rearranged in T-ALL and four out of 13 cases had Ig gene rearrangement. Lymphoid-associated antigens were expressed in 40% of AML cases; those most frequent expressed were CD7 (17%), CD2 (15%), CD19 (10%), and CD10 (7.5%). Evidence of Ig and/or TCR gene rearrangements was detected in 12% of AML cases. There was no correlation between the isolated expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), B, and T-cell antigens with Ig and TCR gene rearrangements. However, in cases of AML defined as biphenotypic because they expressed two or more lymphoid antigens there was a statistically significant correlation between gene rearrangements and lymphoid score (p < 0.001). Our findings support the concept of biphenotypic leukemia as a distinct entity in which there is frequent correspondence between phenotypic and genotypic changes.","['Buccheri, V', 'Matutes, E', 'Dyer, M J', 'Catovsky, D']","['Buccheri V', 'Matutes E', 'Dyer MJ', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jun;7(6):919-27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An early stage was characterized by the presence in the blood of many large proliferating B lineage cells marked by surface antigen phenotype IgM+l-, B220low, CD5-, Mac-1low. During a prolonged intermediate 'remission' phase of different duration in each mouse, B lymphocytes in the periphery were non-proliferative, few, and of conventional phenotype (IgM+, B220+, CD5-, Mac-1-), while subsets of precursor B cells were both numerous and highly proliferative in the bone marrow. In the final stage of tumorigenesis, large proliferating cells similar in phenotype to those of the early period reappeared and increased rapidly in numbers. This B cell tumorigenic progression occurred independently of interactions with T lymphocytes. Evidence of massive cell death in the bone marrow during the intermediate phase, plus molecular characterization of the final tumors, suggested that the end of the peripheral 'remission' period and entry into the terminal stage of tumorigenesis may be due to a clone of cells acquiring the ability to circumvent normal processes of cell death and elimination that usually regulate the egress of B cells from the bone marrow to the periphery.","['Sidman, C L', 'Shaffer, D J', 'Jacobsen, K', 'Vargas, S R', 'Osmond, D G']","['Sidman CL', 'Shaffer DJ', 'Jacobsen K', 'Vargas SR', 'Osmond DG']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Ohio 45267.']",['eng'],"['AI20232/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI25765/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35845/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/genetics', '*Genes, myc', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Time Factors']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jun;7(6):887-95.,,,,,,,,,,,"['Eu-myc', 'myc']",,,,,,

The leukemias appeared to arise in the primary recipients by independent transformation events. The transformed cells from different mice differed in their in vitro growth characteristics, their ability to produce GM-CSF or multipotential CSF, and in the nature of the transplanted tumors derived from the primary cells. While all primary recipients at death contained fully transformed leukemic cells, the bulk of the large population of FDC-P1 cells appeared either to be untransformed or to have altered characteristics not yet representing full transformation. If the FDC-P1 engrafted model has some validity for myelodysplasia, the results suggest that sustained CSF administration to myelodysplastic patients possessing abnormal, potentially preleukemic, granulocyte-macrophage populations may increase the risk of death either from accumulated pretransformed or from fully transformed leukemic cells.","['Metcalf, D', 'Rasko, J E']","['Metcalf D', 'Rasko JE']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jun;7(6):878-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coagulant response to a number of stimuli is regulated by the expression of tissue factor, but the role of the plasminogen activator inhibitors, PAI-1 and PAI-2, in contributing to the net coagulant response is not known. In this study, we have examined the production of these proteins by cultured myeloid leukemic cells arrested at different stages of differentiation. Northern blot analysis showed time-dependent and differential production of mRNA for PAI-2 and tissue factor, and to a much lesser extent, PAI-1, in response to the differentiating agent, 12-phorbol-13-myristate acetate. The capacity to synthesize PAI-2 appeared to be related to the stage of myeloid cell differentiation. Examination of the gene products by immunoblot analysis demonstrated multiple forms of PAI-2 in all myeloid cells examined. In addition, a common characteristic of all the myeloid cells was the production of a high molecular weight species of tissue factor which may be a secreted form unique to leukemic cells.

At the lowest concentration range (0.1 microM to 20 microM for H-7 and 0.1 nM to 1 nM for staurosporine), we observed growth stimulation whereas higher concentrations induced dose-dependent growth inhibition. Moreover, AML-CFU proved to be significantly more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of both H-7 and staurosporine than CFU-GM (3.16- and 2.12-fold, respectively). These results were further confirmed with comparable murine cell line models (FDC-P1, a hematopoietic cell line generated from normal bone marrow and WEHI, a myelomonocytic leukemia cell line).

Our current understanding of the methylation of human genomes allows us to consider the association between the epigenetic phenomenon and the control of differentiation and proliferation in mammalian cells. In order to determine whether the methylation status of the M-BCR is associated with breakpoint-localization in this region and with the lineage of hematopoietic cells, we have examined 28 patients with Ph+ leukemias, including nine with Ph+ AL, six patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia without Ph (Ph- AML), and five patients with Ph- acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph- ALL); using the restriction endonuclease isochizomers, MspI and HpaII. In CML patients in the chronic phase, the hypomethylated status within the normal M-BCR allele is heterogeneous. In contrast, patients with Ph+ CML in the lymphoid blast crisis phase exhibited a 2.5/2.7 kb band with a complete disappearance of the germline M-BCR fragment (type L). This pattern is consistently noted in Ph- ALL cells, and the pattern is quite different from that found in myeloid blast crisis or Ph- AML (type M). In patients with M-BCR-nonrearranged Ph+ ALL, it is suggested that the M-BCR methylation patterns are cell-lineage specific but some Ph+ ALL cells had a hypomethylation pattern that was identical to that observed in Ph- AML, suggesting a distinction of genetic diversity of leukemia cells with the Ph chromosome, especially Ph+ AL.","['Ohyashiki, J H', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Kawakubo, K', 'Tauchi, T', 'Shimamoto, T', 'Toyama, K']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Kawakubo K', 'Tauchi T', 'Shimamoto T', 'Toyama K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Granulocytes/pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Methylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Jun;7(6):801-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unilateral X-inactivation was more common following cytotoxic therapy for lymphoma (7/25) than in normals (2/35) (p < 0.025) and in the lymphoma cohort was associated with increasing time from the end of therapy (p = 0.03). Patients in remission from lymphoma have an increased incidence of clonal haemopoiesis compared to normal individuals.

Among 13 marrow cultures from ALL patients with full-blown disease, 11 developed leukemic colonies. A type of colony, very similar to a lymphoblastic colony and possibly T-cell in origin, could be found in four cultures of the six control marrows. To minimize the difficulty in differentiating a leukemic blast colony and a normal lymphocyte colony, based solely on morphology, a quantitative approach was used. Since both the mean of blast colony count and the mean of blast percentage of leukemic marrow were significantly higher than those of the control group, mean value plus two standard deviations of the control group were defined arbitrarily as upper normal limits. The defined normal range was then used to examine the relationship between results of the cultures and clinical outcome for the ALL patients. Early relapse or incomplete remission following chemotherapy could be predicted in four patients by these quantitative colony-culture assays 0.5-2 months before full-blown disease. The low colony count and low blast percentage in the colony-culture assay of the fifth patient is compatible with the clinical observation of continuous remission.

In summary, the quantitative colony-culture assay could detect morphologically unidentifiable leukemic cells in ALL patients with early relapse or incomplete remission.

Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations were normal (0.21 ng/ml), which precludes the possibility of primary hyperparathyroidism or ectopic PTH secretion as a cause of the hypercalcemia. As for the factors which can accelerate mineral resorption, there were no apparent increases in the levels of PTH-related protein (PTH-rP), prostaglandins and vitamin D metabolites. In our in vitro experiment, ATRA did not stimulate the leukemic cells to produce PTH-rP.

The routine evaluation of BM aspirates, however, may be disappointing in accurately assessing marrow activity because of the sampling error inherent in the BM aspiration technique, and occasionally may fail to provide a precise diagnosis because BM aspirates cannot be obtained due to packed or fibrotic marrows. Because of the advantages it offers over the conventional method of diagnosis, we have studied Romanowsky-stained, thin sections of plastic-embedded BM biopsies from 87 newly diagnosed AML patients. Based on our study, the patients were broadly grouped into four categories: (1) those with hypocellular marrow (haemopoietic cellularity less than 50%), hypoplastic AML; (2) those with some degree of marrow fibrosis, AML with marrow fibrosis; (3) those with homogeneous infiltration of marrow with blast cells; and (4) those with inhomogenous infiltration of marrow with blast cells. Our results show that the proposed classification of AML based on the evaluation of plastic-embedded BM biopsy sections may offer benefits over those afforded by conventional morphologic smear techniques. This may provide significant prognostic information and may have a major impact on patient management. It may also provide a meaningful stratification of the patient population when comparing treatment protocols for newly diagnosed AML patients.","['Islam, A']",['Islam A'],"['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14623.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/*pathology', 'Plastic Embedding']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(93)90097-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 May;17(5):421-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90097-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The finding of bcl-2 expression in the terminal differentiated syncytial trophoblast, but not cytotrophoblast, and in some cells responsive to hormone stimulation such as in the endometrium and myometrium suggests that the gene expression may be related to hormone responsiveness. As no bcl-2 localization was seen in the benign hyperproliferative skin condition psoriasis, this does not suggest a straight-forward link to proliferation.

The IFN+ group had received IFN-A in doses of 3 to 5 x 10(6) U/m2 three times a week or more for at least 4 weeks anytime before transplantation. RESULTS: For patients in chronic phase, there were no significant differences between the IFN+ group and the IFN- group in regard to neutrophils recovery more than 1.0 x 10(9)/L (29 v 24), platelet recovery more than 50 x 10(9)/L (33 v 36), incidence of grade II to IV GVHD (23% v 28%), incidence of chronic GVHD (39% v 47%), disease-free survival (46% +/- 11% v 59% +/- 13%), relapse (9% v 11%), or 100-day transplant-related mortality (22% v 16%).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 1987 to March 1990, 161 assessable patients younger than 15 years of age with newly diagnosed AML were treated uniformly with two courses of daunorubicin and standard-dose cytarabine. After initial consolidation with a course of daunorubicin, cytarabine, and thioguanine (DAT), patients in complete remission (CR) were randomized to receive either ABMT or SPC, except for those with an HLA-matched sibling who were assigned to undergo BMT. SPC consisted of three additional courses of DAT, followed by three pairs of drugs administered sequentially for a total of six cycles. RESULTS: Overall, 127 of 161 patients attained CR (79%). The estimated probabilities of survival and event-free survival (EFS) at 5 years for all patients were 42% and 25%, respectively (median follow-up, 28 months). For the 127 complete responders, the 5-year probability of disease-free survival (DFS) was 31%, with a cumulative risk of relapse of 64%. For the purpose of this study, all complete responders were evaluated for analysis of disease outcome according to the intent-to-treat principle, regardless of whether they actually received the intended therapy. The 5-year DFS was 51% for the BMT group (n = 24), significantly higher (P = .03) than that observed for the other cohorts: 21% for ABMT (n = 35), 27% for SPC (n = 37), and 34% for a group of 31 nonrandomized (NR) patients. Bone marrow relapse was the most frequent cause of postremission failure in all therapeutic subgroups, including the BMT cohort, in which no deaths attributable to the toxicity of the procedure were recorded. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that BMT is more effective than ABMT or SPC in preventing leukemia relapse and extending DFS duration in children with AML in first remission.","['Amadori, S', 'Testi, A M', 'Arico, M', 'Comelli, A', 'Giuliano, M', 'Madon, E', 'Masera, G', 'Rondelli, R', 'Zanesco, L', 'Mandelli, F']","['Amadori S', 'Testi AM', 'Arico M', 'Comelli A', 'Giuliano M', 'Madon E', 'Masera G', 'Rondelli R', 'Zanesco L', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.6.1046 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jun;11(6):1046-54. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.6.1046.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These codes were suggested to be surrogates of electromagnetic field exposure. However, the selection criteria used in several of the studies caused the case and control populations to be non-comparable, especially with respect to residential mobility. Specifically, controls were required to be residentially stable but cases were not. Thus, an artificial association between residential mobility and cancer was created by the subject selection procedure. The present study of 5721 residences in Columbus, Ohio was conducted to learn if bias due to differences in residential mobility, rather than electromagnetic fields, could explain the reported association between wire configuration codes and childhood cancer. It was found that the proportion of homes classified as ""high"" wire code in the non-stable population was 31% greater than the corresponding proportion in the stable population. This finding shows that high wire codes are associated with homes in which the residents are mobile and low wire codes are associated with homes occupied by stable residents. Thus, as a consequence of this association between residential mobility and high wire codes, studies that created an artificial association between residential mobility and childhood cancer will also produce a false association between high wire codes and cancer.","['Jones, T L', 'Shih, C H', 'Thurston, D H', 'Ware, B J', 'Cole, P']","['Jones TL', 'Shih CH', 'Thurston DH', 'Ware BJ', 'Cole P']","['Electrical Research Service, American Electric Power Service Corporation, Columbus, OH 43215.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Epidemiol,Journal of clinical epidemiology,8801383,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Housing/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Ohio/epidemiology', 'Population Dynamics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Selection Bias']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0895-4356(93)90127-M [pii]', '10.1016/0895-4356(93)90127-m [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Epidemiol. 1993 Jun;46(6):545-8. doi: 10.1016/0895-4356(93)90127-m.,,,,['J Clin Epidemiol. 1994 Sep;47(9):1081-3.

The coincident release of preformed mediators and AA metabolites suggests that AA metabolism is related to mast cell degranulation. To clarify the relationship between mast cell degranulation and AA metabolism, the effects of various A cascade inhibitors on rat basophilic leukemia cell (RBL) mediator release induced by either anti-IgE or A23187 were examined. 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) inhibited both PGD2 and LTC4/D4 generation, and partially inhibited serotonin release. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) caused complete inhibition of LTC4/D4 generation, and partial inhibition of PGD2 generation and serotonin release. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, and the specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, L-651,392 completely inhibited PGD2 and LTC4/D4 generation, respectively, without affecting release of other mediators. Both PGD2 and LTC4/D4 generation were abolished by the combination of indomethacin and L-651,392, however, serotonin release remained intact. HPLC analysis showed that no shift to other AA metabolites occurred after the treatment with these inhibitors. Mepacrine, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor, completely inhibited PGD2 and LTC4/D4 generation, as well as AA release itself, without affecting serotonin release. Therefore, neither AA metabolism nor AA release is necessary for RBL degranulation.","['Igarashi, Y', 'Lundgren, J D', 'Shelhamer, J H', 'Kaliner, M A', 'White, M V']","['Igarashi Y', 'Lundgren JD', 'Shelhamer JH', 'Kaliner MA', 'White MV']","['Allergic Diseases Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Immunopharmacology,Immunopharmacology,7902474,"['0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phenothiazines)', '0 (SRS-A)', '1191-85-1 (5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic Acid)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', '93211-49-5 (4-bromo-2,7-dimethoxy-3H-phenothiazin-3-one)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic Acid/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Masoprocol/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phenothiazines/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin D2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'SRS-A/metabolism', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0162-3109(93)90016-J [pii]', '10.1016/0162-3109(93)90016-j [doi]']",ppublish,Immunopharmacology. 1993 Mar-Apr;25(2):131-44. doi: 10.1016/0162-3109(93)90016-j.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the malignant tumors 32 were primary salivary tumors and one case each of lymphoma and leukemia. The overall accuracy was 97 per cent. There were no false positives but one false negative diagnosis. In two cases there was a discrepancy of tumor type between the cytology and histopathology; these were due mainly to sampling errors. This study documents that cytomorphology can characterise a wide range of histologically described lesions including the rare epithelial myoepithelial tumor. The application of stringent criteria in the diagnoses of salivary lesions, even inflammatory conditions like chronic sialadenitis, avoids over-diagnosis. Both inflammatory and neoplastic lesions may be cystic. These cystic lesions may prove to be a pitfall in cytology. Reaspiration of cystic lesions especially from residual solid areas greatly improves accuracy. We suggest that a fore-knowledge of tumor type preoperatively greatly reduces surgery in clinically questionable salivary lesions.","['Bhatia, A']",['Bhatia A'],"['Dept. of Pathology, University College of Medical Science, G.T.B.

Different cellular targets for oligodeoxynucleotides with oncologic interest have been identified such as oncogenes, growth factors, and cell cycle-related genes.

Pol alpha gene expression is constitutive throughout the cell cycle and its mRNA content and activity are related to the growth rate and neoplastic phenotype. The effects of a 18-mer pol alpha antisense oligomer on the proliferation of the MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cell line have been investigated.

UCN-01 itself was shown to exhibit antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo in oncogene-activated human and murine tumor cell lines. Since the mechanism(s) of action of UCN-01 is thought to be different from those of alkylating agents, including mitomycin C (MMC), we tested the combined effect of UCN-01 with MMC on human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. UCN-01 potentiated the antiproliferative activity of MMC and yet it did not affect the growth of the cells in vitro. However, other nonselective protein kinase inhibitors, such as staurosporine, K-252a, KT6124 (a derivative of K-252a) and H7, did not enhance the activity of MMC. Isobologram analysis revealed that the interaction of UCN-01 with MMC was synergistic in its antiproliferative activity. A DNA histogram of A431 cells treated with both UCN-01 and MMC showed a block in the cell cycle at the G1/S phase. However, a histogram of cells treated with UCN-01 or MMC alone showed a G1 or a G2M block, respectively. The combined effect of UCN-01 with MMC was further examined in vivo in xenografted A431 cells in nude mice. The combination of both drugs in a single i.v. injection exhibited greater antitumor activity than MMC and UCN-01 alone (P < 0.01). This synergistic antitumor effect was also confirmed in two other solid tumor cell lines, i.e. human xenografted colon carcinoma Co-3 and murine sarcoma 180. The same was observed in the i.v.-inoculated P388 leukemia model, in which we saw an increased lifespan of mice when UCN-01 was combined with MMC. These results suggests the feasibility of using UCN-01 in clinical oncology, especially in combination with alkylating agents such as MMC. In addition, this combination therapy might be a novel chemotherapeutic approach to MMC-insensitive tumors in clinical trials.","['Akinaga, S', 'Nomura, K', 'Gomi, K', 'Okabe, M']","['Akinaga S', 'Nomura K', 'Gomi K', 'Okabe M']","['Pharmaceutical Research Laboratories, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co.

JD118 is a cytotoxic murine IgM mAb with reactivity restricted to a subset of normal B cells, some monocytic series cells, and a large percentage of B cell hematopoietic neoplasms including acute and chronic leukemias and lymphomas. Specificity was determined on several hundred normal and neoplastic, hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells and tissues, as well as progenitor cells. JD118 was able to kill fresh human leukemias and lymphomas in the presence of human serum as a complement source with an LD50 of 100 ng/ml. At this mAb concentration, fewer than 4% of more than 10(5) available target sites were bound. Killing was not affected by changes in antigen expression observed during the cell cycle nor by loss of cell-surface targets via antigenic modulation. Cytotoxicity could be achieved with human serum diluted as low as 5%, suggesting that complement depletion in vivo should not limit activity. Autologous human serum could be used effectively as a complement source. The JD118 antigen target has not been identified, but it appears to be a glycoprotein. Up-regulation of antigen expression on normal B cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro resulted in antigen-negative neoplasms becoming positive and thus targets for JD118 killing. The restricted expression, potent cytotoxic characteristics, and potential for up-regulation of its antigen make JD118 a possible candidate for ex vivo autologous bone marrow purging and in vivo therapeutic trials in patients with B cell neoplasms.","['Czuczman, M S', 'Garin-Chesa, P', 'Lemoli, R M', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Czuczman MS', 'Garin-Chesa P', 'Lemoli RM', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York 10021.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology/therapy', 'Cell Cycle/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*chemistry', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Up-Regulation']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01742255 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1993 Jun;36(6):387-96. doi: 10.1007/BF01742255.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Matched case-control study with three controls for each case. SETTING: The whole of Scotland. SUBJECTS: The fathers of 1024 children with leukaemia and 237 children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in Scotland below the age of 25 among those born in Scotland since nuclear operations began (in 1958) and the fathers of 3783 randomly chosen controls. The fathers of 80 children with leukaemia and 16 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in north Cumbria were also covered since some workers at one Scottish nuclear site live over the border in that area. Details of all fathers were then matched against records of the nuclear industry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Paternal preconceptional radiation exposures, particularly relatively high levels, both lifetime and in the six and three months before conception. RESULTS: No significant excess was observed in any subgroup and there was no significant trend: fathers of three controls but no cases were exposed to lifetime preconceptional levels of 100 mSv or greater (Fisher's exact p value 0.84). In the six months before conception, fathers of two cases and three controls received 10 mSv or more, odds ratio 2.3 (95% confidence interval 0.31 to 17.24). In the three months before conception the fathers of one case and two controls received 5 mSv or more, odds ratio 1.7 (0.10 to 30.76). The results for leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma combined were similar. CONCLUSIONS: No significant excess of leukaemia or of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was found at any radiation level in any preconceptional period.","['Kinlen, L J', 'Clarke, K', 'Balkwill, A']","['Kinlen LJ', 'Clarke K', 'Balkwill A']","['Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Infirmary.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Fathers', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Preconception Care', 'Random Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Scotland/epidemiology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.306.6886.1153 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1993 May 1;306(6886):1153-8. doi: 10.1136/bmj.306.6886.1153.,,,PMC1677644,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerical evidence for unusual coexpressions (present in normal marrow at < or = 0.1%) of surface markers on > or = 10% of the blast cells was found in 85% of all cases. Asynchronous expression of myeloid differentiation antigens occurred in 70% of the cases. Unusual coexpression of T-lymphoid, B-lymphoid, or natural killer (NK) markers with myeloid markers occurred in 38%, 13%, and 21%, respectively, of all AML cases. Two- and three-color analyses confirmed coexpression in 15 of 15 cases, and indicated that these percentages are an underestimate, because coexpression can be demonstrated in cases without numerical overlap. These data indicate that the unusual coexpression of normal differentiation antigens is a common occurrence in AML. Markers in 12 of 13 patients were similar between presentation and relapse, and in two patients, unusual phenotypes detected at first relapse were shown at second relapse, indicating these immunophenotypes are stable in the majority of AML patients. Significant correlations were found between t(8;21) cytogenetics and coexpression of CD19 with CD15 or CD34, t(9;22) and coexpression of CD19 and CD34, and t(15;17) and coexpression of CD2 and myeloid antigens. Multiparameter fluorescence analysis allows detection of unusual phenotypes when the blast counts are < 5% (classical remission). Analysis of 16 patients in remission indicated the presence of presentation phenotypes in 0.2% to 7.9% of the lymphocyte + blast light scatter region, representing 0.03% to 1.4% of the total nucleated marrow cells. Of the 16 patients with > or = 4 months follow-up after detection of these cells, 6 of 6 patients with > or = 0.2% unusual presentation phenotypic marrow cells have relapsed, while 9 of 10 patients with < 0.2% remain in remission.

This spontaneous proliferation is related to the endogenous production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), the major myeloma-cell growth factor. A 50% inhibitory dose (100 U/mL) of human recombinant gamma-interferon (hr gamma-IFN) blocked the proliferation of myeloma cells almost completely in all 19 patients analyzed. This inhibition was not caused by suppression of endogenous IL-6 production and was also observed in the presence of an excess of hrIL-6. hr gamma-IFN was also completely inhibitory in four human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) whose growth is totally dependent on the addition of exogenous hrIL-6. This inhibition was associated with a 47% to 73% decrease in membrane IL-6-binding gp80 protein as well as with a 90% decrease in the amount of gp80 mRNA in HMCL. These results are in line with recent reports indicating that gamma-IFN inhibited several IL-6-dependent biologic processes.

Of the 19 marrow samples tested, 7 responded to GM-CSF with a mean increase in ALL blast colonies of 346%. Blast cells from one of the responders chosen for flow cytometric study showed expression of GM-CSF receptors on 38% of cells. These findings prompted us to establish five ALL cell lines of diverse phenotypes to examine the expression of GM-CSF and GM-CSF receptor genes in human leukemia, and to determine the role of GM-CSF in autocrine and paracrine growth control of ALL cells. One line, termed G2, manifested a GM-CSF-mediated autocrine pattern of cell growth with the following features: G2 blast colony growth in a serum-free system without added growth factor was density dependent; exogenous GM-CSF augmented G2 colony formation when the cells were seeded at low density; G2 cells constitutively expressed mRNA for GM-CSF and GM-CSF receptor; G2 cells also produced and secreted measurable amounts of GM-CSF into cell culture supernatant; and, monoclonal anti-GM-CSF antibodies abolished G2 colony growth when added to cultures with cells seeded at low density without growth factors. Of the other four ALL cell lines, three expressed mRNA for GM-CSF receptor and responded in vitro to added GM-CSF with increased blast colony growth; however, none of these four cell lines expressed mRNA for constitutive production of GM-CSF. A fifth ALL cell line lacked receptors for GM-CSF and did not respond in clonogenic assays to added GM-CSF. Thus, a bioregulator of normal hematopoiesis plays a central role in autocrine growth control of G2 ALL cells, and an important paracrine growth-promoting role in three of four other ALL cell lines.","['Freedman, M H', 'Grunberger, T', 'Correa, P', 'Axelrad, A A', 'Dube, I D', 'Cohen, A']","['Freedman MH', 'Grunberger T', 'Correa P', 'Axelrad AA', 'Dube ID', 'Cohen A']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71550-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jun 1;81(11):3068-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three patients with MDS (2 RAEB and 1 RAEB in T) had missense point mutations in the conserved regions of the p53 coding sequence. Furthermore, expression of the wild-type p53 mRNA was not detected in these three patients. The probable absence of normal p53 function in the three cases studied here suggests that alterations in the p53 gene may occasionally play a role in MDS.

We found that although the mature myeloid compartment in patients with CML was expanded and entirely derived from the dominant leukemic clone, the primitive hematopoietic progenitor compartment did not show a corresponding expansion and was substantially enriched for cells without the BCR-ABL gene rearrangement. More importantly, primitive progenitors exhibiting the BCR-ABL gene rearrangement did not express either the BCR-ABL hybrid mRNA or fusion protein (P210). Expression of P210 protein and BCR-ABL mRNA increased with myeloid commitment in vivo as well as with growth factor-induced proliferation and differentiation of the primitive CML progenitors in vitro. This differential expression of BCR-ABL between primitive and mature CML progenitors may explain the expansion of the leukemic clone at the level of mature myeloid progenitors and granulocytes without a concomitant expansion of primitive CML progenitors. Because BCR-ABL mRNA is minimally expressed or may be absent in primitive CML progenitors, these cells may escape detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and eradication by antisense oligonucleotides targeted against BCR-ABL mRNA.","['Bedi, A', 'Zehnbauer, B A', 'Collector, M I', 'Barber, J P', 'Zicha, M S', 'Sharkis, S J', 'Jones, R J']","['Bedi A', 'Zehnbauer BA', 'Collector MI', 'Barber JP', 'Zicha MS', 'Sharkis SJ', 'Jones RJ']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL46533/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations/diagnosis', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71530-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jun 1;81(11):2898-902.,,,,,,,,,,,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,

Male New Zealand White rabbits were injected with 0.125 mg dexamethasone (n = 10) or vehicle (control group, n = 10). Both groups were fed a 1% cholesterol diet for 8 weeks. Although the dexamethasone-treated animals exhibited a greater degree of hyperlipidemia, they exhibited significantly less atherosclerotic plaque of the aortic surface than control animals (7.8% versus 47.2%). Immunofluorescence study of the aortic plaque specimens showed that dexamethasone administration reduced both macrophages and T lymphocytes. In vitro, dexamethasone suppressed the proliferation and differentiation of U937 cells and inhibited uptake and degradation of beta-very low density lipoproteins by mouse peritoneal macrophages. These findings suggest that dexamethasone suppresses the development of atherosclerosis in the aorta of rabbits by inhibiting recruitment and proliferation of macrophages and the formation of foam cells in plaques.","['Asai, K', 'Funaki, C', 'Hayashi, T', 'Yamada, K', 'Naito, M', 'Kuzuya, M', 'Yoshida, F', 'Yoshimine, N', 'Kuzuya, F']","['Asai K', 'Funaki C', 'Hayashi T', 'Yamada K', 'Naito M', 'Kuzuya M', 'Yoshida F', 'Yoshimine N', 'Kuzuya F']","['Department of Geriatrics, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb,Arteriosclerosis and thrombosis : a journal of vascular biology,9101388,"['0 (Cholesterol, Dietary)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, VLDL)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/drug effects', 'Arteriosclerosis/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Body Weight', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Cholesterol, Dietary/*administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lipoproteins/blood/drug effects', 'Lipoproteins, VLDL/blood/metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Organ Size', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'Rabbits', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.atv.13.6.892 [doi]'],ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb. 1993 Jun;13(6):892-9. doi: 10.1161/01.atv.13.6.892.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine which cytokines are produced in the nervous system and to identify any correlations with dementia, cytokine and HIV messenger RNA expression was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the brains from 24 HIV-infected patients with and without dementia and 9 HIV-uninfected control subjects. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha messenger RNA were significantly higher and levels of interleukin (IL)-4 messenger RNA were significantly lower in demented compared to nondemented HIV-infected patients. Demented patients also had lower IL-1 beta levels than did nondemented patients. No significant differences were detected in the amounts of leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-6, transforming growth factor-beta 1 and -beta 2, monokine induced by gamma interferon-2 (MIG-2), or interferon-gamma messenger RNAs. IL-10 and IL-2 messenger RNAs were undetectable in all brains examined. Cytokine messenger RNA levels in nondemented HIV-positive patients were similar to those in HIV-negative control subjects. HIV transcripts were more abundant in subcortical white matter than in the basal ganglia, cortex, or deep white matter.

Transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia as a model.,63-73,"OBJECTIVE: Studies concerning the genetic relatedness between chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the more aggressive B-cell cancers that develop in about 10% of affected persons were reviewed. These B-cell cancers include large B-cell lymphoma (the Richter syndrome), prolymphocytic transformation, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. Two possible relations were evaluated: development from the chronic lymphocytic leukemia clone (clonal evolution) and development of a genetically unrelated, independent second cancer. DATA SOURCES: An English-language medical literature search was done using MEDLINE (1982 to 1992) and CANCERLIT (1982 to 1992). An extensive manual search of the literature that included meeting abstracts and reports was also done. Approximately 500 articles, abstracts, and book chapters were identified; 102 were selected for detailed analysis. DATA ANALYSIS: Analysis of genetic relatedness between the two cancers considered concordance for immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, for immunoglobulin isotypes and idiotypes, and for cytogenetic abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: In the case of large B-cell lymphoma, generally thought to arise from the chronic lymphocytic leukemia clone, approximately one half of the patients had genetically unrelated cancers. In prolymphocytic transformation, all cases studied appeared to evolve from the chronic lymphocytic leukemia clone. The few studies of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and multiple myeloma showed genetic relatedness in some cases and unrelatedness in others. These data indicate that progression to more aggressive B-cell cancers in persons with chronic lymphocytic leukemia can result from either clonal evolution or from an independent transforming event.","['Foon, K A', 'Thiruvengadam, R', 'Saven, A', 'Bernstein, Z P', 'Gale, R P']","['Foon KA', 'Thiruvengadam R', 'Saven A', 'Bernstein ZP', 'Gale RP']","['Markey Cancer Center, Lexington, Kentucky.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-119-1-199307010-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1993 Jul 1;119(1):63-73. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-119-1-199307010-00011.,,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: IL-6 levels were significantly higher in 34 leukemic children than in 18 healthy controls and 15 patients with various malignant diseases in long remission (p < 0.0001). Three patients with apparent bacterial infections showed especially high IL-6 levels of > 100 pg/ml. In all the leukemic children, the high IL-6 levels at initial diagnosis had decreased to a low range at the time of complete remission, regardless of the use of antibiotics. In 10 of 14 leukemic children, TNF levels were high at diagnosis and then decreased to undetectable levels at remission. The relationship between IL-6/TNF levels and clinical/laboratory findings in leukemic children at diagnosis was also examined.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological assessments (NA) were performed in 35 children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with cranial irradiation (CI) and intrathecal and intravenous methotrexate. Patients were under the age of 7 years (MD: 3.5 years) at diagnosis; median follow-up at MRI and NA was 8 years since diagnosis. RESULTS: MRI's were classified as definitely abnormal in 51% and as probably abnormal in another 17% of the patients. White matter damage was most frequently seen. MRI abnormalities were not related to CI dose or age at diagnosis. Patients showed significantly lower scores, compared to the norm group on measures of intelligence, verbal auditory memory, visual motor integration, and fine motor functioning. Lower scores significantly correlated with higher CI dose (25-32 Gy compared to 18-20 Gy) and younger age at diagnosis (< 4.0 years compared to > or = 4.0 years). Forty percent of the patients had to be referred to schools for learning disabled.

Implications for post-marrow transplant antileukemia treatment.,185-95,"PURPOSE: Over the past 30 years, evidence supporting the existence of an antileukemic effect of allogeneic bone marrow has rapidly expanded. Early animal studies demonstrated this ""graft-vs.-leukemia"" (GVL) effect in association with graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). PATIENTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: Clinical evidence for the GVL effect derived from experience in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) includes the following: the association of GVHD, both acute and chronic, with a decreased rate of leukemic relapse, the occurrence of a higher relapse rate following identical twin transplants compared to allogeneic major histocompatibility complex-matched sibling transplants, the decrease of GVHD and increase of leukemic relapses with T-cell depletion of donor bone marrow, and that allogeneic marrow transplants without GVHD have a lower leukemic relapse rate compared to identical twin transplants and T-cell depleted transplants. In addition, some reports indicate that modifying the immunosuppressive regimens (consisting of cyclosporine A or methotrexate) that are aimed at prevention of GVHD can affect leukemic relapse rates. Although the mechanism of this GVL effect is poorly understood, there are several favored hypotheses. Cytotoxic T cells, which may mediate GVH effects, could also mediate a GVL effect. There may also be T cells with specificity for destroying leukemic blasts alone. The natural killer/lymphokine-activated killer cytotoxic cell may play a role in the GVL effect. These nonspecific cytotoxic cells can be activated with cytokines induced in the transplant setting. Finally, the GVL effect could be secondary to the in vivo induction of various cytokines that either have direct antileukemic effects or that induce leukemic differentiation. Advances in our basic understanding of the immune system and its activation, and the availability of purified immunoregulatory cytokines, have revealed new ways to induce GVL-like effects. Promising results with therapy based on use of interleukin-2 in solid tumors have been seen. It is hoped that these advances will enable the ""antileukemic"" components of the GVL effect to be prospectively controlled (as part of the technique of marrow transplant) and intentionally used as leukemic therapy in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.","['Sosman, J A', 'Sondel, P M']","['Sosman JA', 'Sondel PM']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['ACS-CH-237/CH/OID CDC HHS/United States', 'CH-32685/CH/OID CDC HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,['0 (Biological Factors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/therapy']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199305000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1993 May;15(2):185-95. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199305000-00006.,,92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been reported to provide disease-free survival rates of from 40 to 70%, its application is severely limited by the lack of sibling donors. The use of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) allows the application of therapy of comparable intensity to a larger number of patients. A potential problem associated with transplanting autologous marrow, the reinfusion of residual leukemic cells in the harvested marrow, can be addressed through purging. The most widely used purging techniques involve either immunologic or pharmacologic techniques. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1980, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has had an active autologous bone marrow transplantation program for children with recurrent ALL. Sixty-six children underwent autologous marrow transplants with a conditioning regimen consisting of teniposide, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation. This was followed by infusion of autologous marrow purged with two monoclonal antibodies directed against CD9 and CD10 and complement. RESULTS: Twelve patients died of acute complications, 26 experienced relapse of ALL, one patient had acute myeloid leukemia 6 years after marrow transplant, and 27 remain in continuous complete remission. The event-free survival rate was 47% for patients with a first remission of at least 2 years, as compared with a rate of 10% for those with a shorter first remission. Since 1989, we have used a new conditioning regimen consisting of fractionated total body irradiation followed by high-dose etoposide and cyclophosphamide for patients with a short first remission. For the first 11 patients, the event-free survival rate is 61%. LITERATURE REVIEW: We reviewed reports of 552 patients with ALL who underwent ABMT at 17 centers. To our knowledge, only four series, including our own, were limited to pediatric patients. Some form of purging was used in 483 (87%) patients. Although conditioning regimens varied greatly, more than 80% of patients received at least total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide. Failure of engraftment was reported in only three patients. The rates of disease-free survival in these series clustered between 25-35%. The most common cause of treatment failure after ABMT was relapse, which occurred in 40-85% of patients. Early deaths from toxicity occurred in 5-21% of patients. Two studies attempted to compare the results of allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplantation by using the same conditioning regimen for all. Neither series reported significant differences in overall survival.","['Billett, A L', 'Sallan, S E']","['Billett AL', 'Sallan SE']","['Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199305000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1993 May;15(2):162-8. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199305000-00003.,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mismatched related donors or closely matched unrelated donors.,141-9,"PURPOSE: Bone marrow transplantation has been used with increasing frequency for the treatment of children with leukemia that is resistant to conventional therapy or in cases that have initial features indicating a poor prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For those children who are in need of a transplant but who do not have a matched sibling as bone marrow donor, transplantation can be performed with marrow from either a closely matched unrelated donor or from a partially matched family member. RESULTS: Comparable results have been reported for transplants using either one of these alternative types of donor marrow, but these results are not as good as those using HLA-matched siblings as donors. CONCLUSIONS: Delays in engraftment, increased infection rates, and complications related to graft-versus-host disease makes transplants using marrow from alternative donors more difficult and less successful. Improved methods to control graft-versus-host disease and greater ability to prevent infections, particularly opportunistic viral infections, will increase the success rate for marrow transplants using alternative donors. In addition, expansion of the National Marrow Donor Registry increases the likelihood of finding unrelated donors for children requiring such transplants.","['Trigg, M E']",['Trigg ME'],"['University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', '*Tissue Donors']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199305000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1993 May;15(2):141-9. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199305000-00001.,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Injection of spleen and marrow cells from these mice promotes long-term survival of lethally irradiated wild-type animals, however, showing that the LIF- stem cells remain pluripotent. The numbers of committed progenitors are also reduced in the spleen but not the bone marrow, suggesting that stem cells interact differently with the splenic and medullary microenvironment. Heterozygous animals are intermediate in phenotype, implying that LIF has a dosage effect, and defects in stem cell number can be compensated by exogenous LIF.

Here we describe three pairs of infant twins with concordant leukaemia who each share unique (clonal) but non-constitutive HRX rearrangements in their leukaemic cells, providing evidence that the leukaemogenic event originates in utero and unequivocal support for the intra-placental 'metastasis' hypothesis for leukaemia concordance in twins.","['Ford, A M', 'Ridge, S A', 'Cabrera, M E', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Steel, C M', 'Chan, L C', 'Greaves, M']","['Ford AM', 'Ridge SA', 'Cabrera ME', 'Mahmoud H', 'Steel CM', 'Chan LC', 'Greaves M']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Diseases in Twins/*genetics', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', '*Oncogenes', 'Placenta', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*embryology/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Twins, Monozygotic']",1993/05/27 00:00,1993/05/27 00:01,['1993/05/27 00:00'],"['1993/05/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/27 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/363358a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1993 May 27;363(6427):358-60. doi: 10.1038/363358a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proteins encoded by these genes form homo- and heterodimers which recognize a common DNA sequence motif. Recent data have suggested that homodimers of individual subunits of NF-kappa B can selectively activate gene expression in vitro. To explore this possibility in a more physiological manner, murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were treated with phosphorothio antisense oligonucleotides to either p50 or p65. Within 5 h after exposure to phosphorothio antisense p65 oligonucleotides, cells exhibited dramatic alterations in adhesion properties. Similar findings were obtained in a stable cell line that expressed a dexamethasone-inducible antisense mRNA to p65. Although antisense oligonucleotides raised against both p50 and p65 elicited a significant reduction in their respective mRNAs, only the cells treated with antisense p50 maintained a normal morphology. However, 6 days following removal of leukemia-inhibiting factor, a growth factor which suppresses embryonic stem cell differentiation, adhesion properties of cells treated with the antisense p50 oligonucleotides were markedly affected. The ability of the individual antisense oligonucleotides to elicit differential effects on cell adhesion, a property dependent upon the stage of differentiation, suggests that the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-kappa B regulate gene expression either as homodimers or as heterodimers with other rel family members. Furthermore, the finding that reduction in p65 expression alone had profound effects on cell adhesion properties indicates that p65 plays an important role in nonstimulated cells and cannot exist solely complexed with the cytosolic inhibitory protein I kappa B.","['Narayanan, R', 'Higgins, K A', 'Perez, J R', 'Coleman, T A', 'Rosen, C A']","['Narayanan R', 'Higgins KA', 'Perez JR', 'Coleman TA', 'Rosen CA']","['Division of Oncology, Roche Research Center, Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., Nutley, New Jersey 07110.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (Thionucleotides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Oncogenes', 'PC12 Cells', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Antisense/metabolism', 'Stem Cells', 'Thionucleotides']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.6.3802-3810.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Jun;13(6):3802-10. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.6.3802-3810.1993.,,,PMC359866,,,,,,,,['rel'],,,,,,

The DNA binding and several transcriptional regulatory domains of the c-Myb protein have been defined by transient transfections into nonhematopoietic cell lines. Although the relationship between these domains and transformation has been studied, little is known about the function of these domains during hematopoietic maturation. Up-regulation of stably transfected c-myb in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells blocks terminal differentiation when MEL cells are induced to differentiate with N,N'-hexamethylene bisacetamide. To determine which functional domains of c-Myb are necessary and sufficient to block differentiation, mutated c-myb constructs under the control of a murine metallothionein promoter were transfected into C19 MEL cells, and stable clonal cell lines were established. The ability of Myb mutants to block differentiation paralleled their ability to transactivate transcription of a reporter gene containing Myb-responsive elements, by transient transfection into a lymphoid cell line. The smallest c-Myb mutant able to block differentiation consisted of the DNA binding domain juxtaposed to the transactivation domain.

A major determinant of the thymic disease specificity of Moloney virus genetically maps to the conserved viral core motif in the Moloney virus enhancer. Point mutations introduced into the core site significantly shifted the disease specificity of the Moloney virus from thymic leukemia to erythroid leukemia (N.A. Speck, B. Renjifo, E. Golemis, T.N. Fredrickson, J.W. Hartley, and N. Hopkins, Genes Dev. 4:233-242, 1990). We previously reported the purification of core-binding factors (CBF) from calf thymus nuclei (S. Wang and N.A. Speck, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:89-102, 1992). CBF binds to core sites in murine leukemia virus and T-cell receptor enhancers. Affinity-purified CBF contains multiple polypeptides. In this study, we sequenced five tryptic peptides from two of the bovine CBF proteins and isolated three cDNA clones from a mouse thymus cDNA library encoding three of the tryptic peptides from the bovine proteins. The cDNA clones, which we call CBF beta p22.0, CBF beta p21.5, and CBF beta p17.6, encode three highly related but distinct proteins with deduced molecular sizes of 22.0, 21.5, and 17.6 kDa that appear to be translated from multiply spliced mRNAs transcribed from the same gene. CBF beta p22.0, CBF beta p21.5, and CBF beta p17.6 do not by themselves bind the core site. However, CBF beta p22.0 and CBF beta p21.5 form a complex with DNA-binding CBF alpha subunits and as a result decrease the rate of dissociation of the CBF protein-DNA complex. Association of the CBF beta subunits does not extend the phosphate contacts in the binding site. We propose that CBF beta is a non-DNA-binding subunit of CBF and does not contact DNA directly.","['Wang, S', 'Wang, Q', 'Crute, B E', 'Melnikova, I N', 'Keller, S R', 'Speck, N A']","['Wang S', 'Wang Q', 'Crute BE', 'Melnikova IN', 'Keller SR', 'Speck NA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA058343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23018/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51065-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.6.3324-3339.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Jun;13(6):3324-39. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.6.3324-3339.1993.,"['GENBANK/L03279', 'GENBANK/L03305', 'GENBANK/L03306']",,PMC359789,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the early effects of infection may determine the pathway that eventually leads to malignant transformation. To determine how F-MuLV affects host cell proliferation soon after infection, BALB/c mice were inoculated with virus and then were assayed for susceptibility to appropriately pseudotyped spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) as an indicator of erythropoietic activity. Twelve-week-old mice exposed to F-MuLV for 9 days were more susceptible (by a factor of 30) to superinfection by SFFV than were nonviremic mice. To test whether increased susceptibility was the result of increased hematopoietic activity, hematopoietic progenitors from the spleens of F-MuLV-infected mice were enumerated with a clonal culture assay. Nine days after inoculation with F-MuLV, the numbers of colony-forming progenitors increased by a factor of 4. Morphological analysis of the cultured colonies showed that erythroid, granulocytic, monocytic, and mixed granulocytic-monocytic progenitors all had increased. Thus, F-MuLV more rapidly induced a generalized increase in hematopoiesis than has previously been reported.

Most of the characterized human tumor antigens have been classified as tumor associated, because of demonstrable expression at low levels in some normal cells, and thus have not been extensively studied as potential targets of a therapeutic immune response. However, the quantitative difference in expression of such antigens between the tumor and normal cells might permit the generation of antigen-specific T cells capable of selective antitumor and not autoimmune activity. To address this issue, transgenic (TG) mice were generated that expressed low levels of Friend murine leukemia virus (FMuLV) envelope protein in lymphoid cells under the control of an immunoglobulin promoter. This protein is expressed at high levels by a Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia of C57BL/6 (B6) origin, FBL, and has been shown to serve as an efficient tumor-specific rejection antigen in B6 mice. The env-TG mice were tolerant to envelope, as reflected by the failure to detect an envelope-specific response after in vivo priming and in vitro stimulation with preparations of FMuLV envelope. However, adoptively transferred envelope-specific T cells from immunized non-TG B6 mice mediated complete eradication of FBL tumor cells in TG mice, and did not induce detectable autoimmune damage to TG lymphoid tissues. The transferred immune cells were not permanently inactivated in the TG mice, since donor T cells responded to envelope after removal from the TG mice. The lack of autoimmune injury did not reflect inadequate expression of envelope by TG lymphocytes for recognition by T cells, since TG lymphocytes functioned effectively in vitro as stimulators for envelope-specific T cells. The results suggest that this and analogous strains of TG mice may prove useful for elucidating principles for the generation and therapeutic use of tumor-reactive T cells specific for tumor-associated antigens.","['Hu, J', 'Kindsvogel, W', 'Busby, S', 'Bailey, M C', 'Shi, Y Y', 'Greenberg, P D']","['Hu J', 'Kindsvogel W', 'Busby S', 'Bailey MC', 'Shi YY', 'Greenberg PD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.']",['eng'],['CA-33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/biosynthesis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*immunology', 'Genes, env', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*therapy', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.177.6.1681 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Jun 1;177(6):1681-90. doi: 10.1084/jem.177.6.1681.,,,PMC2191055,,,,,,,,['env'],,,,,,

Few species of pathogens survive and multiply in these vesicles. However, one strategy for microbial survival would be to induce a higher pH within these organelles, thus interfering with the activity of many lysosomal enzymes. Altering the intravesicular milieu might also profoundly influence antigen processing, antimicrobial drug delivery, and drug activity. Here we report the first example of an organism proliferating within phagolysosomes that maintain a relatively neutral pH for a sustained period of time. We inoculated P388D1 macrophages with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Histoplasma capsulatum or zymosan. Using the ratio of fluorescence excitations at 495 and 450 nm, we determined that vesicles containing either virulent or avirulent FITC-labeled H. capsulatum yeasts had a pH one to two units higher than vesicles containing either zymosan or methanol-killed H. capsulatum. The difference in pH remained stable for at least 5.5 h postinoculation. Longer-term studies using cells preincubated with acridine orange indicated that phagolysosomes containing live Histoplasma continued to maintain a relatively neutral pH for at least 30 h. Many agents raise the pH of multiple vesicles within the same cell. In contrast, H. capsulatum affects only the phagolysosome in which it is located; during coinoculation of cells with unlabeled Histoplasma and labeled zymosan, organelles containing zymosan still acidified normally. Similarly, unlabeled zymosan had no influence on the elevated pH of vesicles housing labeled Histoplasma. Thus, zymosan and Histoplasma were segregated into separate phagolysosomes that responded independently to their phagocytized contents. This localized effect might reflect an intrinsic difference between phagosomes housing the two particle types, active buffering by the microbe, or altered ion transport across the phagolysosomal membrane such that acidification is inhibited.","['Eissenberg, L G', 'Goldman, W E', 'Schlesinger, P H']","['Eissenberg LG', 'Goldman WE', 'Schlesinger PH']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']",['eng'],['AI-25584/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,['I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Histoplasma/*physiology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Phagosomes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.177.6.1605 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Jun 1;177(6):1605-11. doi: 10.1084/jem.177.6.1605.,,,PMC2191039,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to normal controls, mean serum levels of sIL-2R and beta-2M were significantly increased in both NHL and CLL (p < 0.001) while the increase in ESR and CRP was less marked (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Comparison of these tumor markers with histologic grading showed statistically significant differences only for CRP between low, intermediate and high-grade lymphomas (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05). More advanced stages exhibited higher mean values of all serum markers than early stages (p < 0.001 for sIL-2R, beta-2M and ESR and p < 0.05 for CRP). An association with the presence of b-symptoms was observed only for sIL-2R (p < 0.05). In addition, sIL-2R as well as beta-2M were able to predict time to progression in patients with diffuse large-cell lymphomas. We conclude that of the four tumor markers tested sIL-2R and beta-2M more frequently showed increased serum levels and were associated with clinical stage and/or presence of b-symptoms. Both sIL-2R and beta-2M were also found to have prognostic significance for survival.","['Pavlidis, A N', 'Kalef-Ezra, J', 'Bourantas, L C', 'Lambrou, A', 'Mavridis, A']","['Pavlidis AN', 'Kalef-Ezra J', 'Bourantas LC', 'Lambrou A', 'Mavridis A']","['Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Ioannina, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Biol Markers,The International journal of biological markers,8712411,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', '*Blood Sedimentation', 'C-Reactive Protein/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis', 'Survival Analysis', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*analysis']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Biol Markers. 1993 Jan-Mar;8(1):14-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inocula of FBL-3N, but not the parental FBL-3 tumor, regressed after initial growth in CD8-depleted, syngeneic B6 mice. The cellular mechanisms by which FBL-3N was rejected in these mice were investigated in this study. We demonstrated that CTL with both CD4+ and CD4-CD8-TCR-alpha beta phenotypes were generated in mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture spleen cells obtained from CD8-depleted B6 mice that had rejected FBL-3N by in vitro stimulation with mitomycin C-treated FBL-3N. After adoptive transfer of these CTL that were generated in vitro into athymic B6 mice, challenge with the FBL-3N tumor resulted in tumor regression after its initial growth. Thus, CD4+ and CD4-CD8-TCR-alpha beta CTL mediated rejection of the FBL-3N tumor in CD8-depleted B6 mice. Furthermore, the findings that depletion of B6 mice of CD4+ cells in addition to CD8+ cells abrogated the rejection of FBL-3N and generation of CTL in mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture spleen cells suggest that CD4+ cells were required not only as a source of CD4+ CTL, but also as helper cells for generation of CD4-CD8-TCR-alpha beta CTL. Tumor Ag recognition of CD4-CD8-TCR-alpha beta CTL was restricted to Db, like that of classical CD8+ CTL, but the restriction appeared to be less obligatory than that of CD8+ CTL.","['Yoshimura, A', 'Shiku, H', 'Nakayama, E']","['Yoshimura A', 'Shiku H', 'Nakayama E']","['Department of Periodontology, Nagasaki University School of Dentistry, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'CD4 Antigens/*analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/*analysis/physiology', 'Clone Cells/chemistry', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Genetic Variation/immunology', '*Graft Rejection', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Jun 1;150(11):4900-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Simple surgical excision without manipulation of the lesion was performed. RESULTS: The lesion was surgically excised without recurrence. CONCLUSION: Solitary mastocytoma is a rare lesion in adulthood. The differential diagnosis includes a melanocytic nevus, xanthogranuloma and leukemia cutis. Surgical excision offers a rapid, relatively simple and effective mode of treatment.","['Ashinoff, R', 'Soter, N A', 'Freedberg, I M']","['Ashinoff R', 'Soter NA', 'Freedberg IM']","['Ronald O.

Cellular levels of HMG 14 and HMG 17 mRNA were assayed in primary cultures of calvarial-derived rat osteoblasts under conditions that: (1) support complete expression of the mature osteocytic phenotype and development of a bone tissue-like organization; and (2) where development of osteocytic phenotypic properties are both delayed and reduced in extent of expression. HMG 14 and HMG 17 are preferentially expressed in proliferating osteoblasts and decline to basal levels post-proliferatively at the onset of extracellular matrix mineralization. In contrast, under conditions that are not conducive to extracellular matrix mineralization, HMG 14 is maximally expressed following the downregulation of proliferation. Consistent with previous reports by Bustin and co-workers [Crippa et al., 1990], HMG 14 and HMG 17 are expressed in proliferating HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and downregulated post-proliferatively following phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation.

This cDNA corresponds to a gene constitutively expressed in most human cells which is induced to higher levels upon serum stimulation in untransformed and ras-transformed HBL100 cells. However, the abundance of the pag transcript is approximately 3-fold higher in transformed as compared to untransformed cells after 7-15 h of serum stimulation. In the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 induced to differentiate the level of pag mRNA starts to decrease between 48 and 72 h following induction. During this period, which represents the commitment phase of differentiation, HL60 cells cease to proliferate. Therefore, in HBL100 and HL60 cells, higher levels of pag gene expression are correlated with cell proliferation. The pag cDNA codes for a 22-kDa protein, devoid of known consensus motifs, and shares 66% homology with a murine gene product (MER5) that is preferentially expressed in erythroleukemia cells during the early period of cell differentiation. In addition, the pag gene product shares approximately 50% identity with a 29-kDa surface antigen of Entamoeba histolytica and a 26-kDa antigen of Helicobacter pylori. Distant relationship was also found with other prokaryotic proteins. The pag cDNA hybridizes to multiple sequences within human and other mammalian genomes and to fewer sequences in chicken and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although a true relationship between eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes is difficult to establish, the conservation of pag gene sequences throughout Eukaryotae rather suggests that the pag locus belongs to a new class of genes encoding highly conserved proteins.","['Prosperi, M T', 'Ferbus, D', 'Karczinski, I', 'Goubin, G']","['Prosperi MT', 'Ferbus D', 'Karczinski I', 'Goubin G']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncogenese, Institut Curie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Protozoan Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bacterial Proteins/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Epithelium', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Library', 'Genes, ras', '*Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Peroxidases', 'Peroxiredoxins', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Protozoan Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/25 00:00,1993/05/25 00:01,['1993/05/25 00:00'],"['1993/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)82090-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 May 25;268(15):11050-6.,['GENBANK/X67951'],,,,,,,,,,"['pag', 'ras']",,,,,,

Treatment of the cells with 0.5-4 microM A23187 or 1-4 microM ionomycin induced a concentration-dependent decrease in c-myb mRNA; this decrease was abolished by EGTA. c-myc mRNA levels were only moderately affected. After 12-24 h of calcium ionophore exposure, c-myb mRNA returned to pretreatment levels. No similar decrease in c-myb mRNA was seen with the sodium ionophore monensin (up to 16 microM). The dimethyl sulfoxide-induced suppression of c-myb and also of c-myc mRNA levels was not prevented in Ca(2+)-free medium and thus appeared Ca(2+)-independent. A23187 and ionomycin were capable of inducing beta-globin mRNA synthesis in F4-6 cells. Prolonged calcium ionophore exposure, however, strongly reduced cell viability and resulted only in a slight hemoglobin increase at lower concentrations. These results suggest that a rise in [Ca2+]i may be a signal leading to a transient decrease in c-myb mRNA and the initiation of erythroid differentiation in Friend cells.

METHOD: The sample consisted of 61 mother-child dyads. Twenty-one (34%) mothers met DSM-III-R criteria for at least one psychiatric disorder based on a Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID). RESULTS: Findings revealed that compared with children whose mothers did not meet DSM-III-R criteria for a psychiatric disorder, children with mothers who evidenced a psychiatric disorder self-reported more anxiety and a maladaptive attributional style and were reported by their mothers as evidencing more depression and a range of internalizing behavioral symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Although our earlier research suggested that ALL children show relatively few symptoms of psychopathology, the present report reveals high rates of psychiatric difficulties in the mothers of ALL youth. These findings and their implications are discussed within a model that incorporates behavioral pediatrics and developmental psychopathology.","['Brown, R T', 'Kaslow, N J', 'Madan-Swain, A', 'Doepke, K J', 'Sexson, S B', 'Hill, L J']","['Brown RT', 'Kaslow NJ', 'Madan-Swain A', 'Doepke KJ', 'Sexson SB', 'Hill LJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30335.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,8704565,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/etiology', '*Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*psychology', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0890-8567(09)65264-3 [pii]', '10.1097/00004583-199305000-00010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 1993 May;32(3):554-61. doi: 10.1097/00004583-199305000-00010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Encouraging results are also reported in children with high risk ALL receiving intensive chemotherapy. Results in adults with ALL are less satisfactory, the long term survival is less than 35 per cent. Further dose intensification as possible in the setting of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has increased the cure rate to 50 per cent in adult ALL. Allogeneic BMT has, however, besides the enhanced antileukaemia activity related to high dose therapy, additional antileukaemia effect related to immune mechanisms. Immune effects may be separated into three elements viz., an antileukaemia effect of graft vs host disease (GvHD), a separate antileukaemia effect of T cells and possibly a specific graft vs leukemia effect (GvL). These immune mediated antileukaemic effects offer a new potential therapeutic modality. For instance, the T cell antileukaemic effect of transplant could be achieved by transfusing radiated T cells or administering lymphokines. Alternatively autologous bone marrow could be manipulated in vitro prior to reinfusion. Manipulation might include activation of natural killer (NK) cells or lymphokine activated killer (LAK) activity. Another newer approach to treat ALL is the use of hemopoietic growth factors. Use of these factors prior to chemotherapy may increase the proportion of proliferating leukaemic stem cells. This would increase the efficacy of many drugs since most are active against proliferating cells. Hemopoietic regulatory factors could also be used to directly inhibit leukemic cell growth or to promote differentiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kochupillai, V']",['Kochupillai V'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 1993 Feb;98:1-7.,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Circumstantial evidence indicates that neutrophils in addition modulate the inflammatory process. Production of neutrophils takes place in the bone marrow, and mature cells egress to the circulation. Neutrophils emigrate following activation from the vessels into the tissues (chemotaxis). During this process neutrophils generate reactive oxygen species (respiratory burst) and mobilize intracellular compartments (degranulation). By degranulation, neutrophils exercise influence on nearby cells or bacteria by extracellular release of intragranular proteins (exocytosis), and intensify plasma membrane-related processes, such as chemotaxis and respiratory burst, by translocation of membrane-bound proteins to the surface (upregulation). Ultimately, microorganisms may be killed intracellularly following engulfment (phagocytosis). The thesis presents results of protein-chemical analysis of human neutrophils, based on studies of intact cells and subcellular structures (subcellular fractionation). By fractionation, azurophil granules and specific granules can be disunited from each other and from plasma membrane and secretory vesicles. Only partial separation of plasma membrane and secretory vesicles can be obtained. Subcellular structures are identified by markers, e.g. vitamin B12 binding protein for specific granules, and latent alkaline phosphatase for secretory vesicles. The studies demonstrated tetranectin in neutrophils, localized exclusively in the secretory vesicles. Tetranectin was released by incubation of neutrophils in the presence of weak, inflammatory stimuli and paralleled the upregulation of alkaline phosphatase, but preceded degranulation of specific granules. Alkaline phosphatase has previously been employed as a plasma membrane marker. A novel ELISA for HLA class I antigen was introduced as a new plasma membrane marker. Results obtained by this assay showed upregulation of alkaline phosphatase occurring without a concurrent redistribution of HLA antigen. This indicates that the two proteins are localized in separate compartments. Upregulation of alkaline phosphatase induced by weak stimuli, however, paralleled the translocation of cytochrome b559, anticipated to be the terminal component in the respiratory burst, and known to be localized primarily in the specific granules. The present studies indicate that 15% of cytochrome b is localized in the secretory vesicles. An ELISA was established for quantitation of beta 2-microglobulin, the light chain of HLA class I antigens. The concentration of beta 2-microglobulin in plasma from patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia was found to correlate with the concentration of vitamin B12 binding protein.4+ Measurements in neutrophils demonstrated 65% of the total content of beta 2-microglobulin to be localized in the specific granules, and 20% to be present in secretory vesicles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Bjerrum, O W']",['Bjerrum OW'],"['Department of Internal Medicine and Haematology C, Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Denmark,Dan Med Bull,Danish medical bulletin,0066040,"['0 (Cytochrome b Group)', '0 (Photosystem II Protein Complex)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '9044-61-5 (cytochrome b559)']",IM,"['Cytochrome b Group/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/*physiology', '*Photosystem II Protein Complex', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*physiology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dan Med Bull. 1993 Apr;40(2):163-89.,,274,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All 4 cell lines producing IL-1 alpha also produced other inflammatory cytokines, namely, IL-6, TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, but they did not produce IL-2. The IL-1 alpha-producing cell lines had the phenotype of mature, activated T cells, regardless of leukemia or transformant origin (TdT-, CD4+, CD8-, IL-2R+, HLA-DR+) and all were HTLV-1+. However, the production of other cytokines followed a random distribution, and no relationship emerged between cytokine production patterns and alpha/beta or gamma/delta type of T cell receptor (TcR) expression, immunophenotypic marker profiles, or the clinical origin of the cells. These results thus show that human leukemia and HTLV-I-transformed T cell lines can produce a large number of biologically active cytokines and that, except for the association of inflammatory cytokine production with mature activated cells, random patterns of cytokine production reflect the individuality of leukemia cell lines.","['Dao, T', 'Holan, V', 'Minowada, J']","['Dao T', 'Holan V', 'Minowada J']","['Fujisaki Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1993 Apr;57(2):139-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idarubicin was superior to daunorubicin in terms of intracellular accumulation and binding capacity to DNA, which may result in idarubicin having much stronger activity in inducing DNA strand breaks than daunorubicin.

We found that vectors with the GALV Env glycoproteins are up to 10-fold more efficient at transducing genes into primary monkey airway epithelial cells than vectors with the amphotropic Env glycoproteins. Under optimal conditions, up to about 80% of primary monkey airway epithelial cells could be transduced with the vector containing the GALV Env glycoproteins.

A large heterogeneity with respect to cell kill was observed for all combinations tested, the interactions ranging from antagonistic to synergistic in terms of the multiplicative concept for drug interactions. However, an 'additive' model provided a significantly better fit of the data compared to the effect of the most active single agent of the combination (Dmax) for several common antileukaemic drug combinations. When the two interaction models were related to treatment outcome 38% of the non-responders showed preference for the additive model whereas the corresponding figure for responders was 80%. Overall, in 248 of 290 (85%) tests performed with drug combinations, there was an agreement between the effect of the combination and that of the most active single component. Direct comparison of Dmax and the combination for correlation with clinical outcome demonstrated only minor differences in the ability to predict drug resistance. The results show that FMCA appear to report drug interactions in samples from patients with AML in accordance with clinical experience. Furthermore, testing single agents as a substitute for drug combinations may be adequate for detection of clinical drug resistance to combination therapy in AML.","['Larsson, R', 'Fridborg, H', 'Kristensen, J', 'Sundstrom, C', 'Nygren, P']","['Larsson R', 'Fridborg H', 'Kristensen J', 'Sundstrom C', 'Nygren P']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1993.178 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1993 May;67(5):969-74. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1993.178.,,,PMC1968433,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present investigation the differences in the behaviour of leukaemia in immature and mature rat testis and the interactions of testicular and leukaemic cells were studied. Intraperitoneal injection of rat T-leukaemic cells to sexually immature animals induced testicular infiltrations in 100% of animals in 17 days. The infiltrations were small and located perivascularly in the interstitial tissue. Intraperitoneal injection of T-leukaemic cells to sexually mature animals induced testicular infiltrates in 42% of the animals. Leukaemic cells injected directly to the lymph sinusoids of sexually immature and mature testis proliferated rapidly causing testicular enlargement. The M(r) > 5 K fraction of extracts of 50 days old normal rat testes inhibited 3H-TdR incorporation of both normal and leukaemic ConA-stimulated rat lymphoblasts significantly. The same fraction of extracts of testes of 25 days old rats did not have any effect on 3H-TdR incorporation. The normally occurring pubertal increase in the lymphocyte inhibitory effect of the M(r) > 5 K fraction of testis extracts on 3H-TdR incorporation of PBL was prevented following either intraperitoneal or intratesticular injection of rat leukaemic lymphoblasts administered at the age of 25 days. The present observations suggest that physiological pubertal changes in the permeability of vascular endothelium and immunosuppressive effect of the testis may be important explanatory factors for the smaller number of testicular relapses in men compared to boys seen after treatment of ALL.","['Jahnukainen, K', 'Morris, I', 'Roe, S', 'Salmi, T T', 'Makipernaa, A', 'Pollanen, P']","['Jahnukainen K', 'Morris I', 'Roe S', 'Salmi TT', 'Makipernaa A', 'Pollanen P']","['Department of Anatomy, University of Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sexual Maturation', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*secondary', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1993.166 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1993 May;67(5):885-92. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1993.166.,,,PMC1968455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The binding of the hybrid molecule, named 'Distel', to a range of natural DNAs and synthetic polynucleotides with different base pair arrangements was studied by electric linear dichroism. The interaction with DNA simultaneously implicates binding of the distamycin part in the minor groove and intercalation of the ellipticine chromophore. The drug binds to DNA without any apparent preference for AT or GC polynucleotides, and can accommodate both homopolymeric and co-polymeric sequences as a binding site. However, the geometry of the drug-DNA complex varies depending on the targeted sequence. The lower activity of the hybrid as compared to the ellipticine derivative cannot be explained in terms of DNA binding. Taking advantage of the fluorescence of the pyridocarbazole chromophore, fluorescence microscopy was used to map cellular uptake of the hybrid molecule compared to the ellipticine derivative. Both the conjugate and the ellipticine derivative preferentially accumulate in the nuclei of HeLa cells rather than in the cytoplasm. Nuclei of ellipticine derivative-treated cells appear markedly more fluorescent than those of cells treated with the hybrid, which seems to be preferentially located in the nucleoli. Therefore, we consider the possibility that the difference in cytotoxicity between the two ellipticine-containing drugs is due to different intranuclear concentrations of these two compounds.","['Bailly, C', 'Leclere, V', 'Pommery, N', 'Colson, P', 'Houssier, C', 'Rivalle, C', 'Bisagni, E', 'Henichart, J P']","['Bailly C', 'Leclere V', 'Pommery N', 'Colson P', 'Houssier C', 'Rivalle C', 'Bisagni E', 'Henichart JP']","['INSERM Unite 124, Institut de Recherches sur le Cancer, Lille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Distamycins)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '144236-70-4 (Distel)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clostridium perfringens/genetics', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Distamycins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ellipticines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Micrococcus/genetics', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1993 Apr;8(2):145-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six patients were older than 57 years (2 in their 70s) at the onset of their symptoms. The demyelinating nature of the lesions was established through biopsy in each patient and all improved significantly after corticosteroid therapy. Three patients developed additional lesions during the follow-up periods ranging from 9 months to 12 years consistent with the course of multiple sclerosis. Twenty-eight patients did not develop additional lesions. These included 6 patients with multiple lesions at the onset. In 1 of the patients, the first symptoms developed 10 days after receiving vaccination against influenza. Two patients had concomitant malignancy (chronic monomyelogenous leukemia and retroperitoneal seminoma respectively) and 1 patient developed immunoblastic sarcoma in the opposite hemisphere after biopsy diagnosis and steroid treatment of her demyelinating lesion. Tumor-like masses of demyelination may occupy an intermediate position between multiple sclerosis and postinfectious/postvaccination encephalitis.

Composite immunophenotypic analysis is essential for classifying leukemias once the disease is detected by traditional means. In contrast, in the detection of lymphoproliferative diseases, the composite immunophenotype is itself diagnostic of the disease process. Characterization of size, as measured by light scatter and by DNA ploidy and cell cycle analysis, contributes to the further subdivision of lymphoproliferative disorders. Specifically, small, monoclonal cells that are diploid with a synthetic fraction of 5% are characteristic of low-grade lymphomas. Admixtures of large and small cells wherein the large cells are monoclonal and the small cells are either monoclonal or heterogeneous may be seen in intermediate lymphomas. In this category, DNA ploidy is variable and the total synthetic fraction is usually between 5% and 15%. High-grade lymphomas, with the exception of the immunoblastic category, are usually of intermediate size, are diploid or near-diploid, and exhibit synthetic fractions greater than 15%. Interestingly, few reactive T cells are seen. Ongoing efforts to standardize procedures will eventually result in more widespread applicability together with improved understanding of the attributes and limitations of this technology. The most important consideration, however, is that the technology is useless in the absence of a working knowledge of the biology of the diseases to be characterized. Conversely, the complexity of flow cytometry is sufficient to warrant rigorous training of laboratory professionals in this field.","['Duque, R E']",['Duque RE'],"['Department of Pathology, Norwood Clinic/Carraway Methodist Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama 35234.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/blood', 'Cell Cycle', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia/*blood/classification/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*blood/classification/genetics/*pathology']",1993/03/20 00:00,1993/03/20 00:01,['1993/03/20 00:00'],"['1993/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1993.tb38786.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1993 Mar 20;677:309-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1993.tb38786.x.,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study included measurements of the pretherapy proliferative rate of the leukemia cells in vivo, assessment of differentiation in vivo during remission induction therapy, and the level of expression of the fms, myc, and IL1 beta genes in pretherapy leukemia cells. Short cell cycle times were characteristic of the best prognostic category and were associated with a rapid reduction in marrow leukemia cells in cytosine arabinoside (araC)-sensitive patients. Expression of c-fms was associated with rapid reduction in marrow leukemia cells during araC therapy and with a successful treatment outcome. Expression of the IL1 beta gene was associated with short remissions. These studies suggest that when compared to newly diagnosed standard prognosis AML, the leukemia of poor prognosis patients is more likely to exhibit long cell cycle times, low levels of fms expression, and is less likely to be associated with myeloid differentiation during remission induction therapy.","['Raza, A', 'Preisler, H D', 'Li, Y Q', 'Larson, R A', 'Goldberg, J', 'Browman, G', 'Bennett, J', 'Grunwald, H', 'Vogler, R', 'Kukla, C']","['Raza A', 'Preisler HD', 'Li YQ', 'Larson RA', 'Goldberg J', 'Browman G', 'Bennett J', 'Grunwald H', 'Vogler R', 'Kukla C']","['University of Cincinnati Medical Center, College of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology Division, OH 45267-0508.']",['eng'],['CA41285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830420406 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1993 Apr;42(4):359-66. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830420406.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were noted in first degree relatives, mostly in men. In some instances, when the HLA type was performed, a specific HLA type was found in the studied family, but a different haplotype was seen in other families. It appeared that familial cases of hairy cell leukemia were not associated with a ""specific HLA antigen"" and other factor(s) such as environmental, or some kind of occupational exposure, were suggested to play a role in the familial occurrence of hairy cell leukemia. We add three more familial hairy cell leukemia cases which are different from other published cases, showing a female predominance. The HLA typing revealed interesting findings. The HLA type shared by case 1 and 3 was A2, A30/31(19), B27, Bw4, Bw6. From these, HLA A2, Bw4, and Bw6 were previously reported (Ward FT, Baker J, Krishnan J, Dow N, Kjobech CH: Cancer 65:319-321, 1990). Case 2, shared with the other two the antigen Bw6. Its specific HLA type was A3 and B7, the type previously reported in a family (Begley CG, Tait B, Crapper RM, Briggs RG, Brodie GN, Mackay IR: Leuk Res 11:1027-1028, 1987).

The relatively inexpensive microcomputer-based system was assembled in our laboratory with commercially available hardware and software. One hundred twenty-two effusions (86 benign lymphocytoses, 26 lymphomas, and 10 chronic lymphocytic leukemias) were studied. Lymphoid cells were selected randomly by the system from real-time images of Papanicolaou-fixed and stained cytospin smears of pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial effusions. Parameters of nuclear shape, area, and optical density were measured automatically. Multiparameter statistical procedures of discriminant classificatory analysis analyzed the distribution of lymphoid nuclear profile integrated optical density to yield three groups of effusions, each with a predictive value of diagnosis of 100%. Neither these statistical procedures nor a simple rule-based expert system accurately classified chronic lymphocytic leukemia effusions based on the distribution of lymphoid nuclear profile area. When chronic lymphocytic leukemia effusions were excluded, however, the predictive values of a diagnosis of lymphoma by statistical analysis and by rule-based expert system were 92.3% and 88.9%, respectively, whereas the predictive values of a diagnosis of benign lymphocytosis were 97.7% and 91.3%, respectively.

At present more than 95% of children with ALL will achieve a complete remission (CR), and +/- 70% will remain in CR. Nevertheless, 20-30% of the patients suffer a relapse, which implies a less favorable prognosis. However, after intensive treatment a part of these patients will have a prolonged second complete remission: 30-50% of children with a late relapse and 0-20% of children with an early relapse. It is important to prevent the occurrence of a relapse. The identification at diagnosis of patients at high risk for a relapse, and a subsequent more specific and more intensive treatment of these patients might contribute to that goal. Well-known risk factors are briefly mentioned, factors of which the prognostic significances is therapy-dependent. In addition, the treatment of relapsed ALL needs further improvement.

Four patients with a history of well-differentiated, small cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with either acute or chronic dacryocystitis and epiphora due to lymphomatous infiltration of the lacrimal sac. METHODS: All four patients underwent dacryocystorhinostomy with lacrimal sac biopsy. All tissues underwent complete histopathologic evaluation including immunohistochemical studies for cell surface markers and, in addition, were compared with previous biopsies performed for the initial diagnosis of lymphoma. FINDINGS: All biopsies demonstrated small cell well-differentiated lymphoma on histologic and immunofluorescent examination. No patient demonstrated orbital involvement on computed tomography. One patient had previously diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia and one patient demonstrated diffuse lymph node involvement on postoperative systemic evaluation. All four patients underwent additional chemotherapy. No recurrence of dacryocystitis or epiphora occurred. CONCLUSION: Four patients presented with dacryocystitis secondary to lacrimal sac lymphoma. Lymphomatous lacrimal sac infiltration is an unusual cause of dacryocystitis. Biopsy of the lacrimal sac plays a diagnostically important role in dacryocystorhinostomy even in the absence of obvious tumorous involvement of the lacrimal sac mucosa.","['Karesh, J W', 'Perman, K I', 'Rodrigues, M M']","['Karesh JW', 'Perman KI', 'Rodrigues MM']","['Krieger Eye Institute, Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, MD 21215.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dacryocystitis/diagnosis/*etiology/surgery', 'Dacryocystorhinostomy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lacrimal Apparatus Diseases/*complications/diagnosis/surgery', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/diagnosis/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-6420(93)31590-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-6420(93)31590-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 1993 May;100(5):669-73. doi: 10.1016/s0161-6420(93)31590-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common cause of metastatic heart disease is bronchial carcinoma followed by carcinoma of the breast, pleural mesothelioma, malignant melanoma, leukemia and lymphoma, in decreasing order of frequency. However metastatic cancer to the heart is not commonly diagnosed prior to death. Atrial extension has been reported as a common route of local spread in patients with bronchial carcinoma, but cardiac conduction system invasion is infrequent. The purpose of this report is to describe an unusual case of pulmonary adenocarcinoma that presented with cardiac manifestations mimicking atrioventricular (AV) block. This AV block was corrected by pacemaker. Chest radiography and bidimensional echocardiography didn't visualize important lesions. The cardiac findings at autopsy were remarkable not only for the severity of epicardial, myocardial and endocardial involvement, but for the metastatic implants into the His bundle and for the elective and wide infiltration of bifurcating His bundle. On addition histological examination revealed neoplastic emboli in the myocardial lymphatics. No valvular involvement was noted. Technical annotation: histological examination of the conduction system of the heart has been carried out on serial sections with the technique devised by one of the present authors.

This paper reviews the work that has been performed in these models with different types of cancer, and highlights those papers that have presented dosimetry estimates and attempts to correlate the findings. Radioimmunotherapy studies in multicell spheroids, as a model for micrometastases, have been performed in human neuroblastoma, colon cancer, and melanoma cell lines using 131I-, 125I-, 186Re-, and 212Bi-labeled antibodies. The uniform geometry of the spheroid has allowed radiation dose estimates to be made. Up to three logs of cell kill have been achieved with 131I- and 186Re-specific antibody with minimal toxicity from labeled nonspecific antibody, but 212Bi-antibody had little effect because of its short half-life as shown by Langmuir. It appears that the two most important factors for therapeutic efficacy in this model are good penetration of the radiolabeled antibody and an adequate radionuclide half-life to allow penetration of the immunoconjugate prior to significant radionuclide decay. Radioimmunotherapy studies in animals bearing transplants of colon cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, hepatoma, renal cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma, glioma, mammary carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and bladder cancer have been performed with 131I, 90Y, 186Re, 153Sm, and 177Lu beta emitting, and 212Bi alpha emitting radionuclides conjugated to monoclonal antibodies. A few studies compared different radionuclides in the same model system. The approaches that have been used in these studies to estimate tumor dosimetry include the MIRD approach, thermoluminescent dosimetry, autoradiography, and comparison to external irradiation. The majority of investigators have estimated the dose to tumor and normal organs using MIRD-based calculations (time-activity curve and equilibrium dose constant method). The range of tumor doses has been between 17 and 11 171 mGy/MBq of administered radioactivity. The effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy depends on a number of factors relating to the antibody such as specificity, affinity, and immunoreactivity. The density, location, and heterogeneity of expression of tumor-associated antigen within tumors will affect the localization and therapeutic efficacy of radiolabeled antibodies, as will physiological factors such as the tumor vascularity, blood flow, and permeability. These factors are discussed and examples are presented.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Buchsbaum, D J', 'Langmuir, V K', 'Wessels, B W']","['Buchsbaum DJ', 'Langmuir VK', 'Wessels BW']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Alabama, Birmigham 35233.']",['eng'],['CA44173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Med Phys,Medical physics,0425746,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Radiometry/*methods', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Rats', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1118/1.597142 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Phys. 1993 Mar-Apr;20(2 Pt 2):551-67. doi: 10.1118/1.597142.,,127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basal bloods were taken for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and serum oestradiol estimations. Serum progesterone concentration was measured in those patients who were in the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle at assessment. In addition, menstrual cycle profiles of salivary progesterone concentrations were derived from daily samples in 12 patients. All patients achieved adult sexual development; median age at menarche was early at 12.4 (9.0-14.6) years and 37 of them have regular menses. Ten patients have had 14 live births, and evidence of ovulation was seen in a further 11 patients assessed in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Four patients had damaged ovaries, two of whom show evidence of ovulation; three of the four received craniospinal irradiation and one received cyclophosphamide as part of her chemotherapy regimen. None of these patients has yet developed total ovarian failure or required sex steroid replacement therapy. The medium term outlook for ovarian function is good for the majority of childhood ALL survivors. The spinal component of craniospinal irradiation is a major risk factor for ovarian damage, and cyclophosphamide may be a contributory factor. A premature menopause remains a possibility if significant follicular depletion has occurred at the time of cytotoxic treatment.","['Wallace, W H', 'Shalet, S M', 'Tetlow, L J', 'Morris-Jones, P H']","['Wallace WH', 'Shalet SM', 'Tetlow LJ', 'Morris-Jones PH']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital, Manchester, England.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Menarche/physiology', 'Menstrual Cycle/blood/physiology', 'Ovary/*physiology/physiopathology', 'Ovulation/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/analysis/blood', 'Saliva/chemistry']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950210505 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1993;21(5):333-9. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950210505.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part of this scientific heritage has been used to the full to plan and carry out prevention measures that have led to improved working conditions in many sectors of industry. Examples are the successes obtained in the prevention of pneumoconioses, aplastic anaemia and leukemia due to benzene, cancer caused by aromatic amines, and diseases occurring in pesticide users and consumers of agricultural products treated with such products. More recently, through original research programmes, with particular reference to the ""Clinica del Lavoro"" of Milan, a theoretical revision was made of the conception and method for analysing the relationship between organised work and health, resulting in an organic arrangement of the variables and procedures for the analysis of working conditions for the purposes of prevention. Other ways and areas where scientific bio-medical knowledge can be used are: a) planning of prevention measures on a vast social scale; b) variables and indicators for planning and assessing services designed for diagnosis and prevention of occupational risks and diseases; c) development of training programmes. In spite of these positive results, European Community statistics show that still too many occupational accidents and work-related diseases occur all over the world, especially in the developing countries, because the amount of scientific knowledge used is still much smaller than what is already available. The causes of this situation are many, among which those of a cultural nature.

Regimen A was given to 106 patients and 82 patients received regimen B. The complete remission induction rate for regimen A and B was 89.4% (93/104) and 98.7% (78/79), respectively. The 3-year event-free-survival (EFS) rate was 70.6% for regimen A, which was higher than the 56.7% for regimen B. The 3-year EFS rate was 44.4% for the 53 patients with an initial leukocyte count > or = 10 x 10(4)/microliters and 72.2% for 132 patients with a leukocyte count < 10 x 10(4)/microliter. We considered that Ara-C plus L-asp, added to the conventional high-risk ALL 811 protocol, improved the prognosis of the high risk ALL patients. However, further intensive chemotherapy was required for improvement of the outcome of the patients with hyperleukocytosis (> or = 10 x 10(4)/microliters).","['Kawai, S', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Zha, Z', 'Asami, K', 'Oka, T', 'Kaneko, Y', 'Takaue, Y', 'Ninomiya, T', 'Nishikawa, K', 'Tsuchiya, T']","['Kawai S', 'Fujimoto T', 'Zha Z', 'Asami K', 'Oka T', 'Kaneko Y', 'Takaue Y', 'Ninomiya T', 'Nishikawa K', 'Tsuchiya T', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University.']",['jpn'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1993 Feb;34(2):128-36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ML-1 cells proliferate in tissue culture as immature myeloblasts and can be induced to differentiate to nonproliferative monocyte/macrophages. In the myeloblastic cells, activation of the K+ current occurs upon depolarization of the membrane potential to above -40 mV; inactivation of this current is also voltage dependent and follows a simple exponential time course with a time constant (Ti) of 900 msec at 0 mV. The current is inhibited by 4-aminopyridine (IC50 of 80 microM at 0 mV), but is much less sensitive to tetraethylammonium of Ba2+. In cells exposed to the differentiation-inducer 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), dramatic alterations in the K+ current occur: upon exposure to 10 nM TPA during whole-cell recording, the amplitude of the voltage-activated current initially increases (within 4 min) and later decreases (at approximately 30-50 min). Upon addition of 0.5 nM TPA to cells in tissue culture, the current shows suppressed activation and accelerated inactivation in the early stages of differentiation (10-fold decrease in Ti at approximately 7 hr) and is completely suppressed in the later stages (3 days). Thus, this voltage-gated K+ current is suppressed early in the induction of differentiation and associated loss of proliferation in myeloid ML-1 cells exposed to TPA; this parallels the fact that channels of a similar type are activated upon the stimulation of proliferation in lymphoid cells exposed to mitogens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lu, L', 'Yang, T', 'Markakis, D', 'Guggino, W B', 'Craig, R W']","['Lu L', 'Yang T', 'Markakis D', 'Guggino WB', 'Craig RW']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Wright State University, School of Medicine, Dayton, Ohio 45435.']",['eng'],"['CA54385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK32753/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM46834/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Tetraethylammonium Compounds)', 'BH3B64OKL9 (4-Aminopyridine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['4-Aminopyridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Ion Channel Gating/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/*physiology', 'Potassium Channels/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tetraethylammonium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00235743 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1993 Mar;132(3):267-74. doi: 10.1007/BF00235743.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genome types of B19 from the fetuses and leukemia patients were similar to the types from patients with aplastic crisis and an asymptomatic individual. Wide diversity of the nucleotide sequence, i.e., six or more (6-11) substitutions, were evident in ten M13 phage clones of each DNA source from fetal materials, while substitutions in sera from patients with leukemia and aplastic crisis and of an asymptomatic individual numbered four or fewer (0-4).

Estimates of the excess relative risk per 10 mSv were negative for both disease categories, but these estimates are consistent both with no risk and with estimates obtained through extrapolation from high-dose data. For all cancer except leukemia, the upper limit for a two-sided 90% confidence interval was about 1.5 times the prediction of the BEIR V model, but several times the estimate recommended by the ICRP 60 committee. For leukemia, the comparable upper limit was very close to that predicted by either BEIR V or ICRP 60. The all-cancer risk estimate, from a recent report on updated analyses of data for Oak Ridge National Laboratory workers, was strongly rejected based on the Hanford data. Of 24 specific cancer categories evaluated, only cancer of the pancreas and Hodgkin's disease showed positive correlations with radiation dose that approached statistical significance with one-tailed p values of 0.07 and 0.04, respectively; these correlations are interpreted as probably spurious. For multiple myeloma, for which a correlation was reported previously, the p value was 0.10. However, a significant correlation (p < .05) was obtained when analyses were expanded to include deaths with multiple myeloma listed on the death certificate but not considered to be the underlying cause, when analyses were expanded to include deaths occurring in Washington State during the time period 1987-1989, or when a 2-y latency period (instead of 10-y) was assumed.","['Gilbert, E S', 'Omohundro, E', 'Buchanan, J A', 'Holter, N A']","['Gilbert ES', 'Omohundro E', 'Buchanan JA', 'Holter NA']","['Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,['0 (Radioactive Pollutants)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', '*Government Agencies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mortality', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Energy', '*Occupational Exposure', '*Radioactive Pollutants', 'Washington/epidemiology']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-199306000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 1993 Jun;64(6):577-90. doi: 10.1097/00004032-199306000-00001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed flow cytometry and Southern blot analysis in 25 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) from the Po River delta region (Northern Italy), in order to correlate surface immunological phenotype and heavy and light chain gene rearrangements with clinical stages. RESULTS: In these 25 CLL cases, as in the larger group of 165, k-positive (k+) patients were more frequent than lambda-positive (lambda +) ones by a ratio of 59:41, with a predominance of lambda + in stage II (46:54) and of K+ in stage IV (77:23). However, the survival behavior of lambda + and k+ patients was not statistically different. Ig gene rearrangements were found in all patients in accordance with the immunophenotype. When Ig gene analysis was performed on two different occasions in 7 of the 8 who received chemotherapy, there was an increase in the percentage of the germline band. This variation was inversely related to changes in WBC count. In the treated subject who showed a reduction of both WBC count and the germline, there was rapid disease progression and short survival. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of Ig gene rearrangements in our CLL patients demonstrated: i) the monoclonality of neoplastic cells; ii) no correlation between rearrangements and clinical stages, and iii) that this analysis may be a useful tool in evaluating biological behavior in selected CLL cases showing a discrepancy between hematological data and clinical response to therapy.","['Gandini, D', 'Lanza, F', 'Latorraca, A', 'Levato, F', 'Del Senno, L', 'Castoldi, G']","['Gandini D', 'Lanza F', 'Latorraca A', 'Levato F', 'Del Senno L', 'Castoldi G']","['Istituto di Chimica Biologica, Universita di Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1993 Jan-Feb;78(1):18-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The putative gene was mapped on mouse chromosome 1, closely linked to Idh-1, but not linked to the Ly-1 (CD5) gene. The cDNA is therefore named Ly-1 antibody reactive clone (LYAR). The putative polypeptide encoded by the cDNA consists of 388 amino acids with a zinc finger motif and three copies of nuclear localization signals. Antibodies raised against a LYAR fusion protein reacted with a protein of 45 kD on Western blots and by immunoprecipitation. Immunolocalization indicated that LYAR was present predominantly in the nucleoli. The LYAR mRNA was not detected in brain, thymus, bone marrow, liver, heart, and muscle. Low levels of LYAR mRNA were detected in kidney and spleen. However, the LYAR gene was expressed at very high levels in immature spermatocytes in testis. The LYAR mRNA is present at high levels in early embryos and preferentially in fetal liver and fetal thymus. A number of B- and T-cell leukemic lines expressed LYAR at high levels, although it was not detectable in bone marrow and thymus. During radiation-induced T-cell leukemogenesis, high levels of LYAR were expressed in preleukemic thymocytes and in acute T leukemia cells. Fibroblast cells overexpressing the LYAR cDNA from a retrovirus vector, though not phenotypically transformed in vitro, had increased ability to form tumors in nu/nu mice. Therefore, LYAR may function as a novel nucleolar oncoprotein to regulate cell growth.","['Su, L', 'Hershberger, R J', 'Weissman, I L']","['Su L', 'Hershberger RJ', 'Weissman IL']","['Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University, California 94305.']",['eng'],['CA42551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lyar protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Testis/embryology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/embryology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics/*physiology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.7.5.735 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1993 May;7(5):735-48. doi: 10.1101/gad.7.5.735.,"['GENBANK/L11593', 'GENBANK/L11594', 'GENBANK/L24529', 'GENBANK/S53920', 'GENBANK/S53921', 'GENBANK/S53922', 'GENBANK/S56763', 'GENBANK/S60885', 'GENBANK/Z15047', 'GENBANK/Z15048']",,,,,,,,,,"['Idh-1', 'ly-1']",,,,,,

During this process, active oxygen species are formed that may damage DNA and other cellular macromolecules. The ability of BT to induce micronuclei (MN) and oxidative DNA damage has been investigated in both human lymphocytes and HL60 cells. An antikinetochore antibody based micronucleus assay was used to distinguish MN containing kinetochores and potentially entire chromosomes (kinetochore-positive, K+) from those containing acentric chromosome fragments (kinetochore-negative, K-). BT increased the frequency of MN formation twofold in lymphocytes and eightfold in HL60 cells with the MN being 62% and 82% K+, respectively. A linear dose-related increase in total MN, mainly in K(+)-MN, was observed in both HL60 cells and lymphocytes. Addition of copper ions (Cu2+) potentiated the effect of BT on MN induction threefold in HL60 cells and altered the pattern of MN formation from predominantly K+ to K-. BT also increased the level of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), a marker of active oxygen-induced DNA damage. Cu2+ again enhanced this effect. Thus, BT has the potential to cause both numerical and structural chromosomal changes in human cells. Further, it may cause point mutations indirectly by generating oxygen radicals. BT may therefore play an important role in benzene-induced leukemia.","['Zhang, L', 'Robertson, M L', 'Kolachana, P', 'Davison, A J', 'Smith, M T']","['Zhang L', 'Robertson ML', 'Kolachana P', 'Davison AJ', 'Smith MT']","['Department of Biomedical and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42-ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '173O8B04RD (hydroxyhydroquinone)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Aneuploidy', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Centromere/drug effects', 'Copper/toxicity', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/drug effects', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Free Radicals', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Micronucleus Tests/methods', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/em.2850210405 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 1993;21(4):339-48. doi: 10.1002/em.2850210405.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integration is blocked when cells are prevented from progressing through mitosis. Viral nucleoprotein complexes isolated from arrested cells contain full-length viral DNA and can integrate this viral DNA in vitro, showing that the block to integration in arrested cells is not due to a lack of mature integration machinery. When infected cells traverse mitosis, there is a sharp increase in nuclear accumulation of viral DNA.

More difficult presentations are seen with premonitory symptoms, paraneoplastic syndromes, and nonspecific lesions. Dermatologic paraneoplastic syndromes are numerous, nonspecific, and consist of hamartomatous growths, texture changes, new hair growth, or changes in skin color. Alteration of skin color may be of practically any color, localized or diffuse, and of sudden or indolent onset. Hormone production by tumors may lead to acne, hirsutism, gynecomastia, or a cushingoid appearance. Pruritus may herald the onset of leukemia or lymphoma and be intolerable, as with erythroderma. All suspicious presentations require thorough investigation for underlying disease. Metastasis to skin is not common and implies a poor prognosis if seen. Most metastases are seen on the head and neck, anterior chest wall, and abdomen. Basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas commonly occur in sun-exposed areas. Basal cell is locally destructive, whereas squamous cell occasionally metastasizes to local lymph nodes. Malignant melanoma is the leading fatal illness originating in skin, with a dramatic rise in incidence. It is classically described as asymmetric with irregular borders, is elevated, and shows color variegation; however, melanoma may present atypically, particularly in non-whites. Kaposi's sarcoma lesions are well-demarcated, symmetric, smooth nodules that appear purplish-brown, particularly if below the knee (owing to venous stasis). The closely interrelated structures of the eye and orbit are easily disturbed, leading to the presenting symptoms of visual disturbances, exophthalmos, pain, and ocular motility disorders. Primary tumors are not unusual and may include retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and melanoma. Equally common are metastatic lesions, most commonly lung and breast carcinoma. An estimation of the malignancy of bony lesions can be made by assessing the zone of transition, periosteal reaction, and bone destruction. A malignant lesion will more likely have a broad zone of transition, irregular periosteal reaction, and moth-eaten or permeative destruction of trabeculae. Metastatic bone lesions primarily occur in sites of persistent red marrow: skull, ribs, vertebrae, pelvis, and proximal humerus and femur. Bony lesions can be blastic or lytic in nature. Solitary pulmonary nodules that have not grown for 2 years can be assumed to be benign. Calcification seen on plain films are a strong (but not absolute) indication of benignancy. Lesions that are greater than 3 to 4 cm in diameter, have irregular contours, are cavitated with thick walls, have multiple peripheral nodules, and have lack of calcification are more likely malignant.","['Blackburn, P']",['Blackburn P'],"['Department of Emergency Medicine, Maricopa Medical Center, Phoenix, Arizona.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Emerg Med Clin North Am,Emergency medicine clinics of North America,8219565,,IM,"['Emergencies', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/pathology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Emerg Med Clin North Am. 1993 May;11(2):273-335.,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterised by metabolic transformation into a 13-dihydro derivative, idarubicinol, which is as active as the parent drug in in vitro models. The pharmacokinetics of idarubicin follow a 2- or 3-compartment plasma disappearance with half-life (t1/2) values of 13 min, 2.4h and 16h, clearance approximately 60 L/h/m2 and volume of distribution at steady-state of 1,500 L/m2. Idarubicinol is characterised by a very long elimination t1/2 of 55h. The ratio of metabolite: parent drug area under the plasma concentration-time curve is often > 2 and is even higher after 2 or 3 daily injections of the drug, the normal drug protocol used in induction or consolidation treatments of acute leukaemias. Idarubicin can also be administered orally and the pharmacokinetics are similar to those after intravenous administration, except that the idarubicinol: idarubicin ratio is increased, probably due to a liver first-pass effect. The bioavailability of idarubicin is 20 to 25%, but if the activity of idarubicinol is taken into account, it is effectively about 40%. After idarubicin administration by either route, there is a progressive accumulation of idarubicinol after multiple once-daily but not after once-weekly doses. About 10% of the injected dose is recovered in urine as idarubicin and idarubicinol, and only slightly higher proportions are recovered in bile. This suggests that other unidentified metabolites must be excreted by either or by both pathways.","['Robert, J']",['Robert J'],"['Fondation Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,['ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacokinetics']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003088-199324040-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 1993 Apr;24(4):275-88. doi: 10.2165/00003088-199324040-00002.,,60,,,,,,,,,,['Clin Pharmacokinet 1993 Oct;25(4):350'],,,,,

Multiple CD45 isoforms, differing in the extracellular domain, are expressed in a tissue- and activation-specific manner, suggesting an important function for this domain. We report that a chimeric protein in which the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD45 are replaced with those of the EGF receptor (EGFR) is able to restore TCR signaling in a CD45-deficient cell. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 is necessary and sufficient for TCR signal transduction. Moreover, EGFR ligands functionally inactivate the EGFR-CD45 chimera in a manner that is dependent on dimerization of the chimeric protein. Inactivation of EGFR-CD45 chimera function results in the loss of TCR signaling, indicating that CD45 function is continuously required for TCR-mediated proximal signaling events. These results suggest that ligand-mediated regulation of receptor-PTPases may have mechanistic similarities with receptor tyrosine kinases.","['Desai, D M', 'Sap, J', 'Schlessinger, J', 'Weiss, A']","['Desai DM', 'Sap J', 'Schlessinger J', 'Weiss A']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/07 00:00,1993/05/07 00:01,['1993/05/07 00:00'],"['1993/05/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/07 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/07 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(93)90141-C [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(93)90141-c [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1993 May 7;73(3):541-54. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(93)90141-c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two patients had Stage I disease, 5 Stage II, 9 Stage III, 8 Stage IVA (< 25% blasts in the bone marrow), and 16 Stage IVB (> 25% blasts in the bone marrow). The last patient with Stage IVB disease was entered in 1977, a time when the philosophy of treatment for leukemia-lymphomas had not yet evolved completely. Most of these lymphomas were high-grade lymphoblastic lymphomas, followed by immunoblastic lymphomas and reticulosarcomas. The event-free survival rate of this group of patients was 75%, with all patients having completed therapy, and a median observation time of more than 10 years without therapy. The lymphoma-free survival rate was 80%. Sex, age, and stage were not of prognostic significance. There was no significant difference in survival between patients with lymphoblastic and histiocytic lymphomas (75% versus 64%, respectively). There was no significant difference in survival between the patients with high-grade and medium-grade lymphomas (75% versus 78%, respectively). Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) in this primary site was not indicative of extent or bulk of disease and did not affect survival negatively. Radiation therapy and dose intensity of chemotherapy influenced survival by promoting rapid and more complete cell kill, helping prevent the emergence of resistant cells. CONCLUSIONS: Although primary peripheral nodal lymphoma usually is disseminated at diagnosis, it is still a highly curable disease when treated aggressively. The lymphoma-free survival rate for patients with primary nodal NHL with marrow involvement is 75%, and this subsequently has led to a different philosophy in the treatment of high-risk leukemias and lymphoma-leukemias with the NY-I and NY-II protocols, with excellent results.","['Wollner, N', 'Exelby, P', 'Lindsley, K L', 'Lieberman, P', 'Filippa, D', 'Heller, G']","['Wollner N', 'Exelby P', 'Lindsley KL', 'Lieberman P', 'Filippa D', 'Heller G']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'LSA(2)L(2) protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/classification/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Sex Factors', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930601)71:11<3670::aid-cncr2820711133>3.0.co;2-s [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Jun 1;71(11):3670-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930601)71:11<3670::aid-cncr2820711133>3.0.co;2-s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors studied the clinical and biologic features and treatment response of 358 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), including 90 adolescents, treated on a single multiagent protocol (St. Jude Total Study XI, 1984-1988). This was done to clarify whether the disease differed in adolescents and to determine the degree of improvement in treatment outcome produced by this modern intense chemotherapy. RESULTS: Compared with the younger children (1-9 years of age; infants 1 year old or younger excluded; n = 257), adolescents (10-18 years of age; n = 90) were significantly more likely to have adverse prognostic features, including T-cell phenotype, L2 blast cell morphologic characteristics, blasts with negative findings for common ALL antigen, and ploidy other than hyperdiploidy greater than 50. Eighty-six of the 90 (96%) adolescents achieved a complete remission, a rate similar to that of the children (97%). Although the event-free survival (EFS) of adolescents was shorter than that of younger children (5-year EFS of 66 +/- 8% versus 75 +/- 5%, respectively; P = 0.04), in this analysis of consecutively treated patients with ALL it showed a significant statistical and clinical improvement as compared with that in our previous study (St. Jude Total Study X, 1979-1983; 5-year EFS rate of 66 +/- 8% versus 37 +/- 5%, respectively; P < 0.001). Within the adolescent group treated on Total Study XI, the EFS was worse for those older than 15 years of age than for those 10-14 years old (46 +/- 15% versus 75 +/- 8%, respectively; P = 0.007). Toxic effects primarily included myelosuppression without severe sequelae. Approximately 96% of the therapy was administered in the outpatient setting. CONCLUSIONS: The increased frequency of unfavorable clinical and biologic features undoubtedly accounts for the poorer prognosis of adolescents with ALL, a conclusion supported by the lack of independent prognostic importance of age in this study. The authors conclude that approximately two-thirds of adolescents can be cured when treated with this intensive but tolerable therapy, showing that this form of treatment significantly has changed the prognosis of adolescents with ALL.","['Rivera, G K', 'Pui, C H', 'Santana, V M', 'Hancock, M L', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Furman, W', 'Marina, N', 'Crist, W M']","['Rivera GK', 'Pui CH', 'Santana VM', 'Hancock ML', 'Mahmoud H', 'Sandlund JT', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Furman W', 'Marina N', 'Crist WM']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930515)71:10+<3400::aid-cncr2820711744>3.0.co;2-o [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 May 15;71(10 Suppl):3400-5. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930515)71:10+<3400::aid-cncr2820711744>3.0.co;2-o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of treatment.,3377-85,"BACKGROUND: Scant data are available on event-free survival (EFS) for young adults with leukemia who were 16-21 years of age at diagnosis. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), it is well recognized that children have a better EFS compared with adults, whereas for acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), EFS results seem to be similar. To determine the appropriate treatment for young adults with leukemia, outcome data are essential. METHODS: Young adults entered on the Childrens Cancer Group (CCG) 100 series ALL protocols and the CCG 213 AML protocol were analyzed for EFS and survival. Prognostic factors for EFS also were determined. RESULTS: The actuarial EFS for 143 young adults with ALL treated on the CCG 100 series ALL protocols was 64 +/- 4% at 4 years and 59 +/- 4% at 6 years. The major adverse prognostic feature was leukocyte counts greater than 50,000/microliters. The actuarial EFS for 79 young adults with AML entered on CCG 213 was 32.2 +/- 5.3% at 2 years and 28.6 +/- 5.3% at 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with ALL treated on CCG protocols have a 6-year EFS of approximately 60%. This is similar to the EFS for patients 10-15+ years of age at diagnosis treated on the same protocols and better than EFS results reported from most adult trials. Young adults with AML had a slightly inferior outcome compared with younger children.","['Nachman, J', 'Sather, H N', 'Buckley, J D', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Tubergen, D G', 'Lampkin, B C', 'Hammond, G D']","['Nachman J', 'Sather HN', 'Buckley JD', 'Gaynon PS', 'Steinherz PG', 'Tubergen DG', 'Lampkin BC', 'Hammond GD']","['University of Chicago Hospitals, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930515)71:10+<3377::aid-cncr2820711741>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 May 15;71(10 Suppl):3377-85. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930515)71:10+<3377::aid-cncr2820711741>3.0.co;2-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An analysis of trends from the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program.,3325-30,"To assess the proportion of children diagnosed with cancer who are enrolled on studies conducted by the two national pediatric cooperative groups, population-based cancer incidence data for Los Angeles county children younger than age 20 for the years 1980 through 1987 were linked with patient records of children registered with the Childrens Cancer Group (CCG) or the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG). For patients not enrolled on a protocol, demographic and disease characteristics were compared with summary eligibility requirements for CCG protocols that were open for enrollment during 1980-1987. The proportion of patients enrolled on studies conducted by the cooperative groups varied with tumor type and age at diagnosis. When patients younger than the age of 10 were diagnosed at an institution affiliated with one of the groups, the majority of those evaluated by our review as eligible for a study were enrolled on a protocol. The proportion of young patients entered on study among those whose diagnosis was not made at a cooperative group institution was generally smaller. Seventy-three percent of all potentially eligible patients with acute leukemia diagnosed between 1980-1987 were entered on a pediatric group protocol. Approximately 50% of all potentially eligible patients with brain tumors were entered on protocol. In contrast to this, less than 50% of patients older than the age of 14 and likely to be eligible for a study were entered on a pediatric group protocol, regardless of the tumor type. Indeed, bone tumors constituted the category of patients most likely to be enrolled, with 39% of all potentially eligible patients entered on a study in the period examined. If the patient's diagnosis was made at a cooperative group institution, the individual was more likely to be entered on a protocol than if the diagnosis was made at a center outside the cooperative group network. It was not possible to determine the precise reason for this trend from the data available. Some explanations include policies at cooperative group institutions regarding admission of patients older than age 14 and the availability of protocols from cooperative groups primarily focused on the treatment of cancers of adults.","['Krailo, M D', 'Bernstein, L', 'Sullivan-Halley, J', 'Hammond, G D']","['Krailo MD', 'Bernstein L', 'Sullivan-Halley J', 'Hammond GD']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],"['CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA17054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Los Angeles/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', '*Registries']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930515)71:10+<3325::aid-cncr2820711731>3.0.co;2-k [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 May 15;71(10 Suppl):3325-30. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930515)71:10+<3325::aid-cncr2820711731>3.0.co;2-k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The 1991 edition of Cancer Statistics Review was scrutinized for information on the status of pediatric cancers in the United States. RESULTS: The evidence indicates that in the United States, cancer among children younger than 15 years of age is increasing in incidence. In this age group, cancer is increasing equally among whites and blacks and among girls and boys. In white children, the increase appears to be largely due to increases in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and tumors of the brain and nervous system, and not to changes in Wilms tumor, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, lymphomas and Hodgkin disease, or other common malignancies of childhood. The data in the report demonstrate that the cancer mortality rate before age 15 continues to decline steadily in both sexes and both races. Despite an increase in the incidence rate of 4% between 1973-1988, the overall cancer mortality in children younger than 15 years has decreased 38%.

METHODS: Indirect calorimetry was performed on 22 dogs with high-grade lymphoblastic lymphoma that were randomized into a blind study and fed isocaloric amounts of a high-fat diet (Diet A) or a high-carbohydrate diet (Diet B) before and after remission was attained with up to five doses of doxorubicin chemotherapy (30 mg/m2 intravenously). Indirect calorimetry was also performed on 30 normal dogs for comparison. RESULTS: During the initial evaluation period, the resting energy expenditure (REE/kg0.75, P < 0.05) and respiratory quotient (RQ, P < 0.05) were significantly lower than in the controls. Six weeks after the start of the study, the REE/kg0.75 and oxygen consumption (VO2/kg0.75) were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in both groups of dogs with lymphoma compared with the controls. The RQ determined 6 weeks after the start of the study for the dogs fed Diet A was significantly (P < 0.05) lower compared with that in the controls evaluated at the same time. When the two groups of dogs with lymphoma were compared with each other, there was no significant difference in any of the outcomes. The REE/kg0.75 and VO2/kg0.75 values were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the group fed Diet A after the third evaluation period compared with the second evaluation. The REE/kg0.75 and VO2/kg0.75 values were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the group given Diet B at the fourth evaluation period compared with the fifth. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that energy expenditure of dogs with lymphoma decreases transiently in response to chemotherapy and remission, but these values are less than those determined in normal dogs and not altered significantly by diet.","['Ogilvie, G K', 'Walters, L M', 'Fettman, M J', 'Hand, M S', 'Salman, M D', 'Wheeler, S L']","['Ogilvie GK', 'Walters LM', 'Fettman MJ', 'Hand MS', 'Salman MD', 'Wheeler SL']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, Colorado State University Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],['2 CA 29582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Dietary Carbohydrates)', '0 (Dietary Fats)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Calorimetry', 'Diet', 'Dietary Carbohydrates/metabolism', 'Dietary Fats/metabolism', 'Dog Diseases/*metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Energy Intake', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*veterinary']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930515)71:10<3146::aid-cncr2820711041>3.0.co;2-v [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 May 15;71(10):3146-52. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930515)71:10<3146::aid-cncr2820711041>3.0.co;2-v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A modified VAD regimen was given: a 96-hour infusion of 1.6 mg vincristine and 36 mg/m2 doxorubicin with dexamethasone 40 mg by mouth daily for 4 days every 3 weeks. The treatment was continued until two cycles beyond maximal response, which was evaluated after two and six cycles. RESULTS: Of the 33 evaluable patients, 7 (21%) achieved a partial response (PR), with no complete remissions. One-third of the patients (11 of 33) had progressive disease and 15 of 33 (45%) had stable disease, as defined by the National Cancer Institute Working Group criteria. The median duration of PR was 6.5 months, with a median survival time of 14.8 months. A PR was achieved by 3 of 19 patients (16%) who had received prior vincristine +/- doxorubicin and 4 of 14 patients (28%) who had not received vincristine or doxorubicin. Of the nine patients whose disease was refractory to prior therapy, five (55%) achieved a PR. The neurotoxicity of VAD was reduced by decreasing the frequency of the dexamethasone, but 22 of 36 (61%) patients still became infected. Only on infection (2.8%) was life threatening, and there were no infectious deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Because fludarabine has shown superior responses, VAD should be reserved for patients who do not respond to alkylating agents and fludarabine and in whom alternative treatments are not appropriate.","['Friedenberg, W R', 'Anderson, J', 'Wolf, B C', 'Cassileth, P A', 'Oken, M M']","['Friedenberg WR', 'Anderson J', 'Wolf BC', 'Cassileth PA', 'Oken MM']","['Marshfield CCOP, Wisconsin.']",['eng'],"['CA 06594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/antagonists & inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930515)71:10<2983::aid-cncr2820711016>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 May 15;71(10):2983-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930515)71:10<2983::aid-cncr2820711016>3.0.co;2-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Details were traced for over 30,000 workers involved in the construction of the large oil terminals in the Shetland and Orkney islands in northern Scotland or employed offshore. Home addresses of the 17,160 Scottish residents were postcoded, integrated with census data, and then classified as urban or rural. Rural postcode sectors, ranked by proportion of oil workers, were grouped into three categories with similar numbers of children but contrasting densities of oil workers. The incidence of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was examined in these rural (and also in urban) categories in the periods 1974-8, 1979-83 and 1984-8. SETTING: Scotland. SUBJECTS: Young people below age 25. RESULTS: A significant excess of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was found in 1979-83 in the group of rural home areas with the largest proportion of oil workers, following closely on large increases in the workforce. The area near the Dounreay nuclear installation, where an excess of leukaemia is already well known, was within the rural high oil category. CONCLUSION: The findings support the infection hypothesis that population mixing can increase the incidence of childhood leukaemia in rural areas. They also suggest that the recent excess in the Dounreay-Thurso area is due to population mixing linked to the oil industry, promoted by certain unusual local demographic factors.","['Kinlen, L J', ""O'Brien, F"", 'Clarke, K', 'Balkwill, A', 'Matthews, F']","['Kinlen LJ', ""O'Brien F"", 'Clarke K', 'Balkwill A', 'Matthews F']","['Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Infirmary.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,['0 (Petroleum)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Emigration and Immigration', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infections/complications', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Petroleum', 'Population Growth', 'Rural Health', 'Scotland/epidemiology', 'Urban Health']",1993/03/20 00:00,1993/03/20 00:01,['1993/03/20 00:00'],"['1993/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.306.6880.743 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1993 Mar 20;306(6880):743-8. doi: 10.1136/bmj.306.6880.743.,,,PMC1677226,,,,,,,,,['BMJ 1993 Jul 10;307(6896):91'],,,,,

We studied the in vitro antiproliferative effects of interferon (IFN)-gamma on the mouse B16 melanoma and Friend erythroleukemia, and the human K562 erythroleukemia, as doxorubicin (DXR)-sensitive and -resistant (multidrug resistant) variants. These effects were marked in B16 melanoma and rather slight in K562 erythroleukemia, without any difference between the DXR-sensitive and -resistant lines. The chemosensitive variant of Friend erythroleukemia showed an intermediate response, which was greater than that seen in its resistant counterpart. There was no apparent relationship between the antiproliferative activity of IFN-gamma and the glutathione content of the cell lines. On the other hand, this activity was enhanced by co-treatment with glutathione-depleting concentrations of buthionine sulfoximine, but only in the cell lines which had responded better to IFN-gamma alone. This result probably confirms that a free radical mechanism plays a part in the antitumor effect of the cytokine. Finally, a range of concentrations of IFN-gamma, including slightly cytotoxic ones, did not substantially improve the antiproliferative effects of doxorubicin on the various cell lines, except in the DXR-sensitive variant of Friend erythroleukemia where a synergistic effect of the combination was observed. Thus, our results are not very promising with regard to a possible favorable modulatory activity by IFN-gamma of DXR (multidrug)-resistance.","['Borsellino, N', 'Crescimanno, M', 'Flandina, C', 'Leonardi, V', 'Rausa, L', ""D'Alessandro, N""]","['Borsellino N', 'Crescimanno M', 'Flandina C', 'Leonardi V', 'Rausa L', ""D'Alessandro N""]","['Istituto di Farmacologia, Facolta di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universita di Palermo, Policlinico P.

Cachexia is most obviously manifested as weight loss with massive depletion of both adipose tissue and muscle mass, and death is probably due to loss of lean body tissue. Not only is the survival time shorter in patients with cachexia, but the frequency of response to chemotherapy is also significantly reduced. Although anorexia frequently accompanies cachexia, attempts to halt or reverse cachexia by nutritional repletion have not been successful. This suggests that cachexia is due to metabolic abnormalities produced by the tumor in addition to the underlying anorexia. In some patients weight loss is associated with an increased relative energy expenditure possibly through an elevated adrenergic state. Several factors have been postulated as mediators of cancer cachexia and can be divided into two groups. (i) Materials with hormone-like characteristics which result in direct catabolism of host tissues. (ii) Cytokines which cause alterations in host metabolism indirectly. Included in group (i) are the conventional catabolic hormones and a lipid mobilizing factor (LMF) produced by tumors, which causes direct breakdown of adipose tissue. Included in group (ii) are tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and leukaemia inhibitory factor. The materials appear to influence adipose tissue indirectly through an inhibition of lipoprotein lipase. Reversal of cachexia has been achieved by two groups of agents. (i) Those stimulating food intake, e.g. megestrol acetate. (ii) Those directly inhibiting the LMF, e.g. eicosapentaenoic acid. While agents in group (i) can cause tumor growth stimulation, those in group (ii) act as tumor growth inhibitors. This latter results suggests that the products of catabolism of host tissues may be important for tumor growth and provides a new avenue for chemotherapeutic intervention.","['Tisdale, M J']",['Tisdale MJ'],"['Pharmaceutical Sciences Institute, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cachexia/*etiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*complications']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199304000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1993 Apr;4(2):115-25. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199304000-00001.,,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of one DCC allele or decreased DCC expression occurs in more than 70% of colorectal cancers, suggesting that DCC inactivation constitutes a critical event in the development of these tumors. Using polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA, we have studied DCC expression in bone marrow from 4 patients with leukemia (1 chronic myeloid leukemia-blastic crisis, case 1; 1 acute myeloid leukemia, case 2; 1 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], case 3; 1 B-cell ALL, case 4) showing loss of one DCC allele due to monosomy 18. We also studied DCC expression in multiple control samples, including normal lymphocytes, normal tonsillar tissue, and leukemias without 18q abnormalities. Four primer pairs consistently amplified the predicted DCC sequences from cDNA prepared from all control samples. However, in samples with monosomy 18, DCC transcripts were either not detected (case 1) or detected at a very low level (cases 2, 3, and 4). Southern analysis showed no structural rearrangement of the remaining DCC locus in all leukemia samples. Thus, loss of DCC expression was demonstrated in association with loss of one DCC allele in all cases tested. These results suggest that, as for colorectal tumors, the inactivation of DCC can have a role in the development of hematologic malignancies.","['Porfiri, E', 'Secker-Walker, L M', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Hancock, J F']","['Porfiri E', 'Secker-Walker LM', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Hancock JF']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, DCC', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Monosomy', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67865-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 May 15;81(10):2696-701.,,,,,,,,,,,['DCC'],,,,,,

In the case of RPM cells, ADP was the only naturally occurring platelet agonist capable of eliciting this response. Binding studies with [3H]ADP and fixed cells showed 3.99 +/- 1.77 x 10(5) binding sites/cell for RPM cells (apparent dissociation constant [kd] = 7.75 +/- 2.3 x 10(-8) mol/L), 8.19 +/- 3.25 x 10(5) sites/cell for HEL cells (kd = 2.15 +/- 0.84 x 10(-7) mol/L, 1.15 +/- 0.23 x 10(6) sites/cell for U937 cells (kd = 2.20 +/- 0.53 x 10(-7) mol/L) and 5.39 +/- 2.80 x 10(5) sites/cell for K562 cells (kd = 1.37 +/- 0.39 x 10(-7) mol/L), Inhibition studies with unlabeled nucleotides and analogues showed that binding was approximately 85% specific and the inhibitory pattern was similar to that seen with mature platelets.

We report on the isolation of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis from 17 blood cultures that were taken from a 67-year-old white man with a diagnosis of acute biphenotypic leukemia during a 2-week period of hospitalization for induction chemotherapy. Despite receiving high-dose amphotericin B throughout this period, the status of the patient worsened, and he experienced pancytopenia, hypernatremia, azotemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which led to his death. Candida krusei and C tropicalis were isolated concurrently from 10 of the 17 blood cultures, while C krusei was the single isolate in three cultures and C tropicalis was isolated alone in four cultures. Each species manifested markedly different colonial morphological features.

Far fewer situations exist, however, in which these analyses are the main clue in establishing an emergency diagnosis. Artifacts can lead to wrong diagnosis, e.g. pseudo-thrombocytopenia, which is defined as a low platelet count resulting from a laboratory artifact. Severe neutropenia (agranulocytosis) and extreme hyperleukocytosis, as well as suspicion of acute leukemia, require a rapid diagnostic work-up. A newly detected anemia should not necessarily be treated by packed red cell transfusions. The decision whether an anemic patient ought to receive transfusions should be based on the speed with which the anemia has developed, as well as on clinical judgement. As a rule a chronic anemia patient with hemoglobin above 70 g/l does not need transfusions. An uncritical transfusion policy can even cause emergencies, e.g. in patients with megaloblastic anemia or in anemic multiple myeloma patients with a hyperviscosity syndrome. An elevated hematocrit requires prompt further investigations. This is of utmost importance if one considers the diagnosis of polycythemia vera rubra, a disease in which patients are particularly prone to thrombotic complications. Fragmented red cells (schistocytes) on peripheral blood smears constitute a cardinal diagnostic clue for the detection of microangiopathic hemolytic anemias (MAHA), in particular for the diagnosis of the life-threatening thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Malaria is another example for a chief role of blood smears examination in achieving a rapid diagnosis. If one encounters an unexpected severe thrombocytopenia, a marrow examination reveals whether it is due to rapid peripheral destruction, or due to a marrow failure. Furthermore, in any patients with an unanticipated thrombocytopenia, a disseminated intravascular coagulation and a MAHA should be ruled out. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a rare, but possibly fatal complication of therapy with heparins.","['Tobler, A']",['Tobler A'],"['Hamatologisches Zentrallaborator der Universitat, Inselspital Bern.']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,,IM,"['*Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Transfusion', '*Emergencies', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Hematologic Diseases/*blood/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Platelet Count', 'Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic/blood', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood']",1993/04/17 00:00,1993/04/17 00:01,['1993/04/17 00:00'],"['1993/04/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/17 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1993 Apr 17;123(15):711-20.,,47,,,Der Blutbildnotfall.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, malignant hematological diseases among 1003 Danish patients injected during 1935-1947 and followed to 1992 accruing 20,433 person-years were assessed and available histopathological specimens revised. The mean cumulative bone marrow alpha-particle radiation dose (1.34 Gy) was estimated from records of the amount of Thorotrast injected (mean 18.7 ml). Sixteen cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and seven cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were diagnosed 8-40 years after injection, the cumulative frequency reaching 7.6%. No significant relationship was seen between the cumulative frequency of AML + MDS and the age at injection, gender, or amount of Thorotrast injected, but a multivariate analysis described data best by a model with the bone marrow dose and the power of the attained age. The risk estimate for AML + MDS was 173 cases/10(4) persons per Gy. If also considering cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (1), chronic myelogenous leukemia (3), non-Hodgkins lymphoma (4), and multiple myeloma (2), the risk estimate became 248 cases/10(4) persons per Gy.

Previous analyses of these data have been made either without regard to cancer type, excluding leukemia, or separately for types or classes of cancers. Clearly, analyses without regard to cancer type are less than satisfactory. The primary advantages of joint, rather than separate, analyses are that: (1) models can be fitted with some parameters common to cancer types and others type-specific; (2) significance tests can be used to compare type-specific risks; and (3) through consideration of more comprehensive models, a clearer understanding may be obtained of the modifying effects of sex, age at exposure, and time since exposure. Joint analysis is straightforward, entailing primarily the incorporation of another factor, cancer type, in the usual cross-tabulation of the data for analysis. The use of these methods is illustrated in an analysis of three classes of cancer studied by the National Research Council's BEIR V Committee: digestive, respiratory, and other solid tumors. Based on this analysis, some criticism is made of the BEIR V preferred models. The proposed methods are applicable to models for either relative or absolute risks, and results using both types of models are given. Although some of the gains from joint analysis are apparent from the results here, it will be important to use these methods with a more suitable choice of cancer classes and for cancer incidence data where the diagnoses are more accurate.","['Pierce, D A', 'Preston, D L']","['Pierce DA', 'Preston DL']","['Department of Statistics, Oregon State University 97331-4606.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Respiratory Tract Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1993 May;134(2):134-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of these results with classical cytogenetic (CC) data demonstrated a good correlation between the two methods. FISH confirmed the finding of monosomy 7 in all patients who demonstrated this abnormality by CC. Two AML patients who did not show monosomy 7 by CC were unexpectedly found to contain this abnormality in 39.8% and 17% cells when examined by FISH. Given that our modified FISH method consistently yielded > 96% hybridization efficiency, these findings constitute an unexpected but real presence of monosomy 7 in a substantial number of interphase cells that had remained undetected by classical karyotyping. Finally, a number of maturing myeloid cells including granulocytes also demonstrated monosomy 7 by FISH, thereby confirming the ability of malignant cells to undergo differentiation. We conclude that FISH constitutes a highly sophisticated molecular technique which can be extremely useful in select cases for detecting 'masked monosomy 7' as well as helping to determine the lineage of terminally mature cells in AML, thereby providing a handle on the effects of cytokines or chemotherapy on normal vs leukemic clones.","['Kadam, P', 'Umerani, A', 'Srivastava, A', 'Masterson, M', 'Lampkin, B', 'Raza, A']","['Kadam P', 'Umerani A', 'Srivastava A', 'Masterson M', 'Lampkin B', 'Raza A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cincinnati, OH 45267-0508.']",['eng'],['CA41285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*physiology', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Interphase/*physiology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Monosomy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/pathology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90025-G [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90025-g [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Apr;17(4):365-74. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90025-g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood samples were obtained from 11 patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia at certain intervals up to 20 h after the infusion of mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2. Plasma and leukemic cells were separated and the drug concentrations were determined with HPLC. Before treatment, leukemic cells from 12 patients were incubated with 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 1.0 microM mitoxantrone for 1-4 h and thereafter cultured in suspension culture for 20 h; during this time cell samples were taken at certain intervals for drug determination. In cells incubated with 0.05 and 0.2 microM mitoxantrone the cytotoxic effect was measured with the DiSC assay after cultivation for 4-5 days. In vivo, the intracellular levels exceeded the plasma concentrations already at the end of infusion and after 2 h the intracellular concentrations were 200-300 times higher than in plasma. In vitro, the intracellular steady state level of mitoxantrone was reached after 1-2 h and there was a pronounced intracellular retention even after 20 h culture in drug-free medium. Incubation with 0.05 microM during 1 h gave intracellular concentrations of mitoxantrone similar to those achieved in vivo. This incubation concentration gave a mean cytotoxic effect of 53% living cells measured with the DiSC assay, which gives good possibilities to discriminate between mitoxantrone-sensitive and unsensitive cells. We believe that exposing leukemic cells in vitro for in vivo mimicking mitoxantrone concentrations could increase the clinical relevance of predictive assays.","['Sundman-Engberg, B', 'Tidefelt, U', 'Gruber, A', 'Paul, C']","['Sundman-Engberg B', 'Tidefelt U', 'Gruber A', 'Paul C']","['Department of Medicine, Huddinge Hospital, Karolinska Institute, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/blood/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/blood/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90022-D [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90022-d [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Apr;17(4):347-52. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90022-d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, immunological data and studies on clonal gene rearrangements have provided evidence for circulating malignant B-lymphocytes. Herein, we report on the detection and clinical significance of monoclonal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of multiple myeloma patients. Applying the analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, clonal circulating lymphocytes were found in 8 out of 37 patients. In three of these eight patients, DNA from the bone marrow could be examined as well, and the same gene rearrangement as in peripheral blood was detected. This observation indicates that the monoclonal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood are part of the malignant plasma cell clone in the bone marrow. There was a strong correlation between progressive stage III disease and the detection of circulating tumour cells, whereas neither in stable stage III nor stage I disease could clonal gene rearrangements be detected. Our findings indicate the high incidence of monoclonal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood from patients with progressive multiple myeloma. This may be of importance with respect to cell harvesting strategies for autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma.","['Knauf, W U', 'Pochanke, G', 'Ho, A D']","['Knauf WU', 'Pochanke G', 'Ho AD']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Klinikum Steglitz, Free University, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90021-C [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90021-c [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Apr;17(4):341-5. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90021-c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ophthalmological examination consisted of visual acuity, slit lamp examination, tonometry and ophthalmoscopy. It included also determination of tears break-up-time, Jones-test, rose bengal staining and impression cytology of the conjunctiva. RESULTS: The major ocular complication was the development of a keratoconjunctivitis sicca syndrome in 14 of the 21 patients. This complication is probably due to the total-body irradiation in the preparative before and to the development of a chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease after transplantation. 13 of the 21 patients developed a cataract. This might be a result of the total-body irradiation and a prolonged high steroid intake. CONCLUSION: The frequency and severity of ocular complications suggest that detailed ocular examinations should be performed routinely in patients after bone marrow transplantation.","['Bautista Juanes, J A', 'Theischen, M', 'Beelen, D W', 'Pauleikhoff, D', 'Koch, J M', 'Waubke, T N', 'Wessing, A']","['Bautista Juanes JA', 'Theischen M', 'Beelen DW', 'Pauleikhoff D', 'Koch JM', 'Waubke TN', 'Wessing A']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Augenheilkunde, Medizinische Einrichtungen, Universitat-Gesamthochschule Essen.']",['ger'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,0014133,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*surgery', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cataract/*etiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Visual Acuity/physiology']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd. 1993 Feb;202(2):110-5.,,,,,Okulare Komplikationen bei Langzeituberlebenden nach Knochenmarktransplantation.

While epidemiologic studies suggest an association between cancer in humans and consumption of chlorination byproducts in drinking water, these studies have not been adequate to draw definite conclusions about the carcinogenic potential of the individual byproducts. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the carcinogenic potential of chlorinated or chloraminated drinking water and of four organic trihalomethane byproducts of chlorination (chloroform, bromodichloromethane, chlorodibromomethane, and bromoform) in rats and mice. METHODS: Bromodichloromethane, chlorodibromomethane, bromoform, chlorine, or chloramine was administered to both sexes of F344/N rats and (C57BL/6 x C3H)F1 mice (hereafter called B6C3F1 mice). Chloroform was given to both sexes of Osborne-Mendel rats and B6C3F1 mice. Chlorine or chloramine was administered daily in the drinking water for 2 years at doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.3 mmol/kg per day. The trihalomethanes were administered by gavage in corn oil at doses ranging from 0.15 to 4.0 mmol/kg per day for 2 years, with the exception of chloroform, which was given for 78 weeks. RESULTS: The trihalomethanes were carcinogenic in the liver, kidney, and/or intestine of rodents. There was equivocal evidence for carcinogenicity in female rats that received chlorinated or chloraminated drinking water; this evidence was based on a marginal increase in the incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia. Rodents were generally exposed to lower doses of chlorine and chloramine than to the trihalomethanes, but the doses in these studies were the maximum that the animals would consume in the drinking water. The highest doses used in the chlorine and chloramine studies were equivalent to a daily gavage dose of bromodichloromethane that induced neoplasms of the large intestine in rats. In contrast to the results with the trihalomethanes, administration of chlorine or chloramine did not cause a clear carcinogenic response in rats or mice after long-term exposure. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that organic byproducts of chlorination are the chemicals of greatest concern in assessment of the carcinogenic potential of chlorinated drinking water.","['Dunnick, J K', 'Melnick, R L']","['Dunnick JK', 'Melnick RL']","['National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, N.C. 27709.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Chloramines)', '0 (Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane)', '4R7X1O2820 (Chlorine)', 'KW8K411A1P (chloramine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chloramines/*toxicity', 'Chlorine/*toxicity', 'Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Kidney Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Water Supply/*standards']",1993/05/19 00:00,1993/05/19 00:01,['1993/05/19 00:00'],"['1993/05/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/19 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.10.817 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 May 19;85(10):817-22. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.10.817.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of malignancy other than leukemia were treated with single daily oral doses of all-trans-RA ranging from 45 mg/m2 to 200 mg/m2. Doses of all-trans-RA were escalated in the next cohort of patients until the MTD was determined if the preceding dose level was not associated with significant toxicity. RESULTS: Lung cancer was the most common type of tumor included in the study (26 cases) followed by head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (three cases), and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (two cases); other miscellaneous solid tumors were also represented. Toxicities included cheilitis, skin reactions, headache, and nausea and vomiting, as well as transient elevations of liver enzymes and triglyceride levels. Skin toxicities, consisting of erythema with desquamation and paronychia, were considered to be the dose-limiting toxicity, and were observed in two of six patients who received 175 mg/m2/d, and in two of five patients who received 200 mg/m2/d. Of the 30 patients with assessable lesions, response was evaluated in 26 patients and no major objective tumor response was observed. Two patients were able to receive the drug for longer than 1 year without significant toxicities. There was considerable variation in individual patients' peak plasma all-trans-RA levels, and a decrease in the area under the curve of all-trans-RA plasma concentration was observed in all four patients evaluated. CONCLUSION: For phase II study of adult patients, we recommend 150 mg/m2 of all-trans-RA administered orally once a day. However, for better optimization of drug administration schedules, further studies are needed.","['Lee, J S', 'Newman, R A', 'Lippman, S M', 'Huber, M H', 'Minor, T', 'Raber, M N', 'Krakoff, I H', 'Hong, W K']","['Lee JS', 'Newman RA', 'Lippman SM', 'Huber MH', 'Minor T', 'Raber MN', 'Krakoff IH', 'Hong WK']","['Department of Thoracic/Head & Neck Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/analysis', 'Cheilitis/chemically induced', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Headache/chemically induced', 'Hearing Disorders/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Liver Diseases/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy', 'Skin Diseases/chemically induced', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.5.959 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 May;11(5):959-66. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.5.959.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because ANLL seems more likely to occur in splenectomized patients, attention is focused on an unexpected association between splenectomy and the risk of secondary leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The risk of ANLL was assessed in 503 patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) homogeneously treated with combined modality therapy (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone [MOPP] plus radiotherapy). These patients were diagnosed from 1970 through 1984 and monitored until June 1991. RESULTS: ANLL was observed in one of 145 (0.69%) patients not splenectomized and in 21 of 358 (5.86%) splenectomized patients, demonstrating a significantly higher frequency of ANLL in the group of patients who underwent splenectomy. The group of patients who developed ANLL received a statistically greater number of MOPP courses than did the group not developing ANLL. ANLL was statistically more frequent in those patients who received more than four cycles of MOPP. Sex, symptoms, extent of radiotherapy, splenectomy, age, and number of MOPP courses were assessed for their impact on ANLL incidence by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Cox's proportional hazards regression showed that splenectomy and, as previously described by others, the number of courses of MOPP are prognostic factors that increase the risk of secondary ANLL in HD patients treated with combined modality therapy. These data raise interesting questions regarding the possible role of the spleen in leukemia development.","['Tura, S', 'Fiacchini, M', 'Zinzani, P L', 'Brusamolino, E', 'Gobbi, P G']","['Tura S', 'Fiacchini M', 'Zinzani PL', 'Brusamolino E', 'Gobbi PG']","['Institute of Hematology L. e A.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: With the first regimen, standard (S), six injections of triple intrathecal chemotherapy (TIC), consisting of methotrexate (MTX), hydrocortisone (HC), and cytarabine (ara-C), were administered during intensification treatment and at every-8-week intervals throughout the maintenance phase for 17 additional doses. The second regimen, standard and MTX pulses (SAM), also specified six TICs during intensification, but substituted every-8-week pulses of intermediate-dose parenteral methotrexate (IDM; 1 g/m2) for the 17 maintenance TIC injections, with a low-dose intrathecal (IT) MTX boost administered with the first four maintenance IDM pulses. Otherwise, systemic therapy on regimen SAM was identical to regimen S. There were 1,152 patients randomized to the S and SAM regimens after stratification by risk group (age/leukocyte count) and immunophenotype. RESULTS: The 5-year probabilities (+/- SE) of an isolated CNS relapse were regimen S: good risk (n = 381), 2.8% +/- 1.3%; poor risk (n = 196), 7.7% +/- 3.2%; good + poor risk (n = 577), 4.7% +/- 1.5%; regimen SAM: good risk (n = 388), 9.6% +/- 2.2%; poor risk (n = 187), 12.7% +/- 4.2%; good + poor risk (n = 575), 10.9% +/- 2.2%. In poor-risk patients, approximately one third of the isolated CNS relapses occurred before preventive CNS therapy was begun at week 9. Hence, regimen S has provided better CNS preventive therapy for both good- and poor-risk patients (P < .001 overall). The difference is statistically significant for good-risk patients (P < .001), but not for poor-risk patients (P = .20). Neither treatment has shown a significant advantage in terms of general outcome. CONCLUSION: TIC injections extended throughout the intensification and maintenance periods are superior to IDM pulses for prevention of CNS leukemia. Our results with TIC seem comparable with those achieved with other contemporary methods of CNS preventative therapy. Thus, extended TIC affords a reasonable alternative to CNS irradiation plus upfront IT MTX for patients with B-progenitor ALL.","['Pullen, J', 'Boyett, J', 'Shuster, J', 'Crist, W', 'Land, V', 'Frankel, L', 'Iyer, R', 'Backstrom, L', 'van Eys, J', 'Harris, M']","['Pullen J', 'Boyett J', 'Shuster J', 'Crist W', 'Land V', 'Frankel L', 'Iyer R', 'Backstrom L', 'van Eys J', 'Harris M', 'et al.']","['University of Mississippi, Jackson.']",['eng'],"['CA-05587/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemic Infiltration/prevention & control', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.5.839 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 May;11(5):839-49. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.5.839.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies that include primarily adults with CML, using unrelated-donor (URD) BMT, have expanded this option to those without an MSD. We review and compare the efficacy of URD and MSD BMT in children with Ph1 CML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven children with URD BMTs were reviewed and compared with 11 children with MSD BMTs for Ph1 CML. Among the URD BMT recipients, there were three with fully matched marrows and 10 with advanced CML. The median time from diagnosis to transplant was 2.6 years. Among the MSD BMT recipients, 11 had fully matched marrows and five had advanced CML. The median time from diagnosis to BMT was 0.7 years. All received non-T-depleted marrows after cyclophosphamide and fractionated total-body irradiation. RESULTS: Both groups had similar engraftment times. Late graft failure occurred in two URD patients. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), > or = grade II, was similar in both groups (77% for URD BMT, 45% for MSD BMT), although more severe acute disease and more persistent chronic disease was seen in the URD group. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of DFS was 45% +/- 15% (SE) and 78% +/- 14% (SE) in the URD and MSD groups, respectively, at 3 years. All had Karnofsky scores of more than 70%, except one URD patient debilitated from GVHD. CONCLUSION: CML is eventually fatal to all patients without BMT. The high survival rate seen among children who receive a URD BMT, despite several adverse factors, opens this important therapeutic option to those without an MSD.","['Gamis, A S', 'Haake, R', 'McGlave, P', 'Ramsay, N K']","['Gamis AS', 'Haake R', 'McGlave P', 'Ramsay NK']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],['P01 CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*surgery', 'Male', 'Quality of Life', 'Survival Analysis', '*Tissue Donors']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.5.834 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 May;11(5):834-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.5.834.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with early bone marrow relapse received a polychemotherapy induction protocol starting with either 12 g/m2 MTX as a 4-hour infusion (high-dose [HDM]) or 1 g/m2 as a 36-hour infusion (intermediate-dose [IDM]). In HDM, leucovorin (LCV) was administered orally (12 times, 15 mg/m2 every 6 hours), beginning at hour 24. In IDM, only two doses were administered at hours 48 and 54. RESULTS: Median serum MTX concentrations during infusion were 716 mumol/L in HDM and 7.2 mumol/L in IDM. In HDM, MTX serum levels at hour 24 (median, 2.8 mumol/L) were significantly less than steady-state levels of IDM. Concentrations greater than 1 mumol/L were maintained for 36 hours with HDM and 45 hours with IDM. General tolerance to treatment was better in the HDM group. Mucosal lesions occurred significantly more often and were more severe after IDM treatment. A median treatment delay of 3 days was required in the IDM group but not in the HDM group. At day 15, complete remission (CR) was documented in 45% of IDM- and 48% of HDM-treated patients. Persistent blasts (> 5%) appeared more frequently in HDM than in IDM (35% v 19% of patients; P = NS). After completion of induction therapy, 28 of 30 patients in each group achieved CR. CONCLUSION: Both regimens produced the same remission rates. The tendency to better antileukemic activity of IDM was accompanied by more severe side effects as a consequence of long-lasting cytotoxic MTX levels. Hence, long-term infusion of IDM followed by low-dose LCV is an effective treatment for recurrent ALL.","['Wolfrom, C', 'Hartmann, R', 'Fengler, R', 'Bruhmuller, S', 'Ingwersen, A', 'Henze, G']","['Wolfrom C', 'Hartmann R', 'Fengler R', 'Bruhmuller S', 'Ingwersen A', 'Henze G']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.5.827 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 May;11(5):827-33. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.5.827.,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1993 May;11(5):820-1.

The hearing threshold changes were small in general, except for two patients who exhibited bilateral hearing threshold changes in the frequency range 0.5-8 kHz.

Factors found not to influence the hearing thresholds were maximum peak concentration of amikacin, cumulative duration of therapy, pretreatment renal dysfunction and concomitant use of vancomycin. It is concluded that administration of amikacin for repeated treatment courses is associated with a low incidence of serious changes in hearing function.","['Axdorph, U', 'Laurell, G', 'Bjorkholm, M']","['Axdorph U', 'Laurell G', 'Bjorkholm M']","['Division of Medicine, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Intern Med,Journal of internal medicine,8904841,['84319SGC3C (Amikacin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amikacin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory Threshold/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hearing/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/*drug therapy']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2796.1993.tb00691.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Intern Med. 1993 May;233(5):401-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2796.1993.tb00691.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in the membrane potential of NK and K562 cells, involved in a cell-mediated cytotoxic process, were studied by standard and slit-scan flow cytometry, using the membrane potential sensitive fluorescent probe DiBAC4(3). The NK cells were labeled with a membrane marker (TR-18 or DiI) prior to incubation with K562 cells and the conjugates that were formed could be identified on the basis of the membrane marker fluorescence and light scattering signals. With a slit-scan technique we measured the membrane potential of each cell in a conjugate separately. The results show that depolarization of the K562 cell occurs as a consequence of the cytotoxic activity of the NK cell. This depolarization appears to be an early sign of cell damage because the cell membrane still remains impermeable to propidium iodide.

Neutrophils activated by factors, normally present in the lumen, release a neutrophil-derived secretagogue activity to which intestinal epithelia respond with an electrogenic chloride secretion, the transport event which underlies secretory diarrhea. Using sequential ultrafiltration, column chromatographic, and mass and Raman spectroscopic techniques, neutrophil-derived secretagogue was identified as 5'-AMP. Additional studies suggested that neutrophil-derived 5'-AMP is subsequently converted to adenosine at the epithelial cell surface by ecto-5'-nucleotidase and that adenosine subsequently activates intestinal secretion through adenosine receptors on the apical membrane of target intestinal epithelial cells. These findings suggest that this ATP metabolite may serve as a neutrophil-derived paracrine mediator that contributes to secretory diarrhea in states of intestinal inflammation.","['Madara, J L', 'Patapoff, T W', 'Gillece-Castro, B', 'Colgan, S P', 'Parkos, C A', 'Delp, C', 'Mrsny, R J']","['Madara JL', 'Patapoff TW', 'Gillece-Castro B', 'Colgan SP', 'Parkos CA', 'Delp C', 'Mrsny RJ']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.""]",['eng'],"['DK-33506/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-35932/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-07627/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine Monophosphate/isolation & purification/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Chlorides/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Epithelium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intestines/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Models, Biological', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Ribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI116462 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1993 May;91(5):2320-5. doi: 10.1172/JCI116462.,,,PMC288238,"['J Clin Invest. 1993 May;91(5):1857-8.

Peripheral blood cells of T-ALL relapse patient H.A. were found to possess a heterozygous point mutation at codon 175 of the p53 gene. To determine whether this was an inherited mutation, a B cell line (HABL) was established. Leukemic T cell lines (HATL) were concurrently established by growing peripheral blood leukemic T cells at low oxygen tension in medium supplemented with IGF-I. Previously we had shown that > 60% of leukemic T cell lines possessed mutations in the p53 gene (Cheng, J., and M. Hass. 1990. Mol. Cell. Biol. 10:5502), mutations that might have originated with the donor's leukemic cells, or might have been induced during establishment of the cell lines. To answer whether establishment of the HATL lines was associated with the induction of p53 mutations, cDNAs of the HATL and HABL lines were sequenced. The HATL lines retained the same heterozygous p53 mutation that was present in the patient's leukemic cells. The HABL line lacked p53 mutations. Immunoprecipitation with specific anti-p53 antibodies showed that HATL cells produced p53 proteins of mutant and wild type immunophenotype, while the HABL line synthesized only wild-type p53 protein. The HATL cells had an abnormal karyotype, while the HABL cells possessed a normal diploid karyotype. These experiments suggest that (a) p53 mutation occurred in the leukemic cells of relapse T-ALL patient HA; (b) the mutation was of somatic rather than hereditary origin; (c) the mutation was leukemia associated; and (d) establishment of human leukemia cell lines needs not be associated with in vitro induction of p53 mutations. It may be significant that patient HA belonged to a category of relapse T-ALL patients in whom a second remission could not be induced.","['Yeargin, J', 'Cheng, J', 'Yu, A L', 'Gjerset, R', 'Bogart, M', 'Haas, M']","['Yeargin J', 'Cheng J', 'Yu AL', 'Gjerset R', 'Bogart M', 'Haas M']","['University of California San Diego Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, La Jolla 92093-0063.']",['eng'],"['R01CA56075/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA28439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'DNA/blood/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI116435 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1993 May;91(5):2111-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI116435.,,,PMC288211,,,,,,,,['p53'],,,,,,

The monomeric enzyme has no associated methionyl aminopeptidase activity. To determine the enzyme's kinetic mechanism, we examined the effect of covariation of subsaturating concentrations of myristoyl-CoA and peptide substrate on initial velocity. Double-reciprocal plots excluded a double displacement (ping-pong) mechanism. Product inhibition studies indicated that CoA was a noncompetitive inhibitor against myristoyl-CoA and a mixed-type inhibitor against peptide substrates. Together these results are consistent with a sequential ordered mechanism where, in a typical catalytic cycle, myristoyl-CoA binds to apoenzyme before peptide followed by release of the CoA and then myristoylpeptide products. This kinetic mechanism is identical to that described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae N-myristoyl-transferase (Nmt1p) and emphasizes the impact that regulation of myristoyl-CoA pool size and accessibility may have in modulating protein N-myristoylation in these two species. Comparative studies of the peptide substrate specificities of hNmt and Nmt1p using a panel of 12 octapeptides revealed distinct differences in their tolerance for amino acid substitutions at positions 3, 4, 7, and 8 of parental peptides derived from the amino-terminal sequences of known N-myristoyl-proteins. This finding contrasts with our recent observation that the acyl-CoA substrate specificities of hNmt and Nmt1p are highly conserved and suggests that these differences in peptide recognition provide an opportunity to develop species-specific enzyme inhibitors.","['Rocque, W J', 'McWherter, C A', 'Wood, D C', 'Gordon, J I']","['Rocque WJ', 'McWherter CA', 'Wood DC', 'Gordon JI']","['Monsanto Corporate Research, Monsanto Company, St. Louis, Missouri 63198.']",['eng'],"['AI27179/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI30188/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Acyl Coenzyme A)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '3130-72-1 (S-tetradecanoyl-coenzyme A)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.97 (glycylpeptide N-tetradecanoyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acyl Coenzyme A/chemical synthesis', 'Acyltransferases/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*enzymology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)82159-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 May 15;268(14):9964-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutrophils express a single class of GM-CSF-R with intermediate affinity that lack IL-3 cross-reactivity. Here we demonstrate the differentiation associated changes of GM-CSF binding characteristics in three models representative of different stages of myeloid maturation. We find that high affinity GM-CSF binding is converted into intermediate affinity binding, which still cross-reacts with IL-3, beyond the stage of promyelocytes. During terminal maturation towards neutrophils, IL-3 cross-reactivity is gradually lost. We sought to determine the mechanism underlying the affinity conversion of the GM-CSF-R. Northern and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of GM-CSF-R alpha and -beta c (KH97) transcripts did not provide indications for the involvement of GM-CSF-R splice variants in the formation of the intermediate affinity GM-CSFR complex. In COS-cell transfectants with increasing amounts of beta c in the presence of a fixed number of GM-CSF-R alpha chains, the high affinity GM-CSF binding converted into intermediate affinity GM-CSF binding. These results are discussed in view of the concept that increasing expression of beta c subunits may cause alternative oligomerization of the GM-CSF-R alpha and -beta c subunits resulting in the formation of intermediate rather than high affinity GM-CSFR alpha.beta c complexes.","['Budel, L M', 'Hoogerbrugge, H', 'Pouwels, K', 'van Buitenen, C', 'Delwel, R', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Touw, I P']","['Budel LM', 'Hoogerbrugge H', 'Pouwels K', 'van Buitenen C', 'Delwel R', 'Lowenberg B', 'Touw IP']","['Dr. Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)82185-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 May 15;268(14):10154-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extracts from these tissues exhibited time-dependent inhibition of the serine proteinase thrombin. This activity was not accelerated by heparin and corresponded to a protein which formed a 67-kDa complex with 125I-thrombin. The complex was stable on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A cleaved and functionally inactive form of the protein was purified from placental tissue by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, followed by affinity chromatography on thrombin-Sepharose. Antibodies raised against the placental protein recognized the inhibitor from K562 cells and placental extract. Western blotting experiments using the antibody showed that the uncleaved inhibitor has a molecular mass of 38 kDa. Amino acid sequencing was performed on the purified protein. Sequences of peptides resulting from digestion with cyanogen bromide followed by Endoproteinase Lys-c confirmed that this is a novel inhibitor with significant homology to the serpin family.","['Coughlin, P B', 'Tetaz, T', 'Salem, H H']","['Coughlin PB', 'Tetaz T', 'Salem HH']","['Department of Medicine, Monash Medical School, Box Hill Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Serpins)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Placenta/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Serpins/*chemistry', 'Thrombin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/05 00:00,1993/05/05 00:01,['1993/05/05 00:00'],"['1993/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)98385-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 May 5;268(13):9541-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compound at the sublethal dose of 215 mg/kg (ca. 50% of the approximate LD50) induced no nephrotoxic effect strong enough to increase the blood urea level in rats. It had good in vivo antitumor efficacy against murine P388 (max. ILS: D-17872 132%, cisplatin 55%) and L1210 leukemia (max. ILS: D-17872 43%, cisplatin 38%), L5222 leukemia of the rat (max.

Apart from its cytotoxic action it was able to induce in vitro differentiation of the human HL-60 and K562 and of the murine M1-T22 cell lines, while cisplatin induced differentiation only in the HL-60 cell line.

In the first phase, a nontoxic bivalent monoclonal antibody conjugated to an enzyme is targeted to the tumor cells. In the second phase, a radionuclide-derivatized enzyme inhibitor, specific for the enzyme conjugated to the antibody, is administered. The model system selected for this study is the recombinant human enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (rhDHFR) and its high-affinity competitive inhibitor methotrexate (MTX). MTX was labeled with a radionuclide by covalent attachment of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) complexed with 111In. Using the gamma-carboxyl residue of MTX for the attachment of DTPA, binding of the inhibitor to rhDHFR was not affected. The inhibitory activities of nonderivatized MTX and DTPA-MTX were indistinguishable. Human K562 erythroleukemia cells were used to evaluate under in vitro conditions the DHFR-MTX affinity system for the delivery of 111In-labeled DTPA-MTX to pretargeted alpha-transferrin receptor antibody-rhDHFR conjugates (alpha-TFR-DHFR). The data demonstrate that the delivery of 111In is dose dependent and highly specific. Under saturating conditions, binding of 111In-DTPA-MTX to alpha-TFR-DHFR-treated cells was 14-fold higher than to cells treated with nonconjugated alpha-TFR antibody. Further experiments indicated that the low level of nonspecific binding of 111In-DTPA-MTX was comparable to that of 111In-DTPA, known for its complete extracellular distribution and rapid clearance through the kidneys. Based on the data of this study, antibody-conjugated rhDHFR and radionuclide-labeled DTPA-MTX complexes provide components for an alternative radioimmunotherapeutic approach that can be expected to result in improved tumor tissue ratios of both the targeting moiety and the radionuclide-labeled derivative as compared to current approaches.","['Hawkins, G A', 'McCabe, R P', 'Kim, C H', 'Subramanian, R', 'Bredehorst, R', 'McCullers, G A', 'Vogel, C W', 'Hanna, M G Jr', 'Pomato, N']","['Hawkins GA', 'McCabe RP', 'Kim CH', 'Subramanian R', 'Bredehorst R', 'McCullers GA', 'Vogel CW', 'Hanna MG Jr', 'Pomato N']","['Organon Teknika Biotechnology Research Institute, Rockville, Maryland 20850.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '7A314HQM0I (Pentetic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Carriers', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Immunotoxins/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Indium Radioisotopes/*administration & dosage', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Methotrexate/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pentetic Acid/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Radioimmunotherapy', 'Receptors, Transferrin/immunology', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism']",1993/05/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 May 15;53(10 Suppl):2368-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were given either a low-tryptophan diet or tryptophan-free hyperalimentation, prior to and during therapy. Their plasma, separated by pheresis, was continuously passed through a tryptophan depletion column containing the immobilized tryptophan side-chain oxidase. Up to 4 plasma volumes were passed through the column daily, 5 days per week for 2-3 weeks, and plasma tryptophan levels, both free and total, were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Pre- and postcolumn plasma samples were collected throughout the pheresis procedure. All postcolumn plasma samples had unmeasurable tryptophan levels throughout the treatment period, whereas precolumn samples were always measurable. Generally, tryptophan levels of plasma isolated from peripheral blood decreased after therapy, but rebounded by the next day. The enzyme depletion column reduces circulating plasma tryptophan levels, and its use is well tolerated by patients. However, further development of this method will require study of the effects of diet and of the duration, interval, and frequency of use of this column on therapeutic efficacy. Problems include difficulties with extended diet compliance and apparently intensive mobilization of tryptophan from body stores, which may preclude the clinical application of this enzyme depletion column.","['Ho, D H', 'Covington, W P', 'Wallerstein, R O', 'Hester, J P', 'Lin, J R', 'Brown, N S', 'Newman, R A', 'Krakoff, I H', 'Freireich, E J']","['Ho DH', 'Covington WP', 'Wallerstein RO', 'Hester JP', 'Lin JR', 'Brown NS', 'Newman RA', 'Krakoff IH', 'Freireich EJ']","['Division of Medicine, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.99.- (indolyl-3-alkane-alpha-hydroxylase)']",IM,"['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diet', 'Humans', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*therapeutic use', 'Plasmapheresis/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*therapy', 'Tryptophan/*blood']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/07357909309024849 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1993;11(3):252-7. doi: 10.3109/07357909309024849.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, a murine model of MHC-compatible BMT was used to show that delayed infusion of immunocompetent donor cells early after T cell-deficient BMT eliminated residual host cells and provided an antileukemic effect without causing lethal GVHD. AKR (H-2k) recipient mice were pre-conditioned with 9 Gy total body irradiation (LD50) and transplanted with 10(7) BM cells from MHC-matched B10.BR donors. These mice did not develop GVHD and became stable, long-term mixed (donor-host) T cell chimeras. In this model, mixed or incomplete donor T cell chimerism was associated with decreased GVL reactivity. AKR hosts that were transplanted with B10.BR bone marrow admixed with 3 x 10(7) B10.BR spleen cells (as a source of T cells) became complete donor T cell chimeras, but they developed severe and lethal GVHD. However, when the infusion of donor spleen cells was delayed until 21 days after BMT, few mice exhibited any clinical signs of GVHD, and > 95% of the mice became long-term survivors. The infused spleen cells eliminated residual host T cells by 21 days after infusion, and most chimeras were able to resist a supralethal challenge with AKR leukemia/lymphoma cells. Thus, post-transplant adoptive immunotherapy with normal mononuclear cells from the marrow donor may be an effective way to eliminate residual disease or treat leukemia relapse after BMT without causing significant GVHD.","['Johnson, B D', 'Drobyski, W R', 'Truitt, R L']","['Johnson BD', 'Drobyski WR', 'Truitt RL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['CA01534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/pathology/*surgery/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Postoperative Period', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1993 Apr;11(4):329-36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No host cells were detected by karyotype analysis in patients who were in clinical remission. NISH with a biotinylated Y-specific probe showed residual host cells in 16 of the 17 patients in clinical remission. In samples from three patients the existence of host cells was further confirmed by revealing the XY-containing cells with two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using X- and Y-specific probes on direct BM smears showed > 3% residual host cells in 50% of the samples studied at or later than 2 months post-BMT. On conventional cytogenetic preparations < 1% Y-specific cells were detected in all but two samples at > or = 2 months post-BMT. There was no difference in the proportion of host cells between patients conditioned with total body irradiation and CY and those who received busulphan and CY. The recipient's stromal or epithelial cells in the aspirates probably account for most of the host cells detected.

The beta PDGFR gene is located on mouse chromosome 18 close to the c-fms gene which codes for the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R). We previously reported that in a high percentage of myeloblastic leukemias induced by the Friend helper murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV), proviruses were integrated in the first intron of the c-fms gene leading to an enhanced expression of c-fms mRNA. Since activation by proviral insertion can act at long distance, we studied beta PDGF receptor gene expression in murine myeloblastic leukemias. This gene was found to be frequently expressed but the level of beta PDGF receptor mRNA was weak and not related to proviral activation. High affinity binding sites were expressed on myeloblastic cells and ligand binding induced cell proliferation. To determine whether beta PDGFR expression is a common feature in hematopoietic cells, we tested cell lines belonging to other hematopoietic lineages. We found that multipotent stem and mast cell lines also expressed the beta PDGF receptor gene. This suggests that PDGF, known as a mitogen for connective tissue cells, could also play a role in normal hematopoiesis.","['de Parseval, N', 'Fichelson, S', 'Mayeux, P', 'Gisselbrecht, S', 'Sola, B']","['de Parseval N', 'Fichelson S', 'Mayeux P', 'Gisselbrecht S', 'Sola B']","['ICGM, INSERM U363 Paris V, Hopital Cochin, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/physiology', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/*chemistry', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1043-4666(93)90018-Z [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(93)90018-z [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1993 Jan;5(1):8-15. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(93)90018-z.,,,,,,,,,,,['c-fms'],,,,,,

Overall concordance rate was 62.6%. The most significant differences were observed for M2 vs M4, M4 vs M5, M1 vs M2, and M2 vs M5 subtypes. In order to minimize the impact of some diagnostic deviations on the mean cytologic concordance rate, a distinction between ""major"" and ""minor"" discrepancies in the diagnostic procedures has been proposed. When the results of the single institutions were corrected by considering the ""major"" discrepancies only, a mean diagnostic agreement of 78.1% was reached.","['Castoldi, G L', 'Liso, V', 'Fenu, S', 'Vegna, M L', 'Mandelli, F']","['Castoldi GL', 'Liso V', 'Fenu S', 'Vegna ML', 'Mandelli F']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita di Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01703231 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1993 Apr;66(4):171-4. doi: 10.1007/BF01703231.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AML Cooperative Group.,165-70,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML FAB M3, APL) and acute myelomonocytic leukemia with abnormal eosinophils (AML M4Eo) are considered distinct entities with characteristic clinical, morphological, cytogenetic, and prognostic features. Promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by abnormal promyelocytes replacing normal hematopoiesis associated with a translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17 t (15; 17), severe coagulopathy, and responsiveness to all-trans retinoic acid (tretinoin). Characteristic features of AML M4Eo are a myelomonocytic marrow infiltration, eosinophils with abnormal immature granules positive for chloroacetate esterase, an inversion or translocation of chromosome 16, and an increased risk of meningeal relapses. Prognosis of both types of AML has been reported to be better than prognosis of the other entities combined. Since most of the published data were collected from heterogeneous patient populations treated with various chemotherapeutic regimens, we have analyzed treatment outcome of AML M3 and M4Eo in the AMLCG-85 study for patients younger than 60 years. For the total population of 594 patients of this study, CR rate was 68.89%, early death rate 11.60%, and no or partial remission was achieved in 19.51% of the cases. Of 40 patients with AML M3 or M3 v complete remission was attained in 62.5%. Nine patients died within 42 days after the start of antileukemic therapy (22.5%). Of these nine, four died because of infection, five because of bleeding. Relapse-free survival rate was 59% after 3 years, significantly better than the respective curve of the other FAB types combined (35% after 3 years). In AML M4Eo, 91.7% of the 24 patients reached complete remission. The early death rate was 8.3%. No case of nonresponse was seen. Relapse-free survival rate was 49% after 3 years compared with 35% for the other types combined.","['Haferlach, T', 'Gassmann, W', 'Loffler, H', 'Jurgensen, C', 'Noak, J', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Thiel, E', 'Haase, D', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Becher, R']","['Haferlach T', 'Gassmann W', 'Loffler H', 'Jurgensen C', 'Noak J', 'Ludwig WD', 'Thiel E', 'Haase D', 'Fonatsch C', 'Becher R', 'et al.']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Cause of Death', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01703230 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1993 Apr;66(4):165-70. doi: 10.1007/BF01703230.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these, 112 were re-analysed at least 6 months after initial presentation and were classified as 'persistent' (92/112) or 'transient' (20/112) according to whether or not the original abnormality was still present. Lymphocyte counts in most patients with persistent abnormalities were within normal limits (18/92) or slightly increased (68/92), with only six having a lymphocytosis exceeding 10.0 x 10(9)/l. With the exception of five persistent LGL expansions in which the granular lymphocytes did not express NKa determinants (designated LGL+NKa-), the remaining 87 cases could be phenotypically grouped according to their primary abnormality as CD8+NKa+ (n = 33), CD4+ NKa+ (n = 14), CD8dim+NKa+ (n = 7) or CD8-NKa+ (n = 33). TCR genotypic studies in 58 patients showed that the 16 patients with rearranged TCR components were restricted to the CD8+NKa+ group and that, in most of these, the CD8+ fraction showed abnormal relative CD16/CD56 expression. Persistent neutropenia (n = 15) also appeared to be associated with primary abnormalities of CD8+NKa+ cells (12/15), with 10 of these additionally showing rearranged TCR genes. In contrast, persistently increased CD8dim+NKa+ and CD8-NKa+ components did not appear to phenotypically differ from their corresponding 'counterparts' in normal bloods or in patients with transient LGL/NKa+ abnormalities. This survey has therefore established that persistent LGL/NKa+ abnormalities are considerably more common than suggested in published work, that a high proportion of patients with expanded CD8+NKa+ components, with quite diverse clinical histories, show evidence of clonal lymphoid populations, and that the clonal nature of such disorders appears to be associated with abnormal NKa phenotypic patterns.","['Scott, C S', 'Richards, S J', 'Sivakumaran, M', 'Short, M', 'Child, J A', 'Hunt, K M', 'McEvoy, M', 'Steed, A J', 'Balfour, I C', 'Parapia, L A']","['Scott CS', 'Richards SJ', 'Sivakumaran M', 'Short M', 'Child JA', 'Hunt KM', 'McEvoy M', 'Steed AJ', 'Balfour IC', 'Parapia LA', 'et al.']","['Yorkshire Leukaemia Diagnostic Unit, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*pathology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/*blood/genetics', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Time Factors']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04678.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Mar;83(3):505-15. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04678.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using either locus-specific minisatellite probes separately or in combination with a Y specific probe for sex-mismatched transplants, complete haematological chimaerism, autologous reconstitution, or mixed chimaeric states have been defined immediately post-BMT. We have also been able to identify emerging autologous cells or relapse prior to morphological diagnosis. Forty-two children, mean age 6.4 years (range 9 months to 15 years), received an allogeneic BMT for: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), n = 17; acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), n = 5; biphenotypic leukaemia, n = 1; myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), n = 5; chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL), n = 1; severe aplastic anaemia (SAA), n = 7; familial erythrophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FEL), n = 2; beta thalassaemia major (beta thal), n = 1; and juvenile chronic myeloid leukaemia (JCML), n = 3. Immediately post-transplant, 78% had achieved complete haematological chimaerism, 12% had failed to engraft (DNA analysis confirmed autologous reconstitution) and 10% had mixed chimaerism. SAA was the underlying disease in two of the chimaeric cases, the third case having had a matched unrelated donor (MUD) BMT for MDS.

However, once remission has been established, quality of life and even survival may be threatened by exacerbation of viral infections in the prolonged period of continuation therapy necessary to prevent relapse. Often the viruses involved in the most severe infections are from the herpesvirus and paramyxovirus groups, suggesting that patients suffer from a defect in the cellular immunity thought essential to control such cell-associated infections. This may result from a T cell defect and, in this study, T cell responsiveness of patients under therapy for leukaemia has been investigated. In vitro proliferative responses of peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL) to the T cell mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were impaired in children with ALL before treatment and in the induction of remission. Impairment was attributable to reduced T cell numbers, the presence of inhibitors in the patient's serum and direct damage to lymphocytes. On achieving remission, proliferative responses to PHA of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets quickly returned to normal levels with the switch to continuation chemotherapy. Proliferative responses to Herpes simplex virus antigens were also apparently normal in the majority of patients tested in remission. Further investigations, however, have suggested a persisting defect in CD8+ lymphocyte function. Gamma interferon secretion by PHA-stimulated PBLs was severely reduced for children with ALL in remission when compared with control children of similar age. Further, cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to allogeneic cells could only be induced in PBL isolated from two of 13 children in remission from ALL whilst all control children of similar age and adults produced anti-allogeneic responses.","['Nash, K A', 'Mohammed, G', 'Nandapalan, N', 'Kernahan, J', 'Scott, R', 'Craft, A W', 'Toms, G L']","['Nash KA', 'Mohammed G', 'Nandapalan N', 'Kernahan J', 'Scott R', 'Craft AW', 'Toms GL']","['Department of Child Heath, University and Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*immunology', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04666.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Mar;83(3):419-27. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04666.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the detection of MRD at this time may have little value in the prediction of future relapse. However, at the end of treatment, children who remain in complete remission have no evidence of MRD. Conversely, detectable MRD at this time would seem to predict for future relapse, though this can be a delayed event. Remarkably, in two children who suffered a bone marrow relapse 8.5 and 9 years after completing therapy for their initial disease, MRD was detected, in their end of initial treatment marrow samples. Clearly PCR technology is changing the definition of the remission state in childhood ALL, and may have predictive value in the assessment of children who are at a high risk of future relapse. Large prospective studies of molecular monitoring are now required to confirm these preliminary results.","['Potter, M N', 'Steward, C G', 'Oakhill, A']","['Potter MN', 'Steward CG', 'Oakhill A']","['Department of Haematology-Oncology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Bristol.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Infant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04665.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Mar;83(3):412-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04665.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of patients with previously untreated chronic phase Ph-positive CML, enrolled from 1984 to 1990 into two consecutive IFN trials at our institution. Of a total of 71 patients, 62 (87%) were evaluable for cytogenetic response. No cytogenetic improvement was seen in 16 patients (23%), 28 patients (38%) had a decrease in Ph-positive bone marrow metaphases to levels ranging from 35% to 95%, and nine patients (13%) to levels between 5% and 34%. In nine patients (13%), Ph-positive metaphases were no longer detectable. After a median follow-up period of 33 months, the projected 5-year survival is 55% for the 62 patients evaluable for cytogenetic response. In this patient population there was no significant difference in the survival probability according to patients' risk status as defined by the Sokal score. Categorization according to the extent of Ph reduction, however, allowed three groups with significantly different prognoses to be identified. Patients achieving a Ph reduction to less than 35% were found to constitute a low risk group with a median survival not yet known and a projected 5-year survival of 90%. The 5-year survival rate was 55% for patients with a Ph reduction to levels between 35% and 95%, and less than 10% for those without any cytogenetic improvement. Thus, this study demonstrates that cytogenetic improvement on IFN treatment is an important prognostic factor for survival.","['Kloke, O', 'Niederle, N', 'Qiu, J Y', 'Wandl, U', 'Moritz, T', 'Nagel-Hiemke, M', 'Hawig, I', 'Opalka, B', 'Seeber, S', 'Becher, R']","['Kloke O', 'Niederle N', 'Qiu JY', 'Wandl U', 'Moritz T', 'Nagel-Hiemke M', 'Hawig I', 'Opalka B', 'Seeber S', 'Becher R']","['Department of Internal Medicine (Cancer Research), West German Cancer Centre Essen, University of Essen Medical School.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04663.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Mar;83(3):399-403. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb04663.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although structurally-related to mitomycin C, EO9 exhibits a distinct preclinical antitumour profile and there are also differences in its biochemical activation. In this study, EO9 was found to demonstrate preferential cytotoxicity against solid tumours in vitro as compared to leukaemia cell lines both in the Corbett two-tumour assay and in the disease-oriented human tumour cell line panel of the U.S. National Cancer Institute. In the latter system activity was particularly apparent in colon, melanoma and central nervous system lines, together with some renal and non-small cell lung lines. Preferential cytotoxicity towards hypoxic versus aerobic EMT6 mouse mammary tumour cells was observed. In vivo, EO9 was inactive against the P388 murine leukaemia, while exerting significant antiproliferative effects against several murine and human solid tumours, including the generally resistant MAC mouse colon tumours and gastric, ovarian and breast xenografts. These results confirmed in vitro observations of preferential solid tumour activity. In animal toxicology studies, EO9 induced vascular congestion in the gastrointestinal tract, but no significant bone marrow toxicity. The LD10 value of EO9 after a single intravenous injection into mice was 9 mg/kg (27 mg/m2). A dose of one-tenth of the mouse equivalent LD10 (2.7 mg/m2), the recommended starting dose for clinical phase I studies, was found to be safe in rats. Considering its distinct mechanism of bioactivation as compared to mitomycin C, its preferential solid tumour activity, its excellent activity against hypoxic cells, and lack of significant bone marrow toxicity in animals studies, EO9 has been selected for clinical evaluation within the framework of the EORTC.","['Hendriks, H R', 'Pizao, P E', 'Berger, D P', 'Kooistra, K L', 'Bibby, M C', 'Boven, E', 'Dreef-van der Meulen, H C', 'Henrar, R E', 'Fiebig, H H', 'Double, J A']","['Hendriks HR', 'Pizao PE', 'Berger DP', 'Kooistra KL', 'Bibby MC', 'Boven E', 'Dreef-van der Meulen HC', 'Henrar RE', 'Fiebig HH', 'Double JA', 'et al.']","['EORTC New Drug Development Office, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Indolequinones)', '0 (Indoles)', 'H464ZO600O (apaziquone)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Aziridines/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Indolequinones', 'Indoles/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(05)80434-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(05)80434-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1993;29A(6):897-906. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(05)80434-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the identity of the isoform of PGH synthase that is induced under these conditions has not been established. Northern and Western analyses revealed a dramatic increase in levels of PGH synthase-1 mRNA and protein levels within 24 hr after treatment of THP-1 cells with phorbol ester. No significant increase in PGH synthase-2 mRNA or protein was observed. The increases in PGH synthase-1 were accompanied by enhanced capacity of the cells to produce PGE2.

Three cases of septic arthritis caused by Candida species are reported, and the literature is reviewed. The first patient developed a popliteal cyst infected by Candida albicans after multiple intravenous antibiotic treatments. The second patient had acute myelogenous leukemia and experienced knee arthritis after chemotherapy, and the third suffered oligoarthritis after a second heart transplantation. All patients received treatment with a standard dose of intravenous amphotericin B. Responses were achieved only in the first two cases; the third patient died despite therapy. Thirty-six previously reported Candida arthritis cases are reviewed, and epidemiologic, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic features are analyzed. Cases are divided into two categories: direct inoculation of fungus and hematogenously disseminated disease; these two categories are compared in terms of sex, age, pathogen species, treatment, and survival.

Total cellular RNA obtained from archival bone marrow aspirate smears of 23 leukemia patients, which had been stored for periods of time from 1 day to 34 mo, were extracted, and 1 to 2 micrograms of each were subjected to RT-PCR using primer pairs specific for the amplification of beta-actin cDNA. Three pairs of primers for the amplification of beta-actin cDNAs of 83,260, and 540 base pairs were used to evaluate the length of mRNA that could be analyzed; the results indicate the consistent amplification of cDNA for the short- and intermediate-sized fragments as revealed by ethidium bromide fluorescence of agarose gel-resolved PCR products. To address the utility of RT-PCR analysis towards the detection of mRNA associated with specific gene alterations in such specimens, a primer pair for amplification of the E2A-PBX1 fusion cDNA was used in PCRs of RT cDNAs for each of the 23 specimens, three of which were pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias known to have the t(1;19) karyotype alteration resulting in the fusion of the E2A and PBX1 genes. Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of the products of these RT-PCR amplifications revealed the amplification of the fusion gene cDNA in only those cases for which there was cytogenetic documentation of t(1;19); these results were confirmed by the Southern filter hybridization of an internal E2A-PBX1 oligonucleotide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Akoury, D A', 'Seo, J J', 'James, C D', 'Zaki, S R']","['Akoury DA', 'Seo JJ', 'James CD', 'Zaki SR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Emory University SOM, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematology/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1993 Mar;6(2):195-200.,,,,,,,,,,,"['E2A', 'PBX1']",,,,,,

Five of the HAG derivatives (LK02 through LK06) were designed to contain an orthohydroxy group on the phenyl ring of ArCH = to increase the stability of the Schiff base formed. In addition, two compounds with a substituted quinoline [LK10; ArCH = (4-hydroxy-7-trifluoromethylquinolin-3-yl)methylene] or isoquinoline (LK11; ArCH = (5-nitroisoquinolin-1-yl)methylene] moiety were synthesized through multiple-step reactions involving reduction and/or oxidation. The IC50 values of the newly synthesized HAG Schiff bases were determined against human leukemic CCRF-CEM/0 cells in culture. The IC50 values of two previously reported HAG derivatives [ATL25; ArCH = (5-nitro-isoquinolin-1-yl)methylene] and [LW02; ArCH = 2-hydroxy-3-allyl-benzylidene)] were also determined for the first time against CCRF-CEM/0 cells. Among the compounds tested, LK11 was found to be the most potent (IC50, 2.95 +/- 0.1 microM) and the 4-methoxy-2-hydroxyphenyl derivative (LK02) to be the least potent (IC50, 121 +/- 16 microM). LK11 was about 15-fold more potent against CCRF-CEM/0 cells compared to the parent compound hydroxyguanidine sulfate (IC50, 46 +/- 7.1 microM) and was about 32 times more potent than LK10 (IC50, 97.6 +/- 0.9 microM). LK11 in combination was incubated in sequence with cytarabine (ara-C) at various molar ratios against CCRF-CEM/0 cells for 48 hr.

He was assigned to undergo autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). The conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide and whole body irradiation. Two weeks later he developed veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver. Doppler sonography confirmed the diagnosis showing a reversal of the blood flow in the portal vein. In addition a large thrombus was present in the inferior caval vein. Protein C level was strongly reduced (28%). Because of clinical deterioration intravenous urokinase was started. The transaminases normalised rapidly and the patient showed a dramatic clinical improvement. There were no major bleeding complications.

Fifty-five bone marrow samples of 27 patients in clinical remission were studied by PCR, 0.5 to 99 months (median 8 months) after BMT. The median clinical follow-up of this cohort of patients is 24 months (1-109) after BMT. BCR-ABL transcripts could be detected in 16 out of 27 patients (59%). Risk factors for minimal residual leukemia (MRD) as defined by PCR were the kind of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis (patients with T-cell-depleted grafts had a higher rate of MRD in comparison to patients treated with methotrexate/cyclosporin A) and the presence or absence of GvHD after BMT (patients without GvHD had a higher incidence of MRD than patients with GvHD). Moreover, the detection of minimal residual leukemia had prognostic significance. Out of 16 patients with minimal residual leukemia as detected by PCR, four patients relapsed clinically and two further cases relapsed cytogenetically. In contrast none of the patients lacking evidence of minimal residual leukemia relapsed. Serial PCR analysis may prove helpful in deciding about further therapeutic interventions (e.g. interferon therapy or adoptive immunotherapy) before leukaemic relapse becomes manifest after BMT.","['Arnold, R', 'Janssen, J W', 'Heinze, B', 'Bunjes, D', 'Hertenstein, B', 'Wiesneth, M', 'Kubanek, B', 'Heimpel, H', 'Bartram, C R']","['Arnold R', 'Janssen JW', 'Heinze B', 'Bunjes D', 'Hertenstein B', 'Wiesneth M', 'Kubanek B', 'Heimpel H', 'Bartram CR']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*surgery', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7(5):747-51.,,,,,,,,,,,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,

Degenerate primers deduced from the highly conserved amino acid sequences in the catalytic domain of known PTPases were used for amplification. Among 16 clones sequenced, 13 were identical to known PTPases, whereas the other three clones were disclosed to encode novel PTPases. The expression pattern of one of the three newly identified PTPases, designated as F-36-12, was further analysed. In murine tissues, the F-36-12 message was predominantly expressed in brain, kidney, and intestine, and was weakly expressed in heart and thymus. In human hematopoietic cell lines, the F-36-12 message was preferentially expressed in a promyelocytic leukemic cell line, HL60, and two factor-dependent leukemic cell lines, F-36P and F-36E, that are dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-3 and erythropoietin, respectively. The transcript was approximately 8 kb long and the message level in HL60 cells was slightly increased at 24 hours and then slowly declined when treated with dimethyl sulfoxide for granulocyte differentiation, while the message level was rapidly decreased when treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate for monocyte/macrophage differentiation. These results show that several PTPases including three novel ones are expressed in a human leukemic cell line and that the particular PTPase, F-36-12, might be involved in the differentiation process in HL60 cells.","['Honda, H', 'Shibuya, M', 'Chiba, S', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Honda H', 'Shibuya M', 'Chiba S', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*enzymology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7(5):742-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies were performed to investigate whether lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells play a role in this GVL effect. Splenocytes from WAG/Rij and BN rats were activated in vitro by recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) for 5-6 days. The cytolytic activity of these LAK cells was tested on four rat solid tumor cell lines, i.e. an ureter carcinoma, a rhabdomyosarcoma, and two lung tumors, and on leukemic cells derived from the BN rat acute myelocytic leukemia (BNML) and the WAG/Rij acute lymphocytic leukemia (L4415). The panel of target cells also included the murine cell lines P815 and YAC. Both WAG/Rij and BN LAK cells were not capable of lysing the leukemic cells in contrast to significant cytolytic activity on the rat solid tumor cell lines and P815 and YAC. BNML cells showed to be resistant to lysis by human NK cells. Phenotypical analysis of the rat LAK population revealed a decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio compared to the unstimulated splenocyte population. Rat LAK cells displayed no antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) on the leukemic cells, whereas IL-2-stimulated human peripheral blood cells showed moderate ADCC activity on the leukemic cells. To investigate whether cytokines play a role in lysis of leukemic target cells, graded numbers of LAK cells and leukemic cells were co-cultivated for seven days in an agar-based colony culture system. This resulted in moderate suppression of leukemic colony formation. From the current in vitro studies it appears that the graft-versus-leukemia observed in in vivo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation studies is probably not due to a direct leukemic cell kill by LAK cells.","['Gaiser, J F', 'Kloosterman, T C', 'Martens, A C', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Gaiser JF', 'Kloosterman TC', 'Martens AC', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Institute of Applied Radiobiology and Immunology TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Survival', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7(5):736-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chimerism was determined in nucleated cells using fluorescence in situ hybridization with a murine Y-chromosome-specific probe. We observed a rapid decline in the ability of cultured marrow cells to repopulate the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and thymus of sublethally irradiated male recipients. After 4 weeks of culture only 5% of the long-term repopulating ability of the inoculated bone marrow cells remained. The remaining long-term repopulating cells, however, had similar qualities to establish and maintain long-term engraftment compared to fresh bone marrow, as judged from their ability to give stable chimerism over a period of 6 months.

We now report that P30-35 CAMAL is inhibitory to colony formation by murine progenitor cells in vitro. Colonies from P30-35 CAMAL-treated cultures of murine bone marrow cells were reduced in number and in size, an effect similar to that seen in cultures of human cells. As in assays using human cells, murine CFU-G appeared to be preferentially targeted by the inhibitory activity of P30-35 CAMAL. In addition, day 10 spleen colony formation was inhibited by P30-35 CAMAL in an ex vivo assay.

Doses of IL-3 ranging from 60 micrograms/m2 during weeks 1-6 to 125 micrograms/m2 during weeks 7-12 were administered as subcutaneous bolus injections three times per week for 12 weeks. Platelet counts increased in six patients. Platelet increase correlated with stable or decreased serum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels, while an increase of TNF-alpha levels during IL-3 therapy occurred in patients with no change or a decrease of platelet counts. Leukocyte counts increased in two patients and reticulocytes in three, without an effect on hemoglobin levels. Morphological analysis of the bone marrow revealed an expansion of the myeloid compartment in seven of eight evaluable patients, mainly due to stimulation of the precursor cells. No improvement of the in vitro growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells was observed. Sequential cytogenetic analyses indicate that IL-3 treatment does not act preferentially on either the cytogenetically abnormal or the normal clones. These results suggest that long-term treatment with low-dose IL-3 stimulates megakaryopoiesis with increase of platelet counts, but that additional later-acting cytokines probably will be required to augment neutrophil and erythrocyte counts.","['Ganser, A', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Seipelt, G', 'Lindemann, A', 'Hess, U', 'Geissler, G', 'Maurer, A', 'Frisch, J', 'Schulz, G', 'Mertelsmann, R']","['Ganser A', 'Ottmann OG', 'Seipelt G', 'Lindemann A', 'Hess U', 'Geissler G', 'Maurer A', 'Frisch J', 'Schulz G', 'Mertelsmann R', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time Factors']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7(5):696-701.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Double labeling of the cells with myeloperoxidase and lymphoid markers demonstrated that individual blasts in all the five T+ AML tested were simultaneously expressing myeloperoxidase activity and CD7; however, most blasts in the three B+ AML studied expressed either myeloperoxidase activity or CD10, but not both. In eight of the nine T+ AML tested, the T-cell antigen-positive leukemic blasts were significantly decreased to less than 10%, after in vitro culture with the differentiation-inducing agent phorbol ester.

The use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of these genetic rearrangements may offer advantages over cytogenetic techniques which are often unsatisfactory in patients with ALL and, furthermore, provide a useful tool for monitoring of residual disease. However, it has not yet been evaluated whether the employment of PCR at the time of diagnosis improves the detection rate of these clinically relevant genetic anomalies. We have developed a multiprimer-PCR protocol which facilitates the detection of each of the four chimeric E2A/PBX1 and BCR/ABL mRNAs in a single reaction. This protocol was used for the evaluation of bone-marrow or blood samples from 251 children with ALL in whom cytogenetic analyses had been performed. Of the 251 patients, 221 had a B-cell precursor immunophenotype. In this group, 21 patients (9.5%) carrying the E2A/PBX1 rearrangement and three patients (1.4%) with BCR/ABL transcripts were detected by PCR. Twelve of these cases had escaped the detection by conventional cytogenetic analysis. In two of 12 patients with a typical t(1;19)(q23;p13), no E2A/PBX1 transcripts were identified by PCR, thus suggesting the presence of different molecular rearrangements. Residual leukemic cells were detected by PCR in five of eight patients who were followed during complete clinical remission. The frontline use of PCR has an important impact on the timely diagnosis, therapeutic decisions, and monitoring of high-risk patients with B-cell precursor leukemia who carry the E2A/PBX1 or BCR/ABL fusion genes.","['Izraeli, S', 'Janssen, J W', 'Haas, O A', 'Harbott, J', 'Brok-Simoni, F', 'Walther, J U', 'Kovar, H', 'Henn, T', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Reiter, A']","['Izraeli S', 'Janssen JW', 'Haas OA', 'Harbott J', 'Brok-Simoni F', 'Walther JU', 'Kovar H', 'Henn T', 'Ludwig WD', 'Reiter A', 'et al.']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7(5):671-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method has been applied in studies on leukemic HL-60 and MOLT-4 cell lines to reveal whether it is specific to apoptotic cells, and whether it can be used in the clinic to detect DNA breakage in leukemic cells during chemotherapy. There was labeling of mononuclear cells in peripheral blood of all 11 patients studied during chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic, acute myelogenous, or chronic myelogenous leukemia (ALL, AML, or CML) in blastic crisis, indicating induced DNA damage; the number of labeled cells increased from 1-8% before treatment up to 80% during the course of treatment. The DNA topoisomerase inhibitors mitoxantrone, VP-16 (etoposide), and m-AMSA (amsacrine) were more effective in inducing DNA breaks than was hydroxyurea or cytosine arabinoside (AraC). Cells with DNA breaks were identified in peripheral blood for up to 5 days following administration of Mitoxantrone and VP-16. In the case of DNA aneuploid leukemias, the DNA breaks were predominant in the aneuploid cell subpopulations, whereas presumably non-neoplastic diploid cells were unlabeled. In one case of ALL there were two distinct subpopulations of aneuploid cells: one responded to the treatment (by DNA breakage) and the other was non-responding. Thus, cells undergoing apoptosis can be detected by this method of labeling DNA strand breaks and the technique is applicable for analysis of response of leukemic cells to chemotherapy. With this method it may be possible to identify tumor cell sensitivity or resistance to particular drugs early in the course of treatment.","['Gorczyca, W', 'Bigman, K', 'Mittelman, A', 'Ahmed, T', 'Gong, J', 'Melamed, M R', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Gorczyca W', 'Bigman K', 'Mittelman A', 'Ahmed T', 'Gong J', 'Melamed MR', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10523.']",['eng'],['R01 CA28074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Alkenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Pyrones)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'ZO1648L551 (fostriecin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkenes/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyenes', 'Pyrones', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 May;7(5):659-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DIC, however, was quickly arrested by administration of heparin and there was no exacerbation. Also, on admission her peripheral blood leukocyte count was 700/ul, but after oral administration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (45 mg/m/day) was begun on February 22, this count gradually increased and peaked at 35,200/ul on March 7. Some of these matured leukocytes revealed dysplastic features; some had Auer bodies. At this time cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells showed 46XX, t (15;17). The leukocyte count gradually decreased to 1,500/ul, and the dysplastic features disappeared. On March 21 her thrombocytes and reticulocytes began to increase, and she achieved complete remission when her abnormal karyotype disappeared on March 24. She suffered no severe complications such as infection or hemorrhage during treatment. We therefore suggest that ATRA is very effective for APL in elderly patients.

RNase protection assays reveal that three rat tumor cell lines--RBL-1 basophilic leukemia cells, RM-SV1 macrophages, and CRNK-16 NK cells--all coordinately express multiple and probably identical rtFc gamma RIII-related transcripts in similar relative proportions but at significantly different levels. These results indicate that no single isoform predominates in these cell types but that the overall level of rtFc gamma RIII-related transcripts is differentially regulated. Two of the rtFc gamma RIII isoforms found to have extensive amino acid sequence differences in their second extracellular (EC2) domains are shown to bind rat and mouse IgG subclasses differently. This result suggests that the receptor isoform diversity in this species may function as a mechanism for extending the IgG-binding capacity of rat leukocytes. Cloned cDNA for the rat CD3 zeta protein was also isolated in this study and its ability to augment surface expression of class III Fc gamma R was tested by rosetting of cDNA-transfected COS cells. Like the structurally homologous mouse CD3 zeta, rat CD3 zeta fails to promote surface expression of Fc gamma RIII, sharply contrasting the efficient receptor expression produced by human CD3 zeta. Variations in the transmembrane amino acid sequences correlate with the divergent capacities of these CD3 zeta molecules to augment receptor expression. The high levels of CD3 zeta message expressed in rat NK cells may indicate that other unidentified hetero-subunits are required for assembly of rat CD3 zeta into functional CD16 receptors.","['Farber, D L', 'Giorda, R', 'Nettleton, M Y', 'Trucco, M', 'Kochan, J P', 'Sears, D W']","['Farber DL', 'Giorda R', 'Nettleton MY', 'Trucco M', 'Kochan JP', 'Sears DW']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of California, Santa Barbara 93106.']",['eng'],"['AI 23963/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44977/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S07 RR0799-24/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CD3 Complex/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgG/classification/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rosette Formation', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 May 15;150(10):4364-75.,"['GENBANK/L08446', 'GENBANK/L08447']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up-regulation of polyamine uptake was evaluated following a 48-hr treatment with a combination of biosynthetic enzyme inhibitors to deplete intracellular polyamine pools. The latter declined gradually over 48 hr and was accompanied by a steady increase in spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPM) transport as indicated by rises in Vmax to levels approximately 4.5 times higher than control values. Restoration of individual polyamine pools during a 6-hr period following inhibitor treatment revealed that SPD and SPM uptake could not be selectively affected by specific pool changes. The effectiveness of individual polyamines in reversing inhibitor-induced stimulation of uptake was as follows: putrescine < SPD < SPM = the SPM analog, N1, N12-bis(ethyl)spermine (BESPM). In contrast to stimulation of transport, down-regulation by exogenous polyamines or analogs occurred rapidly and in response to subtle increases in intracellular pools. Following a 1-hr exposure to 10 microM BESPM, Vmax values for SPD and SPM fell by 70%, whereas the analog pool increased to only 400-500 pmol/10(6) cells--about 15-20% of the total polyamine pool (approximately 2.8 nmol/10(6) cells). SPM produced nearly identical regulatory effects on transport kinetics. Both BESPM and SPM were even more effective at down-regulating transport that had been previously stimulated four to fivefold by polyamine depletion achieved with enzyme inhibitors. A dose response with BESPM at 48 hr revealed a biphasic effect on uptake whereby concentrations of analog < 3 microM produced an increase in SPD and SPM Vmax values, whereas concentrations 3 microM and higher produced a marked suppression of these values. Cells treated with 3 microM BESPM for 2 hr and placed in analog-free medium recovered transport capability in only 3 hr. Thus, whereas stimulation of polyamine transport is a relatively insensitive and slowly responsive process that tends to parallel polyamine depletion, down-regulation of polyamine transport by exogenous polyamines and analogs and its reversal are rapidly responsive events that correlate with relatively small (i.e., 15-20%) changes in intracellular polyamine pools.","['Kramer, D L', 'Miller, J T', 'Bergeron, R J', 'Khomutov, R', 'Khomutov, A', 'Porter, C W']","['Kramer DL', 'Miller JT', 'Bergeron RJ', 'Khomutov R', 'Khomutov A', 'Porter CW']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263-0001.']",['eng'],"['CA-16506/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '61345-84-4 (N(1), N(12)-diethylspermine)', ""84981-49-7 (S-(5'-deoxyadenosyl-5')-S-methylthioethylhydroxylamine)"", '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Polyamines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Spermine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041550222 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1993 May;155(2):399-407. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041550222.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that disruption of MFs with cytochalasin D (CD) induced beta-actin gene transcription, resulting in elevated levels of beta-actin mRNA and protein synthesis. CD also inhibited cell growth by arresting progression through the S phase of the cell cycle. These CD-induced responses were reversible since recovering cells progressed through the G2 phase and resumed normal growth while beta-actin mRNA and protein synthesis rapidly returned to control levels. In the present study, we show that the response of beta- and gamma-actin genes is due to the synthesis of a protein(s) acting at a 5' regulatory element that may be independent of or require sequences in addition to the serum response element (SRE). CD induces beta- and gamma-actin mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximum of 20-fold over control mRNA levels at 30 microM. beta- and gamma-Actin gene expression was also induced 5-fold by serum stimulation of quiescent murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, while combined treatment with serum and CD had an additive effect. Two protein synthesis inhibitors, cycloheximide and puromycin, blocked the CD-induced increase in beta-actin mRNA, in contrast to the serum-induced increase which is insensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis. The rapid return of beta-actin mRNA to basal levels following CD removal did not require protein synthesis nor did it require progression through the G2 phase of the cell cycle. A vector containing the 5' end of the beta-actin gene linked to a CAT reporter responded to CD when transfected into MEL cells, localizing the responsive element to the 5' portion of the beta-actin gene. By contrast, a minimal 99-bp actin promoter-CAT construct containing a functional SRE did not respond to CD.","['Sympson, C J', 'Singleton, D', 'Geoghegan, T E']","['Sympson CJ', 'Singleton D', 'Geoghegan TE']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Kentucky 40292.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)']",IM,"['Actins/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cytochalasin D/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'S Phase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(83)71080-3 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1993.1080 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1993 Apr;205(2):225-31. doi: 10.1006/excr.1993.1080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An i.v. ATRA formulation, which can be achieved by encapsulating ATRA into liposomes, may have the potential to overcome these unwanted effects. We investigated the ability of liposomal ATRA (L-ATRA) to induce differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cell lines (HL-60, KG-1, and THP-1). Cellular differentiation, as assessed by morphological criteria and by the expression of a mature myeloid cell surface antigen (CD11b on HL-60 and KG-1 cells), was induced by culture in the presence of L-ATRA. The ability of L-ATRA-treated HL-60 cells to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium demonstrated that they were functionally differentiated cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed significant growth inhibition of the cells after L-ATRA treatment. Following culture with L-ATRA, cells from five patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were found to be morphologically and immunophenotypically mature myeloid cells. L-ATRA was as effective as free ATRA in inducing differentiation of the cell lines and of the cells from patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.

Since the 1960s it has been known that some leukemic cells are deficient in asparagine synthetase and therefore cannot manufacture sufficient quantities of this essential amino acid to maintain cell viability. L-asparaginase is predominantly useful in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) although responses have been noted in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, and rarely other tumors. L-asparaginase has been used in conjunction with methotrexate and ara-C in combination programs in leukemia. The major side-effect limiting the usefulness of L-asparaginase is allergic reactions. In addition, it is probable that neutralizing antibodies develop which shorten the half life of the drug so that the goal of depletion of plasma levels of asparagine cannot be attained or maintained. Polyethylene glycol (M.W. 5000) can be conjugated to L-asparaginase at sites not involving the active site of the enzyme. This enables free access of a small molecule, asparagine, to the active site of the enzyme but prevents uptake by the reticuloendothelial system, greatly decreasing the probability of developing antibodies against the asparaginase and prolongs the circulating half life of the drug. In a phase I/II study conducted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 37 heavily pretreated patients with refractory hematologic malignancy were treated. The age range from 15 to 73 years, median 49 years. Nineteen patients had ALL, 15 lymphoma, two myeloma, and one Hodgkin's disease. The dose levels of PEG L-asparaginase varied from 250 IU/m2 up to 8000 IU/m2. The pharmacokinetic profile demonstrated a monophasic half life consistent with a one compartment model with a single elimination phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Keating, M J', 'Holmes, R', 'Lerner, S', 'Ho, D H']","['Keating MJ', 'Holmes R', 'Lerner S', 'Ho DH']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyethylene Glycols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309149129 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;10 Suppl:153-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199309149129.,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro incubations of freshly isolated leukemia cells from patients with chronic (n = 7) or acute (n = 5) leukemias with F-ara-A, increased the rate of ara-CTP accumulation by a median of 1.5 or 1.7-fold, respectively, when subsequently incubated with ara-C. The objective of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that ara-C can be biochemically modulated during therapy of leukemias. To test the biochemical modulation of ara-C in the clinical setting, we designed two protocols to administer fludarabine (clinical formulation of F-ara-A) and ara-C in a pharmacologically directed sequence for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) refractory to conventional fludarabine therapy or for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in relapse. Comparison of ara-CTP pharmacokinetics demonstrated a significant increase in the area under concentration curve (AUC) of ara-CTP both in CLL (median 1.5-fold) and AML cells (median 1.8-fold) after fludarabine infusion. Analyses of different processes involved in the metabolism of ara-CTP indicated that the increase in AUC was due to potentiation of the rate of ara-CTP accumulation. These studies demonstrate that protocols designed on biochemical and pharmacological rationales modulate ara-C metabolism during therapies.","['Gandhi, V', 'Estey, E', 'Keating, M J', 'Plunkett, W']","['Gandhi V', 'Estey E', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.

Human IgE binds with exquisite species specificity to the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) expressed on the surface of these cells. In rodents this receptor has been characterized as a tetrameric plasma membrane protein composed of an IgE-binding alpha chain, a beta chain and two disulfide-linked gamma chains. In order to establish a cell line expressing the alpha chain of human Fc epsilon RI which can be triggered with IgE from human patients and specific allergen, we transfected the cDNA coding for the human alpha subunit into rat basophilic leukemia cells. The resulting transfectants express the human alpha chain on the cell surface in the form of a hybrid complex associated with endogenous rat gamma chains. After sensitization with human IgE from mite-specific patients, the transfectant produces a calcium response upon incubation with allergen. The established cell line can be used as a model system to study the mechanism of mast cell triggering through IgE from allergic patients.","['Taudou, G', 'Varin-Blank, N', 'Jouin, H', 'Marchand, F', 'Weyer, A', 'Blank, U']","['Taudou G', 'Varin-Blank N', 'Jouin H', 'Marchand F', 'Weyer A', 'Blank U']","[""Unite d'Immuno-Allergie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, Dermatophagoides)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Allergens/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Dermatophagoides', 'Basophils/*physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mites/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000236436 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 1993;100(4):344-50. doi: 10.1159/000236436.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of these findings and the distinct clinical features of infant leukemia, we investigated 30 cases of infant ALL for molecular defects of 11q23. Fourteen cases had cytogenetic abnormalities of 11q23, and all of them showed 11q23 rearrangements at the molecular level. An additional seven cases also had 11q23 molecular rearrangements, including one with normal cytogenetic analysis. Molecular abnormalities of 11q23 were significantly correlated with adverse prognostic factors, including age under 6 months, hyperleukocytosis, CD10- phenotype, and early treatment failure. Molecular analysis identified a group of infants with germline 11q23 that had a very good treatment outcome with a projected event-free survival of 80% at median follow-up of 46 months compared to 15% in infants with rearranged 11q23 (P < .001). These findings suggest that a high proportion (70%) of infants with ALL have 11q23 rearrangements and that these rearrangements are not always detectable by cytogenetic analysis.

It is shown that M1 mycer cells, like M1, undergo terminal differentiation coupled to growth arrest and programmed cell death (apoptosis) after treatment with the physiologic differentiation inducer interleukin-6. However, when beta-estradiol is included in the culture medium, M1 mycer cells respond to differentiation inducers like M1 myc cell lines, where the differentiation program is blocked at an intermediate stage. By manipulating the function of the mycer transgene product, it is shown that there is a 10-hour window during myeloid differentiation, from 30 to 40 hours after the addition of the differentiation inducer, when the terminal differentiation program switches from being dependent on c-myc suppression to becoming c-myc suppression independent, where activation of c-myc has no apparent effect on mature macrophages.

We hypothesize that pulmonary macrophages (PM), which are increased substantially in the lungs of smokers, might suppress TIL function. The addition of PM into the TIL cytotoxicity assay produced a concentration-dependent suppression of TIL cytotoxicity with up to 71% inhibition of autologous tumor killing at the 1:1 PM:TIL ratio. Inhibition was not target-specific, as killing of NK-sensitive (K562), NK-resistant (M14), and autologous tumor targets were equally suppressed. Nor was inhibition specific for lung TIL, as similar inhibition was observed with melanoma and renal TIL. Using a model system, we demonstrated that both CD3+ antigen-specific and CD56+ nonspecific lymphocytes are susceptible to the suppressive effects of the PM. Direct co-incubation of PM and TIL for 4 to 44 h resulted in progressive suppression of TIL proliferation and cytotoxicity. TIL cytotoxicity remained suppressed even if PM were removed from the co-culture after 24 h, but was restored if the separated TIL were re-incubated in interleukin-2. These results suggest that PM may locally regulate the proliferative and cytotoxic function of adoptively transferred TIL.","['Swisher, S G', 'Kiertscher, S M', 'Golub, S H', 'Holmes, E C', 'Roth, M D']","['Swisher SG', 'Kiertscher SM', 'Golub SH', 'Holmes EC', 'Roth MD']","['Division of Surgical Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],"['CA 09010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 07014/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DA03018/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Cell Communication', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/cytology/*immunology', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1165/ajrcmb/8.5.486 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 1993 May;8(5):486-92. doi: 10.1165/ajrcmb/8.5.486.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Persistent cryptosporidiosis was established in all retrovirus immunosuppressed mice, while control mice were refractory to infection. Parasite colonization of intestinal villi was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in immunosuppressed animals that received dietary supplemental pooled bovine colostrum compared with to those that did not receive colostrum treatment. Similarly, shedding of oocysts in the feces of immunosuppressed animals that received dietary pooled bovine colostrum was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced compared with those that did not at 26 days post-parasite challenge. Since the nonimmune bovine colostrum contained no anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies, this suggests that passively transferred antibodies alone are unlikely to have provided the improved resistance shown in this study.","['Watzl, B', 'Huang, D S', 'Alak, J', 'Darban, H', 'Jenkins, E M', 'Watson, R R']","['Watzl B', 'Huang DS', 'Alak J', 'Darban H', 'Jenkins EM', 'Watson RR']","['Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson.']",['eng'],"['3-G12RR03059-0451 NIH/RCMI/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '5G12RR03059-04-NIH/RCMI/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'AA-08037/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Trop Med Hyg,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,0370507,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Colostrum/*immunology', 'Cryptosporidiosis/complications/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Cryptosporidium parvum/*immunology', 'Feces/parasitology', 'Female', 'Intestinal Mucosa/parasitology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microvilli/parasitology', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/*immunology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.4269/ajtmh.1993.48.519 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1993 Apr;48(4):519-23. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.1993.48.519.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key findings are summarized with notation of the methodological challenges with which investigators must content. Although exposure is ubiquitous, long-term average EMF is influenced primarily by the background levels in homes, use of selected electric appliances such as electric blankets, and workplace exposures to energized equipment. Studies of residential exposure have focused on childhood cancer, starting with the report of an excess of wire configurations associated with elevated magnetic fields near the homes of children who developed cancer compared to healthy children. Several subsequent studies have tended to confirm that association, although the evidence falls short of demonstrating a causal association between magnetic fields and cancer. Exposures from electric appliances have been less extensively pursued, with some suggestions of an association with childhood cancer. A more extensive literature has evaluated the association between workplace exposure to EMF, based on job titles of ""electrical workers"" and cancer. Across many different study designs and settings, certain groups of electrical workers show elevated occurrence of leukemia and brain cancer. The consistency of findings is notable, but the key question is whether the association with job title is due to EMF or some other agent in the workplace. Future research would benefit from specification of testable challenges to a causal association between EMF exposure in the home or workplace and cancer, along with continued efforts to improve our understanding and measurement of EMF exposure.","['Savitz, D A']",['Savitz DA'],"['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am Ind Hyg Assoc J,American Industrial Hygiene Association journal,0371160,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Electric Wiring', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15298669391354559 [doi]'],ppublish,Am Ind Hyg Assoc J. 1993 Apr;54(4):197-204. doi: 10.1080/15298669391354559.,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, when it was associated with 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3, CBS-211A strongly potentiated the 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-induced inhibition of U937 cell proliferation and caused a dramatic increase in their differentiation toward monocytes/macrophages.

All clones expressing wt-max grow slowly, and the process of inducer-mediated differentiation is delayed. Furthermore, cells transfected with the mutated max exhibit growth retardation, accumulation in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and spontaneous differentiation. Our findings are consistent with a model in which a large excess of wt-Max in the cells enhances the formation of Max-Max growth-suppressor complexes, while elevated bm-Max deprives the cell of growth-promoting Myc-Max heterodimers in a dominant-negative manner, presumably by inactivating endogenous Myc and Max.","['Cogliati, T', 'Dunn, B K', 'Bar-Ner, M', 'Cultraro, C M', 'Segal, S']","['Cogliati T', 'Dunn BK', 'Bar-Ner M', 'Cultraro CM', 'Segal S']","['NCI-Navy Medical Oncology Branch, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20889-5105.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myc associated factor X)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '137468-70-3 (Max protein, mouse)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, myc', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 May;8(5):1263-8.,,,,,,,,,,,"['c-myc', 'max']",,,,,,

These animals develop multiple types of hematopoietic tumors, which could arise either from undifferentiated cells that mature during tumor development or from progenitors committed to different lineages. To examine the BCR/ABL-sensitive target cells present in the marrow of mice treated with 5-fluorouracil, we used a single-step in vitro assay. These experiments revealed that both the P210 and P185 BCR/ABL proteins and the related v-abl protein induce lymphoid and myeloid colonies, colony types that mimic two of the prominent types of tumors found in the reconstitution model. The lymphoid colonies were similar to lymphoid colonies found following infection of normal bone marrow with respect to differentiation state and tumorigenicity. The cells in the myeloid colonies were differentiated and non-tumorigenic. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed that most of the lymphoid and myeloid colonies arose from distinct precursors and that the lymphoid colonies arose from B-lineage-committed cells.

Regarding leukemogenesis, we found that neocarzinostatin induced a variety of deletions and reciprocal translocations. Among these random chromosome abnormalities, two reciprocal translocations which were specific for certain leukemias could be observed; t(11;14)(q13;q32) and t(7;11)(p15p13). This fact suggests that a translocation carrying oncogene rearrangement may be of potential relevance to the leukemogenesis. The success in making a subgroup (FAB classification) identified a number of subtype-specific translocations in leukemias. It has been suggested that an initiation or progression-associated event is mediated through a gross chromosomal change. The molecular characterization of chromosomal rearrangement leads to the identification of genes involved in leukemia. Our recent works in molecular cytogenetics of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), FAB-M3 and -M4 were shown in this article. Since rearrangement of relevant genes were cloned, PCR made it feasible to detect minimal residual disease at 10(-6) level after intensive treatment or bone marrow transplantation for CML, Ph-positive ALL, M3 and approximately half of childhood leukemia. Recently developed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using specific probes can visualize certain chromosomes or chromosomal segments. Ph translocation, for instance, is now demonstrated as three spot-signals in interphase nuclei using YAC (yeast artificial chromosome)-BCR clone. Lastly, the use of antisense oligonucleotides for the BCR-ABL junctions should result in the inhibition of growth of CML clone. The strategy using antisense molecules may be very powerful tool in the gene-targeting therapy for human neoplasms.","['Abe, T']",['Abe T'],"['Department of Hygiene, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine.']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,['9014-02-2 (Zinostatin)'],IM,"['DNA Damage', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/etiology/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinostatin/pharmacology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1993 Mar;34(3):251-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: The English-language literature encompassing the above aspects, published between 1977 and 1992, is critically reviewed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: ILL/MCL is a disease of proliferating B lymphocytes that is characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy and frequent, often extensive, involvement of the spleen, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. The malignant cells usually express the markers CD5 and IgM with or without IgD, but not CD10, on the cell surface, and grow in one of two dominant histologic patterns: mantle zone and diffuse. The characteristic cytogenetic abnormality is a t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation, which juxtaposes the bcl-1 locus on chromosome 11 with the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14, and appears to result in dysregulated expression of the gene encoding cyclin D1. Median survival is in the range of 2 to 5 years. While responses to chemotherapy may be seen in up to half the patients, relapses are the rule, and longterm survival is uncommon. The optimal treatment remains undefined, although therapy may be deferred until there are symptoms or complications, at which time judicious administration of alkylating agents and glucocorticoids may result in effective palliation.","['Shivdasani, R A', 'Hess, J L', 'Skarin, A T', 'Pinkus, G S']","['Shivdasani RA', 'Hess JL', 'Skarin AT', 'Pinkus GS']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.4.802 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Apr;11(4):802-111. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.4.802.,,75,,['J Clin Oncol. 1994 Apr;12(4):876-7.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report three patients with AML and t(8;21) who developed granulocytic sarcomas, and review the world literature. RESULTS: Between 1980 and 1992, 53 cases of AML French-American-British (FAB) M2 were identified at our institution. Eight (15%) patients had t(8;21). Three of these eight patients (38%) developed granulocytic sarcoma. All three of our patients received conventional intensive antileukemic chemotherapy yet had short relapse-free survival durations. Several series of patients with t(8;21) report that granulocytic sarcomas occur in approximately 18% of this population, which is four times the expected incidence in AML. Thirty-seven cases have been previously reported. Although karyotype analyses were not reported in many cases of granulocytic sarcoma in the literature, the vast majority of abnormal karyotypes in patients with AML involved t(8;21). Recent work with a cell line derived from a patient with t(8;21) indicates that such cells are unusually adherent to culture bottles and are aggregable CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that this association is more common than generally recognized and may be specific. Patients with t(8;21) should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of granulocytic sarcoma. These patients may have a less favorable prognosis than other patients with t(8;21). Cooperative oncology groups should retrospectively identify patients with AML and t(8;21) who had a poor outcome to determine if they had a disproportionate incidence of granulocytic sarcoma. If so, aggressive therapy such as bone marrow transplantation may be warranted early in the therapeutic strategy.","['Tallman, M S', 'Hakimian, D', 'Shaw, J M', 'Lissner, G S', 'Russell, E J', 'Variakojis, D']","['Tallman MS', 'Hakimian D', 'Shaw JM', 'Lissner GS', 'Russell EJ', 'Variakojis D']","['Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL 60611.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Orbital Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.4.690 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Apr;11(4):690-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.4.690.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, plasmid was constructed in which human MRP-1/CD9 cDNA is expressed under the control of the Abelson murine leukemia virus promoter sequence. The expression plasmid for MRP-1/CD9 was introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells, human lung adenocarcinoma cell line MAC10 (MRP-1 positive), and human myeloma cell line ARH77 (MRP-1 negative). All of the MRP-1/CD9 (over)expressing clones obtained from these transfected cells showed suppressed cell motility (penetration and phagokinetic track assays) depending on the degree of expression of MRP-1/CD9. Overexpression of MRP-1/CD9 by MAC10 cells resulted in the suppression of cell motility (maximally 73%) associated with considerable inhibition of the cell growth (maximally 48%). However, the inhibition of the growth of MAC10 cells by mAb M31-15 was < 17% at an antibody concentration of 1-5 micrograms/ml, which inhibits cell motility by > 90%. These results suggest that MRP-1/CD9 directly regulates cell motility and may also affect cell growth. Effects on metastasis by the expression of MRP-1 CD9 were investigated with mouse melanoma BL6 cells-BALB/c nu/nu mouse system. Metastatic potential of all transformants expressing MRP-1/CD9 was lower than that of parent BL6 cells.","['Ikeyama, S', 'Koyama, M', 'Yamaoko, M', 'Sasada, R', 'Miyake, M']","['Ikeyama S', 'Koyama M', 'Yamaoko M', 'Sasada R', 'Miyake M']","['Department VI, Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (Cd9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*physiology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Movement/genetics/*physiology', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', '*Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Tetraspanin 29', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.177.5.1231 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 May 1;177(5):1231-7. doi: 10.1084/jem.177.5.1231.,,,PMC2191011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to explore the optimal conditions for the potentiating action of low pH on the cytotoxic activities of cis- and carboplatin, we have investigated the temporal aspects of drug activity and pH modulation in L1210 murine leukemia cells in comparison with various other drugs. Extra- and intra-cellular pH of L1210 cells was modulated before, during and after drug exposure and survival of L1210 cells was determined. During short exposures, cytotoxicity of cisplatin and alkylating drugs was potentiated by conditions of low pH in the ranking order of: cisplatin, mitomycin C, melphalan and chlorambucil. Low pH had no effect on the cytotoxic activity of carboplatin and cytosine arabinoside and it inhibited the action of doxorubicin. During prolonged incubation at low pH, potentiation of cisplatin was increased and a more than 3-fold potentiation was induced in the case of carboplatin. Part of the latter effect was also manifested by 20 hr post-incubation in drug-free medium at low pH after a 4-hr exposure to carboplatin. Post-incubation did not increase the stimulating effect of low pH on the cytotoxic activity of melphalan and cisplatin. Acidification affected neither the uptake nor the extracellular hydrolysis of platinum-containing drugs. Under all circumstances, potentiation of platinum-containing drugs was accompanied by an increase in platinum-induced DNA modification, as detected by immunocytochemistry.","['Atema, A', 'Buurman, K J', 'Noteboom, E', 'Smets, L A']","['Atema A', 'Buurman KJ', 'Noteboom E', 'Smets LA']","['Department of Experimental Therapy, The Netherlands Cancer Institute/Antoni van Leeuwenhoekhuis, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Carboplatin/*toxicity', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'Cytoplasm/physiology', 'DNA/chemistry', '*DNA Damage', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/22 00:00,1993/04/22 00:01,['1993/04/22 00:00'],"['1993/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910540126 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 Apr 22;54(1):166-72. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910540126.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By 2 weeks after infection, there was essentially very little growth inhibition of C. albicans by PMNs from the FLV-infected mice. However, when bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known activator of macrophages and PMNs, was added to PMNs from the FLV-infected mice, anti-C. albicans activity was restored to normal levels. This restoration of anti-C. albicans activity of FLV-infected mouse PMNs was observed after stimulation with as little as 0.01 micrograms of LPS per ml.

Recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) as well as certain combinations of inducer substances could be shown to stimulate the expression of the p55 (alpha)-chain of the IL-2R in PER-117 cells. The synergistic increases in IL-2R alpha expression were demonstrated at the cell surface as well as at the mRNA level. The results suggested that in PER-117 cells IL-1 appears to induce expression of the alpha-chain by pathways that are different to activation via protein kinase C (PKC), and that drug-induced cyclic AMP (cAMP) activation did not substitute for IL-1. We found that the regulation of mRNA for IL-2R beta (p75) differed significantly from that seen for IL-2R alpha. Moreover, the requirements for IL-2R alpha induction determined for this cell line differ from other human cell lines, which may reflect that there are distinct requirements for activation depending on the stage of differentiation and/or lineage of the cells.

In contrast, non-pulsatile, chronic treatment with supraphysiological doses of LHRH-analogues (LHRHA) results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis. It has been suggested that inhibition of spermatogenesis during exposure to cytotoxic drugs might reduce gonadal toxicity. The protective effects of LHRHA during chemotherapy or irradiation has been examined in 11 preclinical studies. In only 6 out of 11 models could protection be demonstrated. Four clinical trials have been performed using LHRHA as a gonadal protector. In none of these trials could LHRHA significantly influence severity and duration of germ cell impairment. New approaches are needed to minimize or even prevent gonadal toxicity during chemotherapy or irradiation, such as reduction of courses, alternative schedules, or new drugs.","['Kreuser, E D', 'Klingmuller, D', 'Thiel, E']","['Kreuser ED', 'Klingmuller D', 'Thiel E']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinikum Steglitz, Freie Universitat, Berlin, FRG.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Eur Urol,European urology,7512719,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Fertility/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Spermatogenesis/*drug effects/*radiation effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000474586 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Urol. 1993;23(1):157-63; discussion 163-4. doi: 10.1159/000474586.,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDS patients had slightly more immature megakaryocytes when compared with normal controls. The megakaryocytic ploidy distribution had a peak at 16N in normal controls, at 8N in the 11 of the 15 MDS patients, and at 4N in the remaining 4 patients, which is suggestive of impaired polyploidization in MDS patients. In MDS, micromegakaryocytes were shown not to be immature but much more impaired in polyploidization than non-micromegakaryocytes. However, there was no difference in the megakaryocytic ploidy pattern among the type of the modification of Feinendegen' classification in each case for both the normal controls and the MDS patients, suggesting that the megakaryocytic ploidy is probably determined at the maturation level of the megakaryoblasts or the precursor cells. The study of megakaryocytic ploidy before and after therapy in the case of refractory anemia with excess of blasts might suggest that the remission of MDS patients might be qualitatively different from that seen in acute leukemia patients. Furthermore, the DNA histogram of the megakaryocytes from one of the two MDS patients obtained by the new method, which is able to determine the amount of DNA in the immunologically identified megakaryocytes microfluorometrically, using the monoclonal anti-glycoproteins IIb/IIIa antibody on bone marrow smears, showed a shift towards small ploidy compared with those defined on the basis of WG staining. This finding indicates that the micromegakaryocytes or the megakaryoblasts which could not be identified morphologically can be identified immunologically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kobayashi, Y', 'Ozawa, M', 'Maruo, N', 'Kondo, M']","['Kobayashi Y', 'Ozawa M', 'Maruo N', 'Kondo M']","['1st Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Azure Stains)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Indoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/drug therapy/pathology', 'Azure Stains', 'Biomarkers', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology', '*Ploidies', 'Polyploidy', 'Remission Induction']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309148504 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Jan;9(1-2):55-61. doi: 10.3109/10428199309148504.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problems associated with its classification and diagnosis are discussed in this report using all currently available tools from clinical data to molecular genetics, including morphology, histology, cellular biology and cytogenetics. Three groups of patients can be identified (isolated monocytosis with a mild degree of dysplasia, severe cytopenia and the most frequent type with proliferative symptoms dominating the clinical picture). The latter group is close to atypical chronic myeloid leukaemia and perhaps these two entities should be regarded as a single one. Classification of the disease is further complicated by the possibility of evolution from one subgroup into another one and by the finding that CMML can also arise as a disorder secondary to other myeloproliferative (MPS) or myelodysplastic (MDS) syndromes. No specific marker of the disease has been identified by cytogenetics or molecular biology. Due to all these facts, we believe that CMML should perhaps be viewed more pragmatically by considering the use of prognostic factors that could at least help to define different groups of patients who may require different therapeutic strategies. We conclude that CMML is a heterogeneous syndrome with features of both MPS and MDS, encompassing primary and secondary stem cell disorders and varying widely in its clinical presentation. This heterogeneity should stimulate the search for reliable predictors of evolution which would allow a better definition of CMML subtypes based on prognostic factors.","['Michaux, J L', 'Martiat, P']","['Michaux JL', 'Martiat P']","['Department of Haematology, Cliniques Universitaires St-Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*classification/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*classification', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Prognosis']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309148501 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Jan;9(1-2):35-41. doi: 10.3109/10428199309148501.,,42,,,,,,,,,['C-FMS'],,,,,,

We studied the effect of Bryo on differentiation and growth modulation of human myeloid leukemia cell lines and freshly explanted blood cells from patients with myeloid leukemia. Alterations at the molecular level and phenotypic changes triggered by Bryo were similar, but not identical, to those induced by phorbol esters. Bryo was able to inhibit cellular proliferation as evidenced by [3H]-thymidine uptake and induced morphological changes associated with monocytic differentiation. In studies using continuous cell lines, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone was unable to prevent the Bryo-induced growth inhibition or the induced phenotypic changes. However, in fresh myeloid blood cells dexamethasone attenuated these Bryo-triggered effects. Our own data taken together with reports from the literature reviewed here suggest the following conclusions: (i) Bryo, while lacking tumor promoting activity, is able to induce differentiation in maturation arrested leukemia cells; (ii) it exhibits selective antiproliferative properties in normal or malignant hematopoietic cells and supports growth of multipotent stem cells.

In particular, 7/10 (70%) of these patients who presented CSF-TK levels above the upper limit of normal (1.4 U/microliters) had evidence of a neurological relapse, while 49/52 (94.2%) of subjects with presenting CSF-TK levels of up to 1.4 U/microliters did not develop a neurological leukemic disease (p < 0.00001). The white blood cell count at diagnosis was significantly increased, but not directly correlated to CSF-TK levels, in the group with CNS involvement, while age, serum thymidine kinase levels and lactic dehydrogenase, FAB classification or immunophenotype were not different in patients with or without neurological relapse. In conclusion, increased levels of CSF-TK at presentation correlate with a high risk of subsequent CNS involvement in patients with responsive ALL.","['Musto, P', 'Modoni, S', 'Ladogana, S', 'Salcuni, G', 'Fusilli, S', 'Carotenuto, M']","['Musto P', 'Modoni S', 'Ladogana S', 'Salcuni G', 'Fusilli S', 'Carotenuto M']","['Department of Hematology, I.R.C.C.S., Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital, S.

In order to assess the reliability of the soluble interleukin-2 receptor as a disease marker in the management of patients with hairy-cell leukemia, we investigated serum levels in 35 untreated patients and in 2 patients with the hairy-cell leukemia variant. In 21 of 35 patients soluble receptor levels were also monitored during and after recombinant interferon-alpha therapy. Clinical and hematological parameters were also assessed. Soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels were extremely high at the time of diagnosis in patients with typical hairy-cell leukemia [32,722 +/- 27,001 vs. 331 +/- 145 units/ml in controls (mean +/- SD)], but not in patients with the leukemia variant. A progressive decrease in soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels paralleled the clinical response to treatment, although normal values were never detected, even in patients who achieved an apparent complete remission. After recombinant interferon-alpha discontinuation, disease recurrence was accompanied by a progressive increase to pre-treatment soluble receptor levels. Overall, a close correlation was found between soluble interleukin-2 receptor values and total tumor burden (r = 0.84, P < 0.001).

To detect low-level or heterogenous expression of the MDR1 gene in acute leukemia, we have developed sensitive, specific and semi-quantitative protocols for measuring levels of MDR1 mRNA, based on the polymerase chain reaction. Using this assay, we screened blasts from 20 patients with untreated adult acute leukemia for evidence of MDR1 gene expression. The level of MDR1 mRNA was normalized to beta 2-microglobulin mRNA and was defined by reference to the highly resistant trimetrexate-selected leukemia cells MOLT-3/TMQ200 (1.80). MDR1 mRNA was observed in 14 out of 20 patients. Higher MDR1 mRNAs were observed in three patients with phenotypes of undifferentiated or minimally differentiated nonlymphocytic acute leukemia, as compared with other types of acute leukemia (0.98 vs. 0.25). In contrast, lower MDR1 mRNAs were found in five patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, as compared with other types of acute leukemia (0.08 vs. 0.45). These findings suggest that MDR1 gene expression is correlated with the leucocyte differentiation stage of leukemia. MDR1 gene expression may, in part, explain the responsiveness to chemotherapy in these distinct subtypes of acute leukemia.","['Miyachi, H', 'Takemura, Y', 'Yonekura, S', 'Komatsuda, M', 'Nagao, T', 'Arimori, S', 'Ando, Y']","['Miyachi H', 'Takemura Y', 'Yonekura S', 'Komatsuda M', 'Nagao T', 'Arimori S', 'Ando Y']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1993 Jan;57(1):31-7.,,,,,,,,,,,['MDR1'],,,,,,

The reproducibility of these new staging systems, our former staging systems for leukemic transformation and nonleukemic death, and that for overall survival provided by Sanz et al. (Blood 1989;74:395-408), were estimated using a total of 132 patients with RA, RARS, or RAEB (test sample). The correlation of risk ratios of the test sample from our system and that of Sanz et al. was poor (tau = 0.24; Kendall rank correlation). Our risk ratio was a significant (p = 0.0012) continuous covariate of the Cox model life-table analysis in the test sample but that of Sanz et al. was not. The new and previous staging systems for leukemic transformation were highly similar (tau = 0.7) and risk ratios of both systems were significant in the test sample (p = 0.00046 and 0.0017, respectively). Based upon the new system, patients at high risk for leukemic transformation RA or RARS were identified as males, with bone marrow myeloblasts higher than 2.5%, abnormal granules in the granulocytes, and circulating erythroblasts. Their cumulative leukemic transformation rate exceeded 50% within 2 years from presentation. The new and previous systems for nonleukemic death were moderately correlated (tau = 0.47). The risk ratios of both systems were significant in the test sample (p = 0.00012 and 0.000024, respectively) but failed to stratify test sample patients into three distinct risk groups.

The histologic characteristics of lymphomas may be discordant in patients with multiple sites of involvement. When different types of lymphomas are encountered in a single organ or tissue, they are designated as CLs in the Working Formulation of NHL. The most common CLs consist of different subsets of follicular center cell lymphomas, usually one with low-grade follicular histologic characteristics and another with diffuse architecture and/or more aggressive cytologic features. These lymphomas now are considered to represent different phases of clonal evolution rather than representing a coincidental simultaneous occurrence of two unrelated lymphomas. Whether B-cell large-cell lymphoma coexisting with another B-cell lymphoma, namely, the nodular variant of lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease, also represents clonal evolution requires further study. Composite lymphomas consisting of a B-cell lymphoma and a T-cell lymphoma are extremely rare. The histogenetic implications for a clonal relationship between component subsets in these and other equally rare combinations remain uncertain. The CLs should continue to be recognized because (1) the component morphologic subsets may have entirely different natural histories, requiring different treatment modalities although they may be clonally related; and (2) the study of such cases may provide us with information regarding the complex interrelationship of the lymphoid system and its clonal evolution.

The use of ATRA in APL is associated with two major drawbacks: (1) the risk of rapidly rising leukocyte counts, leading to the 'retinoic acid syndrome' which may be fatal if the increase in leukocytes is not reversed and (2) almost universal relapse, if no intensive chemotherapy is administered after CR achievement.

Therapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2) +/- lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells has induced clinical responses in some patients with advanced malignant lymphoma (ML) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). It is postulated that IL-2 +/- LAK cells represents a potentially non-cross-resistant therapeutic modality which might prevent or delay relapses if used as consolidative immunotherapy after ABMT, at a time of minimal residual disease. Therefore, we first studied the reconstitution of IL-2-responsive LAK precursor cells after ABMT and found them in the circulation as early as 3 weeks after ABMT. A phase Ib clinical trial was then performed which identified a tolerable IL-2 regimen which could be administered early after ABMT and which could induce immunomodulatory effects. We then initiated a clinical trial to determine the feasibility of generating and administering autologous LAK cells using this IL-2 regimen after ABMT for 16 patients with ML. The results show that IL-2+LAK therapy early after ABMT is feasible but is more toxic than IL-2 alone. Patients with AML on the phase I IL-2 trial and with ML on the IL-2+LAK protocol were evaluated for tumor status. Of 8 patients with AML in first relapse or at a later stage who underwent ABMT and received IL-2, 2 have relapsed, while 6 remain in complete remission 26+ to 40+ (median 28+) months after ABMT.

The leukemia was controlled initially with hydroxyurea prior to commencing IFN and Ara-C. The treatment was continued for at least 12 months after which time nonresponders were withdrawn from the trial and responders continued on IFN alone. The median duration of follow-up is 14 months (range 10-53 months). Hematological response was assessed by clinical and laboratory parameters and cytogenetic response was assessed by regular bone marrow chromosome analysis. A complete hematological response occurred in 28/30 patients (93%). A complete cytogenetic response (no detectable Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases) was present on at least one occasion in 9/30 (30%), a partial cytogenetic response (between 1 and 34% Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases) in 7/30 (23%) and a minor response in 4/30 (13%), giving an overall cytogenetic response rate of 67%. Significant side effects included mucositis, nausea, cytopenia and depression. Side effects could be managed by dose reduction or temporary cessation and were tolerable in most patients, but in 1 patient this led to withdrawal from the trial due to severe depression. Two patients have transformed, 1 to acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 1 to accelerated phase. Two patients have died after exiting the study, both from complications of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

Careful pharmacokinetic studies performed during drug development in conjunction with an assessment of patient characteristics, such as age, renal and hepatic function, and concomitant therapy, is essential for defining those factors that may alter drug disposition. By integrating pharmacokinetic studies with measures of efficacy and toxicity, a pharmacodynamic framework can be established for guiding therapy to minimize differences in systemic exposure among subpopulations of patients (eg, impaired renal function and neonates). In selected instances when pharmacokinetic variability cannot be predicted by patient covariates, the potential for individualizing dosages based on patient-specific pharmacokinetic parameters is now a clinically feasible option.

Mice that develop the CML-like syndrome can be segregated into two groups based on the latency with which the granulocytic disease appears--early onset (< 20 weeks) and late onset (> 20 weeks). Only cells from mice exhibiting the late-onset CML-like syndrome can efficiently propagate the disease when transplanted into sublethally irradiated syngeneic recipients. Mice engrafted with late-onset murine CML cells develop a range of hematopoietic disorders that originate from multipotent stem cells. The chronic granulocytic hyperplasia can be propagated by serial transplantation into secondary and tertiary recipient mice. The majority of transplanted mice succumb to acute myeloid and B- and T-lymphoid leukemias. These data support the idea that late-onset murine CML originates from a multipotent progenitor cell with a high replicating capacity. The inability to transplant the disease from mice developing the early-onset CML-like syndrome suggests that this disorder may originate from more differentiated progenitor cells with limited replication capacity that have undergone clonal expansion but are not immortalized. Although both early- and late-onset CML-like syndromes exhibit granulocytic hyperplasia, these disorders represent distinct diseases that appear to originate from different hematopoietic cell types. The late-onset CML-like disease and transfer to secondary recipients provides a useful murine model with features of the chronic and acute phases of human CML.","['Gishizky, M L', 'Johnson-White, J', 'Witte, O N']","['Gishizky ML', 'Johnson-White J', 'Witte ON']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Los Angeles 90024.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Genes, abl', 'Hematologic Diseases/*genetics/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Oncogenes', 'Phenotype']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.8.3755 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Apr 15;90(8):3755-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.8.3755.,,,PMC46380,,,,,,,,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,

To test the role of germ-line transcripts in class switching, we have used homologous recombination to mutate the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus of the 18.81A20 murine pre-B-cell line. In the parent cell line, the combination of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces germ-line epsilon locus transcription prior to class switching to epsilon. The heavy chain locus of the mutated cell line contains the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer and variable region gene promoter in place of the LPS/IL-4-responsive germ-line epsilon promoter. The mutant cell line constitutively transcribes the epsilon locus in the absence of IL-4. Strikingly, the mutant cell line also switches to epsilon in the absence of IL-4. This result demonstrates that, at least in the 18.81A20 cell line, germ-line epsilon transcription plays a direct role in class switching to the epsilon locus. In addition, the ability to change the pattern of class switching by altering transcriptional activity indicates that transcription of germ-line CH is mechanistically important in regulation of class switching.","['Xu, L', 'Gorham, B', 'Li, S C', 'Bottaro, A', 'Alt, F W', 'Rothman, P']","['Xu L', 'Gorham B', 'Li SC', 'Bottaro A', 'Alt FW', 'Rothman P']","['Department of Microbiology and Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['AI-20087/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin epsilon-Chains)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA Probes', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin epsilon-Chains/*genetics', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.8.3705 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Apr 15;90(8):3705-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.8.3705.,,,PMC46370,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer prevention strategies may differ in different parts of the world. In Europe, lung cancer is responsible for about one fourth of all cancer deaths and most of it could be prevented by eliminating tobacco smoking. Other exposures that can be controlled include occupational exposures to agents known to cause cancer at sites such as lung, bladder, paranasal sinuses, leukaemia, lymphoma and liver, as well as exposure to sunlight, known to be associated with both non-melanocytic and melanocytic skin cancer. Liver cancer is a common cancer in other regions of the world where hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic; in these areas, fungal contamination of food is also common. While immunization against HBV may be the method of choice in the long run, reduction of exposure to aflatoxins might be a more useful intermediate goal in primary prevention because of the strong interaction between hepatitis B and aflatoxin exposure on liver cancer risk.

Dimethyl sulfoxide-induced MEL cell differentiation decreases Spi-1 mRNA to approximately 20% of the uninduced level before commitment occurs. In addition to erythroid cells, Spi-1 mRNA is present in B cells, myelomonocytes, and mast cells but not in T cells and nonhematopoietic cell types. In situ hybridization demonstrated Spi-1 mRNA expression in bone marrow, spleen, interstitial nonhepatocytes of the liver, and interstitial nontubular cells of the testis.

S1 nuclease protection analyses confirmed that the induction of c-myc by c-Myb was transcriptional and affected both P1 and P2 start sites in a murine T-cell line, EL4, and a myelomonocytic line, WEHI-3. Mutational analyses of the c-myc promoter revealed that two distinct regions could confer Myb responsiveness in two T-cell lines, a distal site upstream of P1 and a proximal site within the first noncoding exon. In contrast, only the proximal site was required for other cell lineages examined. Five separate Myb-binding sites were located in this proximal site and found to be important for c-Myb trans activation. DNA binding was necessary for c-myc activation, as shown by the loss of function associated with mutation of Myb's DNA-binding domain and by trans-dominant repressor activity of the DNA binding, trans-activation-defective mutant. The involvement of additional protein factors was addressed by inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide in a conditional expression system in which the activity of presynthesized Myb was under the control of estrogen. These experiments indicate that de novo synthesis of additional proteins was not necessary for c-myc trans activation. Together these data reveal two cell lineage-dependent pathways by which c-Myb regulates c-myc; however, both pathways are mechanistically indistinguishable in that direct DNA binding by Myb is required for activating c-myc whereas neither de novo protein synthesis nor other labile proteins are necessary.","['Cogswell, J P', 'Cogswell, P C', 'Kuehl, W M', 'Cuddihy, A M', 'Bender, T M', 'Engelke, U', 'Marcu, K B', 'Ting, J P']","['Cogswell JP', 'Cogswell PC', 'Kuehl WM', 'Cuddihy AM', 'Bender TM', 'Engelke U', 'Marcu KB', 'Ting JP']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7295.']",['eng'],"['AI29564/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA48185/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Exons', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, myc', 'Globins/genetics', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Oncogenes', 'Plasmids', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Thymoma', 'Thymus Neoplasms', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.5.2858-2869.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 May;13(5):2858-69. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.5.2858-2869.1993.,,,PMC359676,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promoters of the LD78 alpha and LD78 beta genes showed similar inducible activities in two leukemic cell lines, K562 and Jurkat, but the induction mechanisms differed between the two cell lines. Further characterization of the LD78 alpha promoter indicated that multiple positive and negative regulatory elements are present, some of which are differentially required for induction and repression of the promoter activity in different cells. One of the negative regulatory elements, ICK-1, functioned in both cell lines in the absence and presence of stimulation and was shown to be a recognition site for positive and negative transcriptional factors. This ICK-1 element contained a direct repeat, and similar repeats were also found in the negative regulatory elements of hematopoietic growth factor interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene promoters. Nuclear extracts from K562 and Jurkat cells formed several protein-DNA complexes with the LD78 alpha ICK-1 element, one of which was also observed with the IL-3 and GM-CSF ICK-1 elements. Results from in vivo and in vitro analyses suggested that the protein forming this complex functions as a negative factor. The binding affinity of this protein, ICK-1A, to the LD78 alpha ICK-1 element was low and was significantly affected by the incubation temperature and the salt concentration in the binding buffer. ICK-1B, another protein bound specifically by the LD78 alpha ICK-1 element, was shown to be a positive factor important for induction of the promoter. These results suggested that ICK-1A plays an important role in balanced expression of LD78, IL-3, and GM-CSF during hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation.","['Nomiyama, H', 'Hieshima, K', 'Hirokawa, K', 'Hattori, T', 'Takatsuki, K', 'Miura, R']","['Nomiyama H', 'Hieshima K', 'Hirokawa K', 'Hattori T', 'Takatsuki K', 'Miura R']","['Department of Biochemistry, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Monokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monokines/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.5.2787-2801.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 May;13(5):2787-801. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.5.2787-2801.1993.,,,PMC359660,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the SFFV env glycoprotein associates with erythropoietin receptors (EpoR) to cause proliferation of infected erythroblasts [J.-P. Li, A. D. D'Andrea, H. F. Lodish, and D. Baltimore, Nature (London) 343:762-764, 1990]. Interestingly, the mitogenic effect of SFFV is blocked in mice homozygous for the Fv-2r resistance gene, but mutant SFFVs can overcome this resistance. Recent evidence suggested that these mutants contain partial env deletions that truncate the membrane-proximal extracellular domain of the encoded glycoproteins (M. H. Majumdar, C.-L. Cho, M. T. Fox, K. L. Eckner, S. Kozak, D. Kabat, and R. W. Geib, J. Virol. 66:3652-3660, 1992). Mutant BB6, which encodes a gp42 glycoprotein that has a large deletion in this domain, causes erythroblastosis in DBA/2 (Fv-2s) as well as in congenic D2.R (Fv-2r) mice. Analogous to gp55, gp42 is processed inefficiently as a disulfide-bonded dimer to form cell surface gp42p. Retroviral vectors with SFFV and BB6 env genes have no effect on interleukin 3-dependent BaF3 hematopoietic cells, but they cause growth factor independency of BaF3/EpoR cells, a derivative that contains recombinant EpoR. After binding 125I-Epo to surface EpoR on these factor-independent cells and adding the covalent cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate, complexes that had immunological properties and sizes demonstrating that they consisted of 125I-Epo-gp55p and 125I-Epo-gp42p were isolated from cell lysates. Contrary to a previous report, SFFV or BB6 env glycoproteins did not promiscuously activate other members of the EpoR superfamily. Although the related env glycoproteins encoded by dualtropic murine leukemia viruses formed detectable complexes with EpoR, strong mitogenic signalling did not ensue. Our results indicate that the SFFV and BB6 env glycoproteins specifically activate EpoR; they help to define the glycoprotein properties important for its functions; and they strongly suggest that the Fv-2 leukemia control gene encodes an EpoR-associated regulatory factor.","['Kozak, S L', 'Hoatlin, M E', 'Ferro, F E Jr', 'Majumdar, M K', 'Geib, R W', 'Fox, M T', 'Kabat, D']","['Kozak SL', 'Hoatlin ME', 'Ferro FE Jr', 'Majumdar MK', 'Geib RW', 'Fox MT', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098.']",['eng'],"['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54149/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics/metabolism', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mutation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Virulence']",1993/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.5.2611-2620.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 May;67(5):2611-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.5.2611-2620.1993.,,,PMC237582,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During virion assembly, NC protein is necessary for core formation and the NC zinc finger is required for the packaging of the genomic RNA dimer. In vitro NCp10 has RNA-binding and -annealing activities critical for virus infectivity, since NCp10 promotes dimerization of viral RNA containing the Psi packaging element and annealing of replication primer tRNA(Pro) to the initiation site of reverse transcription (primer-binding site). To investigate the role of the basic amino acids flanking the NCp10 zinc finger, neutral residues were substituted for the basic amino acids and the effects of these mutations in vivo on virus assembly and infectivity and in vitro on the RNA-annealing activity of NCp10 were analyzed. Here we report that the substitution of 1 or 2 neutral amino acids for the basic residues did not impair the production of mature virions but that infectivity was either moderately or strongly attenuated. When more than 2 basic residues were replaced by neutral amino acids, viruses were poorly infectious because of a severe defect in genomic RNA dimer packaging and initiation of reverse transcription. In vitro NCp10-derived peptides with similar mutations were chemically synthesized and were found to be either fully or partially active or completely inactive.

Both Rex and Rev act at a posttranscriptional level by binding to highly structured RNA-response elements, the Rex-response element in HTLV-I and the Rev-response element in HIV-1. Using a sensitive in vivo assay of protein-protein interaction, we now demonstrate that the HTLV-I Rex and HIV-1 Rev proteins readily form homomultimeric complexes in the absence of their cognate RNA-response elements yet fail to form heteromultimeric complexes with each other. Dominant negative mutations have been identified in both the rex and rev genes which presumably specify a critical activation or effector domain in each of these viral transactivators. Surprisingly, these dominant negative mutants of Rex and Rev fail to interact in vivo. These findings raise the possibility that the binding of nonfunctional monomers rather than functional multimers underlies the transdominant phenotype of these Rex and Rev mutants. Further, it seems likely that the assembly of functional and stable multimers of Rex and Rev in vivo may depend not only on the intrinsic multimerization domains of these proteins but also on the binding of a bridging cellular cofactor to the related activation domains present in each viral transactivator.","['Bogerd, H', 'Greene, W C']","['Bogerd H', 'Greene WC']","['Department of Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Products, rev/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, rex/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.5.2496-2502.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 May;67(5):2496-502. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.5.2496-2502.1993.,,,PMC237568,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All 10 rats injected with both HX-1920 and LD50 of cisplatin survived for 14 days. After 24 hr, co-administration of HX-1920 significantly increased the urinary excretion of cisplatin in rats. HX-1920 also significantly inhibited the cisplatin-induced elevation of urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine concentrations in rats. HX-1920 had no effect on the number of white blood cell. HX-1920 tended to reduce the emesis induced by cisplatin in ferrets. Furthermore, there was no difference in the survival curve between the cisplatin group and the HX-1920 plus cisplatin group in mice inoculated with P 388 leukemia cells. Thus, HX-1920 did not modify the antitumor activity of cisplatin. These results suggest that HX-1920 has a protective effect on the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin without inhibiting its antitumor activity.","['Shiroshita, Y', 'Minami, M', 'Endo, T', 'Monma, Y', 'Asaka, M', 'Itoh, H', 'Ikeda, T', 'Matsumoto, H', 'Satoh, T']","['Shiroshita Y', 'Minami M', 'Endo T', 'Monma Y', 'Asaka M', 'Itoh H', 'Ikeda T', 'Matsumoto H', 'Satoh T']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Higashi-Nippon-Gakuen University, Hokkaido, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,J Toxicol Sci,The Journal of toxicological sciences,7805798,"['0 (Thiazines)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (Acetylglucosaminidase)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'X033PDI962 (sudoxicam)']",IM,"['Acetylglucosaminidase/urine', 'Animals', 'Blood Urea Nitrogen', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use/*toxicity/urine', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Drug Interactions', 'Ferrets', 'Kidney/*drug effects', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nausea/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Thiazines/*pharmacology']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2131/jts.18.31 [doi]'],ppublish,J Toxicol Sci. 1993 Feb;18(1):31-41. doi: 10.2131/jts.18.31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcriptional enhancers for the genes of all four subunits are active in both gamma delta and alpha beta T cells, but are less active or inactive in other cells. Conserved sequence motifs are present in all four enhancers, suggesting that common transcription factors regulate TCR gene expression. One of these motifs in the gamma 3 site of the TCR-gamma enhancer is similar to motifs found in several other lymphoid-specific and viral enhancers. This conserved ""core"" sequence is present in the enhancers of Moloney and SL3-3 murine leukemia viruses, important for transcription in T cells and in determining disease specificity. Here we characterize the gamma 3 site of the gamma enhancer and a corresponding homologous site, delta E3, of the TCR-delta enhancer. Our results suggest that the core site is critical for activity of the 200-bp gamma enhancer fragment and of the gamma 3 and delta E3 sites. Furthermore, we identify a nuclear factor in human T cell lines that specifically binds the core region in these and several other core-containing enhancers. This factor may be identical to or related to a purified bovine nuclear core binding factor that binds the core region of the Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer, gamma 3 and delta E3 sites, suggesting that similar proteins regulate the TCR-gamma, delta and Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancers.

Whereas some of the isolated cDNA are from known B cell-specific genes, many of them represent previously uncharacterized genes. One of these unknown genes was denoted as BL34. Northern blot analysis performed with the BL34 cDNA revealed a 1.6-kb mRNA transcript that was present at low levels in RNA extracted from resting B lymphocytes, but whose expression was markedly increased in RNA prepared from mitogen-activated B cells. Similarly, RNA prepared from several B cell lines treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) contained high levels of BL34 mRNA. In contrast, RNA from purified T cells treated with phytohemagglutinin and PMA had undetectable amounts of BL34 mRNA. In addition, high levels of BL34 mRNA were detected in RNA purified from PBMC of a patient with B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. Southern blot analysis of human DNA from various tissues and cells lines demonstrated that BL34 is a single-copy gene without evidence of rearrangement. Two full length BL34 cDNA were sequenced, and an open reading frame of 588 bp was identified that was predicted to encode for a 196 amino acid protein. Searches of several protein data bases failed to find any homologous proteins. To directly analyze the expression of BL34 mRNA in lymphoid tissues in situ, hybridization studies with human tonsil tissue sections were performed. BL34 mRNA was detected in a portion of the cells in the germinal center region and adjacent to the mantle region.

This study analyzes the effects of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on cytokine expression in different cell lineages. Recombinant human LIF increases levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA in human articular chondrocytes as demonstrated by Northern blotting. These cytokine mRNAs are detectable as early as 1.3 h after stimulation and reach their maximum after 5 h. The LIF effects are dose dependent and of similar magnitude to those of IL-1. By metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation it is shown that LIF induces synthesis and secretion of IL-6. IL-6 bioactivity in conditioned media, as measured by the B9 hybridoma proliferation assay, is increased by LIF. Effects of LIF on cytokine expression are not confined to connective tissue cells. By PCR it is shown that human blood monocytes express IL-6 mRNA after stimulation with LIF. An increase in IL-6 mRNA levels is detectable 2 h after stimulation, and this starts to decline by 5 h. The response is of shorter duration as compared with IL-1 beta. In addition to increased mRNA expression, LIF also stimulates release of biologically active IL-6 from blood monocytes. In synoviocytes and neuronal as well as epithelial cell lines, LIF increases IL-1 beta and IL-6 gene expression. In summary, LIF induces cytokine expression in a wide variety of tissues. These results suggest that through the induction of cytokines, LIF can modulate inflammation, immune responses, and connective tissue metabolism, and act as a pathogenetic mediator in different disease states.","['Villiger, P M', 'Geng, Y', 'Lotz, M']","['Villiger PM', 'Geng Y', 'Lotz M']","['Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research in Aging, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],"['AG-07996/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-39799/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Cartilage, Articular/chemistry/cytology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-8/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Synovial Membrane/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI116363 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1993 Apr;91(4):1575-81. doi: 10.1172/JCI116363.,,,PMC288133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While GH has pleiotropic actions on cellular growth and metabolism, most of its effects are believed to be mediated by a single GH receptor. This receptor is not functional in tissues from patients with Laron dwarfism. We used human T-cell leukemia virus-immortalized T-lymphoblast cell lines from Laron dwarfs and normal individuals to examine the mechanism of GH-induced insulin resistance at the cellular level. GH (5-500 micrograms/L) caused a profound decrease in the sensitivity of normal T-lymphoblasts in response to all insulin concentrations (P < 0.0001 vs. insulin alone); pretreatment with GH and GH receptor antibody significantly improved sensitivity to all concentrations of insulin (P = NS vs. insulin alone). Preincubation with GH and PRL receptor antibody was associated with partial improvement in insulin sensitivity (P = 0.004 vs. insulin alone). Thus, in normal T-cell lines, the major pathway of GH-induced insulin resistance appears to be directed by the GH receptor, with a smaller effect mediated through the PRL receptor. While T-cell lines from Laron dwarfs do not respond to GH in clonal proliferation assays, GH (50 and 100 micrograms/L) caused profound insulin resistance in these cells (P = 0.008 and P < 0.0001, respectively, vs. insulin alone). GH receptor antibody did not abrogate this effect at any insulin concentration (P = NS vs. insulin alone), but there was partial restoration of insulin sensitivity when GH and PRL receptor antibody were coincubated (P = 0.0069 vs. insulin alone). Thus, in Laron T-cell lines, PRL and perhaps other lactogenic receptors appear to mediate GH-induced insulin resistance. The kinetics of GH-induced insulin resistance in Laron T-cells were also distinct from the pattern seen in normal T-cells, and unlike in normal cells, GH had no effect on insulin-like growth factor-I-induced clonal expansion of Laron T-cell lines (P = NS vs. insulin-like growth factor-I alone). These results provide evidence for an alternative pathway of GH action revealed in cells lacking classical growth responses to GH.","['Geffner, M E', 'Bersch, N', 'Golde, D W']","['Geffner ME', 'Bersch N', 'Golde DW']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California Medical Center, Los Angeles 90024.']",['eng'],"['CA-30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-865/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Receptors, Prolactin)', '0 (Receptors, Somatotropin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Dwarfism/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Growth Hormone/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Prolactin/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Prolactin/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Somatotropin/immunology/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.76.4.8473379 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1993 Apr;76(4):1039-47. doi: 10.1210/jcem.76.4.8473379.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unique properties provide evidence for multiple pathways of iron uptake.,8521-8,"The present study characterizes the transport of nontransferrin (non-Tf) iron by K562 cells. Accumulation of radiolabel by cells incubated with 55Fe-nitrilotriacetate (NTA) is a saturable process that is time and temperature dependent (Ea approximately 20 kcal/mol). Initial rate analysis of iron influx yields values of Vmax = 855 fmol/min/10(6) cells and apparent Km = 0.54 microM. NHCL4 and chloroquine, agents that block cellular acquisition of iron from Tf, do not interfere with assimilation from FeNTA, demonstrating that uptake is truly independent of the Tf-mediated pathway. Furthermore, the inactivation of this transport mechanism by limited proteolytic digestion on ice indicates that specific cell surface proteins are involved. The extent of radiolabel incorporation into heme and ferritin is the same regardless of whether K562 cells acquire iron from 55FeNTA via the cell surface mechanism or from 55Fe-Tf via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Unlike other Tf-independent iron transport pathways that have been described, the K562 cell transport mechanism is not inhibited by divalent cations such as Ni2+, Co2+, or Mn2+. Uptake from 55FeNTA can be blocked by Cu2+ but at concentrations > 1500-fold molar excess. However, Cd2+ is a fairly specific inhibitor of 55Fe uptake by K562 cells (IC50 approximately 50 microM). Additionally, the K562 cell transport mechanism is not Ca2+ dependent and does not appear to be regulated by extracellular iron salts, in contrast to features noted for non-Tf iron uptake by fibroblasts (Sturrock, A., Alexander, J., Lamb, J., Craven, C. M., and Kaplan, J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3139-3145; Kaplan, J., Jordan, I., and Sturrock, A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2997-3004). These unique characteristics of the K562 cell uptake mechanism suggest that multiple transport systems function in Tf-independent iron assimilation.","['Inman, R S', 'Wessling-Resnick, M']","['Inman RS', 'Wessling-Resnick M']","['Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'KA90006V9D (Nitrilotriacetic Acid)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'Z3U5ED15B9 (ferric nitrilotriacetate)']",IM,"['Ascorbic Acid/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Ferric Compounds/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Nitrilotriacetic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/25 00:00,1993/04/25 00:01,['1993/04/25 00:00'],"['1993/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)52906-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Apr 25;268(12):8521-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the effects of deregulated c-myc expression on T-cell development and oncogenesis, we sought to generate a transgenic mouse model in which c-myc expression was targeted specifically to the T-cell lineage. A plasmid construct containing a dominant control region (DCR) from the human CD2 locus linked 5' to the human c-myc gene was used to generate 2 lines of transgenic mice. Both strains developed thymic lymphoma at low frequency, but thymic development and peripheral T-cell numbers were otherwise apparently normal. Low tumour penetrance was consistent with the observed lack of stable CD2-myc transgene mRNA in tissues of healthy transgenic mice. In contrast, transgene RNA was detected in all malignant tumours as well as in early lymphomatous lesions. RNase protection analyses confirmed these findings and showed that the PI human c-myc promoter was active in all neoplastic tissues but not in the thymus or other tissues of healthy transgenic mice. Despite the low spontaneous tumour incidence, the presence of the transgene markedly and uniformly accelerated the onset of tumours after neonatal infection with Moloney murine leukaemia virus. All tumours were rearranged for T-cell receptor beta-chain genes and were of T-cell origin from their surface phenotype (Thy-1+, CD3+, CD4+/-, CD8+, sIg-). Virus-accelerated tumours contained clonal integrations of Moloney murine leukaemia virus, suggesting that proviral insertional mutagenesis may have played a role in tumour development. Analysis of several candidate myc-cooperating genes failed to reveal any rearrangements apart from a low frequency involving proviral insertion at the pim-1 locus. The CD2-myc mouse should therefore be a valuable system in screening for novel myc-collaborating genes involved in T-cell lymphoma.","['Stewart, M', 'Cameron, E', 'Campbell, M', 'McFarlane, R', 'Toth, S', 'Lang, K', 'Onions, D', 'Neil, J C']","['Stewart M', 'Cameron E', 'Campbell M', 'McFarlane R', 'Toth S', 'Lang K', 'Onions D', 'Neil JC']","['Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Cancer Research Campaign Beatson Laboratories, Bearsden, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Genes, Dominant/*genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Genetic Linkage/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/microbiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/microbiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Thymus Gland/physiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910530628 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 Apr 1;53(6):1023-30. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910530628.,,,,,,,,,,,"['CD2', 'E&mgr;-myc', 'E&mgr;-pim-1', 'c-myc', 'myc']",,,,,,

In culture cell lines, KB cells had significantly higher levels of DTD activity (8260) than PH101 (1934), SH101 (1805) or K562 (1796), and the highest sensitivity to MMC. In contrast, the higher the DTD activity of xenografts, the greater their resistance to MMC, while the inhibition rate of relative tumor growth for MMC, as evaluated by the NCI protocol, was highest in SH-6, high in CH-5, lower in CH-4 and lowest in EH-6. The investigation using 11 fresh tumor specimens also showed an inverse relationship between IC50 values after a 30-min MMC treatment, as evaluated by ATP assay and DTD activities. Moreover, a non-toxic DTD inhibitor, dicoumarol (DIC), or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), suppressed the efficacy of MMC in culture cells, but enhanced it in xenografts. Thus, we suggest that DTD may play an important role in MMC-induced cytotoxicity but MMC metabolism by DTD in solid tumors may differ from that in culture cells.","['Nishiyama, M', 'Saeki, S', 'Aogi, K', 'Hirabayashi, N', 'Toge, T']","['Nishiyama M', 'Saeki S', 'Aogi K', 'Hirabayashi N', 'Toge T']","['Department of Surgery, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitomycin/*pharmacology', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910530626 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 Apr 1;53(6):1013-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910530626.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the GATA-1 protein is present at nearly equal levels before and after differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells, in this study it was found that in the early commitment stages of the differentiation program there is a transient decrease in the GATA-1 mRNA and DNA binding activity levels due to a temporary block in transcription of the gene. Moreover, using a whole cell extraction procedure it was discovered that murine erythroleukemia cells contain a second GATA binding activity (denoted GATA-rel) which appears to be distinct from the GATA-1 factor based on its non-reactivity to two GATA-1 antisera. This protein has a limited tissue specificity, as it could not be detected in extracts from CHO, NIH 3T3, or COS cells. Similarly to the GATA-1 DNA-binding activity, the GATA-rel activity decreased during the early stages of differentiation. However, unlike GATA-1, GATA-rel activity did not return to pre-induced levels at later times. These results suggest that changes in gene expression during erythroid terminal differentiation may involve an interplay on levels of different GATA-binding factors.","['Aumont, F L', 'Trudel, P', 'Wall, L']","['Aumont FL', 'Trudel P', 'Wall L']","['Institut du cancer de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(11)60064-9 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.1993.tb00627.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1993 Jan;52(2):169-76. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.1993.tb00627.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic cells from 10 of the 11 patients examined proliferated in response to both IL-2 and IL-4 in a dose-dependent manner. The proliferative response to IL-4 was higher than that obtained with IL-2 in 8 patients.

The IL-4 receptor was demonstrated by flow cytometry on the surface of ATL cells. Neither IL-4-induced proliferation of ATL cells nor IL-4-induced IL-2R expression on ATL cells was inhibited by anti-Tac or anti-IL-2 antibody and, therefore, these effects of IL-4 are considered independent of endogenous IL-2 activity.

These results suggest that leukemic cells from ATL patients proliferate by an IL-2 or IL-4 paracrine mechanism in lymphoid tissue in vivo and that IFN-gamma inhibits IL-2- or IL-4-induced proliferation of ATL cells.","['Mori, N', 'Yamashita, U', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Nakata, K', 'Oda, S', 'Morimoto, I', 'Eto, S']","['Mori N', 'Yamashita U', 'Tanaka Y', 'Nakata K', 'Oda S', 'Morimoto I', 'Eto S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Medicine, Kitakyushu, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1993.tb00081.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1993 Mar;50(3):133-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1993.tb00081.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The series comprised cases diagnosed and immunophenotyped in 43 Italian centers (GIMEMA Cooperative Group) between April 1988 and June 1991. The immunophenotypic characterization consisted of two consecutive steps. The initial screening was based on the reactivity for TdT, HLA-Dr, CD7, CD10, CD13, CD19, CD24, CD33 and CD41. According to the results obtained, the second level of investigation assessed the positivity for intra cytoplasmic (Cy) Ig, CD1a, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8 and CD20. Based on the hierarchical expression of the different B- and T-cell related antigens, each case was assigned to a given differentiation stage. B-lineage ALL were classified in five subgroups (B0-B4) and T-lineage ALL in four subgroups (T0-T3). Cases in which the blasts were lymphoid according to the FAB criteria, but expressed myeloid antigens in association with B- and T-lymphoid markers were defined as hybrid leukemias. As expected, CD10+ cases (B2-B3) were the most frequent within the B-lineage ALL (83.2% of cases). CyIg+ (B3) accounted for about 20% of CD10+ ALL.

Among children receiving immunosuppressive therapy for cancer, possible early loss of specific immunity acquired from prior vaccination or disease, and likely diminished responsiveness to initial or booster vaccination must be considered. In addition, the safety of vaccine administration requires separate study in this population. Published evidence demonstrates preservation of vaccine-induced antibody titers against tetanus, diphtheria, poliomyelitis and (in children treated for lymphoma) pneumococcus. In contrast, prior immunity to varicella, influenza, and hepatitis B (when naturally acquired), and measles (acquired by vaccination) is compromised during and/or after antineoplastic therapy. Studies of immunologic protection acquired by prior vaccination against hepatitis B, varicella, and H influenza have not been published. The safety of administering toxoids and inactivated vaccines in this population is well documented. In contrast, morbidity must be expected if live attenuated vaccines (oral polio vaccine, attenuated measles vaccine or attenuated varicella vaccine) are administered to children receiving anti-cancer therapy. The risks of using live vaccines should be measured against demonstrable benefits in any vaccine program. The response to initial or booster immunizations against tetanus and diphtheria are similar to those in healthy children. For all other immunizations reviewed, responsiveness is diminished during periods of chemotherapy, more strikingly in children treated for leukemia than for solid tumors. Antibody responses to these vaccines range from slightly blunted (in the case of H influenza B) to marginal (influenza) or completely useless (pneumococcus and hepatitis B in children treated for leukemia).","['Ridgway, D', 'Wolff, L J']","['Ridgway D', 'Wolff LJ']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Chickenpox/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Haemophilus Infections/prevention & control', 'Haemophilus influenzae/immunology', 'Hepatitis B/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Influenza, Human/prevention & control', 'Leukemia/complications/*immunology', 'Measles/prevention & control', 'Neoplasms/complications/*immunology', 'Pneumococcal Infections/prevention & control', 'Poliomyelitis/prevention & control', 'Tetanus/prevention & control', '*Vaccination/adverse effects']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199309147369 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Feb;9(3):177-92. doi: 10.3109/10428199309147369.,,127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic T-cell lines (TCL) with specificity for host pretransplant PBMC were obtained from 9 of these patients, all presenting with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but from none of the remaining cases lacking evidence of disease. Cytotoxic TCL were specific for host targets and failed to lyse donor cells. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) blocking experiments and donor population screening analyses demonstrated that minor histocompatibility antigen (MiHA)-specific lysis of host targets was restricted by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) determinants. Whereas hematopoietic cells such as phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts or lymphoblastoid cell lines were susceptible to lysis by MiHA-specific TCL, keratinocytes (K) representing the natural targets of GVHD were quite resistant. Quantitative radioimmunometric measurements indicated very low constitutive expression of class I MHC antigens on K targets, which was readily increased by treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). IFN-gamma treatment at the same time rendered these cells susceptible to lysis by MiHA-specific TCL. Host leukemic cells of 3 patients were recognized by MiHA-specific TCL in a chromium release assay and in one experiment host leukemic cells were effectively killed and their growth specifically inhibited in a leukemia colony assay by a clone. These data demonstrate that (1) host-specific cytotoxic TCL are detected exclusively in the PB of patients with acute GVHD grades II through IV after allogeneic matched bone marrow transplantation, and (2) their target antigens are simultaneously expressed on several host cell lines, including lymphoblastoid cell lines, PHA blasts, leukemic cells, and K. We also extend previous findings by showing that, besides the expression of the nominal MiHA, the density of the restricting class I MHC elements also crucially determines the extent of TCL lysis. Because of its capacity to enhance class I MHC antigen expression, IFN-gamma represents a key cytokine for determining the susceptibility of MiHA targets for lysis by TCL and clones, and in one patient an MiHA-specific clone recognized host leukemic cells and also inhibited host leukemic cell growth in a colony inhibition assay.","['Niederwieser, D', 'Grassegger, A', 'Aubock, J', 'Herold, M', 'Nachbaur, D', 'Rosenmayr, A', 'Gachter, A', 'Nussbaumer, W', 'Gaggl, S', 'Ritter, M']","['Niederwieser D', 'Grassegger A', 'Aubock J', 'Herold M', 'Nachbaur D', 'Rosenmayr A', 'Gachter A', 'Nussbaumer W', 'Gaggl S', 'Ritter M', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Epithelium/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/analysis/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/surgery', 'Lymphoma/immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/surgery', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/surgery', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80511-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Apr 15;81(8):2200-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two regimens consisted either of fractionated total body irradiation and etoposide (FTBI/VP-16) or high-dose busulfan with cyclophosphamide (BU/CY). Only patients who had failed prior conventional management at least once were study eligible, ie, no patients with acute leukemia in first remission (CR) or in first chronic phase (CP) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) participated. Patients were stratified according to the following risk criteria: ""good-risk"" patients were those who were in second CR of their acute leukemia or in accelerated phase (AP) of CML; ""poor-risk"" patients had further advanced stages of leukemia. During a 52-month period, 131 patients were registered of whom 122 (93%) were study eligible. Sixty-one eligible patients were randomized to the FTBI/VP-16 arm and 61 to the BU/CY regimen. Of these 122 patients, 114 (93%) proceeded to BMT according to protocol. Posttransplant immunosuppression to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) consisted of cyclosporine and prednisone (CSA/PSE). Neither overall survival nor disease-free survival (DFS) differed significantly between the two treatment groups (P = .89 and .69, respectively). Estimated DFS for ""good-risk"" patients who had been prepared with the FTBI/VP-16 regimen was 55% +/- 11%, as compared with patients treated with BU/CY whose DFS figure was 34% +/- 10% (P = .30). For ""poor-risk"" candidates, the DFS rates at 24 months were 17% +/- 6% (for FTBI/VP-16) and 24% +/- 8% (for BU/CY), respectively (P = .81). These figures do not differ significantly, especially in view of the fact that the ""good-risk"" patients prepared with the FTBI/VP-16 regimen were younger than those treated with BU/CY. Both regimens were well tolerated with no regimen-related deaths encountered during the 6-week period after BMT. This study also confirmed the efficacy of the CSA/PSE combination in the prevention of GVHD with 23 of 113 (20%) of BMT recipients developing moderate to severe acute GVHD. The leading cause for treatment failure was leukemic relapse (45 of the 114 BMT recipients suffered a recurrence of their leukemia), whereas 38 patients died without evidence of relapse.

In one patient (pt) a monosomy 13, and in three other pts deletions involving or encompassing band 13q14 were detected by conventional cytogenetic analysis. In contrast, in situ hybridization to interphase nuclei showed a monoallelic RB-1 deletion in 11 cases (31%). One pt showed a translocation with the breakpoint in 13q1?4 on G-banding, but on in situ hybridization analysis the RB-1 signals were not affected.

To determine if rearrangements of the TAL1 proto-oncogene confer a distinct leukemic phenotype, we studied leukemic peripheral blood or bone marrow samples from 182 children with newly diagnosed T-ALL enrolled on Pediatric Oncology Group treatment protocols. Forty-eight (26%) of the samples had a local rearrangement of the TAL1 locus. Demographic and clinical features were compared for patient subgroups with and without TAL1 rearrangements. The only clinical correlates that were significantly associated with TAL1 gene rearrangements were higher white blood cell count (P = .017) and higher hemoglobin (P = .007) at diagnosis. Immunophenotypically, samples with altered TAL1 were more likely to be CD2+ (P = .001) and lack CD10 (cALLa) expression (P = .007) than those without the rearrangement. There was a trend toward improved event-free survival (EFS) in patients with TAL1 rearrangements (4-year EFS was 44% +/- 7% for patients without the rearrangements v 59% +/- 11% for those with rearrangements), but the difference was not significant (P = .34).

We examined effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in combination with several kinase inhibitors on differentiation of human leukemia U937 cells. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-reducing activity, a typical marker of myelomonocytic differentiation, of U937 cells was induced by genistein and GM-CSF enhanced this activity. GM-CSF also induced the NBT-reducing activity of the cells in combination with 2,5-dihydroxycinnamic acid methyl ester, psi-tectorigenin and staurosporine, although each of them did not induce the activity.

The observation that individuals with AIDS lack the expression of several T cell receptor V beta-chain genes lends support to this hypothesis. Staphylococcal exotoxins represent another class of superantigen with a similar ability to stimulate large numbers of T cells bearing specific T cell receptor V beta-chain types. To examine the hypothesis that T cells from HIV-infected individuals may be exposed to a superantigen during the infection process, we have compared the ability of T cells from asymptomatic HIV-infected donors and healthy donors to respond to stimulation with several known staphylococcal exotoxin superantigens. Following in vitro stimulation with staphylococcal enterotoxin D and staphylococcal enterotoxin E, asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals responded with a significantly different T cell receptor V beta-chain usage to that observed for healthy individuals. This skewed V beta-chain usage is likely to reflect preferential conditioning of T cells bearing specific V beta-chains as a result of HIV infection, supporting the hypothesis of superantigen involvement early in the course of infection.","['Bisset, L R', 'Opravil, M', 'Ludwig, E', 'Fierz, W']","['Bisset LR', 'Opravil M', 'Ludwig E', 'Fierz W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (enterotoxin E, Staphylococcal)', '12788-99-7 (enterotoxin D, Staphylococcal)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enterotoxins/*immunology', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*metabolism', 'Staphylococcus/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1993.9.241 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1993 Mar;9(3):241-6. doi: 10.1089/aid.1993.9.241.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the residence of mothers in the year preceding the childrens' birth was examined, there were relatively few removals in this period (26, i.e. 24 per cent, altogether, of which 14 were over 5 km and nine from another administrative district). Of these, 18 case mothers had moved (11 over 5 km) compared with eight control mothers (three over 5 km).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Alexander, F E', 'McKinney, P M', 'Cartwright, R A']","['Alexander FE', 'McKinney PM', 'Cartwright RA']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology (Universities of Leeds and Southampton), Southampton.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Public Health Med,Journal of public health medicine,9011205,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Population Dynamics', '*Transients and Migrants']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubmed.a042826 [doi]'],ppublish,J Public Health Med. 1993 Mar;15(1):9-15. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubmed.a042826.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The are different risk factors associated with the development of this kind of cancer. OBJECTIVE: To identify which of the already known factors described in the literature associated with the development of leukemia are most frequent in the pediatric population of Mexico City. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A protective case-control study was carried out using prevalent and incident cases. In two third level hospitals of Mexico City, a total of 81 children who had been diagnosed as suffering from different kind of leukemia, confirmed by biopsy of bone marrow, were select and studied. The control were 154 children from two different sources: 77 of them came from the same hospital where the cases received medical care, the selection criteria was not to have any kind of neoplasia; and 77 came from the same community where those diagnosed children cases lived, the selection criteria for this group was that they were healthy children. Both cases and community controls were visited at home and interview to complete precoded questionnaire with the different variables of the study. The information from the hospital controls was obtained during the time they stayed in the hospital. Odds ratio (OR's) for the different associations were calculated, as well as its confidence intervals at 95% (IC) accord to Cornfield and unconditioned logistic regression was carried out to control confounding variables. RESULTS: OR greater than 1 was found in those with familiar cancer background 1.93 (1.2-3.63); the mother being exposed to X-ray during pregnancy 1.89 (0.84-4.22); previous abortions before the child with leukemia was born 2.44 (1-06-5.68); being born from full term birth 2.42 (0.47-16.65); being born with weight greater that 3500 g 2.21 (1.04-4.33); being exposed to fertilizers 4.73 (1.04-24.14) and insecticides 1.93 (1.05-3.56). OR smaller than 1 was found in those who have been in a hospital because of an infectious disease during the first year of life 0.57 (0.17-1.74); to have suffered from chicken pox 0.59 (0.32-1.08). No association to parent's age or job was found. Multivariated analysis shows that the exposure to insecticide is the most important risk factor associated with the development of leukemia in children. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained positive associations to different risk factors described in the literature, having found that exposure to fertilizers is the most important risk factor and finding no association with the parent's occupation. This leads to the need of carrying out further studies to investigate, in more detail, the occupation of the father to confirm whether or not this is a risk factor.","['Fajardo-Gutierrez, A', 'Garduno-Espinosa, J', 'Yamamoto-Kimura, L', 'Hernandez-Hernandez, D M', 'Mejia-Arangure, M', 'Gomez-Delgado, A', 'Farfan-Canto, J M', 'Ortiz-Fernandez, A', 'Martinez-Garcia, M C']","['Fajardo-Gutierrez A', 'Garduno-Espinosa J', 'Yamamoto-Kimura L', 'Hernandez-Hernandez DM', 'Mejia-Arangure M', 'Gomez-Delgado A', 'Farfan-Canto JM', 'Ortiz-Fernandez A', 'Martinez-Garcia MC']","['Unidad de Investigacion en Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional, Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, D.F.']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Mexico,Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,0414106,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Parents', 'Risk Factors']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex. 1993 Apr;50(4):248-57.,,,,,Factores de riesgo asociados al desarrollo de leucemia en ninos.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correlation with cytotoxicity.",1503-15,"Dolastatin 10 is a potent antimitotic peptide isolated from the marine mollusk Dolabella auricularia. Four of its five residues are modified amino acids (in sequence, dolavaline, valine, dolaisoleuine, dolaproine, dolaphenine). Besides inhibiting tubulin polymerization, dolastatin 10 non-competitively inhibits vinca alkaloid binding to tubulin, inhibits nucleotide exchange and formation of the beta s cross-link, and stabilizes the colchicine binding activity of tubulin. To examine the mechanism of action of dolastatin 10 we prepared six chiral isomers, one tri- and one tetrapeptide segment, and one pentapeptide analog of dolastatin 10, all of which differ little from dolastatin 10 as inhibitors of tubulin polymerization. However, only two of the chiral isomers were similar to dolastatin 10 in their cytotoxicity for L1210 murine leukemia cells and in their effects on vinblastine binding, nucleotide exchange, beta s cross-link formation, and colchicine binding. These were isomer 2, with reversal of configuration at position C(19a) in the dolaisoleuine moiety, and isomer 19, with reversal of configuration at position C(6) in the dolaphenine moiety. The pentapeptides with reduced cytotoxicity and reduced effects on tubulin interactions with other ligands were all modified in the dolaproine moiety at positions C(9) and/or C(10). The tripeptide and tetrapeptide segments which inhibited polymerization but not ligand interactions were the amino terminal tripeptide (lacking dolaproine and dolaphenine) and the carboxyl terminal tetrapeptide (lacking dolavaline). We speculate that strong inhibition of other ligand interactions with tubulin requires stable peptide binding to tubulin (i.e. slow dissociation), but that inhibition of polymerization requires only rapid binding to tubulin.","['Bai, R', 'Roach, M C', 'Jayaram, S K', 'Barkoczy, J', 'Pettit, G R', 'Luduena, R F', 'Hamel, E']","['Bai R', 'Roach MC', 'Jayaram SK', 'Barkoczy J', 'Pettit GR', 'Luduena RF', 'Hamel E']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['CA-443440-1A1-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26376/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Tubulin)', '123884-00-4 (dolastatin 15)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EI946JT51X (dolastatin 10)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colchicine/metabolism', '*Depsipeptides', 'Isomerism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tubulin/*chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vinblastine/metabolism']",1993/04/06 00:00,1993/04/06 00:01,['1993/04/06 00:00'],"['1993/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90051-W [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90051-w [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Apr 6;45(7):1503-15. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90051-w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CPE-C is a prodrug and requires intracellular phosphorylation to cyclopentenyl cytosine triphosphate (CPE-CTP) which depletes endogenous CTP pools. The initial step in this activation process is catalyzed by uridine/cytidine kinase. We studied the mechanism of resistance to CPE-C in a Molt-4 T-cell leukemia line made resistant to CPE-C (Molt-4R) by culturing it in the continuous presence of increasing concentrations of CPE-C. Using a tetrazolium based colorimetric assay to assess cytotoxicity, the IC90 for the parent Molt-4 cells (Molt-4WT) was 0.5 microM after a 24 hr drug exposure. In contrast, cytotoxicity was not observed at concentrations as high as 1 mM in the Molt-4R cells. Following a brief exposure to 1 microM CPE-C, parent drug could be detected intracellularly in the resistant and sensitive cell lines. However, CPE-CTP formation was reduced markedly in the resistant cell line. Measurement of the activity of anabolic and catabolic enzymes in the Molt-4WT and Molt-4R cells revealed equivalent activities of alkaline and acid phosphatases as well as cytidine and dCMP deaminase but there was a significant reduction in uridine/cytidine kinase activity in Molt-4R cells. Endogenous ribonucleotide pools and CPE-CTP pools were measured in the absence and presence of CPE-C. CTP pools were reduced markedly in Molt-4WT cells following exposure to CPE-C. However, CTP pools in Molt-4R cells exposed to 100 microM CPE-C were two times greater than in the untreated Molt-4WT cells. At high concentrations of CPE-C (10 and 100 microM), Molt-4R cells were able to generate amounts of CPE-CTP equivalent to that seen in Molt-4WT cells exposed to 1 microM CPE-C (a cytotoxic concentration of drug in Molt-4WT cells), but no cytotoxic effect was seen in Molt-4R cells. Therefore, in addition to decreased uridine/cytidine kinase activity, a second mechanism of resistance that is the result of alterations in CTP synthetase activity also appears to be operative. Elucidation of the mechanism of resistance in vitro may provide insight into the mechanism of action of the drug and potential mechanisms of resistance in vivo.","['Blaney, S M', 'Grem, J L', 'Balis, F M', 'Cole, D E', 'Adamson, P C', 'Poplack, D G']","['Blaney SM', 'Grem JL', 'Balis FM', 'Cole DE', 'Adamson PC', 'Poplack DG']","['Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC 20307.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '69MO0NDN8K (cyclopentenyl cytosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.48 (Uridine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Uridine Kinase/metabolism']",1993/04/06 00:00,1993/04/06 00:01,['1993/04/06 00:00'],"['1993/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/06 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90050-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90050-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Apr 6;45(7):1493-501. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90050-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Med. Chem. 31, 1183-1190]. The mechanism by which these compounds bring about their effects was investigated by using variant cell lines in which processes thought to be altered by these agents are perturbed. Comparisons between the response of these cells and of their parental equivalents to BESM, N1N11-bis(ethyl)norspermine, N1N14-bis(ethyl)homospermine and N1N8-bis(ethyl)spermidine were then made. It was found that D-R cells, an L1210-derived line that over-expresses ornithine decarboxylase, were not resistant to these compounds. This indicates that the decrease in ornithine decarboxylase is not critical for the action of the compounds on cell growth. Furthermore, although polyamine levels were decreased in the D-R cells, the content was not totally depleted, indicating that such depletion is also not essential for the anti-proliferative effect. Two cell lines lacking mitochondrial DNA (human 143B206 cells and chicken DU3 cells) did not differ in sensitivity to BESM from their parental 143BTK- and DU24 cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of respiration in L1210 cells in response to BESM developed more slowly than the inhibition of growth. Thus it appears that the inhibitions of mitochondrial DNA synthesis and of mitochondrial respiration are also not primary factors in the anti-proliferative effects of these polyamine analogues. The inhibition of growth did, however, correlate with the intracellular accumulation of the analogues. It appears that the bis(ethyl)polyamine derivatives act by binding to intracellular target molecules and preventing macromolecular synthesis. The decline in normal polyamines may facilitate such binding, but is not essential for growth arrest.","['Albanese, L', 'Bergeron, R J', 'Pegg, A E']","['Albanese L', 'Bergeron RJ', 'Pegg AE']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Physiology and Pharmacology, M.S.

Since their nuclear receptors (RARs: alpha, beta and gamma) were cloned, extensive studies on retinoid signalling at molecular level have elucidated its elaborate mechanisms, by which the expression of a variety of retinoid responsive genes are regulated. Furthermore, discoveries of the second receptor system of retinoid (RXRs: alpha, beta and gamma) and their substantial ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9C-RA), were recently reported. The heterodimer formation between RXR and RAR or other members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily gave us a new aspect of hormonal gene control including retinoids, thyroid hormone, vitamin D3 and others. These heterodimers were showed to bind specific response elements consisted of the direct repeat of consensus sequence (AGATTC) or its related sequences. Differential regulation of retinoid responsive gene by RARs or/and RXRs in vivo is an ongoing subject and the combinatory outcome of subtypes or isotypes of receptors, natural response elements, natural ligands (AT-RA, 9C-RA, or their metabolites) owing to pleiotropic effects of retinoids is being revealed. The anti-malignant effect of retinoids is another important theme. The report of prominent therapeutic effect of AT-RA against APL patients was sensational. In many APL patients, translocation between RAR alpha gene and an oncogenic gene, PML, can be detected, although the roles of their fusion products (RAR alpha-PML and PML-RAR alpha) in APL induction have not been understood. Furthermore, the cross-talk between RAR and AP-1 is thought to give an explanation for the suppressive effects of retinoids against tumor promoters (TPA and others). In those contexts, synthetic retinoids specific for each subtype of RAR or RXR, which will be useful reagents for biological studies and/or excellent therapeutic agents, are being developed. Some RAR subtype-selective compounds including antagonists have been already reported.","['Fukasawa, H', 'Shudo, K']","['Fukasawa H', 'Shudo K']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Analyses that allow for a latent period suggest the risk is associated with exposures that occurred 10 or more years before death. Workers with peak exposure scores above the median have odds ratios of 2.4 (95% CI 0.7-9.0) and 6.6 (95% CI 0.7-58) for latent periods of 10 and 15 years, respectively. The data suggest an increasing risk with increasing exposure (p for trend = 0.05) when cumulated scores are based on peak exposure scores. Peak exposures tended to occur in cable splicing work and in old telephone switching offices. The numbers in this study are small and observed differences may be due to chance.","['Matanoski, G M', 'Elliott, E A', 'Breysse, P N', 'Lynberg, M C']","['Matanoski GM', 'Elliott EA', 'Breysse PN', 'Lynberg MC']","['Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Telephone', 'Time Factors']",1993/03/15 00:00,1993/03/15 00:01,['1993/03/15 00:00'],"['1993/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116718 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1993 Mar 15;137(6):609-19. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116718.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The five cats ranged from 6 to 9 years of age and presented with nonspecific gastrointestinal signs. Four of the five cats were tested for feline leukemia virus and were negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The neoplastic process involved the abdominal cavity in all cases, with a predilection for the distal small intestine and mesentery. The liver and peripheral and thoracic lymphoid tissues were also sporadically affected. Neoplastic round cells contained 0.5-1.5-microns eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules that were difficult to discern on causal observation with hematoxylin and eosin stain but were deep blue and easily visualized when stained with phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin. In two cases, epithelium in the affected ileum and liver contained unusually large numbers of apparently normal globule leukocytes. Ultrastructurally, the tumor granules tended to cluster at one nuclear pole and were spindle to round in shape with variably dense contents. Some granules contained a dense ""cap"" at one end or internal crystalloid bars that distorted the granule membrane. The tumors reported herein are similar to all three of the previously reported feline granulated round cell tumors and probably have a common cellular origin.","['McEntee, M F', 'Horton, S', 'Blue, J', 'Meuten, D J']","['McEntee MF', 'Horton S', 'Blue J', 'Meuten DJ']","['Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tennessee, Knoxville.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,['820484N8I3 (Histamine)'],IM,"['Abdominal Neoplasms/chemistry/pathology/ultrastructure/*veterinary', 'Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*pathology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Granular Cell Tumor/chemistry/pathology/ultrastructure/*veterinary', 'Histamine/analysis', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/030098589303000213 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Pathol. 1993 Mar;30(2):195-203. doi: 10.1177/030098589303000213.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following techniques were used: electron microscopy; detection of antibodies against human von Willebrand factor (vWF) and human platelet glycoprotein GP IIIa using a modified avidin biotin peroxidase complex technique on formalin-fixed paraffin sections; and enzyme histochemical methods on plastic sections for alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, myeloperoxidase, alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase, alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase, naphthol AS acetate esterase, and naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase. In addition, benign megakaryocytic cells, platelets, and neoplastic cells were labeled with lectins that have partially been shown to bind to platelet glycoproteins of other species. In healthy cats and dogs, the megakaryocytes and platelets reacted with lectins PSA, LCA, PHA-L, and WGA. Megakaryocytes and platelets from healthy cats were also labeled by lectin PNA. The lectins PHA-L and WGA reacted with neoplastic cells from the cat and both dogs. Lectin PNA bound to neoplastic cells from the cat, and lectins PSA, LCA, and SBA bound to neoplastic cells from both dogs.

Eight patients with APL were randomly assigned to receive either 50 U/kg (Group A) or 100 U/kg (Group B) of an AT-III concentrate, starting on the first day of chemotherapy and continuing for 7 days thereafter. Fibrinopeptide A (FPA), prothrombin fragment F1+2 and thrombin-AT III complexes, measured before and 15 minutes after each AT-III infusion, decreased significantly after each infusion, but the effect was minimal and short-lived, despite the achievement of post-infusion levels of AT-III activity well above 150% (Group A) or 200% (Group B). Small amounts of heparin were consistently detected in AT-III concentrates and post-infusion plasma samples.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four-hundred and twenty-five children (aged below 15 years), diagnosed of ALL in 8 different Cuban hospitals between 1973 and 1991, were evaluated. Five different therapeutic regimes were used: three ""classic"" GLATHEM protocols in the first period (1973-1981) and two intensive BFM-like protocols in the second period (1982-1991). The Kaplan-Meier method was applied for survival analysis, and the differences were evaluated by the log-rank and Mantel-Cox methods. RESULTS: Two-hundred and sixty-five patients were included in the first period, 81 with low-risk disease, 133 with standard risk and 51 with poor-risk leukaemia. The second period comprised 160 cases, 50 of low-risk, 83 with standard risk and 27 with poor-risk leukaemia. The disease-free survival probability at 60 months was 35% for the first group and 55% for the second (p < 0.0001). The 60-month survival (SV) as a whole was 45% for the ""classic"" treatments and 60% for the BFM-like protocols (p < 0.01). The disease-free survival (DFS) probability for each prognostic group was as follows: 50% for low-risk, 43% for standard risk, and 25% for poor-risk (p < 0.001) and the probability of survival as a whole was, respectively, 65%, 49% and 28% (p < 0.001). as for this compilation, 172 patients were out of any treatment for periods ranging between 14 and 168 months. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The percentage of remissions was similar for both groups of treatments. 2) The results attained with BFM-like protocols were better than those of the ""classic"" therapy with regard to the SV and DFS differences. 3) Significant differences can be appreciated between good- and poor-prognosis groups for both types of treatment.","['Svarch, E', 'Gonzalez, A', 'Vergara, B', 'Campos, M', 'Mendez, J', 'Fernandez, O', 'Cruz, E', 'Fernandez, R', 'Alert, J', 'Roque, M C']","['Svarch E', 'Gonzalez A', 'Vergara B', 'Campos M', 'Mendez J', 'Fernandez O', 'Cruz E', 'Fernandez R', 'Alert J', 'Roque MC', 'et al.']","['Instituto de Hematologia e Inmunologia, La Habana, Cuba.']",['spa'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cuba', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1993 Feb;38(1):25-30.,,,,,Tratamiento de la leucemia linfoide aguda (LLA) en el nino.,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, those children suffering relapse or presenting with poor-risk features at diagnosis have scarce possibility of doing well with conventional chemotherapy. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a good choice in such cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between July 1985 and January 1992, twenty-four children with ALL underwent BMT in the Service of Pediatrics of the Hospital Ramon y Cajal. In seven patient with poor-risk criteria at diagnosis BMT was performed in the first complete remission (CR) and in seventeen cases it was performed after the second CR. The conditioning for transplantation consisted of cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation in 21 patients and cyclophosphamide plus busulphan in 3 others. RESULTS: Fifteen patients persist in CR with post-transplant follow-up of 3 to 73 months (median, 31 months). Five patients died due to complications of the transplantation techniques, and four others died upon leukaemic relapse. The probability of disease-free survival for all cases is 61%, a plateau being reached at 13 months (83% and 52% for BMT in first or second CR, respectively).

A population based case-control study investigated the association with local environmental factors. For each case younger than 40 years of age (n = 14), diagnosed between 1975 and 1989, four controls, matched for age and gender, were selected via local general practitioners. All parents of patients and controls completed a questionnaire on their life style, living conditions and health for several years preceding each individual diagnosis. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated, matched and--if necessary--stratified for neighbourhood. Increased ORs were recorded for intensive use of petroleum products and pesticides, by the patients themselves and their fathers (OR petroleum products: 8.0, resp. 9.0; OR pesticides: 6.0, resp. 3.2). Most of these increases were statistically significant. Swimming in a local pond was also significantly associated with the disease (OR = 5.3); in the seventies this pond had been polluted by accidents with petroleum products and pesticides. contributed to the increase of the disease: ORs for several indirect exposure parameters were all above 2. It can be concluded that the increased incidence of childhood haematopoietic malignancies in Aalsmeer may have been associated with several specific local environmental factors.

The small studies conducted to date have shown median survival durations of approximately 3 years for patients who have B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and 7.5 months for those who have T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, compared with about 8 years for patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chemotherapy consisting of alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil combined with prednisone has achieved overall response rates of 50% to 70%, but this regimen has resulted in response rates of less than 25% in prolymphocytic leukemia. Pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin; DCF) is a purine analogue that has shown activity in treatment of chronic lymphoid malignancies. PURPOSE: This prospective phase II trial by the Leukemia Cooperative Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer was performed to assess the activity and toxicity of DCF in prolymphocytic leukemia. METHODS: Twenty patients with B-cell or T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia were given DCF at a dosage of 4 mg/m2 intravenously once a week for 3 weeks, then every other week for three doses. Patients who had at least partial response received maintenance therapy once a month for a maximum of 6 months. Fourteen patients had B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and six had T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, as evidenced by morphologic and immunologic criteria; three were previously untreated, eight had been given one or two chemotherapeutic regimens, and nine had been given more than two. RESULTS: One patient died of an unknown cause during the first 6 weeks of treatment, and one died of disseminated toxoplasmosis during the period of maintenance therapy, 5 months after achieving partial remission. Nine (45% response rate) of the 20 patients achieved partial remission, including seven (50%) of 14 with B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and two (33%) of six with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. The median duration of response was 9 months (range, 2-30 months); for patients with B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, the median remission duration was 12 months. No complete remission was observed. Toxic effects included nausea and vomiting (30%), infections (30%), and transient increase in liver enzymes (35%) and in creatinine (20%) levels. Eight patients experienced thrombocytopenia, the major hematologic toxic effect; four had grade 3 or 4 toxic effects. CONCLUSION: DCF is active in prolymphocytic leukemia, even as salvage therapy in patients who had received multiple prior chemotherapeutic regimens. IMPLICATIONS: Trials using DCF or other purine analogues alone or in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents in front-line or salvage therapy are warranted to improve the prognosis of patients with prolymphocytic leukemia.","['Dohner, H', 'Ho, A D', 'Thaler, J', 'Stryckmans, P', 'Sonneveld, P', 'de Witte, T', 'Lechner, K', 'Lauria, F', 'Bodewadt-Radzun, S', 'Suciu, S']","['Dohner H', 'Ho AD', 'Thaler J', 'Stryckmans P', 'Sonneveld P', 'de Witte T', 'Lechner K', 'Lauria F', 'Bodewadt-Radzun S', 'Suciu S', 'et al.']","['Medizinische Klinik, University of Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/04/21 00:00,1993/04/21 00:01,['1993/04/21 00:00'],"['1993/04/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/21 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.8.658 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Apr 21;85(8):658-62. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.8.658.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, catheter-related infections are responsible for significant morbidity leading to the removal of approximately 20% of implanted RACs. Sepsis has been linked to thrombus and fibrin sheath formation within the RAC. Gram-negative and fungal infections appear to be particularly resistant to antibiotic therapy alone and most of these infections have required catheter removal. Urokinase has been effectively used for reopening thrombus occluded RACs. Theoretically, thrombolytic agents could improve the treatment of catheter-related infections by removing luminal sites of bacterial/fungal colonization. We prospectively monitored the use of urokinase and antibiotics for catheter-related sepsis in our pediatric hematology/oncology population from 1985 to 1991. Sepsis episodes were treated with 2 doses of urokinase and antibiotics (10 to 42 days) infused through the RAC. One to 2 mL of urokinase (5,000 U/mL) was instilled in the RAC for 1 hour, then removed and repeated 24 hours later. During the study, 224 RACs were placed in 177 children. RACs were in place for a total of 71,134 days (median, 274 days). There were 67 blood culture-positive sepsis episodes occurring in 50 RACs. Fifty-nine sepsis episodes were treated with urokinase and antibiotics and all responded by clearance of organisms from the blood. Three patients (5.1% of urokinase treated) had recurrent sepsis with the same organism within 2 months, were considered treatment failures and had RACs removed. Only 1 of 16 episodes of multiple organism/Candida sepsis led to RAC removal due to inability to cure the infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Jones, G R', 'Konsler, G K', 'Dunaway, R P', 'Lacey, S R', 'Azizkhan, R G']","['Jones GR', 'Konsler GK', 'Dunaway RP', 'Lacey SR', 'Azizkhan RG']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of North Carolina, School of Medicine, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Catheters, Indwelling/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fungemia/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Heart Atria', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*therapeutic use']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-3468(93)90230-I [pii]', '10.1016/0022-3468(93)90230-i [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1993 Mar;28(3):350-5; discussion 355-7. doi: 10.1016/0022-3468(93)90230-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antipeptide antibodies, directed against the N-formyl chemotactic peptide receptor (FPR) and the activation peptide from the fifth component of C (C5a) anaphylatoxin receptor (C5aR) of human neutrophils, were used to analyze the ability of these receptors to be phosphorylated. Our data show that, in granulocyte-like differentiated HL-60 cells, both FPR and C5aR undergo an agonist dose-dependent phosphorylation that reaches completion in less than 2 to 3 min, consistent with the rate and the dose-dependent attenuation of signaling in phagocytes. Therefore, phosphorylation might be one of the possible mechanisms involved in the desensitization process of FPR and C5aR. Addition of either C5a or the protein kinase C activator (PMA) did not appear to induce the phosphorylation of FPR in the absence of FMLP or to modulate the phosphorylation of the latter at low concentrations of agonist. In contrast, although FMLP at a saturating concentration barely stimulated the phosphorylation of unoccupied C5aR, it markedly potentiated C5aR phosphorylation in cells exposed to low concentrations of C5a. Moreover, PMA was able to induce C5aR phosphorylation in the absence of agonist, indicating that protein kinase C or protein kinase C-activated kinase(s) could be involved in the phosphorylation of C5aR. Pretreatment of cells with staurosporine, a potent but nonspecific inhibitor of protein kinase C, resulted in the partial inhibition of both FPR and C5aR phosphorylation induced by saturating concentrations of agonist, suggesting that a kinase different from protein kinase C might be mainly responsible for the phosphorylation of these chemotactic receptors.","['Tardif, M', 'Mery, L', 'Brouchon, L', 'Boulay, F']","['Tardif M', 'Mery L', 'Brouchon L', 'Boulay F']","[""DBMS/Laboratoire de Biochimie (CNRS/URA 1130), Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires, Grenoble, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.15 (beta-Adrenergic Receptor Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Complement C5a/*pharmacology', '*Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Complement/analysis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Adrenergic Receptor Kinases']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Apr 15;150(8 Pt 1):3534-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although undifferentiated cells did not produce PAF, the exposure of IFN-gamma differentiated Eol-1 to generate PAF in response to the Ca-ionophore. In addition, the IFN-gamma-treated cells acquired the ability to release free fatty acids, approximately 55% of which was found to be AA. When DHA was supplemented into the culture of Eol-1 for 24 h, PAF production decreased by 40 to 50% at concentrations of 3 to 10 microM. On the other hand, supplementation of 10 microM eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3) did not significantly decrease PAF production. With the supplementation of 10 microM DHA, DHA levels in phospholipid subclasses, including alkylacylglycerophosphocholine, were greatly increased with concurrent decreases in other unsaturated fatty acids. In these cells, the liberation of AA in response to an ionophore was decreased by 55%. Even when DHA was enriched in phospholipids, DHA release in response to ionophore stimulation was almost negligible, indicating that the DHA moiety of phospholipids is not susceptible to the action of phospholipase A2. Furthermore, DHA supplementation appeared to attenuate phospholipase A2 reaction by some unknown mechanism because the decrease in AA release was much more than that for the AA level in phospholipids. Acetyl-CoA:1-alkylGPC acetyltransferase activity of stimulated cell lysate was also reduced by DHA supplementation but the reduction was much less when compared with that of PAF synthesis or AA release. These results implicated that enrichment of DHA attenuates enzymic reactions for PAF synthesis, mainly the initial reaction catalyzed by AA-specific phospholipase, and thereby reduces PAF synthesis in Eol-1.","['Shikano, M', 'Masuzawa, Y', 'Yazawa, K']","['Shikano M', 'Masuzawa Y', 'Yazawa K']","['Sagami Chemical Research Center, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (acetyl-CoA-1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine', 'acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Eosinophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylcholines/chemistry', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/chemistry', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Apr 15;150(8 Pt 1):3525-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At 4 degrees C, 125I-IL-1 binding was competed by IL-1 but not by other cytokines tested. At 37 degrees C, GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 decreased 125I-IL-1 binding in a dose-dependent manner. Kinetic studies showed that GM-CSF reduced > 45% IL-1 binding within 15 min but later (8 h) produced a > 2-fold increase. In contrast, TNF decreased > 85% IL-1 binding within 15 min with a recovery of > 80% relative to that of control after 24 h. Scatchard analysis revealed that TNF or GM-CSF down-modulation of IL-1 binding was due to a decrease of IL-1R number. Further studies showed that dexamethasone and GM-CSF (or G-CSF) synergistically increased IL-1 binding after 8 h. This synergistic modulation was a cytokine dose- and time-dependent process, and was due to an increase in IL-1R numbers rather than a change in binding affinity. In addition, human bone marrow neutrophils, cord blood neutrophils, and several human hematopoietic cell lines (HL-60, U-937, and AML-193) responded to dexamethasone and GM-CSF (or G-CSF) with a superadditive increase in IL-1 binding. Because mammalian systems respond to bacterial endotoxins with secretion of TNF, IL-1, glucocorticoids, G-CSF and GM-CSF, our results shed additional light on this highly regulated cytokine network and revealed a novel role for GM-CSF.","['Shieh, J H', 'Peterson, R H', 'Moore, M A']","['Shieh JH', 'Peterson RH', 'Moore MA']","['James Ewing Laboratory of Developmental Hematopoiesis, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['AI 32918/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Apr 15;150(8 Pt 1):3515-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This process can be monitored by measuring the expression of early markers such as the high affinity receptor for monomeric IgG2a (Fc gamma RI) and Ia antigen followed by late markers such as lysozyme production and finally morphological changes from blast cells to mature macrophages. The same early markers that are expressed on M1 cells after induction with IL-6 are also expressed on monocytic cells after activation with interferon-gamma (IFN gamma). We used IL-6 and IFN gamma to investigate whether the early stages of M1 cell differentiation could be accomplished without commitment of the cells to terminal differentiation. Cytofluorometry shows that the expression of the same early differentiation markers (Fc gamma RI and Ia antigen) that are inducible by IL-6 on M1 cells can be induced by IFN gamma as well. However, stimulation with IFN gamma, in contrast to IL-6, does not induce the late differentiation markers such as lysozyme production, phagocytic activity, and morphological changes. Northern analysis supports these findings in that expression of Fc gamma RI mRNA is induced by either cytokine, whereas expression of mRNA for lysozyme is inducible by IL-6 only. Nuclear run-on analysis reveals that the changes in steady state mRNA levels of both Fc gamma RI and lysozyme are regulated by a transcriptional mechanism. These data suggest that early stages in the process of myeloid differentiation can be separately induced by IFN gamma and thus are independent from the later events induced by IL-6.","['Ruhl, S', 'Pluznik, D H']","['Ruhl S', 'Pluznik DH']","['Division of Cytokine Biology, CBER, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Muramidase/genetics/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fc/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041550117 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1993 Apr;155(1):130-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041550117.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radiation therapy used alone is associated with the lowest risk, combination mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy plus irradiation with the highest risk, and the risk of MOPP chemotherapy alone being in between the two. Splenectomy and probably splenic irradiation may also add to the risk.

On the other hand, PGA1, a PGE1-derived cyclopentenone prostaglandin, can inhibit in vitro the proliferation of virus-infected CBMC, preventing the emergence of the potentially transformed clone. In order to achieve a complete control of HTLV-I infection in this experimental model, we evaluated whether the antiviral activity of IFNs and the antiproliferative activity of PGA1 could be preserved in a combination therapy scheme. Recipient CBMC were treated with IFN alpha or beta (1000 IU/ml) at the onset of the co-culture with lethally irradiated virus-donor MT-2 cells, followed by multiple treatments with PGA1 (4 micrograms/ml every 4 days, starting on day 0) for 6 weeks post infection (p.i.). In PGA1-treated co-cultures the percentage of virus-positive CBMC was constantly doubled during culture time as well as the amount of viral transcripts and p19 virus core protein production were increased. The antiviral effects of IFNs, resulting in about a 50% reduction of the percentage of virus-positive CBMC and consequently in a partial inhibition of virus expression (HTLV-I transcription and p19 production) until 4 weeks p.i., were suppressed by multiple PGA1 treatments. However, the antiproliferative effect of PGA1 was enforced in IFN-treated co-cultures, leading to earlier control of proliferation of virus-infected cells. Interestingly, infection of CBMC with HTLV-I was associated with persistent expression of 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70), for at least 4 weeks p.i. IFNs and PGA1 showed antagonistic effects on HSP70 production in infected CBMC. In fact, production of HSP70 was suppressed (or prevented) in IFN-treated co-cultures, tested 2 and 4 weeks p.i. The fact that the expression of HSP70 is apparently suppressed (or prevented) by IFN treatment is surprising, since expression of this protein family has been associated with antiviral immunity. PGA1 could totally reverse the IFN-mediated suppression of HSP70 expression in these co-cultures. It is presently unclear whether HSP70 expression is directly involved in the control of proliferation exerted by PGA1 against virus-infected CBMC or is an epiphenomenon associated with inhibition of cell growth.","[""D'Onofrio, C"", 'Franzese, O', 'Ricci, F', 'Bonmassar, E']","[""D'Onofrio C"", 'Franzese O', 'Ricci F', 'Bonmassar E']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Prostaglandins A)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'VYR271N44P (prostaglandin A1)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/immunology/microbiology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/immunology/microbiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/etiology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage', 'Interferon-beta/*administration & dosage', 'Prostaglandins A/*administration & dosage', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0192-0561(93)90088-G [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(93)90088-g [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1993 Feb;15(2):125-36. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(93)90088-g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T. parva and the related parasite, Theileria annulata, are unique among protozoa in that their intralymphocytic stages induce transformation of bovid lymphocytes. Comparison of in vitro protein kinase activities between uninfected IL-2-dependent T lymphoblasts and T. parva-infected lymphocytes revealed a 4.7- to 12-fold increase in total phosphorylation and the induction of a group of Theileria infection-specific phosphoproteins. The enzyme that phosphorylates these substrates is a serine/threonine kinase with substrate and effector specificities of casein kinase (CK) II. Northern blot analyses revealed a 3.9- to 6.0-fold increase in CKII alpha mRNA in the infected cells relative to the controls. Furthermore, a marked increase of CKII antigen was observed on Western blots of materials prepared from the infected cell lines. The antibovine CKII antibody used in these studies immunoprecipitated a protein kinase that phosphorylated casein in a reaction that was inhibited by low (nM) quantities of heparin. Our data show marked increases of bovine CKII at the transcriptional, translational and functional levels in T. parva-infected lymphocytes, relative to quiescent cells or IL-2-dependent parental lymphoblasts. Bovine CKII thus appears to be constitutively activated in these cells and we propose that this kinase may be an important element in the signal-transducing pathways activated by Theileria in bovid lymphocytes and perhaps in some leukemic cells.","['ole-MoiYoi, O K', 'Brown, W C', 'Iams, K P', 'Nayar, A', 'Tsukamoto, T', 'Macklin, M D']","['ole-MoiYoi OK', 'Brown WC', 'Iams KP', 'Nayar A', 'Tsukamoto T', 'Macklin MD']","['International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases, (ILRAD), Nairobi, Kenya.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Casein Kinase II', 'Cattle', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Gene Expression', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/*parasitology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Polyamines/pharmacology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Theileria parva/*pathogenicity', 'Theileriasis/*enzymology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1993 Apr;12(4):1621-31.,['GENBANK/M93665'],,PMC413376,,,,,,,,['CKII'],,,,,,

The Bcr sequences activate the Abl tyrosine kinase which is required for the transforming function of Bcr-Abl. The Bcr sequences also enhance an F-actin-binding activity associated with c-Abl. Here, we show that binding of c-Abl and Bcr-Abl proteins to actin filaments in vivo and in vitro is mediated by an evolutionarily conserved domain at the C-terminal end of c-Abl. The c-Abl F-actin-binding domain contains a consensus motif found in several other actin-crosslinking proteins. Mutations in the consensus motif are shown to abolish binding to F-actin. Bcr-Abl proteins unable to associate with F-actin have a reduced ability to transform Rat-1 fibroblasts and to abrogate the requirement for interleukin-3 in the lymphoblastoid cell line Ba/F3. In transformed cells, Bcr-Abl induces a redistribution of F-actin into punctate, juxtanuclear aggregates.

We have examined the biological effects of substituting the v-Myb transactivation domain with the strong acidic activator domain from the C-terminus of the HSV-1 VP16 protein. In the absence of Ets, deletion of the transactivation domain destroyed the ability of v-Myb to stimulate transcription and to transform cells, whilst the substitution of the VP16 transactivation domain into v-Myb resulted in a greatly enhanced transactivation potential and altered TATA box binding protein (TBP) binding properties. In spite of these functional differences, the v-Myb VP16 protein regained the ability to transform myeloid cells with the same characteristics as wild type v-Myb. A construct encoding v-Myb VP16 fused to v-Ets was still capable of inducing leukaemia and of transforming both myeloid cells and MEPs in vitro, although the latter cells exhibited an altered phenotype.

Here we describe the cloning of NF-M, a myeloid-specific transcription factor related to C/EBP beta, which is a target of activated protein kinases. NF-M stimulates the expression of the gene encoding cMGF, a myeloid cell-specific growth factor, creating an autocrine growth loop crucial to oncogene transformation of myeloid cells. The NF-M protein bound directly to the cMGF gene promoter and activated its transcription, even in erythroid cells where the promoter is usually inactive. In addition, a truncated, dominant-negative form of NF-M inhibited cMGF expression in macrophages, indicating that NF-M is required for the normal activation of the gene. When multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells were stimulated to differentiate, NF-M expression was induced at a very early stage, suggesting that the transcription factor plays a role in lineage commitment. The stimulation of transformed myelomonocytic cells or of normal peripheral blood macrophages with kinases or LPS or TPA respectively, led to the rapid redistribution of NF-M protein from the cell bodies to the nucleus, consistent with the notion that NF-M was directly affected by such treatments.

It has been hypothesized that these repetitive sequences are causally related to the chromosome rearrangements found in ANLL. Here, we further refine the mapping of CH16LAR sequences with respect to the ANLL inversion breakpoints, using a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing 51 different chromosome 16 breakpoints. These studies indicate that CH16LAR sequences at 16p13 are in close proximity to the ANLL short-arm breakpoint region. However, the region containing the highest density of CH16LAR sequences on the long arm appears to be distal to the region where the ANLL long-arm breakpoint has been mapped.

The studies reported here were undertaken with the view that the mechanism may be understood in part through an analysis of anticancer drug-sensitive clones. We have isolated a murine (Friend) erythroleukemia clone in which drug sensitivity was correlated with increased differentiation, suggesting that anticancer drug-induced cell death may be based on differentiation or a differentiation-dependent mechanism. In addition, this clone showed a high propensity for constitutive differentiation and frequent appearance of large multinucleate cells. Morphologically similar large aberrant cells were observed after the treatment of parental (745A) cells with Adriamycin (or bleomycin). We attribute these morphological defects occurring in clone 3-1 or in the parental cell line after anticancer drug treatment to a defective or inhibited cell cycle function. We suggest that the putative cell cycle defect in clone 3-1 is coupled to the increased drug-induced differentiation and resulting cell death. From a broader perspective, the studies reported here suggest that the search for and design of new anticancer drugs be directed at agents that modulate differentiation functions.","['Dinnen, R D', 'Robinow, C F', 'Ebisuzaki, K']","['Dinnen RD', 'Robinow CF', 'Ebisuzaki K']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Vincristine/metabolism/pharmacology']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Apr 15;53(8):1877-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that the antitumor agent gallium nitrate is a potent inhibitor (concentration producing 50% inhibition, 2-6 microM) of detergent-solubilized cellular membrane PTPase from Jurkat human T-cell leukemia cells and HT-29 human colon cancer cells. This is the first report of a selective, small molecule drug inhibitor of PTPase. Gallium nitrate did not inhibit CD45, a PTPase found in the membranes of hemopoietic lineage cells such as Jurkat cells. Studies with gallium nitrate and a series of gallium-containing analogues revealed no correlation between growth-inhibitory activity in Jurkat and HT-29 cells and the ability to inhibit detergent-solubilized PTPase. Gallium nitrate and most of the gallium analogues penetrate poorly into cells. In contrast, a gallium-hydrogen peroxide complex inhibits DNA synthesis in Jurkat cells and induces the accumulation of phosphotyrosines on multiple intracellular proteins in this cell line. Gallium-hydrogen peroxide complex and gallium nitrate have similar inhibitory activity toward detergent-soluble PTPase. This is a new mechanism of action for gallium nitrate but it is not known if the inhibition of PTPase is related to the antitumor activity of gallium nitrate.","['Berggren, M M', 'Burns, L A', 'Abraham, R T', 'Powis, G']","['Berggren MM', 'Burns LA', 'Abraham RT', 'Powis G']","['Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['CA 09127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42286/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 52995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'VRA0C6810N (gallium nitrate)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Gallium/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Mice', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Apr 15;53(8):1862-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P388 parental cells exposed to various concentrations of doxorubicin and annamycin for 24 h displayed dose-dependent DNA cleavage: at 1 microM, both doxorubicin and annamycin were effective in inducing DNA breakdown, but at 10 microM, the effect was markedly decreased or totally absent. In multidrug-resistant P388/Dox cells, doxorubicin did not cause DNA cleavage, while 10 microM annamycin had a significant effect. By agarose gel analysis, drug-induced DNA fragmentation showed the characteristic pattern of internucleosomal ladder. Morphologically, P388 cells treated with 1 microM doxorubicin or annamycin for 24 h showed a reduction in cell volume and condensation of nuclear structures. Similar changes were observed in P388/Dox cells exposed to 10 microM annamycin for 24 h but not in cells exposed to 10 microM doxorubicin. Time course studies demonstrated that DNA fragmentation was detected 12 h after incubation with 1 microM doxorubicin or annamycin, while loss of membrane integrity appeared at 24 h, thus indicating that DNA degradation was a preceding event. DNA fragmentation caused by doxorubicin and annamycin was inhibited by the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, and the endonuclease inhibitor aurintricarboxylic acid. Drug-induced cell death was partially prevented by cycloheximide and aurintricarboxylic acid, thus suggesting that the apoptotic process caused by these drugs requires gene expression, synthesis of new proteins, and activation of endogenous nucleases. In contrast, DNA cleavage was not affected by incubating cells with 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, thus indicating that intracellular calcium depletion does not affect anthracycline-induced apoptosis. The results obtained demonstrate that the cell killing effect of anthracyclines is mediated, at least in part, by the induction of apoptosis.","['Ling, Y H', 'Priebe, W', 'Perez-Soler, R']","['Ling YH', 'Priebe W', 'Perez-Soler R']","['Department of Head, Neck, and Thoracic Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.

A Pediatric Oncology Group pilot study.,2854-61,"BACKGROUND: To prevent drug resistance, the authors designed a protocol that featured early intensive rotating drug pairs as part of the therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: After prednisone, vincristine, asparaginase, and daunorubicin induction, 12 intensive treatments (ABACABACABAC) were given in 30 weeks: A--intermediate-dose methotrexate (IDMTX) plus intermediate-dose mercaptopurine (MP); B--cytosine arabinoside (AC) plus daunorubicin (DNR); C--AC plus teniposide (VM-26). Triple intrathecal chemotherapy (AC, MTX, and hydrocortisone) was given for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. Continuation therapy consisted of weekly MTX and daily MP until 2.5 years of continuous complete remission had been achieved. RESULTS: Seventy-four children (age range, 1-19 years) at high risk of relapse were treated. Of 55 with B-lineage (early pre-B, pre-B) ALL, 24 have failed (2 induction failures, 2 deaths from infection, and 20 relapses). The event-free survival (EFS) rate at 4 years was 55.5% (standard error [SE] +/- 7.7%). Of 19 patients with T-cell ALL, 12 have failed (2 induction failures and 10 relapses). The EFS rate at 4 years was 32.6% (SE +/- 26.8%). Toxicities were significantly more common after AC and DNR or AC and VM-26 than IDMTX and MP. There were no toxicity-related deaths during intensive treatments. CONCLUSION: Early intensive rotating therapy is tolerable and warrants consideration for additional trials of patients with high-risk, B-lineage ALL.","['Lauer, S J', 'Camitta, B M', 'Leventhal, B G', 'Mahoney, D H Jr', 'Shuster, J J', 'Adair, S', 'Casper, J T', 'Civin, C I', 'Graham, M', 'Kiefer, G']","['Lauer SJ', 'Camitta BM', 'Leventhal BG', 'Mahoney DH Jr', 'Shuster JJ', 'Adair S', 'Casper JT', 'Civin CI', 'Graham M', 'Kiefer G', 'et al.']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Midwest Children's Cancer Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.""]",['eng'],"['CA-03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Failure']",1993/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930501)71:9<2854::aid-cncr2820710929>3.0.co;2-j [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 May 1;71(9):2854-61. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930501)71:9<2854::aid-cncr2820710929>3.0.co;2-j.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report successful BMT and eradication of the disease at 18 months follow-up in a child 15 months old at presentation, who was conditioned with busulphan 20 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg, with the addition of splenic irradiation. Despite using higher than conventional doses of busulphan, pharmacokinetic analysis revealed very low busulphan peak levels and rapid excretion. As a possible consequence, only partial chimerism was achieved, but full engraftment ensued following the discontinuation of cyclosporin A, rebound donor lymphocytosis and the onset of acute GVHD. We suggest that host resistance to engraftment and tumour elimination was overcome by removing a suppressive effect on donor lymphocytes, allowing a graft-versus-leukaemia effect.","['Rassam, S M', 'Katz, F', 'Chessells, J M', 'Morgan, G']","['Rassam SM', 'Katz F', 'Chessells JM', 'Morgan G']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital For Sick Children, London, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Male']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1993 Mar;11(3):247-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show that there are no features on either skin or rectal biopsy that could identify those patients with early GVHD who would respond to treatment. Following treatment with steroids there was no change histologically in the grading of the skin biopsy whereas the rectal biopsy showed improvement in six of nine good responders and no improvement in the poor responders. There was an increase in infiltrating lymphocytes in both the skin and rectum of patients showing a poor response and this is most likely due to the ongoing immune reaction. The pre-treatment biopsy did not show any features that would predict this development and was therefore of no prognostic value.

The sickle mutation is responsible for an increased rigidity and adherence of the red blood cell leading to haemolytic anaemia and vaso-occlusive episodes. Symptoms include dactylitis, painful crisis, splenic sequestration and the development of multi-organ damage and failure. The progressive loss of splenic function increases the risk of infections. The morbidity and mortality can be reduced by the maintenance of an adequate nutrition, the prevention of infection and the treatment of complications. In some patients severely affected, a chronic transfusion program has to be instigated to maintain a level of haemoglobin S below 50%. New therapeutic strategies include the use of hydroxyurea and maybe, in the future, butyrates to increase the level of foetal haemoglobin. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of such therapies. Bone marrow transplantation represents an attractive therapeutic tool and its role in other haemoglobinopathies like thalassaemia is now well demonstrated. As far as sickle anaemia is concerned, the first report concerned a child with acute myeloblastic leukaemia. The patient is now cured of both the sickle cell anaemia and the leukemia. Since April 1986, 21 patients underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for sickle cell anaemia in our department. 20 patients became asymptomatic and have an electrophoretic pattern of the haemoglobin similar to that of the donor. One patient died of bone marrow transplantation related complications.","['Vermylen, C', 'Cornu, G']","['Vermylen C', 'Cornu G']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Catholic University of Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/*surgery/therapy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0268-960X(93)90017-X [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(93)90017-x [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1993 Mar;7(1):1-3. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(93)90017-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present results demonstrate that exposure of G1- or S phase-enriched U-937 cells to TPA was associated with delayed transition through G2-M and then exit from the cell cycle in the subsequent G0-G1 phase. In contrast, G2-M cells treated with TPA progressed through G1-S, were delayed in the next G2-M phase, and then entered a nonproliferative G0-G1 state. The effects of TPA on expression of cell cycle control genes demonstrated down-regulation of the cdc25 mitotic inducer during S-G2 progression. In order to investigate the role of cdc25 in the control of cell cycle progression, U-937 cells were stably transfected with an antisense cdc25 construct under control of a metallothionein-inducible promoter. Expression of this construct in G1 phase cells was associated with a significant delay in transition through S and G2-M phase. Similar results were obtained when G1 phase cells were incubated with a 14-base pair antisense cdc25 oligomer. Taken together, these results indicate that the cdc25 gene product is functionally associated with S-G2 transition of proliferating myeloid leukemia cells and that down-regulation of this gene by TPA is associated with G2-M delay.","['Hass, R', 'Gunji, H', 'Hirano, M', 'Weichselbaum, R', 'Kufe, D']","['Hass R', 'Gunji H', 'Hirano M', 'Weichselbaum R', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],['CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'S Phase/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1993 Mar;4(3):159-66.,,,,,,,,,,,['cdc25'],,,,,,

In this paper, we describe an unconventional strategy for the purification of a fully active MK from E. coli with a high yield. The MK was overproduced in E. coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The MK fusion protein extracted from the bacterial inclusion bodies with guanidine-HCl was renatured, refolded slowly and cleaved by thrombin at the site where the GST links to the MK. The purified free MK, like RA, induced neurite outgrowth from central neurons of the mouse spinal cord, and suppressed the growth of human HL60 leukemia cells in vitro. Unlike RA, however, the MK did not induce granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells. Furthermore, the MK supported the survival of an NGF-insensitive sensory neuron subpopulation(s) from chicken embryo dorsal root ganglion. Thus, the actions of the MK and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are surprisingly similar. There is no sequence similarity between MK and LIF, however, and unlike MK, LIF production does not appear to be RA-inducible.","['Maruta, H', 'Bartlett, P F', 'Nurcombe, V', 'Nur-E-Kamal, M S', 'Chomienne, C', 'Muramatsu, T', 'Muramatsu, H', 'Fabri, L', 'Nice, E', 'Burgess, A W']","['Maruta H', 'Bartlett PF', 'Nurcombe V', 'Nur-E-Kamal MS', 'Chomienne C', 'Muramatsu T', 'Muramatsu H', 'Fabri L', 'Nice E', 'Burgess AW']","['Melbourne Tumor Biology Branch, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '137497-38-2 (Midkine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Cytokines', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Escherichia coli/*genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Midkine', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Neurites/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Neurons, Afferent/*cytology/drug effects', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Sorting Signals/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spinal Cord/cytology', 'Teratoma', 'Thrombin/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08977199309046932 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 1993;8(2):119-34. doi: 10.3109/08977199309046932.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NAD is a pivotal molecule in regulating the energy and redox potentials of cells via synthesis of ATP and NAD(P)/NAD(P)H ratios. NAD turnover in cells is very rapid due to NAD catabolism via ADP-ribosylation reactions. These facts suggest that the cellular uptake and transport of nicotinamide may not be a passive process but a highly regulated cellular event. We have utilized radiometric procedures to characterize the uptake of [14C]nicotinamide in human leukemic K-562 cells. At physiologically relevant doses of nicotinamide (< 100 microM), the uptake was saturable with a Km of 2.3 +/- 1.0 microM and a Vmax of about 1.5 +/- 0.5 pmol/10(6) cells/min. Kinetic studies revealed that nicotinamide was first taken up intracellularly and then immediately converted to NAD and 1-methyl nicotinamide. All of the nicotinamide taken up into the cell was bound tightly to plasma membranes (25,000 g pellet) with Kd values between 3.2 and 12.7 microM and a Bmax of 1.56 pmol/10(6) cells. The specificity of nicotinamide binding was demonstrated by competitive inhibition experiments using NAD analogs, nicotinamide derivatives, and agonists or antagonists of plasma membrane receptors.

Diagnostic accuracy is good when compared with histological results.","['Williams, D M', ""O'Connor, S"", 'Grant, J W', 'Marcus, R E', 'Broadbent, V']","['Williams DM', ""O'Connor S"", 'Grant JW', 'Marcus RE', 'Broadbent V']","['Department of Paediatrics, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/diagnosis', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/diagnosis', 'Time Factors']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.68.3.393 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1993 Mar;68(3):393-8. doi: 10.1136/adc.68.3.393.,,,PMC1793878,['Arch Dis Child. 1993 Jul;69(1):170.

Reduced proliferation and preferential secretion of a T helper-2-like cytokine pattern on stimulation.,433-6,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: Since patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) demonstrate several immunologic abnormalities such as elevated serum immunoglobulin levels or reduced natural killer cell activity, we analyzed functional properties of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with nonleukemic CTCL and healthy donors. RESULTS: After priming with phytohemagglutinin for 3 days, a reduced proliferation in the presence of interleukin 2 and interleukin 4 was found. Limiting dilution technique revealed a diminished number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with CTCL that were capable of proliferating on interleukin 2 but not on interleukin 4 stimulation. Phytohemagglutinin induced a significantly higher release of interleukin 4 (mean +/- SD, 196 +/- 149.8 pg/mL [n = 19] vs 76.4 +/- 16.4 pg/mL [n = 248]) and a significantly lower secretion of interferon-gamma (24.9 +/- 30.7 U/mL [n = 17] vs 47.5 +/- 43.5 U/mL [n = 18]) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with CTCL compared with the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors (P < or = .02, U test). CONCLUSION: These functional characteristics can be explained by an imbalanced T helper-1/T helper-2 system and allow speculations concerning clinical features such as elevated immunoglobulin serum levels and reduced cytotoxic activity in patients with CTCL.","['Dummer, R', 'Kohl, O', 'Gillessen, J', 'Kagi, M', 'Burg, G']","['Dummer R', 'Kohl O', 'Gillessen J', 'Kagi M', 'Burg G']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Zurich, Medical School, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/immunology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 1993 Apr;129(4):433-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During a three-year period, we saw 11 cases of splenic FNAB. We present four cases of lymphoreticular neoplasms occurring between 1988 and 1991 in which the spleen was the only or most accessible organ in which to establish a diagnosis by FNAB: one case of small cleaved cell lymphoma, two cases of immunoblastic lymphoma (one T cell, one B cell by immunophenotyping studies) and one case of hairy cell leukemia in which the disease was confined to the spleen. All FNABs were radiologically guided, none of the patients suffered significant complications, and all had specimens sufficiently cellular to establish the diagnosis. Splenic puncture with FNAB may be an important and underutilized procedure for establishing a diagnosis in patients who have undetectable disease at other sites.","['Moriarty, A T', 'Schwenk, G R Jr', 'Chua, G']","['Moriarty AT', 'Schwenk GR Jr', 'Chua G']","['Department of Pathology, Methodist Hospital of Indiana, Indianapolis 46206.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*pathology']",1993/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1993 Mar-Apr;37(2):191-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A few reports have described FNA biopsy of the spleen for the diagnosis of lymphoma. There is a definite paucity of North American reports concerning FNA biopsy for metastatic disease involving the spleen; that probably is a reflection of both the relative infrequency of splenic metastases and concern about potential hemorrhagic complications of the procedure. We report a series of 11 FNA biopsies of the spleen in patients with known carcinoma or hematologic malignancies. The FNA biopsies were performed on eight males and three females with a median age of 45 years and a range of 6-77 years. Six patients had a known hematopoietic malignancy at the time of aspiration (five non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, one acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]). The one patient with Hodgkin's disease had an FNA biopsy of the spleen as part of the initial workup; cytologic impression was atypical lymphoid cells with granulomas suggestive of Hodgkin's disease, which was confirmed by splenectomy. Four patients with carcinoma (two testicular, one lung, one ovarian) had FNA biopsies for the evaluation of splenic nodules; FNA biopsy confirmed metastatic carcinoma in three of these patients. In the entire series splenic FNA biopsy documented malignancy in 6 of the 11 patients. The one patient with AML had Aspergillus identified in the splenic aspirate, while granulomatous inflammation with yeast consistent with Candida was seen in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. One aspirate demonstrated abscesses without recognizable organisms, and another showed extensive necrosis in a patient with testicular choriocarcinoma. Only one hemorrhagic complication was noted following splenic biopsy. Our experience demonstrates that FNA biopsy of the spleen is a useful and safe procedure in evaluating infectious and neoplastic splenic masses in patients with hematopoietic malignancies and carcinoma.","['Silverman, J F', 'Geisinger, K R', 'Raab, S S', 'Stanley, M W']","['Silverman JF', 'Geisinger KR', 'Raab SS', 'Stanley MW']","['Department of Pathology, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, North Carolina 27858-4354.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aspergillosis/pathology', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Candidiasis/pathology', 'Carcinoma/secondary', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*pathology/secondary']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1993 Mar-Apr;37(2):158-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo studies show this molecule to be extremely active against P388 leukemia and B16 melanoma. Cytotoxicity assays on the HCT116 colon carcinoma cell line result in an IC50 value of 1 nM. In vitro experiments with phi X174, pM2 DNA, and 32P-end-labeled restriction fragments demonstrate that this chromophore binds and cleaves duplex DNA with a remarkable sequence selectivity producing single-strand breaks. The cleavage chemistry requires reducing agents and oxygen similar to the other naturally occurring enediynes. Certain cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) prevent strand cleavage. High-resolution 1H NMR studies on the chromophore in the presence of calcium chloride implicate the 2-hydroxynaphthoyl moiety in DNA binding. Interestingly, the kedarcidin chromophore appears structurally related to neocarzinostatin yet recognizes specific DNA sequences in a manner similar to calicheamicin gamma 1I, an enediyne with a significantly different structure. Moreover, kedarcidin and calicheamicin share a DNA preferred site, the TCCTN-mer.

In this study the potential synergistic effects of rhodamine-123 (Rh-123) and merocyanine-540 (MC-540) sensitization of human tumor cell lines after laser exposure were explored. In a first series of experiments, the kinetics of uptake of Rh-123 and M-540 were tested on three human leukemia cell lines (K562, RAJI, 729HF2), P3 squamous carcinoma, and M26 melanoma. Our results demonstrate a clear difference in the rate and amount of uptake of MC-540 (K562 > P3 > RAJI > 729HF2 > M26) and Rh-123 (P3 > RAJI > 729HF2 > K562 > M26) by these cell lines. In a second series of experiments, M26 tumor cells were sensitized with either Rh-123 (1 microgram/ml) or with MC-540 (20 micrograms/ml) alone or with a combination of the two dyes for 60 minutes, then exposed to the argon (514.5 nm) laser at nonthermal energy levels. Our results demonstrate a significant enhancement of the tumoricidal effects of the laser on M26 carcinoma cells after sensitization with both dyes together (MC-540 and Rh-123) when compared to each dye alone. As with combination antibiotherapy, the synergistic effects of two laser dyes that have different intracellular targeting sites appear to enhance tumoricidal effects significantly after exposure to a matching laser wavelength. The data provide evidence for effective laser phototherapy by dye synergy.","['Castro, D J', 'Saxton, R E', 'Haghighat, S', 'Reisler, E', 'Plant, D', 'Soudant, J']","['Castro DJ', 'Saxton RE', 'Haghighat S', 'Reisler E', 'Plant D', 'Soudant J']","['Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1624.']",['eng'],"['R01 AR022031/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DC 00031/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,8508176,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', '*Laser Therapy', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology/secondary', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/019459989310800305 [doi]'],ppublish,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1993 Mar;108(3):233-42. doi: 10.1177/019459989310800305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, the BCR/ABL rearrangement was identified as the molecular basis of the disease. Second, animal models support the notion that the BCR/ABL gene product causes a syndrome similar to CML. Third, recent advances in understanding the functions of the normal ABL protein have given clues to the mechanism(s) of ABL-induced leukemias and approaches to blocking this process. Extrapolating these findings to humans seems reasonable. The challenge now is to determine how the BCR/ABL gene product causes chronic phase CML. Also unresolved is whether BCR/ABL also plays a role in the acute phase of the disease. Finally, the relationship between the two common forms of BCR/ABL, the P190 and P210 configurations, and different disease phenotypes, like CML and Philadelphia (Ph1)-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), needs to be clarified. There is also substantial progress in treating CML. Bone marrow transplants have emerged as the preferred therapy. These result in long-term leukemia-free survival in more than one-half of appropriately selected subjects. How transplants cure CML is complex and controversial. Some data suggest high-dose treatment is the dominant factor whereas other data implicate antileukemia effects of the immune system. Interferon treatment has also proven effective in CML. Whether it prolongs survival of persons with CML remains to be determined, as does its mechanism of action. Certainly the most important and difficult challenge in CML therapy is determining how to use knowledge about the causes CML to treat the disease. These and other issues in the biology and therapy of CML were the subject of a recent meeting of basic and clinical scientists. The meeting, third in a series begun in 1987, was held on Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 4-7 April, 1992. Four major topics were considered in five sessions: molecular biology, cell biology, Ph1-chromosome positive ALL, and therapy of CML.

Proliferation of leukemic blasts was found to be initially dependent on the presence of autologous stromal cells. However, after five weeks of culture, the stromal cells were no longer necessary and cells began to grow autonomously, with a doubling time of approximately 24 hours. The established Pre-Alp cell line displays a pre-B cell phenotype (CD19+, CD10+, CD34-, c mu+, s mu-), with immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain DNA in germline configuration, and carries a (1;19)(p23;q13.3) chromosomal translocation identical to the freshly-isolated leukemic blasts. A unique feature of this cell line is represented by its ability to respond to interleukin 7 (IL-7). Thus, IL-7 enhances 3H-thymidine uptake by Pre-Alp cells in a dose-dependent manner, under conditions of low cell density and serum concentration, and increases cell recovery. Finally, Pre-Alp cells were found to remain at a pre-B stage even upon addition of various cytokines, which failed to induce a transition to surface Ig+ cells. The presently described cell line should constitute a useful model of t(1;19) pre-B ALL and permit the study of IL-7 dependent signal transduction in human pre-B cells.","['Pandrau, D', 'Frances, V', 'Martinez-Valdez, H', 'Pages, M P', 'Manel, A M', 'Philippe, N', 'Banchereau, J', 'Saeland, S']","['Pandrau D', 'Frances V', 'Martinez-Valdez H', 'Pages MP', 'Manel AM', 'Philippe N', 'Banchereau J', 'Saeland S']","['Schering-Plough, Laboratory for Immunological Research, Dardilly, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Interleukin-7)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Line', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Apr;7(4):635-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study utilized two different murine bone marrow stromal cell lines, +/+-1.LDA11 and MBA-13, to define regulatory mechanisms of LIF messenger RNA (mRNA) induction. LIF mRNA was not detected in uninduced stromal cells under serum-free conditions. Incubation with interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or the cAMP analogue 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8BrcAMP) resulted in weakly induced LIF mRNA. Coincubation of combinations of the stimuli increased LIF mRNA expression additively. LIF mRNA stability, even after stimulation, was low with a half-life of about 30 min, suggesting a functional role for known AU-rich motifs in the 3' untranslated LIF mRNA region in mediating this instability. This possibility was further supported by the ability of cycloheximide to increase mRNA levels without affecting transcription. Transcriptional activation was found to be the main mechanism leading to LIF mRNA expression by IL-1, by TNF-alpha, and by 8BrcAMP.

Induction of transcription was detected 45 min post-stimulation and showed peak levels at 90 min.

We have demonstrated before that tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), in combination with low dose phorbol myristic acid (PMA) (0.1 ng/ml), can induce proliferation in these purified B-cell populations and that this TNF-alpha-induced proliferation is completely inhibited by the addition of interleukin 4 (IL-4). In this study we demonstrate that IL-6 is also able to inhibit this TNF-alpha-induced proliferation. Inhibition is maximal with 400 pg/ml of IL-6. With the use of neutralizing antibodies we show that the inhibition by IL-4 and IL-6 are independent processes. In contrast, investigation of differentiation as measured by immunoglobulin M (IgM) production, showed that in combination with PMA (1 ng/ml), IL-4 is the main cytokine to induce differentiation of these B-CLL cells. That we were indeed measuring differentiation of the malignant B cells could be demonstrated by the specific production of IgM/kappa or IgM/lambda. No induction of IgG or IgE production could be detected. In contrast to IL-4, in the majority of cases IL-6 does not play a role in the induction of differentiation of B-CLL cells. However, in two out of nine B-CLL patients we found that at low PMA concentrations (0.1 ng/ml), TNF-alpha can induce both proliferation and differentiation. In agreement with what was found for the proliferative response, this TNF-alpha-induced IgM production is inhibited both by IL-4 and IL-6. The possible therapeutic implications of our findings are briefly discussed.","['van Kooten, C', 'Rensink, I', 'Aarden, L', 'van Oers, R']","['van Kooten C', 'Rensink I', 'Aarden L', 'van Oers R']","['Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Apr;7(4):618-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular events leading to blast crisis, however, have not been well characterized. Gross alterations of the p53 gene have been detected in 30% of patients with blast crisis. Since point mutations in the p53 gene appear to be important in the process of transformation in many epithelial tumors, we looked for these mutations in the critical regions of the p53 gene (exons 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct sequencing, differential PCR, and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis to detect mutations of the p53 gene in samples from 21 patients with CML blast crisis. Two of 21 patients exhibited an intragenic deletion or rearrangement in p53. In addition, these patients were homozygous for the mutant p53 allele. No mutations were found in the p53 gene of the remaining 19 patients. However, sequencing of the CML blast crisis cell line, K562, revealed an insertion of a C at base position 956 within the fifth exon, causing a frame shift mutation and an early translational stop at codon 148. We conclude that, in contrast to solid tumors, mutations in exons 4-8 of p53 are not frequently seen in primary samples from CML blast crisis. However, deletions and/or rearrangements within the p53 gene do occur and may contribute to the progression from chronic phase to blast crisis in a limited number of patients with CML.","['Neubauer, A', 'He, M', 'Schmidt, C A', 'Huhn, D', 'Liu, E T']","['Neubauer A', 'He M', 'Schmidt CA', 'Huhn D', 'Liu ET']","['Department of Medicine, Lineberger Cancer Research Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7295.']",['eng'],['R01-CA49240-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Apr;7(4):593-600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specificity of the amplified targets was proven by internal oligonucleotide hybridisation and nested primer PCR. Homogeneity of the 5' LMP gene region coding for the amino terminal, transmembrane, and short extracytoplasmic domains of the protein was identified in all cases. However, deletions or insertions of small DNA sequences within the coding region for the intracytoplasmic LMP domain were observed in about 20% of cases. In one of them, a 30-base-pair deletion was precisely localized by DNA sequencing. A particularly high frequency of DNA polymorphism (30% of cases) was found in the 3' untranslated LMP region. However, when analysing the LMP gene in seven benign conditions, no DNA polymorphism was found. These data suggest conservation of oncogenic LMP regions coding for the protein domains known to be associated with transforming capacities and immunogenic functions. They also show a considerable genomic heterogeneity of the coding region for the intracytoplasmic domain and the 3' untranslated mRNA region.

Isolation and sequence analysis of a cDNA encoding the 19K protein revealed that this protein has been studied in other systems under different names. The name oncoprotein 18 (Op18) has been proposed on the basis of a postulated up-regulation in neoplastic cells. In the present report we adopt the designation Op18 for the 19K protein, and quantify this phosphoprotein in a series of leukemia/lymphoma cell lines, a panel of non-transformed cells and some terminally differentiated cell types. For this purpose we have developed reagents allowing quantitative Western-blot analysis, and quantification of Op18 on the single cell level by flow cytometric analysis. The data demonstrates a pronounced up-regulation of the Op18 protein in most leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. The HPB-ALL cell line provided the most extreme case and expressed 7 x 10(6) Op18 molecules/cell, which compares with 0.65 x 10(6) Op18 molecules/cell in non-transformed lymphoblastoid cells. The expression of Op18 appears to be restricted to cell types with proliferative potential, but it is clear from our results that up-regulation of Op18 is uncoupled from cellular proliferation. Moreover, by employing an Epstein-Barr virus based shuttle vector, we expressed Op18 cDNA in lymphoblastoid cells. This resulted in a three to fourfold up-regulation of Op18 that did not have any detectable consequences for cell-surface phenotype or cell size. However, increased expression of Op18 resulted in a partial inhibition of cell proliferation. Taken altogether, the results suggest that up-regulation Op18 levels in leukemia/lymphoma cells are strongly associated with, but not a direct cause of tumour progression.","['Brattsand, G', 'Roos, G', 'Marklund, U', 'Ueda, H', 'Landberg, G', 'Nanberg, E', 'Sideras, P', 'Gullberg, M']","['Brattsand G', 'Roos G', 'Marklund U', 'Ueda H', 'Landberg G', 'Nanberg E', 'Sideras P', 'Gullberg M']","['Unit for Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/biosynthesis', 'Stathmin', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Apr;7(4):569-79.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this assay, we have now compared the activity of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 with that of an improved version, anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40KDEL which contains an altered carboxyl terminus, and also with two chimeric toxins made with diphtheria toxin (DT). One of these is a fusion of amino acids 1-388 of DT with anti-Tac(Fv) and is termed DT388-anti-Tac(Fv). The other, DT388-IL2, contains interleukin 2 (IL2) at the carboxyl terminus of the same DT derivative. We incubated these toxins with malignant ATL peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for 1-3 days and then measured [3H]leucine incorporation. We found that anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40KDEL was the most cytotoxic agent and was followed in decreasing order of activity by anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40, DT388-anti-Tac(Fv), and finally DT388-IL2. Trypan blue staining showed that inhibition of protein synthesis correlated with cell death. Time course studies showed that the recombinant toxins containing anti-Tac(Fv) were cytotoxic even if exposed to the cells for only one hour. After intravenous injection into mice, the half-life of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 or anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40KDEL was 30 minutes. Normal PBMCs were resistant to all four toxins.

First a decline in the percentage of CD10+, TdT+ cells was found, although treatment consisted only of red blood cell transfusion and antibiotics. Subsequently the percentage of CD10+, TdT+ cells gradually increased until the morphological ALL diagnosis. These results illustrate that CD10, TdT double immunological marker analysis is a useful tool for early diagnosis of smoldering ALL in patients with a suspicious bone marrow, even when the bone marrow is hypoplastic.","['Knulst, A C', 'Adriaansen, H J', 'Hahlen, K', 'Stigter, J C', 'van den Beemd, M W', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'van Dongen, J J', 'Hooijkaas, H']","['Knulst AC', 'Adriaansen HJ', 'Hahlen K', 'Stigter JC', 'van den Beemd MW', 'Hagemeijer A', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Hooijkaas H']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Apr;7(4):532-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bone marrow cytogenetic abnormalities were complex: they included various numbers of clonal aberrations or variations or combination of those; they affected all but the Y chromosome, with a predominance however for chromosomes 1, 3, 6, and 7; they were often transitory and in some instances became modified with time. None of these chromosomal abnormalities was connected with the initial leukemia, even in the 6 patients who relapsed early.

Based on the chromosomal results obtained from 401 MDS patients by a multicentric study in Japan, we studied correlations between chromosomal findings and prognosis or leukemic transformation in MDS patients. Patients with complex aberrations (cytogenetic abnormalities at more than three chromosomes), of any subtype, had a poor prognosis; for example, > 60% of patients with refractory anemia (RA) showing complex aberrations died within one year, but only 11% of them developed leukemia. In patients with RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), > 70% of those with complex aberrations evolved into the leukemic phase and survived for less than one year, suggesting a biologic heterogeneity in RARS patients. By contrast, about 5% of patients with RA or RARS exhibiting chromosomal findings other than -7/7q-, +8, two aberrations, and complex aberrations, developed leukemia and had a favorable prognosis. Therefore, the presence of chromosome abnormalities alone in patients with RA or RARS is not a factor in predicting leukemic transformation or poor prognosis. In patients with refractory anemia with an excess of blasts (RAEB), the presence of chromosome aberrations at MDS diagnosis affected the occurrence of leukemic transformation (24% versus 43%), however, no particular difference was noted in patients with RAEB in transformation with regard to whether they had chromosome changes or not, and about 60% of them evolved into leukemia. The poor prognosis related to complex aberrations was consistently noted in all MDS subtypes or age-matched groups, indicating that this cytogenetic anomaly is an independent risk factor for a poor prognosis in MDS patients. The duration between MDS diagnosis and development of the leukemic phase and that between the latter and death were significantly shorter in patients with complex aberrations than those without this change. Although the clinical significance of certain chromosomal abnormalities differs among subtypes of MDS, a new scoring system for predicting prognosis by cytogenetic changes, in combination with hematologic parameters, was proposed.","['Toyama, K', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Yoshida, Y', 'Abe, T', 'Asano, S', 'Hirai, H', 'Hirashima, K', 'Hotta, T', 'Kuramoto, A', 'Kuriya, S']","['Toyama K', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Yoshida Y', 'Abe T', 'Asano S', 'Hirai H', 'Hirashima K', 'Hotta T', 'Kuramoto A', 'Kuriya S', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Hemoglobinometry', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Apr;7(4):499-508.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoprecipitation of nuclear extracts with a p53 antibody indicated that Sp1 was associated as a heterocomplex with p53. Formation of this complex was dependent on the level of p53 since p53 was more abundant in proliferating cells and decreased upon induction of growth arrest and apoptosis by withdrawal of GM-CSF while Sp1 levels remained unchanged. These results suggest that the association of Sp1 with p53 may represent a novel mechanism of growth regulation in cytokine-dependent leukemia cells.","['Borellini, F', 'Glazer, R I']","['Borellini F', 'Glazer RI']","['Department of Pharmacology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, D.C. 20007.']",['eng'],['CA54231/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53046-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Apr 15;268(11):7923-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Potential role of PKC in nuclear lamina structural dynamics.,7545-52,"Protein kinase C (PKC) is activated at the nuclear membrane in response to a variety of mitogenic stimuli. In human leukemic cells, the beta II PKC isotype is selectively translocated and activated at the nucleus. We recently identified the nuclear envelope component lamin B1 as a major substrate for nuclear PKC both in whole cells and in vitro. Using highly purified human beta II PKC and isolated nuclear envelopes from the human promyelocytic (HL60) leukemia cell line, we have now determined the major sites for beta II PKC-mediated lamin B phosphorylation. Using a combination of cyanogen bromide cleavage, direct microsequencing, tryptic phosphopeptide, and phosphate release analyses, two major sites of PKC-mediated phosphorylation, Ser395 and Ser405, have been identified. These sites lie within the carboxyl-terminal domain of lamin B immediately adjacent to the central alpha-helical rod domain. Functionally, beta II PKC-mediated phosphorylation of these sites leads to the time-dependent solubilization of lamin B indicative of mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown in vitro. beta II PKC-mediated lamin B phosphorylation is inhibited by 1) a monoclonal antibody directed against the active site of PKC, 2) a PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptide, and 3) a PKC peptide substrate. Two observations indicate that PKC-mediated lamin B phosphorylation and solubilization is due to direct phosphorylation of lamin B by PKC rather than indirect activation of a cdc2 kinase. Neither immunodepletion with p13suc1 Sepharose beads nor the presence of a p34cdc2 kinase peptide substrate had any effect on PKC-mediated lamin B phosphorylation. Therefore, we conclude that beta II PKC represents a physiologically relevant lamin kinase that can directly modulate nuclear lamina structure in vitro. Nuclear beta II PKC, like p34cdc2 kinase, may function to regulate nuclear lamina structural stability during cell cycle.","['Hocevar, B A', 'Burns, D J', 'Fields, A P']","['Hocevar BA', 'Burns DJ', 'Fields AP']","['Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],['GM-43186/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (lamin B1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Baculoviridae/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moths', 'Nuclear Envelope/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics/*metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/05 00:00,1993/04/05 00:01,['1993/04/05 00:00'],"['1993/04/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53210-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Apr 5;268(10):7545-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether focal adhesion-associated tyrosine kinase, pp125FAK, is one of these proteins. Anti-pp125FAK monoclonal antibody immunoblotted and precipitated a 115-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. In the absence of Fc epsilon RI aggregation, pp125FAK was tyrosine-phosphorylated only in adherent cells. Aggregating Fc epsilon RI in adherent cells markedly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK. This increase was detectable within 1 min of Fc epsilon RI aggregation and was maximal by 15 min. In contrast, in nonadherent cells Fc epsilon RI aggregation did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK. The enhanced influx of calcium by calcium ionophore or the activation of protein kinase C by phorbol myristate acetate induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK only in adherent cells. Thus, Fc epsilon RI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK could be mediated by the activation of protein kinase C and/or the induction of calcium influx. The data indicate that cell adherence is essential for Fc epsilon RI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK.","['Hamawy, M M', 'Mergenhagen, S E', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Hamawy MM', 'Mergenhagen SE', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Ptk2 protein, rat)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', '*Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1993/04/05 00:00,1993/04/05 00:01,['1993/04/05 00:00'],"['1993/04/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53114-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Apr 5;268(10):6851-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conjugate mixtures of transferrin-NCS were separated by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography. The separated molecular species were examined with respect to binding affinity to transferrin receptor, cytotoxicity and intracellular metabolism using the human leukemia cell line, K562. Transferrin-NCS conjugate is capable of binding to transferrin receptors specifically and its reactivity became weaker as the ratio of bound NCS to transferrin was increased. Transferrin-6NCS did not bind measurably to the receptor. On the other hand, the cytotoxicity was augmented when the number of NCS molecules bound per molecule of transferrin was increased to 4NCS/transferrin, while transferrin-5NCS and transferrin-6NCS species exhibited low activity. Examination of the kinetics of metabolism by pulse chase study using 125I-labeled ligand indicated that unconjugated transferrin and transferrin-NCS conjugates were internalized in similar ways, although the degradation of internalized conjugate was more marked in the case of transferrin-4NCS than transferrin-1NCS.

Using this assay, it was possible to detect BCR-ABL fusion genes induced among HL60 cells after 100 Gy of X-irradiation in vitro. In total, five fusion gene transcripts were obtained among 10(8) cells examined. These fusion genes contained not only CML-specific BCR-ABL rearrangements, but also other forms of BCR-ABL fusions. These latter genes had junctions of BCR exon 4/ABL exon 2 intervened by a segment of DNA of unknown origin, BCR exon 5/ABL exon 2, and BCR exon 4/ABL exon 2. The results appear to be direct evidence for the induction of the BCR-ABL fusion gene by X-irradiation.

Analysis of the v-abl gene has shown that both the fibroblast-transforming and tyrosine-protein kinase activities reside within a minimal region encoding a protein of 43 kDa (p43v-abl), which represents the most active, isolated form of this enzyme. Since the cellular substrates for p43v-abl are yet to be identified, we synthesized by classical solution methods the octapeptide H-Gly-Asp-Thr-Tyr-Thr-Ala-His-Ala-OH, corresponding to the structural sequence of the main putative autophosphorylation site (Tyr 515) of the abl TPK, as well as some of its analogs modified in positions -2, -1, +1 and +3. The synthetic peptides were tested as substrates for the p43v-abl. The kinetic data obtained indicate that the rates of their phosphorylation vary considerably depending on the sequence of the peptide, as expected. As a rule, no significant increment of the efficiency results from each substitution in the parent sequence. While the replacement of the two charged residues, namely Asp-2 and His-7, with neutral Ala is well tolerated, the substitution with amino acids bearing opposite charges is detrimental. The correlation between secondary structure of our synthetic octapeptides and their substrate recognition by p43v-abl was studied using CD and fluorescence spectroscopy in 5 mM Tris, in 98% TFE/Tris and in 30 mM SDS solutions.
