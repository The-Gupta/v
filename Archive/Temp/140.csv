The transplanted model of hepatoma substantiality (Heps) was established in mice, and the mice were divided into four groups: negative controls group and C21 sterols groups (10, 20, 40 mg x kg(-1)) , treated with drugs separately once a day for 9 days. Then the mice were sacrificed, the tumor growth inhibition rate (IR) was calculated and tumor tissue samples were taken and examined under electron microscope. The tumor cells were harvested and cell viability or apoptosis was analyzed by acridine orange and ethidium bromide (AO/EB) stain. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene (bcl-2) in tumor cells was inspected by immunohistochemistry. After treatment with C21 sterols (10, 20, 40 mg x kg(-1)), inhibitory effect on the transplanted Heps was observed. The IR was 34.79%, 47.08% and 50.23%, respectively. Apoptosis induced by the C21 sterols was observed, low growth density and some apoptotic cells were observed in tumor under the electron microscope. The expression of bcl-2 gene on tumor cells decreased in the C21 sterols groups, but the percentage of positive area is higher in 40 mg x kg(-1) group than that in 20 mg x kg(-1) group, which differed from apoptosis results.

Treg require expression of Foxp3, a transcription factor that not only represses the interleukin-2 gene promoter, but also sequesters key mediators of T-cell signal transduction by complexing with cytoplasmic NFAT and NFkappaB. We have discovered that expression of Foxp3 is linked to two stem cell-related factors, namely leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and axotrophin. Because both LIF and axotrophin each influence Foxp3, we now ask if reciprocal cross-talk occurs; for example, does Foxp3 in turn influence LIF and/or axotrophin? We compared the effect of wt-Foxp3 versus mutant DeltaE251-Foxp3, which lacks transcriptional activity, on transcript levels of axotrophin, LIF, and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3; a feedback inhibitor of LIF) in the Jurkat human T-cell line. Unexpectedly, a 50-fold increase in SOCS-3 transcripts occurred in the DeltaE251-Foxp3 cells, coincident with a dramatic decrease in LIF transcription. This implies that, either directly or indirectly, transcription of SOCS-3 is negatively regulated by wt-Foxp3. Suppression of SOCS-3 by Foxp3 would support a model wherein Foxp3 promotes LIF signaling in Treg and is further evidence of reciprocity between Foxp3, LIF, and axotrophin.","['Muthukumarana, Poorni', 'Chae, Wook-Jin', 'Maher, Stephen', 'Rosengard, Bruce R', 'Bothwell, Alfred L M', 'Metcalfe, Su M']","['Muthukumarana P', 'Chae WJ', 'Maher S', 'Rosengard BR', 'Bothwell AL', 'Metcalfe SM']","[""Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Hills Road, Cambridge, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Models, Immunological', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transplantation Tolerance/*immunology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",2007/08/19 09:00,2007/09/07 09:00,['2007/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2007 Jul 15;84(1 Suppl):S6-11. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000269116.06510.db.,,,"['1P01 AI 036529/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5R01 AI 047257-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['10.1097/01.tp.0000269116.06510.db [doi]', '00007890-200707151-00004 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because caregivers may not be aware of the association of type B lactic acidosis with hematologic malignancies, it may go unrecognized as a cause of acidosis in these patients. We report the cases of 7 patients with type B lactic acidosis who were cared for by members of the Brown Medical School Hematology/Oncology Division. Of the 7 patients reported, 5 had lymphomas and 2 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia. One of the lymphomas was a T-cell lymphoma. Of the patients we were able to evaluate, there did not seem to be a unique cluster of differentiation marker in association with type B lactic acidosis. We also review 14 additional cases, most reported since 2001. From our review of the literature, we suggest that a deficiency of thiamine or riboflavin may play a more pivotal role than previously recognized in the development of type B lactic acidosis associated with malignancy.

Lym-1 Ab has proven to be an effective radioisotope carrier, even in small amounts, for targeting human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR), a surface membrane protein overexpressed on B-cell lymphoma. Pairs of molecules (referred to as ligands), shown by computational and experimental methods to bind to each of 2 sites within the Lym-1 epitopic region, have been linked to generate small (<2 kDa) molecules (referred to as selective high-affinity ligands [SHALs]) to mimic the targeting properties of Lym-1 Ab. METHODS: A lysine-polyethylene glycol (PEG) backbone was used to synthetically link 2 of the following ligands: deoxycholate, 5-leuenkephalin, triiodothyronine, thyronine, dabsyl-L-valine, and N-benzoyl-L-arginyl-4-amino-benzoic acid to generate a series of 13 bidentate SHALs with a biotin or 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) chelate attached to the linker. These SHALs have been assessed for their selectivity in binding to HLA-DR10-expressing cells and for their pharmacokinetics and tissue biodistribution in mice. Biotinylated versions of these SHALs discriminated cell lines positive for HLA-DR10 expression with near-nanomolar affinity. The DOTA versions of 4 SHALs were labeled with (111)In for pharmacokinetic studies in mice with HLA-DR10-expressing malignant Raji xenografts. RESULTS: The bidentate, biotinylated, and DOTA-SHALs were synthesized in high-purity, multimilligram amounts. Mean radiochemical and product yields and purities were 90%, 75%, and 90% at mean specific activities of 3.9 MBq/microg (105 microCi/microg) for the (111)In-labeled SHALs. As expected, rapid blood clearance and tumor targeting were observed. The pharmacokinetics of the SHALs was influenced by the component ligands. Biliary clearance, kidney localization, and serum receptor binding contributed to less favorable tumor targeting. CONCLUSION: A series of SHALs was readily synthesized in multimilligram amounts and showed the expected selective binding in vitro. Better selection of the SHAL components should provide second-generation SHALs with improved properties to fulfill the substantial potential of these novel molecular carriers for targeting.","['DeNardo, Gerald L', 'Natarajan, Arutselvan', 'Hok, Saphon', 'Perkins, Julie', 'Cosman, Monique', 'DeNardo, Sally J', 'Lightstone, Felice C', 'Mirick, Gary R', 'Miers, Laird A', 'Balhorn, Rodney L']","['DeNardo GL', 'Natarajan A', 'Hok S', 'Perkins J', 'Cosman M', 'DeNardo SJ', 'Lightstone FC', 'Mirick GR', 'Miers LA', 'Balhorn RL']","['University of California Davis Cancer Center, Sacramento, California, USA. gldenardo@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lym-1 monoclonal antibody)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Biotinylation', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/chemical synthesis/*pharmacokinetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2007/07/17 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2007/07/17 09:00'],"['2007/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2007 Aug;48(8):1338-47. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.107.041095.

The World Health Organization classification of acute leukemia incorporates morphologic, cytogenetic, immunologic and clinical features to define the entities that are biologically homogeneous and that have clinical relevance. The purpose of this study was to determine the clinicopathologic characteristics of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Taiwan. METHODS: Archival tissues from 70AML patients during the period of 1995 to 2003 were retrieved. Histologic subtype was classified, defined by World Health Organization classification. Clinical data, including age, gender, treatment and outcome, were scrutinized. RESULTS: There were 37 males and 33 females. The median age at onset of disease was 49 years (range, 2-78 years), which was younger in biphenotypic AML (23.5 years) and older in multilineage dysplasia-related AML (61 years). There were 9 cases (13%) with recurrent cytogenetic abnormality, 7 (10%) multilineage dysplasia-related, 7 (10%) therapy-related, 39 (56%) not other categorized and 8 (11%) of ambiguous lineage. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates of AML were 26.5% and 20.6%, respectively. Histologic subtype was a significant parameter to determine survival (p < 0.05). The median survivals of therapyrelated, multilineage dysplasia-related and biphenotypic AML were 2 months, 9 months and 30.5 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: This was a clinicopathologic study of AML in Taiwan. Histologic subtype plays a significant prognostic role. Multilineage dysplasia- and therapy-related AML have worse prognosis. Biphenotypic AML may not be an aggressive subtype.","['Lee, Ming-Yuan', 'Tan, Tran-Der', 'Feng, An-Chen']","['Lee MY', 'Tan TD', 'Feng AC']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Services, Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center, and National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC. md42jj@mail.kfcc.org.tw']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Chin Med Assoc,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,101174817,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Phenotype']",2007/07/17 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/07/17 09:00'],"['2007/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Chin Med Assoc. 2007 Jul;70(7):269-73. doi: 10.1016/S1726-4901(07)70003-5.,,,,"['S1726-4901(07)70003-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S1726-4901(07)70003-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, fulfillment of this goal is often hampered by relapse of the underlying disease, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), or severe opportunistic infections, which account for the majority of post-transplantation deaths. Moreover, studies of long-term survivors of transplantation indicate an accelerated immune aging due to the transplantation procedure itself, preceding chemo- or radiotherapy, and acute and chronic GVHD. Significant advances have been made towards overcoming these obstacles by enhancing immune reconstitution with hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or erythropoietin (EPO) or through the application of cytokines. In addition, there are approaches to promote the thymic-dependent development of naive T cells, which are prepared for the interaction with a multitude of pathogens. Examples are the application of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), neuroendocrine hormones such as growth hormone or prolactin, sex hormone ablation, or the invention of a three-dimensional artificial thymus based on a cytomatrix. Might these measures result in a higher rate of healthy and fully recovered patients?

Despite considerable efforts in divers clinical settings, the potential advantages of hematopoietic growth factors in the management of these leukemias remain inconclusive. In general, individual published trials have shown declines in the incidence and/or duration of neutropenia but have not consistently demonstrated a reduction in the overall frequency of infectious complications or the duration of hospitalization. Most protocols also have failed to show a benefit in terms of disease-free or overall survival.

Benefit is usually only seen in those with less severe disease who are unlikely to require HGFs in practice. HGFs administered alone play no role in the treatment of SAA. The main indication for using HGFs, most often granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), in SAA has been to determine whether they increase the response rate to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and improve survival. While earlier neutrophil recovery occurs when G-CSF is administered with IST, studies to date show no significant advantage in hematologic response or overall survival. Conflicting results have been reported concerning whether G-CSF increases the known risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after IST; follow-up of at least 10 years is required, lacking in many clinical studies reported to date. In MDS, HGFs have been used to counteract the intramedullary apoptosis, which leads to ineffective hematopoiesis. In several uncontrolled and controlled studies, especially in low-risk MDS, high-dose erythropoietin (EPO) or its glycosylated derivative darbepoetin (DPO), alone or in combination with G-CSF, increased hemoglobin levels and diminished the need for red blood cell transfusions, in selected patients with prior transfusion frequency of less than 2 units per month and EPO levels below 500 IU/L. Quality-of-life measures were claimed to have improved, but the cost-effectiveness of this approach is debated, as is safety with regard to the risk of progression. G-CSF is used in supportive care of MDS to improve neutropenia during infectious complications, but to date there is no compelling evidence for a survival benefit or alteration of the course of the disease through the use of HGFs in MDS.","['Marsh, Judith C W', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Stadler, Michael']","['Marsh JC', 'Ganser A', 'Stadler M']","[""Department of Haematology, St George's Hospital/St George's, University of London, London, UK. jmarsh@sgul.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)'],IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/complications/*drug therapy']",2007/07/17 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/07/17 09:00'],"['2007/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2007 Jul;44(3):138-47. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.04.010.,72,,,"['S0037-1963(07)00064-9 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2007.04.010 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial clinical trials with multilineage hematopoietic growth factors, such as stem cell factor (SCF; c-kit ligand) were discontinued due to adverse events. It is well known that bone marrow failure syndromes are pre-leukemic disorders. So far, there is no evidence for induction of leukemia by hematopoietic growth factors.

However, only one adult case of TRALI after allogenic marrow graft has been reported. In this study, we present a pediatric case possibly associated with allogenic marrow infusion. A 10-yr-old girl was referred to our hospital for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. She underwent allogenic bone marrow transplantation from her HLA-2-loci-mismatched mother. During conditioning, she suffered from bacterial sepsis, but it had improved with antibiotics until day 0 of transplantation. Two h after starting the marrow infusion, she developed severe hypoxia. We discontinued the infusion and started steroids, which improved her respiratory condition. However, she developed respiratory failure again after resuming infusion of the graft. Despite intensive care with mechanical ventilation, the patient died of endotoxin shock five days after transplantation. Although we could not identify the antibody which might have been involved in the respiratory distress, the clear temporal relationship between marrow infusion and respiratory distress suggested that similar acute lung injury to TRALI might have occurred following allogenic marrow infusion in the present case.","['Yui, Yoshihiro', 'Umeda, Katsutsugu', 'Kaku, Haruna', 'Arai, Masato', 'Hiramatsu, Hidefumi', 'Watanabe, Ken-ichiro', 'Saji, Hiroh', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi']","['Yui Y', 'Umeda K', 'Kaku H', 'Arai M', 'Hiramatsu H', 'Watanabe K', 'Saji H', 'Adachi S', 'Nakahata T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin-Kawahara-cho, Sakyou-ku, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan. yyui@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/07/17 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/07/17 09:00'],"['2007/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2007 Aug;11(5):543-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3046.2007.00745.x.,,,,"['PTR745 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-3046.2007.00745.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, several groups have discovered a novel recurrent unique acquired clonal mutation in a tyrosine-kinase JAK2 in patients with Philadelphia-negative MPD and other myeloid disorders. It consists in a guanine-to-thymine change encoding a valine to phenylalanine at codon 617 (JAK2 V617F). JAK2 and the other members of the Janus kinase family are tyrosine kinases that function as intermediates between membrane receptors and intracellular signalling molecules. The mutation occurs within the enzymatically inactive JH2 pseudo-kinase domain that regulates the active JH1 kinase domain. The JAK2 activation leads to constitutive JAK and STAT (activators of transcription) hyperactivation with induction of growth factor hypersensitivity and cell transformation. Some authors have found a higher risk of vascular thrombosis and higher platelet activation when the mutation is present. Therefore, the JAK2 mutation offers a molecular target for new drugs investigation in a similar way to bcr/abl rearrangement in CML. For all these reasons, several studies related to JAK2 have arisen in the last year. In this report, we will review the literature and discuss its possible clinical and prognostic significance.","['Mata, R', 'Subira, D', 'Garcia-Raso, A', 'Llamas, P']","['Mata R', 'Subira D', 'Garcia-Raso A', 'Llamas P']","['Department of Hematology, Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Avda.

DESIGN: Seroprevalence survey. ANIMALS: 1,958 dogs and 1,289 cats exported from Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas between August 20 and December 31, 2005. PROCEDURES: 141 animal welfare groups in 37 states and Alberta, Canada, reported results of serologic testing. Risk factors for infection, including age, sex, neuter status, breed, and state of rescue, were examined by means of univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Seroprevalence of dirofilariasis in dogs was 48.8%. Sexually intact dogs were 1.6 times as likely to have dirofilariasis as were neutered dogs, dogs in the ancient breed group were 2.2 times as likely and dogs in the guarding breed group were 1.7 times as likely to have dirofilariasis as were dogs in the herding breed group, and dogs from Mississippi were significantly less likely to have dirofilariasis than were dogs from Texas. Seroprevalences of dirofilariasis, FeLV infection, and FIV infection in cats were 4.0%, 2.6%, and 3.6%, respectively. Seroprevalence of FIV infection was significantly higher in adult cats than in juveniles and in males than in females. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that dogs and cats exported from the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricane disaster area had disease rates similar to those for animals in the region prior to the hurricanes.","['Levy, Julie K', 'Edinboro, Charlotte H', 'Glotfelty, Carmen-Susan', 'Dingman, Patricia A', 'West, Aundria L', 'Kirkland-Cady, Kathy D']","['Levy JK', 'Edinboro CH', 'Glotfelty CS', 'Dingman PA', 'West AL', 'Kirkland-Cady KD']","['Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610-0126, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,"['0 (Antibodies, Helminth)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Helminth/*blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Castration/adverse effects/veterinary', 'Cats', 'Dirofilaria immitis/immunology', 'Dirofilariasis/*epidemiology', 'Dog Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Dogs', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukemia, Feline/*epidemiology', 'Louisiana/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mississippi/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Texas/epidemiology']",2007/07/17 09:00,2007/09/05 09:00,['2007/07/17 09:00'],"['2007/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2007 Jul 15;231(2):218-25. doi: 10.2460/javma.231.2.218.,,,,['10.2460/javma.231.2.218 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we highlight three of the most common 'lumps and bumps' seen in childhood: nevus sebaceus, pilomatricoma and juvenile xanthogranuloma. RECENT FINDINGS: Historically, many authors have advocated the prompt removal of nevus sebaceus at a young age due to the risk of malignant growths arising in these lesions during childhood. Recent articles have revisited this issue, concluding that the actual incidence of malignant growths in nevus sebaceus is quite rare in young patients. Regarding pilomatricomas, new findings show that the clinical accuracy of primary care physicians in diagnosing a pilomatricoma is low. With the identification of several key features, these lesions can be more easily diagnosed. Finally, the association of juvenile xanthogranuloma with neurofibromatosis and chronic juvenile myeloid leukemia has been described more formally in the recent literature, but the incidence and true association of this triad remain debatable. SUMMARY: Several updates in the recent literature now afford greater understanding of these three benign pediatric tumors. With greater familiarity, an accurate diagnosis can often be made in the office and informed counseling regarding the risks or associations of these specific skin lesions can be performed.","['Price, Harper N', 'Zaenglein, Andrea L']","['Price HN', 'Zaenglein AL']","['Department of Dermatology, Penn State, Milton S.

Therefore, we performed STAT5 RNAi in sorted cord blood (CB) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) CD34+ cells by lentiviral transduction and investigated effects of STAT5 downmodulation on the normal stem/progenitor cell compartment and the leukemic counterpart. STAT5 RNAi cells displayed growth impairment, without affecting their differentiation in CB and AML cultures on MS5 stroma. In CB, limiting-dilution assays demonstrated a 3.9-fold reduction in progenitor numbers. Stem cells were enumerated in long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays, and the average LTC-IC frequency was 3.25-fold reduced from 0.13% to 0.04% by STAT5 down-regulation. Single-cell sorting experiments of CB CD34+/CD38(-) cells demonstrated a 2-fold reduced cytokine-driven expansion, with a subsequent 2.3-fold reduction of progenitors. In sorted CD34+ AML cells with constitutive STAT5 phosphorylation (5/8), STAT5 RNAi demonstrated a reduction in cell number (72% +/- 17%) and a decreased expansion (17 +/- 15 vs 80 +/- 58 in control cultures) at week 6 on MS5 stroma.

IL-11, a member of IL-6 family cytokines, is expressed in cardiac myocytes, though it remains to be elucidated how IL-11 functions in the hearts. In the present study, first, we showed that IL-11 administration reduced the ischemia/reperfusion injury in the hearts. IL-11 receptor alpha was expressed in cardiomyocytes. IL-11 treatment rapidly activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in cardiac myocytes. IL-11 stimulation resulted in the translocation of phosphorylated STAT3 into nuclei. Immunofluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that IL-11 treatment led to the cell elongation, as is the case with other cardiotrophic members of IL-6 family, such as leukemia inhibitory factor. Finally we showed that IL-11 treatment conferred the resistance to cell death induced by hydrogen peroxide, which was abrogated by adenoviral transfer of dominant negative STAT3, but not by the inhibition of ERK1/2 with U0126. These findings indicate that IL-11 mediates cytoprotective signals in cardiomyocytes, proposing that IL-11 has the potential to exhibit cardioprotection as a novel biological function.","['Kimura, Ryusuke', 'Maeda, Makiko', 'Arita, Atsushi', 'Oshima, Yuichi', 'Obana, Masanori', 'Ito, Takashi', 'Yamamoto, Yasuhiro', 'Mohri, Tomomi', 'Kishimoto, Tadamitsu', 'Kawase, Ichiro', 'Fujio, Yasushi', 'Azuma, Junichi']","['Kimura R', 'Maeda M', 'Arita A', 'Oshima Y', 'Obana M', 'Ito T', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Mohri T', 'Kishimoto T', 'Kawase I', 'Fujio Y', 'Azuma J']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenomics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, 1-6 Yamada-oka, Suita City, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '0 (IL11 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiotonic Agents/*metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism', 'Reperfusion Injury/therapy', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",2007/07/17 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/07/17 09:00'],"['2007/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2007 May;38(2):107-15. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2007.05.011.

We investigated effects of PS-341 (Bortezomib) on cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, induction of apoptosis and differentiation in a megakaryoblastic (MO7-e) cell line. PS-341 was able to retain NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm and inhibit cell growth (IC(50)=22.5 nM), in a dose/time-dependent way. This anti-proliferative activity resulted to be lineage-specific, because other leukemic cell lines (KG1a, K562/R7, HL60/DNR) were unaffected by the PS-341 treatment. Moreover, PS-341 in MO7-e induced a significant pro-apoptotic effect from 10 nM concentration (40% versus 12% in the control, p<0.05). On the other hand, at lower concentration (5 nM), Bortezomib blocked cell cycle in the G2 phase. Finally, this compound was able to down-regulate WT1 expression. No significant effects on cell differentiation were found. Because a spontaneous NF-kappaB activation has been reported in megakaryocytes from patients affected by myeloproliferative disorders, Bortezomib would so be an attractive therapeutic tool for these malignancies, including essential thrombocythemia or idiopathic myelofibrosis. Preliminary data show an inhibiting activity of Bortezomib in the megakaryocytic colonies formation. Finally, also down-regulation of the WT1 gene Bortezomib-driven could be relevant, because of the role that this gene would play in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic myeloproliferative disorders.","['Galimberti, S', 'Canestraro, M', 'Pacini, S', 'Fazzi, R', 'Orciuolo, E', 'Trombi, L', 'Mattii, L', 'Battolla, B', 'Capodanno, A', 'Collecchi, P', 'Veroni, F', 'Simi, P', 'Piaggi, S', 'Casini, A', 'Petrini, M']","['Galimberti S', 'Canestraro M', 'Pacini S', 'Fazzi R', 'Orciuolo E', 'Trombi L', 'Mattii L', 'Battolla B', 'Capodanno A', 'Collecchi P', 'Veroni F', 'Simi P', 'Piaggi S', 'Casini A', 'Petrini M']","['Department of Oncology, Transplant and Advances in Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Pisa, Ospedale S.

A number of studies have suggested that changes in PU.1 concentration play a role in directing cell fate decisions during hematopoiesis. However, the stages of hematopoietic development at which changes in PU.1 concentration are important have not been defined until recently. Experiments using conditional null alleles, reporter alleles, and hypomorphic alleles of the Sfpi1 gene in mice demonstrate that PU.1 concentration is uniformly high during early stages of hematopoietic development. However, reduction of PU.1 concentration is required for normal development of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors, B cell progenitors, and T cell progenitors. PU.1 concentration increases in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Furthermore, experimental reduction of PU.1 concentration in the myeloid lineages leads to failed differentiation, abnormal proliferation, and leukemia.

It is of paramount importance, however, to distinguish between these 2 groups of patients because of differences in clinical sequelae, prognoses, and selection of treatment. OBJECTIVE: We thus sought to identify clinical and laboratory features that could be used to distinguish these 2 diagnoses. METHODS: We compared 12 patients with D816V-positive systemic mastocytosis with eosinophilia with 17 patients with FIP1L1/PDGFRA-positive CEL. Distinguishing features were used to create a risk factor scoring system. RESULTS: This system correctly classified 16 of 17 FIP1L1/PDGFRA-positive patients with CEL and all 12 patients with systemic mastocytosis with eosinophilia. Thirty-four FIP1L1/PDGFRA-positive patients described in the literature were also classified using this system, and although a complete set of data was not available for any of the historical patients, 21 were correctly classified. CONCLUSION: These results reinforce the hypothesis that the FIP1L1/PDGFRA gene fusion and D816V-KIT mutation cause distinct clinical syndromes. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This novel diagnostic approach should prove helpful in clinical practice in the evaluation of patients with increased mast cells and peripheral eosinophilia.","['Maric, Irina', 'Robyn, Jamie', 'Metcalfe, Dean D', 'Fay, Michael P', 'Carter, Melody', 'Wilson, Todd', 'Fu, Weiming', 'Stoddard, Jennifer', 'Scott, Linda', 'Hartsell, Marilyn', 'Kirshenbaum, Arnold', 'Akin, Cem', 'Nutman, Thomas B', 'Noel, Pierre', 'Klion, Amy D']","['Maric I', 'Robyn J', 'Metcalfe DD', 'Fay MP', 'Carter M', 'Wilson T', 'Fu W', 'Stoddard J', 'Scott L', 'Hartsell M', 'Kirshenbaum A', 'Akin C', 'Nutman TB', 'Noel P', 'Klion AD']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. marici@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Eosinophilia/*classification/diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*diagnosis/genetics/physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*metabolism']",2007/07/14 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/07/14 09:00'],"['2007/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2007 Sep;120(3):680-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2007.05.024.

DESIGN AND METHODS: The peripheral blood samples from thirty AML patients and thirty-six healthy subjects were collected and leukocytes, erythrocytes and plasma were separated for use in various parameter measurements. RESULTS: The generation of O(2)(-), as reflected by lucigenin-based CL (LBCL), by the leukocytes of patients with AML was found to be significantly elevated either in resting or stimuli-elicited condition as compared with that of healthy controls (p<0.05). Coincidentally, these data were matched up with the suppressed SOD activities, notably in Cu/Zn SOD isoform found in AML patients (p<0.05). Conversely, SOD and GPx activities in erythrocytes of patients with AML were shown to be significantly higher than their normal counterparts (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that altered expression of antioxidant enzymes and higher capability of O(2)(-) generation by leukocytes seem to be a distinct feature of AML.","['Er, Tze-Kiong', 'Tsai, Shih-Meng', 'Wu, Szu-Hsien', 'Chiang, Wen', 'Lin, Hsien-Cheng', 'Lin, Sheng-Fung', 'Wu, Szu-Hua', 'Tsai, Li-Yu', 'Liu, Tsan-Zon']","['Er TK', 'Tsai SM', 'Wu SH', 'Chiang W', 'Lin HC', 'Lin SF', 'Wu SH', 'Tsai LY', 'Liu TZ']","['Faculty of Biomedical Laboratory Science, College of Health Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Plasma/drug effects/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Zymosan/pharmacology']",2007/07/14 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/07/14 09:00'],"['2007/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2007 Sep;40(13-14):1015-9. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2007.05.013.

Cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase (CAK) complex, whose activity in phosphorylation of RAR alpha is determined by its targeting subunit menage a trois 1 (MAT1), regulates G(1) exit, a cell cycle stage when cells commonly commit to proliferation or to differentiation. We previously found that in myeloid leukemia cells, the lack of RA-induced RAR alpha-CAK dissociation and MAT1 degradation suppresses cell differentiation by inhibiting CAK-dependent G(1) exit and sustaining CAK hyperphosphorylation of RAR alpha. This contrasts with our recent findings about the P/D transition in normal primitive hematopoietic cells, where MAT1 degradation proceeds intrinsically together with granulocytic development, in accord with dynamic expression of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) 1A1 and 1B1, which catalyze RA synthesis. Blocking ALDH activity inhibits MAT1 degradation and granulocytic differentiation, whereas loss of RAR alpha phosphorylation by CAK induces RA-target gene expression and granulocytic differentiation. These studies suggest that the subversion of RAR alpha-CAK signaling during normal granulopoiesis is crucial to myeloid leukemogenesis and challenges the current paradigm that RA induces cell differentiation solely by transactivating target genes.

TRX is released in response to oxidative stress and shows various biologic functions from the extracellular environment. However, the mechanism by which extracellular TRX transduces the signal into the cells remains unclear. Here we report that the cysteine modification at the active site of TRX promotes the internalization of TRX into the cells. TRX-C35S, in which the cysteine at residue 35 of the active site was replaced with serine, was internalized more effectively than wild-type TRX in human T-cell leukemia virus-transformed T cells. TRX-C35S bound rapidly to the cell surface and was internalized into the cells dependent on lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. This process was inhibited by wild-type TRX, reducing reagents such as dithiothreitol, and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, which disrupts lipid rafts. Moreover, the internalized TRX-C35S binds to endogenous TRX, resulting in the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced cis-diamine-dichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP)-induced apoptosis via a ROS-mediated pathway involving apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1) activation.

Recent studies have revealed that endogenous Trx plays an important role in cytoprotection against various oxidative stress-associated disorders. However, the function of exogenous Trx is still not fully understood. We report here that a cysteine-modified mutant of recombinant human Trx (rhTrx-C35S) binds to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as well as stimulated T cells and rapidly enters these cells via lipid rafts. In addition, we found that endogenous Trx is expressed on the surface of HUVECs, including lipid rafts. These events suggest cell-surface Trx as a possible target of rhTrx-C35S. Furthermore, we found that anti-human Trx mouse monoclonal antibody inhibits adherence of LPS-stimulated human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) to HUVECs. This adherence was also suppressed by a recombinant human Trx (rhTrx), but not by a mutant rhTrx (rhTrx-C32S/C35S) with no reducing activity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Physical activity was assessed by self-report in 2,648 adult survivors of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Participants in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey administered through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used as a comparison group. RESULTS: Survivors had a mean age of 28.7 years (range, 18.0-44.0 years) and were a mean of 23.1 years from their cancer diagnosis (range, 16.0-33.8 years). In multivariate models, ALL survivors were more likely to not meet CDC recommendations for physical activity [odds ratio (OR), 1.44; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.32-1.57] and more likely to be inactive (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.56-1.94) in comparison with the BRFSS general population. Survivors treated with >20-Gy cranial radiotherapy were at particular risk. Compared with BRFSS participants and adjusted for age, race, and ethnicity, survivors were more likely to not meet CDC recommendations (females: OR, 2.07, 95% CI, 1.67-2.56; males: OR, 1.43, 95% CI, 1.16-1.76) and more likely to be inactive (females: OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.50-2.31; males: OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.45-2.32). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survivors of childhood ALL are less likely to meet physical activity recommendations and more likely to report no leisure-time physical activity in the past month. This level of inactivity likely further increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and all-cause mortality.","['Florin, Todd A', 'Fryer, G Edgar', 'Miyoshi, Thomas', 'Weitzman, Michael', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Emmons, Karen', 'Hinkle, Andrea', 'Whitton, John', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C']","['Florin TA', 'Fryer GE', 'Miyoshi T', 'Weitzman M', 'Mertens AC', 'Hudson MM', 'Sklar CA', 'Emmons K', 'Hinkle A', 'Whitton J', 'Stovall M', 'Robison LL', 'Oeffinger KC']","[""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Attitude to Health', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cohort Studies', '*Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leisure Activities', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', '*Survivors', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2007/07/14 09:00,2007/08/29 09:00,['2007/07/14 09:00'],"['2007/07/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2007 Jul;16(7):1356-63. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-0048.,,,"['R01 CA100474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100474-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-100474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA-55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['16/7/1356 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-0048 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17626743,NLM,MEDLINE,20091027,20171116,,26,7,2007 Jul,[Expression of Mer on Jurkat cells and its anti-apoptosis effect].,698-702,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Mer is a member of Axl receptor tyrosine kinase family; its ligand Gas6 can bind Mer, then stimulate the tyrosine kinase activity and downstream cell signal pathway of Mer, and take part in cell inflammation and apoptosis. There are more and more reports on Mer function, while few on its association with malignant diseases. This study was to detect the expression of Mer on T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat, and investigate its anti-apoptosis function and the mechanism. METHODS: Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to detect Mer expression on normal T cells and Jurkat cells. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to block the expression of Mer on Jurkat cells. The effect of Mer on the proliferation of Jurkat cells was assessed by MTT assay, and its effect on serum starvation-induced apoptosis was evaluated by FCM with Annexin V/PI double staining. The expression of apoptosis-associated genes Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 in Jurkat cells was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after Mer blocking. RESULTS: Mer was not expressed on normal T cells both from peripheral blood and bone marrow, but highly expressed on Jurkat cells with a positive rate of 51.1%. The inhibition rate of Mer expression on Jurkat cells by RNAi was 86.0%. After 48-hour serum starvation, the apoptosis rate was 15.3% in Mer-blocking Jurkat cells, and only 1.5% in control Jurkat cells. There was no significant difference in the proliferation rate of Jurkat cells between these 2 groups. After Mer blocking, Bcl-2 expression was decreased by 42.7% of control, Caspase-3 expression showed no significant change. CONCLUSION: Mer is highly expressed on Jurkat cells, and could inhibit cell apoptosis via Bcl-2 signaling pathway.","['Fan, Lei', 'Dai, Lan', 'Shen, Fei', 'Zhou, Meng-Yun', 'Dong, Ning-Zheng', 'Ruan, Chang-Geng']","['Fan L', 'Dai L', 'Shen F', 'Zhou MY', 'Dong NZ', 'Ruan CG']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affilianted Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215006, P.

We now show that lymphoma can occur, albeit infrequently (1 case of 20) and after extended periods of latency (7 years). Direct sequencing and reinfection experiments demonstrated that lymphomagenesis was not due to the reversion of the mutant to the wild type. Similar observations with another type of attenuated mutant impaired in the transmembrane protein (TM) YXXL signaling motifs were made.

We recently observed that IE2 can form dot-like structures even after infection of PML knockdown cells, which lack genuine ND10. To further analyze the determinants of IE2 subnuclear localization, a recombinant HCMV expressing IE2 fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein was constructed. We infected primary human fibroblasts expressing Sp100 fused to the autofluorescent protein mCherry while performing live-cell imaging experiments. These experiments revealed a very dynamic association of IE2 dots with ND10 structures during the first hours postinfection: juxtaposed structures rapidly fused to precise co-localizations, followed by segregation, and finally, the dispersal of ND10 accumulations. Furthermore, by infecting PML knockdown cells we determined that the number of IE2 accumulations was dependent on the multiplicity of infection. Since time-lapse microscopy in live-infected cells revealed that IE2 foci developed into viral replication compartments, we hypothesized that viral DNA could act as a determinant of IE2 accumulations. Direct evidence that IE2 molecules are associated with viral DNA early after HCMV infection was obtained using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Finally, a DNA-binding-deficient IE2 mutant could no longer be recruited into viral replication centers, suggesting that the association of IE2 with viral DNA is mediated by a direct DNA contact. Thus, we identified viral DNA as an important determinant of IE2 subnuclear localization, which suggests that the formation of a virus-induced nucleoprotein complex and its spatial organization is likely to be critical at the early stages of a lytic infection.","['Sourvinos, George', 'Tavalai, Nina', 'Berndt, Anja', 'Spandidos, Demetrios A', 'Stamminger, Thomas']","['Sourvinos G', 'Tavalai N', 'Berndt A', 'Spandidos DA', 'Stamminger T']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, University Hospital Erlangen, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (IE2 protein, Cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Antigens, Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'Autoantigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/pathology/virology', '*Genome, Viral/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Inclusion Bodies, Viral/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2007/07/13 09:00,2007/10/18 09:00,['2007/07/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Sep;81(18):10123-36. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01009-07.

So far, the experience of using MSC to treat GVHD is limited to a few cases, controversial results come from preclinical models and several issues remain to be clarified. The present studies were designed to address these questions in a xenogenic model testing the ability of umbilical cord blood-derived MSC (UCB-MSC) to prevent and/or treat GVHD. Sublethally irradiatiated non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency NOD/SCID mice transplanted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (huPBMC) showed extensive human T-cell proliferation in the peripheral blood, lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, which evolved in extensive GVHD (wasting, ruffled hair and hunched back). The mice treated with a single dose of UCB-MSC did not behave differently form the controls. However, when UCB-MSC were given at weekly intervals, there was a marked decrease in human T-cell proliferation and none of the mice developed GVHD. No therapeutic effect was obtained if UCB-MSC were administered at onset of GVHD. This work supports the clinical use of MSC in stem cell transplantation as a prophylaxis rather than treatment of GVHD.","['Tisato, V', 'Naresh, K', 'Girdlestone, J', 'Navarrete, C', 'Dazzi, F']","['Tisato V', 'Naresh K', 'Girdlestone J', 'Navarrete C', 'Dazzi F']","['Stem Cell Biology Section, Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, Imperial College, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/methods', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2007/07/13 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/07/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Sep;21(9):1992-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404847.

We studied, by real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR, the expression of 33 genes within the CDR that are known to be expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Genes in the 5q- samples that showed the most pronounced decrease in expression compared to non-5q- samples were: solute carrier family 36, member 1 (SLC36A1; 89% downregulated), Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding (G3BP; 79%), antioxidant protein 1 (ATOX1; 76%), colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor precursor (CSF1R; 76%), ribosomal protein S14 (RPS14; 74%), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRB; 73%), Nef-associated factor 1 (TNIP1; 72%), secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC; 71%), annexin VI (ANAX6; 69%), NSDT (66%) and TIGD (60%). We further studied the hematopoietic system in SPARC-null mice. These mice showed significantly lower platelet counts compared to wild-type animals (P=0.008). Although hemoglobin, hematocrit and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were lower in mice lacking SPARC, differences were not statistically significant. SPARC-null mice showed a significantly impaired ability to form erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E). However, no significant differences were found in the formation of erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E), granulocyte/monocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GM) or megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Mk) in these animals.

The mean (+/-s.d.) mutant allele burden was 52% (+/-29); 32 patients (18%) had greater than 75% mutant allele. The burden of JAK2(V617F) allele correlated with measurements of stimulated erythropoiesis (higher hematocrit, lower mean cell volume, serum ferritin and erythropoietin levels) and myelopoiesis (higher white cell count, neutrophil count and serum lactate dehydrogenase) and with markers of neutrophil activation (elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase and PRV-1 expression).

The BCL6 gene is often translocated and/or mutated in DLBCL. Therefore, we examined the BCL6 molecular alterations in these DLBCL subgroups, and their impact on BCL6 expression and BCL6 target gene repression. BCL6 translocations at the major breakpoint region (MBR) were detected in 25 (18.8%) of 133 DLBCL cases, with a higher frequency in the PM (33%) and ABC (24%) subgroups than in the GCB (10%) subgroup. Translocations at the alternative breakpoint region (ABR) were detected in five (6.4%) of 78 DLBCL cases, with three cases in ABC and one case each in the GCB and the unclassifiable subgroups. The translocated cases involved IgH and non-IgH partners in about equal frequency and were not associated with different levels of BCL6 mRNA and protein expression. BCL6 mutations were detected in 61% of DLBCL cases, with a significantly higher frequency in the GCB and PM subgroups (>70%) than in the ABC subgroup (44%). Exon-1 mutations were mostly observed in the GCB subgroup. The repression of known BCL6 target genes correlated with the level of BCL6 mRNA and protein expression in GCB and ABC subgroups but not with BCL6 translocation and intronic mutations. No clear inverse correlation between BCL6 expression and p53 expression was observed. Patients with higher BCL6 mRNA or protein expression had a significantly better overall survival. The biological role of BCL6 in translocated cases where repression of known target genes is not demonstrated is intriguing and warrants further investigation.","['Iqbal, J', 'Greiner, T C', 'Patel, K', 'Dave, B J', 'Smith, L', 'Ji, J', 'Wright, G', 'Sanger, W G', 'Pickering, D L', 'Jain, S', 'Horsman, D E', 'Shen, Y', 'Fu, K', 'Weisenburger, D D', 'Hans, C P', 'Campo, E', 'Gascoyne, R D', 'Rosenwald, A', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Delabie, J', 'Rimsza, L', 'Ott, G', 'Muller-Hermelink, H K', 'Connors, J M', 'Vose, J M', 'McKeithan, T', 'Staudt, L M', 'Chan, W C']","['Iqbal J', 'Greiner TC', 'Patel K', 'Dave BJ', 'Smith L', 'Ji J', 'Wright G', 'Sanger WG', 'Pickering DL', 'Jain S', 'Horsman DE', 'Shen Y', 'Fu K', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Hans CP', 'Campo E', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Rosenwald A', 'Jaffe ES', 'Delabie J', 'Rimsza L', 'Ott G', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Connors JM', 'Vose JM', 'McKeithan T', 'Staudt LM', 'Chan WC']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Introns', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/07/13 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/07/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Nov;21(11):2332-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404856.

NKG2D is a major activating immunoreceptor expressed in not only NK cells but also CD8+ T cells and shows cytotoxicity against tumors by recognizing its ligands major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A and B (MICA and MICB) on tumor cells. Recently, it has been suggested that NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity correlates with the expression levels of NKG2D ligands on target cells. In this study, we were able to increase the expression levels of MICA and MICB on leukemic cell lines and patients' leukemic cells by treatment with trichostatin A (TsA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that treatment with TsA resulted in increased acetylation of histone H3 and decreased association with HDAC1 at the promoters of MICA and MICB. Intriguingly, upregulation of MICA and MICB by treatment with TsA led to enhancement of the susceptibility of leukemic cells to the cytotoxicity of NKG2D-expressing cells. Our results suggest that regulation of the expression of NKG2D ligands by treatment with chromatin-remodeling drugs may be an attractive strategy for immunotherapy.","['Kato, N', 'Tanaka, J', 'Sugita, J', 'Toubai, T', 'Miura, Y', 'Ibata, M', 'Syono, Y', 'Ota, S', 'Kondo, T', 'Asaka, M', 'Imamura, M']","['Kato N', 'Tanaka J', 'Sugita J', 'Toubai T', 'Miura Y', 'Ibata M', 'Syono Y', 'Ota S', 'Kondo T', 'Asaka M', 'Imamura M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hokkaido University, Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (MHC class I-related chain A)', '0 (MICB antigen)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, MHC Class I', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell']",2007/07/13 09:00,2007/10/27 09:00,['2007/07/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Oct;21(10):2103-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404862.

In this study, we examine the role of Bmi-1 (B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1) as a regulator of human epidermal keratinocyte survival. We identify Bmi-1 mRNA and protein expression in epidermis and in cultured human keratinocytes. Bmi-1 is located in the nucleus in cultured keratinocytes, and in epidermis it is expressed in the basal and suprabasal layers. Adenovirus-delivered Bmi-1 promotes keratinocyte survival and protects keratinocytes from stress agent-mediated cell death. This is associated with increased levels of cyclin D1 and selected cyclin-dependent kinases, and reduced caspase activity and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Bmi-1 may be involved in the maintenance of disease state, as Bmi-1 levels are elevated in transformed keratinocytes, skin tumors, and psoriasis. The presence of Bmi-1 in suprabasal non-proliferative cells of the epidermis and within a high percentage of cells within skin tumors suggests a non-stem cell pro-survival role for Bmi-1 in this tissue. Based on the suprabasal distribution of Bmi-1 in epidermis, we propose that Bmi-1 may promote maintenance of suprabasal keratinocyte survival to prevent premature death during differentiation. Such a function would help assure proper formation of the stratified epidermis.","['Lee, Kathy', 'Adhikary, Gautam', 'Balasubramanian, Sivaprakasam', 'Gopalakrishnan, Ramamurthy', 'McCormick, Thomas', 'Dimri, Goberdhan P', 'Eckert, Richard L', 'Rorke, Ellen A']","['Lee K', 'Adhikary G', 'Balasubramanian S', 'Gopalakrishnan R', 'McCormick T', 'Dimri GP', 'Eckert RL', 'Rorke EA']","['Department of Physiology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RCC1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin D1/analysis', '*Epidermal Cells', 'Epidermis/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Psoriasis/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism']",2007/07/13 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/07/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2008 Jan;128(1):9-17. doi: 10.1038/sj.jid.5700949.

Highlights from the '43rd ASCO Annual Meeting'. Chicago, IL, USA. June 1-5, 2007.",365-73,"Pancreatic cancer remains a major therapeutic challenge in 2007. Most patients with advanced pancreatic cancer experience pain and must limit their daily activities because of tumor-related symptoms. Single-agent gemcitabine remains the standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer , which has shown improvement in disease-related symptoms and a modest benefit in survival. Recent phase III trials using gemcitabine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents have failed to show improvements in survival, although the gemcitabine/oxaliplatin and gemcitabine/capecitabine combinations have shown some promise. The combination of gemcitabine with erlotinib, though showed a statistically significant prolongation of survival, may not be clinically significant. Encouraging results in two separate phase II trials of gemcitabine in combination with bevacizumab and cetuximab respectively led to two major randomized comparative trials of the combination (Cancer and Leukemia Group B, CALGB 80303; Southwest Oncology Group, SWOG S0205). The results of these studies presented at the 43rd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, Chicago, IL, USA (June 1-5, 2007) showed no benefit of the combination. 'How can we change this bleak landscape?'. Probably by truly targeting our therapy with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents as well as other biologic agents by identifying those patients who are most likely to derive benefit and achieve meaningful responses. This is particularly crucial in a disease such as pancreatic cancer that has such a short life expectancy that the 'window' for any given treatment may be quite small. Consequently, further study should include the development of more predictive assays and improved exploitation of surrogate biomarkers of response. We need to study locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients separate from advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Role of multiple-targeted agents is also warranted. It's also time to investigate gemcitabine-free regimens. Two recent studies presented at ASCO showed that irinotecan/docetaxel or FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) can offer comparable results to gemcitabine when used as first-line treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. Development of novel agents and approaches, are urgently needed in conjunction with improvement in access to clinical trials for patients.","['Saif, Muhammad Wasif']",['Saif MW'],,['eng'],"['Congress', 'Editorial']",Italy,JOP,JOP : Journal of the pancreas,101091810,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Platinum Compounds)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors', 'Models, Biological', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Platinum Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors']",2007/07/13 09:00,2007/09/08 09:00,['2007/07/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,JOP. 2007 Jul 9;8(4):365-73.,,,,['v08i04a01 [pii]'],,,20070709,,,,,,,,,,,
17625285,NLM,MEDLINE,20070927,20171116,,11,2 Pt 1,2007 Apr-Jun,[Comparison of the present and previously used protocol of risk stratification in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia].,153-8,"INTRODUCTION: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is one of the most common cancers in children. In Poland, since November 2002 a new protocol of risk stratification has been recommended for assessment of risk factors and for choosing therapy regimens. AIM OF STUDY: assessment of accuracy of protocol ALL-IC 2002 in comparison to previously used risk stratification protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ALL was diagnosed in 100 children (44 girls, 56 boys; 1-18 years of age) in the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Warsaw Medical University, over the period from November 2002 to November 2006. According to the ALL-IC 2002 protocol the patients were divided into three risk groups: SR-standard, IR-intermediate and HR-high. The stratification was by age, leukocyte count, cytogenetic changes, early response to prednisone therapy and bone marrow remission. In the previously used risk stratification protocols-BFM-90, only hepatosplenomegaly and the number of blasts in peripheral blood (PB) were considered, and the patients were divided into three risk groups: low (LRG<0.8), medium (MRG) and high (HRG>1.2). RESULTS: out of the 100 patients qualified for treatment regimens according to the ALL-IC 2002 protocol, 97 entered remission, 11 died and 3 had a relapse. Under the ALL-IC 2002 protocol these children were stratified into the following groups: SR-31%, IR-44% and HR-25%. In the previously used stratification, there would be 26% children in low, 46% in the medium and 28% in the high risk group. According to the BFM-90 protocol 18/31 (58%) and 16/44 (36%) patients from the SR and IR groups respectively would be given more intensive treatment. On the other hand 11/44 (25%) and 14/25 (56%) patients from the IR and HR groups respectively would be given less intensive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: 1. ALL-IC 2002 protocol in comparison with the previously used protocol BFM-90, changes the qualification of children with ALL for the SR, IR and HR risk groups. This is linked to basic change of treatment protocol, adequate to severity of disease. 2. Children with ALL qualified according to protocol BFM-90 for moderate risk group (IR) constitute a mixed group in the ALL-IC 2002 classification.

AIM: clinical course and treatment of children afflicted with CN was analysed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: we present 60 children treated in our department due to CN. The diagnosis was based on: bone marrow smears, ANC, immunologic investigation. RESULTS: we established the diagnosis of: Kostmann disease (KD), cyclic neutropenia (CyN), hyperIgM syndrome (HIGM), Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) and chronic benign neutropenia (CBN) in: 4, 2, 2, 1, 21 and 20 children respectively. Due to positive results of tests: MAIGA, GIFT or GAT autoimmune neutropenia of infancy (AIN) was confirmed in 7 children. In 3 infants neutropenia was connected with HCMV- infection and Gancyclovir therapy. RHuG-CSF treatment was implemented in 14 and effective in 13 patients. A girl, suffering from KD, during rHuG-CSF therapy, developed chronic myeloblasts leucaemia and died. A boy, with the same diagnosis, underwent bone marrow transplantation from related donor but died from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Antibacterial prophylaxis was necessary in 29 children. We used Amoxicillin or Trimethoprim/Sulfametoxazole, obtaining decrease of frequency and severity of infections. During observation period all children suffered from upper respiratory tract infections, 19 had chronic gingivitis. Severe infections- bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, severe varicella and measles were observed in 30, 5, 2 and 1 patient respectively. A teenager, affected with SCN, died due to fulminant Clostridium perfringens infection. CONCLUSIONS: 1. RHuG-CSF therapy is essential in children with KD and SCN (when accompanied by severe infections). 2. AIN proved to be a mild condition, although ANC decreased below 500. In this entity rHuG-CSF is recommended during severe infections and before surgery. 3. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for children with: KD, CyN, GSD1b, CN in 1st year of life, HIGM; in other cases it is considered individually.","['Klaudel-Dreszler, Maja', 'Pietrucha, Barbara', 'Skopczynska, Hanna', 'Pac, Malgorzata', 'Kurenko-Deptuch, Magdalena', 'Heropolitanska-Pliszka, Edyta', 'Wolska-Kusnierz, Beata', 'Maslanka, Krystyna', 'Bernatowska, Ewa']","['Klaudel-Dreszler M', 'Pietrucha B', 'Skopczynska H', 'Pac M', 'Kurenko-Deptuch M', 'Heropolitanska-Pliszka E', 'Wolska-Kusnierz B', 'Maslanka K', 'Bernatowska E']","['Oddzial Immunologii, Klinika Gastroenterologii, Hepatologii i Immunologii, Instytut Pomnik Centrum Zdrowia Dziecka, Al.

Because the immune response plays a critical role in each of these diseases, it is important to study the effects of toxicants on the developing immune system. Children's unique susceptibility to environmental toxicants has become an important focus of the field of immunotoxicology and the use of immune biomarkers in molecular epidemiology of children's environmental health is a rapidly expanding field of research. In this review, we discuss how markers of immune status and immunotoxicity are being applied to pediatric studies, with a specific focus on the various methods used to analyze T-helper-1/2 (Th1/Th2) cytokine profiles. Furthermore, we review recent data on the effects of children's environmental exposures to volatile organic compounds, metals, and pesticides on Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles and the associations of Th1/Th2 profiles with adverse health outcomes such as pediatric respiratory diseases, allergies, cancer and diabetes. Although cytokine profiles are increasingly used in children's studies, there is still a need to acquire distribution data for different ages and ethnic groups of healthy children. These data will contribute to the validation and standardization of cytokine biomarkers for future studies. Application of immunological markers in epidemiological studies will improve the understanding of mechanisms that underlie associations between environmental exposures and immune-mediated disorders.","['Duramad, Paurene', 'Tager, Ira B', 'Holland, Nina T']","['Duramad P', 'Tager IB', 'Holland NT']","[""Children's Environmental Health Center, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-7360, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)']",IM,"['Antibodies/blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Cytokines/*blood', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health/*methods/standards', '*Environmental Monitoring/standards', 'Environmental Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immune System/cytology/*drug effects/growth & development/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Th1 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Toxicology/*methods/standards']",2007/07/13 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/07/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2007 Jul 30;172(1-2):48-59. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2007.05.017.

As(III), in particular, reacts with closely spaced protein thiols, forming stable cyclic dithioarsinite complexes in which both sulfur atoms are bound to arsenic. It is this reaction that is mostly responsible for arsenics cytotoxicity. Arsenic compounds have been used as medicinal agents for many centuries for the treatment of diseases such as psoriasis, syphilis, and rheumatosis. From the 1700's until the introduction of and use of modern chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the mid 1900's, arsenic was a mainstay in the treatment of leukemia. Concerns about the toxicity of arsenical compounds led eventually to their abandonment for the treatment of cancer. The discovery in the 1980's that arsenic trioxide induces complete remission in a high percentage of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia has awakened interest in this metalloid for the treatment of human disease. In particular, a new class or organoarsenicals are being trialed for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors.

In this study, we explored the effects of okadaic acid (OA), the phosphatase inhibitor, and retinoic acid (RA) in v-myb-transformed monoblasts BM2. OA induced differentiation of BM2 monoblasts into macrophage-like cells, as documented by analyses of cell morphology, cell cycle, phagocytic activity, non-specific esterase activity, production of reactive oxygen species and expression of vimentin and Mo-1. In contrast to many other leukemic cell lines, BM2 cells do not respond to retinoic acid. However, once exposed to OA and RA simultaneously, BM2 cells differentiate along monocyte/macrophage pathway more efficiently. We conclude that RA enhances differentiation of v-myb-transformed monoblasts induced by protein phosphorylation.","['Benes, Petr', 'Maceckova, Vendula', 'Zatloukalova, Jirina', 'Kovarova, Lucie', 'Smardova, Jana', 'Smarda, Jan']","['Benes P', 'Maceckova V', 'Zatloukalova J', 'Kovarova L', 'Smardova J', 'Smarda J']","['Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Genetics and Molecular Biology, Kotlarska 2, 611 37 Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chickens', 'Genes, myb', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Okadaic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2007/07/13 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/07/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2007/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Oct;31(10):1421-31. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.03.005.

DATA SOURCES: Published articles (2001 - 2006) about microRNAs and malignant lymphoproliferative disorders were selected using MEDLINE. STUDY SELECTION: After independent review by two observers, 43 of 421 originally identified articles were selected that specifically addressed the stated purpose. RESULTS: Two observers independently assessed studies using explicit methodological criteria for evaluating microRNAs in malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. Recent work has revealed a class of small noncoding RNA species, microRNAs, which affect various biological processes. MicroRNAs inhibit the expression of protein encoding genes at the posttranscriptional level in a variety of eukaryotic organisms. In this review, we focused on the biogenetic pathways of microRNAs (miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-155, miR-17-92 cluster, miR-142) and discussed the implications for human malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. CONCLUSIONS: microRNAs are involved in tumorigenesis and mediate gene regulation as a fundamental genetic program at the posttranscriptional level. Further study of microRNAs may lead to novel concepts in the diagnosis and treatment of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-yong']","['Xu W', 'Li JY']","['Department of Haematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/analysis/*physiology']",2007/07/13 09:00,2007/08/03 09:00,['2007/07/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2007 Jun 5;120(11):996-9.,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are few reports dealing with the effects of dopamine on leukaemia cells. However, some dopamine agonists or antagonists do show biological effects on some types of leukaemia cells. Here, we report the effects of dopamine on the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of K562 leukaemia cells. METHODS: Proliferation was determined by MTT assay and cell counting both in liquid and semisolid cultures. Differentiation was verified by morphology, benzidine staining and flow cytometry. Apoptosis was checked by Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry. The two groups were untreated group and treated group (dopamine 10(-9) mol/L - 10(-4) mol/L). RESULTS: In liquid culture, MTT assay and colony assay, dopamine inhibited proliferation of K562 cells. Inhibition rate was 29.28% at 10(-6) mol/L and 36.10% at 10(-5) mol/L after culture for 5 days in MTT assay. In benzidine staining and CD71 expression, dopamine induced K562 cells toward erythroid differentiation by increased 155% at 10(-6) mol/L and by 171% at 10(-5) mol/L after culture for 5 days in benzidine staining. In Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry, dopamine induced K562 cells toward apoptosis. The sub G1 peak stained by PI was 14.23% at 10(-4) mol/L dopamine after culture for 3 days compared with the control (0.81%) in flow cytometry. CONCLUSION: Dopamine inhibites proliferation and induces both differentiation and apoptosis of K562 leukaemia cells.","['He, Qun', 'Yuan, Lin-bo']","['He Q', 'Yuan LB']","['Research Laboratory of Blood Physiology, Department of Physiology, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha 410078, China. hequn888@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,['VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dopamine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/cytology/*drug effects']",2007/07/13 09:00,2007/08/03 09:00,['2007/07/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2007 Jun 5;120(11):970-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is involved in many physiological processes, at the same time, however, it is involved also in the progress of tumoral growth. Although a lot is known about angiogenesis in solid tumors where it plays a role in tumoral invasion and its metastatic potential, in hematological malignancies it has been appreciated only recently. However, the results of studies on abnormal angiogenesis in hematological malignancies are inconsistent. Angiogenesis can be studied at different levels; histologically, it is studied in the infiltrated tissues (lymph nodes, bone marrow) and quantified as microvessel density (MVD). The aims of our study were to introduce the method of MVD quantification in the bonemarrow using immunohistochemical detection of endothelial markers (fVIII) and then evaluate MVD in bone marrow samples in a group of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and compare the results with a control group of patients (CON). CLL is a typical malignancy of the hematopoietic tissue but the course and the prognosis of patients with this disease vary considerably. For this reason there is urgent need for novel prognostic markers in order to assess individual patient prognosis and tailor treatment. Angiogenesis is one of the possible markers which may add more informations about the course of this disease. So far only few studies have been published about angiogenesis measured as MVD in CLL patients andthe results are inconsistent. In our study, both the number and the area of microvessels were increased in bone marrow of patients with CLL, but the number and area of sinuses were not. It can be concluded that there are signs of abnormal angiogenesis in bone marrow of patients with CLL but larger study with longer follow-up is needed to give more specific information about prognostic value of these findings.","['Kasparova, P', 'Smolej, L']","['Kasparova P', 'Smolej L']","['Fingerlanduv ustav patologie, Fakultni nemocnice, Univerzity Karlovy, Hradec Kralove. benespet@seznam.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Cesk Patol,Ceskoslovenska patologie,0050734,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*blood supply/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Microcirculation/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/diagnosis/*pathology', 'von Willebrand Factor/analysis']",2007/07/13 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/07/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cesk Patol. 2007 Apr;43(2):50-8.,,,,,Angiogeneze v kostni dreni u pacientu s chronickou lymfocytdarni leukemii.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to morphology and immunohistochemistry, the last WHO (2001) classification also utilizes cytogenetics and molecular biology. In many cases classification notices oncogenic mechanisms. The authors describe some differences in immunophenotype in certain entities: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma--CLL/SLL, follicular lymphoma--FL, mantle cell lymphoma--MCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma--DLBCL, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma--ALCL, mainly with respect to prognosis. The authors point out to heterogeneity within the individual types of lymphomas from the point of view of morphology, immunohistochemistry and molecular biology. Recently it has been shown, that differences in prognosis are not limited to individual nosologic entities, but also may be found within the particular category of lymphoma. For example, CLL/SLL is divided in two different subunits according to mutational status of variable segment (VH) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. The cases with unmutated VH segment display progressive disease which is in contrast to cases with the same morphology but with mutated VH segment. Similar differences were found in MCL. Attention is drawn to oncogenic and apoptosis-regulating mechanisms, such as gene p53 and the Bcl-2 family.","['Macak, J', 'Plank, L']","['Macak J', 'Plank L']","['Ustav patologie, Lekarske fakulty Masarykovy univerzity a Fakultni nemocnice, Brno. jmacak@fnbrno.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Czech Republic,Cesk Patol,Ceskoslovenska patologie,0050734,,IM,"['Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*classification/pathology']",2007/07/13 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/07/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cesk Patol. 2007 Apr;43(2):39-49.,56,,,,Ne-Hodgkinske lymfomy.

The cytogenetic response rates were 80%, 41.7% and 18.2% in chronic, accelerated and blast crisis phase respectively (p < 0.005). Twenty-six percent of patients developed anaemia, 13% had neutropenia and 12% had thrombocytopenia after starting on treatment. In addition, 14% of patients developed peripheral oedema, 13% complained of musculoskeletal pain, 12% had gastrointestinal side effects which include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, 9% had grade 1 hepatotoxicity, 7% developed skin rashes and one patient had an abnormal renal function test. Patients taking 600mg or higher dosage of imatinib had more gastrointestinal side effects. Patients who weighed less than 60kg had a much higher risk of developing anaemia. Anaemia was a negative predictor of cytogenetic response. Presenting high white blood cell counts and absence of cytogenetic response were also negative predictors of survival. Overall survival was 87%. This was affected by the different phases of disease (chronic phase was better than accelerated and blast crisis) (p < 0.001).

Lonafarnib can inhibit the proliferation of imatinib-resistant cells and increases imatinib-induced apoptosis in vitro in cells from imatinib-resistant patients. METHODS: The authors conducted a phase 1 study of lonafarnib in combination with imatinib in patients with CML who failed imatinib therapy. The starting dose level for patients with chronic phase (CP) disease was imatinib, 400 mg/day, plus lonafarnib at a dose of 100 mg twice daily. The starting dose levels for accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP) disease were 600 mg/day and 100 mg twice daily, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients were treated (9 with CP, 11 with AP, and 3 with BP) for a median of 25 weeks (range, 4-102 weeks). Of those with CP disease, 2 patients had grade 3 (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]) dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at the 400 + 125-mg dose, including diarrhea (2 patients), vomiting (1 patient), and fatigue (1 patient). In patients with AP/BP disease, DLTs were observed at the 600 + 125-mg dose and was comprised of diarrhea (1 patient) and hypokalemia (1 patient). Eight patients (35%) responded; 3 with CP disease achieved a complete hematologic response (CHR) (2 patients) and a complete cytogenetic response (1 patient). Three patients with AP disease responded (2 CHR, 1 partial cytogenetic response), and 2 patients with BP disease demonstrated hematologic improvement. Pharmacokinetics data suggest no apparent increase in exposure or changes in the pharmacokinetics of either lonafarnib or imatinib when they are coadministered. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicate that the combination of lonafarnib and imatinib is well tolerated and the maximum tolerated dose of lonafarnib is 100 mg twice daily when combined with imatinib at a dose of either 400 mg or 600 mg daily.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Daley, George Q', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Koller, Charles', 'Zhu, Yali', 'Statkevich, Paul', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Cortes J', 'Jabbour E', 'Daley GQ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Verstovsek S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Koller C', 'Zhu Y', 'Statkevich P', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Here the authors describe the ability of US birth registries to release information sufficient to locate potential control subjects for two ongoing case-control studies of hepatoblastoma and infant leukemia. The birth registries of 32 states, in which 75.8% of US children 0-5 years of age resided in 2004, agreed to participate in control selection. Data sufficient to track participants and to characterize nonrespondents were available from a majority of registries.

Allogeneic transplantation could reconstitute the immune system potentially arresting the progression of autoimmune disease. The purpose of this paper is to report a patient with MS who underwent allogeneic BMT for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and showed continued evidence of active demyelinating disease by clinical and radiologic criteria over a period of two years.

For example, the goal could be to determine whether the frequency of pain episodes is significantly reduced in the treatment group (arm A) as compared to the control group (arm B). However, for ethical or regulatory reasons, group sequential designs are commonly employed. Then, based on a binomial distribution, the stopping boundaries for the interim analyses are constructed for assessing the difference in the response probabilities between the two groups. This is easily accomplished by using any of the standard procedures, e.g., those discussed by Jennison and Turnbull (2000), and using one of the most commonly used software packages, East (2000). Several factors are known to often affect the primary outcome of interest, but their true distributions are not known in advance. In addition, these factors may cause heterogeneous treatment responses among individuals in a group, and their exact effect size may be unknown. To limit the effect of such factors on the comparison of the two arms, stratified randomization is used in the actual conduct of the trial. Then, a stratified analysis based on the odds ratio proposed in Jennison and Turnbull (2000, pages 251-252) and consistent with the stratified design is undertaken. However, the stopping rules used for the interim analyses are those obtained for determining the differences in response rates in a design that was not stratified. The purpose of this paper is to assess the robustness of such an approach on the performance of the odds ratio test when the underlying distribution and effect size of the factors that influence the outcome may vary. The simulation studies indicate that, in general, the stratified approach offers consistently better results than does the unstratified approach, as long as the difference in the weighted average of the response probabilities across strata between the two groups remains closer to the hypothesized values, irrespective of the differences in the (allocation) distributions and heterogeneous response rate. However, if the response probabilities deviate significantly from the hypothesized values so that the difference in the weighted average is less than the hypothesized value, then the proposed study could be significantly underpowered.","['Srivastava, Deo Kumar', 'Rai, Shesh N', 'Pan, Jianmin']","['Srivastava DK', 'Rai SN', 'Pan J']","[""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. kumar.srivastava@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Biom J,Biometrical journal.

Recently, plasma membrane lipid rafts have been shown to play important roles in the process of phagocytosis in neutrophils. To characterize the proteins involved in phagocytosis and to elucidate the process by which they acquire phagocytic activity, we investigated by nano-LC-MS/MS analysis the changes in protein composition of plasma membrane lipid rafts during DMSO-induced differentiation of the human leukemia cell line HL-60 cells into neutrophilic lineage. Based on the spectrum counts of 147 proteins identified, 25 proteins were upregulated and 49 were downregulated by DMSO treatment. CD11b/CD18 subunits of beta2-integrin Mac-1, CD35, and GPI-80, which are known to be upregulated during differentiation, were dominantly detected in the lipid rafts of DMSO-treated cells. Many known membrane proteins, G proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins were also detected and they showed characteristic distributions. Absolute quantification of nine proteins in the lipid rafts using internal standard peptides labeled with stable isotopes showed that the amount of protein almost corresponded to the results obtained by spectrum count. Identified proteins, expression of which was altered by DMSO treatment, are expected to be candidate proteins involved in differentiation and functions of neutrophils.","['Yanagida, Mitsuaki', 'Nakayama, Hitoshi', 'Yoshizaki, Fumiko', 'Fujimura, Tsutomu', 'Takamori, Kenji', 'Ogawa, Hideoki', 'Iwabuchi, Kazuhisa']","['Yanagida M', 'Nakayama H', 'Yoshizaki F', 'Fujimura T', 'Takamori K', 'Ogawa H', 'Iwabuchi K']","['Institute for Environmental and Gender-specific Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tomioka, Urayasu-shi, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Down-Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Microdomains/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phagocytosis', '*Proteomics', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/07/12 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/07/12 09:00'],"['2007/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proteomics. 2007 Jul;7(14):2398-409. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200700056.,,,,['10.1002/pmic.200700056 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite significant progress and success in the treatment of ALL, a significant number of children continue to relapse and for them, outcome remains poor. Therefore, the search for novel therapeutic approaches is warranted. The aim of this study was to investigate the AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a potential target in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) subtypes characterized by non-random translocation signature profiles. We evaluated the effects of the AMPK activator AICAR on cell growth, cell cycle regulators and apoptosis of various childhood ALL cells. RESULTS: We found that treatment with AICAR inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest in G1-phase, and apoptosis in CCRF-CEM (T-ALL), NALM6 (Bp-ALL), REH (Bp-ALL, TEL/AML1) and SupB15 (Bp-ALL, BCR/ABL) cells. These effects were abolished by treatment with the adenosine kinase inhibitor 5'-iodotubericidin prior to addition of AICAR indicating that AICAR's cytotoxicity is mediated through AMPK activation. Moreover, we determined that growth inhibition exerted by AICAR was associated with activation of p38-MAPK and increased expression of the cell cycle regulators p27 and p53. We also demonstrated that AICAR mediated apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway as revealed by the release of cytochrome C and cleavage of caspase 9. Additionally, AICAR treatment resulted in phosphorylation of Akt suggesting that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway may represent a compensatory survival mechanism in response to apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest. Combined treatment with AICAR and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin resulted in additive anti-proliferative activity ALL cells. CONCLUSION: AICAR-mediated AMPK activation was found to be a proficient cytotoxic agent in ALL cells and the mechanism of its anti-proliferative and apoptotic effect appear to be mediated via activation of p38-MAPK pathway, increased expression of cell cycle inhibitory proteins p27 and p53, and downstream effects on the mTOR pathway, hence exhibiting therapeutic potential as a molecular target for the treatment of childhood ALL. Therefore, activation of AMPK by AICAR represents a novel approach to targeted therapy, and suggests a role for AICAR in combination therapy with inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways for the treatment of childhood in ALL.","['Sengupta, Tapas K', 'Leclerc, Gilles M', 'Hsieh-Kinser, Ting Ting', 'Leclerc, Guy J', 'Singh, Inderjit', 'Barredo, Julio C']","['Sengupta TK', 'Leclerc GM', 'Hsieh-Kinser TT', 'Leclerc GJ', 'Singh I', 'Barredo JC']","['School of Life Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata, India. senguptk@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '24386-93-4 (5-iodotubercidin)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'F0X88YW0YK (AICA ribonucleotide)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/pathology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Tubercidin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2007/07/12 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/07/12 09:00'],"['2007/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2007 Jul 10;6:46. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-6-46.,,,"['R01 CA098152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA098152-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['1476-4598-6-46 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-6-46 [doi]']",,,20070710,,PMC1948012,,,,,,,,,

The t(12;21) translocation leads to the expression of a novel fusion gene, TEL-AML1 (ETV6-RUNX1), and HeH often involves tri- and tetrasomy for chromosome 21. The presence of TEL-AML1+ and HeH cells in utero prior to the development of leukaemia suggests that these lesions play a critical role in ALL initiation. Based on our previous analysis of HLA-DP in childhood ALL, and evidence from in vitro studies that TEL-AML1 can activate HLA-DP-restricted T cell responses, we hypothesised that the development of TEL-AML1+ ALL might be influenced by the child's DPB1 genotype. To test this, we analysed the frequency of six HLA-DPB1 supertypes in a population-based series of childhood leukaemias (n = 776) classified by their karyotype (TEL-AML1+, HeH and others), in comparison with newborn controls (n = 864). One DPB1 supertype (GKD) conferred significant protection against TEL-AML1+ ALL (odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.42, 0.22-0.81; p < 0.005) and HeH ALL (OR; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.30-0.65; p < 0.0001). These negative associations were almost entirely due to a single allele, DPB1*0101. Our results suggest that DPB1*0101 may afford protection from the development of TEL-AML1+ and HeH BCP ALL, possibly as the result of a DP-restricted immune response to BCP ALL-associated antigen(s), the identification of which could have important implications for the design of prophylactic vaccines.","['Taylor, Malcolm', 'Harrison, Christine', 'Eden, Tim', 'Birch, Jillian', 'Greaves, Mel', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Hussain, Adiba']","['Taylor M', 'Harrison C', 'Eden T', 'Birch J', 'Greaves M', 'Lightfoot T', 'Hussain A']","[""Cancer Immunogenetics Laboratory, St Mary's Hospital, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 0JH, UK. gmtaylor@manchester.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'HLA-DP Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*prevention & control', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/07/12 09:00,2008/03/05 09:00,['2007/07/12 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2008 Jan;57(1):53-61. doi: 10.1007/s00262-007-0349-5.

Differential expression was initially identified by microarray analysis and confirmed by real time PCR in 42 B-CLL patients. mRNA expression ranged from 0.3- to 375.4-fold compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC). Expression levels in CD19+ B-CLL cells were 100-fold higher than in B-cells from healthy donors. PEG10 expression levels in B-CLL patient samples remained stable over time even after chemotherapy. High PEG10 expression correlated with high LPL expression (p=0.001) and a positive Coombs' test (p=0.04). Interestingly, similar expression patterns were observed for the neighbouring imprinted gene sarcoglycan-epsilon (SGCE). Monoallelic expression and maintained imprinting of PEG10 were found by allele- or methylation-specific PCR. The intensity of intracellular staining of PEG10 protein corresponded to mRNA levels as confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Short term knock-down of PEG10 in B-CLL cells and HepG2 cells was not associated with changes in cell survival but resulted in a significant change in the expression of 80 genes. However, long term inhibition of PEG10 led to induction of apoptosis in B-CLL cells. Our data indicate (i) a prognostic value of PEG10 in B-CLL patients; (ii) specific deregulation of the imprinted locus at 7q21 in high-risk B-CLL; (iii) a potential functional and biological role of PEG10 protein expression. Altogether, PEG10 represents a novel marker in B-CLL.","['Kainz, Birgit', 'Shehata, Medhat', 'Bilban, Martin', 'Kienle, Dirk', 'Heintel, Daniel', 'Kromer-Holzinger, Elisabeth', 'Le, Trang', 'Krober, Alexander', 'Heller, Gerwin', 'Schwarzinger, Ilse', 'Demirtas, Dita', 'Chott, Andreas', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Zochbauer-Muller, Sabine', 'Fonatsch, Christa', 'Zielinski, Christoph', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Gaiger, Alexander', 'Wagner, Oswald', 'Jager, Ulrich']","['Kainz B', 'Shehata M', 'Bilban M', 'Kienle D', 'Heintel D', 'Kromer-Holzinger E', 'Le T', 'Krober A', 'Heller G', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Demirtas D', 'Chott A', 'Dohner H', 'Zochbauer-Muller S', 'Fonatsch C', 'Zielinski C', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Gaiger A', 'Wagner O', 'Jager U']","['Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PEG10 protein, human)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (seven in absentia proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomic Imprinting/*genetics', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Polysaccharides/metabolism', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics']",2007/07/11 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/07/11 09:00'],"['2007/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 Nov 1;121(9):1984-93. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22929.,,,,['10.1002/ijc.22929 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

This prospective, community-based study evaluated the effectiveness of pegfilgrastim in patients with lymphoma who were also receiving chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged > or = 18 years with cancer other than leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes were eligible, including patients with major comorbidities who were generally not eligible for most clinical trials. Key exclusions were weekly chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy. Patients received pegfilgrastim 6 mg approximately 24 hours after chemotherapy in each cycle (up to 8 cycles). Endpoints included neutropenic complications and serious adverse events. RESULTS: This open-label single-arm study enrolled 2249 patients at 319 sites. Of these 2249 patients, 325 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 46 patients with Hodgkin disease were included in the primary analysis set. The median age was 65 years for patients with NHL and 41 years for patients with Hodgkin disease, and 31% and 26% had major comorbidities, respectively. Few patients experienced neutropenic complications, including grade 4 febrile neutropenia (patients with Hodgkin disease: 0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0-8%]; patients with NHL: 13% [95% CI, 10%-17%]); febrile neutropenia-related hospitalization (patients with Hodgkin disease: 0 [95% CI, 0-8%]; patients with NHL: 10% [95% CI, 7%-14%]), neutropenia-related dose reduction (patients with Hodgkin disease: 0 [95% CI, 0-8%]; patients with NHL: 5% [95% CI, 3%-8%]), and neutropenia-related dose delay (patients with Hodgkin disease: 0 [95% CI, 0-8%]; patients with NHL: 5% [95% CI, 3%-8%]). Serious adverse events were consistent with those observed in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with lymphoma receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy supported by pegfilgrastim experienced few neutropenic complications or neutropenia-related alterations in chemotherapy dose and schedule.","['Noga, Stephen J', 'Choksi, Janak K', 'Ding, Beiying', 'Dreiling, Lyndah', 'Ozer, Howard']","['Noga SJ', 'Choksi JK', 'Ding B', 'Dreiling L', 'Ozer H']","['Department of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Alvin and Lois Lapidus Cancer Institute, 2401 W.

Participants in this cross-sectional study were recruited from urban medical centers as part of a larger study of HSCT survivors. The sample comprised 236 adults who were on average 3.4 years since transplant. Psychological distress was measured by a commonly used self-report questionnaire, the Brief Symptom Inventory. Clinically elevated psychological distress caseness was present in 43% of long-term HSCT survivors. Elevations were highest on clinical subscales of obsessive-compulsiveness, somatization, and psychoticism. However, item-level analyses revealed that the content of the most frequently reported symptoms included trouble with memory and feelings of loneliness. Results of this study suggest that HSCT survivors may experience memory and existential concerns and that such symptoms may not represent psychiatric sequelae.","['Rusiewicz, Anna', 'DuHamel, Katherine N', 'Burkhalter, Jack', 'Ostroff, Jamie', 'Winkel, Gary', 'Scigliano, Eileen', 'Papadopoulos, Esperanza', 'Moskowitz, Craig', 'Redd, William']","['Rusiewicz A', 'DuHamel KN', 'Burkhalter J', 'Ostroff J', 'Winkel G', 'Scigliano E', 'Papadopoulos E', 'Moskowitz C', 'Redd W']","['Program for Cancer Prevention and Control, Derald H.

In addition to structural genes, HTLV-I encodes regulatory and accessory genes in the pX region. Among them, Tax is thought to play a central role in leukaemogenesis through its potent transforming activity. However, since Tax is a major target of the host immune system, its expression is often lost in ATL cells, indicating Tax is dispensable in the last phase of leukaemogenesis. The HTLV-I bZIP factor (HBZ), encoded on the HTLV-I minus strand, was recently shown to be expressed in all ATL cells, and to support growth of human T-cell lines. These findings suggest that HBZ is critical to ATL onset.

However, little is known about the interaction partners or signaling pathways involved in the Ski-mediated block of differentiation in hematopoietic cells. Here we show that Ski interacts with PU.1, a lineage-specific transcription factor essential for terminal myeloid differentiation, and thereby represses PU.1-dependent transcriptional activation. Consistent with this, Ski inhibits the biological function of PU.1 to promote myeloid cells to differentiate into macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR)-positive macrophages. Using a Ski mutant deficient in PU.1 binding, we demonstrate that Ski-PU.1 interaction is critical for Ski's ability to repress PU.1-dependent transcription and block macrophage differentiation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Ski-mediated repression of PU.1 is due to Ski's ability to recruit histone deacetylase 3 to PU.1 bound to DNA. Since inactivation of PU.1 is closely related to the development of myeloid leukemia and Ski strongly inhibits PU.1 function, we propose that aberrant Ski expression in certain types of myeloid cell lineages might contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Ueki, N', 'Zhang, L', 'Hayman, M J']","['Ueki N', 'Zhang L', 'Hayman MJ']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '126648-96-2 (SKI protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*cytology/immunology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2007/07/11 09:00,2008/02/19 09:00,['2007/07/11 09:00'],"['2007/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jan 10;27(3):300-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210654.

Surgery is the primary modality for managing early-stage disease, but most patients who undergo a curative resection develop locoregional or distant recurrence. Consequently, there has been great interest in evaluating strategies to prevent recurrences and improve overall mortality. This article is a review of data on adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment approaches for gastric cancer, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy. Compared with surgery alone, the North American Intergroup 0116 trial demonstrated a clear survival benefit with the administration of a postoperative regimen of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and external beam radiation therapy, and these findings have made concurrent chemoradiation a standard of care in patients with resected gastric cancer. More recently, the British Medical Research Council Adjuvant Gastric Cancer Infusional Chemotherapy (MAGIC) study found that preoperative and postoperative administration of epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil significantly improved survival beyond surgery alone. Thus, after decades of negative studies, 2 successful strategies in localized gastric cancer are now available. Ongoing and proposed trials include the current Intergroup study (Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80101), which is assessing the role of a potentially more active postoperative chemoradiation regimen. The proposed MAGIC-B study will examine the role of adding bevacizumab to perioperative chemotherapy, and the planned CRITICS study by the Dutch Gastric Cancer Group will evaluate the role of postoperative chemoradiation in combination with preoperative chemotherapy.","['Ng, Kimmie', 'Meyerhardt, Jeffrey A', 'Fuchs, Charles S']","['Ng K', 'Meyerhardt JA', 'Fuchs CS']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. kng4@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer J,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",100931981,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects/*methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Survival Analysis']",2007/07/11 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/07/11 09:00'],"['2007/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer J. 2007 May-Jun;13(3):168-74. doi: 10.1097/PPO.0b013e318074e351.,44,,['T32 CA009172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['10.1097/PPO.0b013e318074e351 [doi]', '00130404-200705000-00006 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies suggest that these proteins may be a viable target in leukemia because they have been found to be variably expressed in acute leukemias and are associated with chemosensitivity, chemoresistance, disease progression, remission, and patient survival. Another promising therapeutic target, FLT3, is mutated in about one third of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients; promising results have recently been achieved in clinical trials investigating the effects of the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKC412 on AML patients harboring mutations in the FLT3 protein. Of growing concern, however, is the development of drug resistance resulting from the emergence of point mutations in targeted tyrosine kinases used for treatment of acute leukemia patients. One approach to overriding resistance is to combine structurally unrelated inhibitors and/or inhibitors of different signaling pathways. The proapoptotic IAP inhibitor, LBW242, was shown in proliferation studies done in vitro to enhance the killing of PKC412-sensitive and PKC412-resistant cell lines expressing mutant FLT3 when combined with either PKC412 or standard cytotoxic agents (doxorubicin and Ara-c). In addition, in an in vivo imaging assay using bioluminescence as a measure of tumor burden, a total of 12 male NCr-nude mice were treated for 10 days with p.o. administration of vehicle, LBW242 (50 mg/kg/day), PKC412 (40 mg/kg/day), or a combination of LBW242 and PKC412; the lowest tumor burden was observed in the drug combination group.

Here we found that PGC-1alpha is a short lived and aggregation-prone protein. PGC-1alpha localized throughout the nucleoplasm and was rapidly destroyed via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Upon proteasome inhibition, PGC-1alpha formed insoluble polyubiquitinated aggregates. Ubiquitination of PGC-1alpha depended on the integrity of the C terminus-containing arginine-serine-rich domains and an RNA recognition motif. Interestingly, ectopically expressed C-terminal fragment of PGC-1alpha was autonomously ubiquitinated and aggregated with promyelocytic leukemia protein. Cooperation of the N-terminal region containing two PEST-like motifs was required for prevention of aggregation and targeting of the polyubiquitinated PGC-1alpha for degradation. This region thereby negatively controlled the aggregation properties of the C-terminal region to regulate protein turnover and intranuclear compartmentalization of PGC-1alpha. Exogenous expression of the PGC-1alpha C-terminal fragment interfered with degradation of full-length PGC-1alpha and enhanced its coactivation properties. We concluded that PGC-1alpha function is critically regulated at multiple steps via intramolecular cooperation among several distinct structural domains of the protein.","['Sano, Motoaki', 'Tokudome, Satori', 'Shimizu, Noriaki', 'Yoshikawa, Noritada', 'Ogawa, Chie', 'Shirakawa, Kousuke', 'Endo, Jin', 'Katayama, Takaharu', 'Yuasa, Shinsuke', 'Ieda, Masaki', 'Makino, Shinji', 'Hattori, Fumiyuki', 'Tanaka, Hirotoshi', 'Fukuda, Keiichi']","['Sano M', 'Tokudome S', 'Shimizu N', 'Yoshikawa N', 'Ogawa C', 'Shirakawa K', 'Endo J', 'Katayama T', 'Yuasa S', 'Ieda M', 'Makino S', 'Hattori F', 'Tanaka H', 'Fukuda K']","['Department of Regenerative Medicine and Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics, Keio University School of Medicine, and Department of Rheumatology and Allergy, Research Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. msano@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha)', '0 (Ppargc1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/physiology', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Gene Expression', 'Mice', 'PPAR gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Ubiquitin/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/07/11 09:00,2007/10/30 09:00,['2007/07/11 09:00'],"['2007/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Aug 31;282(35):25970-80. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M703634200.

Intracellular signaling by LIF is principally mediated by activation of STAT-3, although additional pathways for self-renewal have been described. Here, we identified a novel role for Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) as a critical factor in mES cells self-renewal and differentiation. IRS-1 is expressed and tyrosyl phosphorylated during mES cells self-renewal. Differentiation of mES cells, by LIF withdrawal, is associated with a marked reduction in IRS-1 expression. Targeting of IRS-1 by si-IRS-1 results in a severe reduction of Oct-4 protein expression and alkaline phosphatase activity, markers of undifferentiated mES cells. IRS-1 targeting does not interfere with LIF-induced STAT-3 phosphorylation, but negatively affects protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3beta) phosphorylation, which are downstream effectors of the LIF-mediated PI3K signaling cascade. Targeting of IRS-1 also results in a marked down regulation of Id-1 and Id-2 proteins expression, which are important components for self-renewal of ES cells. Conversely, over expression of IRS-1 inhibits mES cell differentiation. Taken together, these results suggest that expression and activity of IRS-1 are critical to the maintenance of the self-renewal program in mES cells.","['Rubin, Raphael', 'Arzumanyan, Alla', 'Soliera, Angela Rachele', 'Ross, Brian', 'Peruzzi, Francesca', 'Prisco, Marco']","['Rubin R', 'Arzumanyan A', 'Soliera AR', 'Ross B', 'Peruzzi F', 'Prisco M']","['Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)', '0 (Irs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Insulin/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2007/07/11 09:00,2008/01/23 09:00,['2007/07/11 09:00'],"['2007/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2007 Nov;213(2):445-53. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21185.,,,"['R01 AA009976/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH079751/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AA009976/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1002/jcp.21185 [doi]'],,,,,PMC3760688,['NIHMS430833'],,,,,,,,

It has proved difficult to isolate disease genes that confer susceptibility to complex disorders, and as a consequence, even fewer genetic variants that influence clinical drug responsiveness have been uncovered. As such, the candidate gene approach has largely failed to deliver and, although the family-based linkage approach has certain theoretical advantages in dealing with common/complex disorders, progress has been slower than was hoped. More recently, genome-wide association studies have gained increasing popularity, as they enable scientists to robustly associate specific variants with the predisposition for complex disease, such as age-related macular degeneration, Type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, autism and leukemia. This relatively new methodology has stirred new hope for the mapping of genes that regulate drug response related to these conditions. Collectively, these studies support the notion that modern high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping technologies, when applied to large and comprehensively phenotyped patient cohorts, will readily reveal the most clinically relevant disease-modifying and drug response genes. This review addresses both recent advances in the genotyping field and highlights from genome-wide association studies, which have conclusively uncovered variants that underlie disease susceptibility and/or variability in drug response in common disorders.","['Grant, Struan F A', 'Hakonarson, Hakon']","['Grant SF', 'Hakonarson H']","[""Center for Applied Genomics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA 19104-4318, USA. grants@chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Mol Diagn,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,,IM,"['Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', '*Genome, Human', 'Genomics/*methods/*trends', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Pharmacogenetics/*trends']",2007/07/11 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/07/11 09:00'],"['2007/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Rev Mol Diagn. 2007 Jul;7(4):371-93. doi: 10.1586/14737159.7.4.371.,267,,,['10.1586/14737159.7.4.371 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been identified as a by-product of fermentation in foods and has been detected in mainstream and side stream tobacco smoke. 4MI was studied because of its high potential for human exposure. Groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats were fed diets containing 0-, 625-, 1,250-, or 2,500 ppm 4MI (males) or 0-, 1,250-, 2,500-, or 5,000 ppm 4MI (females) for 106 weeks. Based on the food consumption the calculated average daily doses were approximately 30, 55, or 115 mg 4MI/kg body weight to males and 60, 120, or 250 mg 4MI/kg to females. Survival of all exposed groups of males and females was similar to that of the control groups. The mean body weights of males in the 1,250- and 2,500 ppm groups and females in the 2,500- and 5,000 ppm groups were less than those of the control groups throughout the study. Feed consumption by 5,000 ppm females was less than that by the controls. Clonic seizures, excitability, hyperactivity, and impaired gait were observed primarily in 2,500- and 5,000 ppm females. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in the 5,000 ppm females was significantly greater than that in the controls. The incidences of hepatic histiocytosis, chronic inflammation, and focal fatty change were significantly increased in all exposed groups of male and female rats. The incidences of hepatocellular eosinophilic and mixed cell foci were significantly increased in 2,500 ppm males and 5,000 ppm females. Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice were fed diets containing 0-, 312-, 625-, or 1,250 ppm 4MI for 106 weeks.

Monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)) is a reactive metabolite of inorganic arsenic and a potent inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Arsenic is also reported to phosphorylate eNOS in cultured keratinocyte and Human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells, respectively. In the present study, we examined the cytotoxicity and eNOS phosphorylation by MMA(III) exposure in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Results showed that MMA(III) is more toxic than arsenite in BAEC cells. The IC(50) values for MMA(III) and arsenite were determined to be approximately 1.7 and 24.1 micromol/L, respectively. Exposure of BAEC to MMA(III) (0.75 micromol/L) caused a significant eNOS phosphorylation 15 min after MMA(III) exposure. However, a complex of MMA(III) with dithiothreitol (DTT) that lacks the reactivity with vicinal thiols unaffected eNOS phosphorylation. The present study shows that MMA(III )generated during biomethylation of arsenic is highly toxic in BAEC. Our study also suggests that MMA(III) could induce the eNOS phosphorylation through modification to cellular thiols of the eNOS enzyme. And the initial up-regulation of eNOS phosphorylation by MMA(III )seems to be an adaptive response against disruption of eNOS bioactivity during arsenic exposure.","['Li, B', 'Sun, Y', 'Sun, X', 'Wang, Y', 'Li, X', 'Kumagai, Y', 'Sun, G']","['Li B', 'Sun Y', 'Sun X', 'Wang Y', 'Li X', 'Kumagai Y', 'Sun G']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bull Environ Contam Toxicol,Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology,0046021,"['0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (monomethylarsonous acid)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/*metabolism', 'Organometallic Compounds/*toxicity', 'Phosphorylation']",2007/07/11 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/07/11 09:00'],"['2007/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bull Environ Contam Toxicol. 2007 Jun;78(6):455-8. doi: 10.1007/s00128-007-9178-7.

Human cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which could specifically lyse WT1-expressing tumor cells with HLA class I restriction, were generated in vitro. It was also demonstrated that mice immunized with the WT1 peptide rejected challenges by WT1-expressing cancer cells and survived with no signs of autoaggression to normal organs that physiologically expressed WT1. Furthermore, we and others detected IgM and IgG WT1 antibodies in patients with hematopoietic malignancies, indicating that the WT1 protein was highly immunogenic, and that immunoglobulin class-switch-inducing, WT1-specific, cellular immune responses were elicited in these patients. CD8+ WT1-specific CTLs were also detected in peripheral blood or tumor-draining lymph nodes of cancer patients. These results provided us with the rationale for elicitation of CTL responses targeting the WT1 product for cancer immunotherapy. On the basis of these findings, we performed a phase I clinical trial of a WT1 peptide cancer vaccine for the patients with malignant neoplasms. These results strongly suggested that the WT1 peptide cancer vaccine had efficacy in the clinical setting because clinical responses, including reduction of leukemic blast cells or regression of tumor masses, were observed after the WT1 vaccination in patients with hematopoietic malignancies or solid cancers. The power of a tumor-associated-antigen (TAA)-derived cancer vaccine may be enhanced in combination with stronger adjuvants, helper peptide, molecular-target-based drugs, or some chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine, which has been revealed to suppress regulatory T-cell function. In contrast, reduction of WT1 peptide dose may be needed for the treatment of patients with hematological stem cell diseases, because rapid and strong destruction of malignant cell-sustained hematopoiesis before recovery of normal hematopoiesis may lead to pancytopenia in these patients.","['Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Tsuboi, Akihiro', 'Elisseeva, Olga A', 'Nakajima, Hiroko', 'Fujiki, Fumihiro', 'Kawakami, Manabu', 'Shirakata, Toshiaki', 'Nishida, Sumiyuki', 'Hosen, Naoki', 'Oji, Yusuke', 'Kawase, Ichiro', 'Sugiyama, Haruo']","['Oka Y', 'Tsuboi A', 'Elisseeva OA', 'Nakajima H', 'Fujiki F', 'Kawakami M', 'Shirakata T', 'Nishida S', 'Hosen N', 'Oji Y', 'Kawase I', 'Sugiyama H']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Rheumatic Diseases, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan. yoshi@imed3.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Cancer Vaccines/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*trends', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Vaccines, Subunit/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology/*therapeutic use']",2007/07/11 09:00,2007/08/22 09:00,['2007/07/11 09:00'],"['2007/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2007 May 29;7:649-65. doi: 10.1100/tsw.2007.119.,84,,,['10.1100/tsw.2007.119 [doi]'],,,20070529,,PMC5901323,,,,,,,,,

DC., found in the Amazon rain forest in South-America and known commonly as cat's claw, has been used in traditional medicine to prevent and treat inflammation and cancer. Recently, it has been found to possess potent anti-inflammation activities. In this study, we extracted cat's claw using four different solvents of different polarities and compared their relative influence on proliferation in human premyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell lines. Cat's claw n-hexane extracts (CC-H), ethyl acetate extracts (CC-EA) and n-butanol extracts (CC-B) had a greater anti-cancer effect on HL-60 cells than those extracted with methanol (CC-M). Furthermore, CC-EA induced DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells in a clearly more a concentration- and time-dependent manner than the other extracts. CC-EA-induced cell death was characterized by cell body shrinkage and chromatin condensation. Further investigating the molecular mechanism behind CC-EA-induced apoptosis, sells treated with CC-EA underwent a rapid loss of mitochondrial transmembrane (DeltaPsi(m)) potential, stimulation of phosphatidylserine flip-flop, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytosol, induction of caspase-3 activity in a time-dependent manner, and induced the cleavage of DNA fragmentation factor (DFF-45) and PARP poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). CC-EA promoted the up-regulation of Fas before the processing and activation of procaspase-8 and cleavage of Bid. In addition, the apoptosis induced by CC-EA was accompanied by up-regulation of Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-X(L) and cleavage of Mcl-1, suggesting that CC-EA may have some compounds that have anti-cancer activities and that further studies using cat's claw extracts need to be pursued. Taken together, the results of our studies show clearly that CC-EA's induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells may make it very important in the development of medicine that can trigger chemopreventive actions in the body.","['Cheng, An-Chin', 'Jian, Cheng-Bang', 'Huang, Yu-Ting', 'Lai, Ching-Shu', 'Hsu, Ping-Chi', 'Pan, Min-Hsiung']","['Cheng AC', 'Jian CB', 'Huang YT', 'Lai CS', 'Hsu PC', 'Pan MH']","['Department of Nutrition and Health Science, Toko University, Chia-Yi County 613, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (caspase-activated DNase inhibitor)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Caspases/*metabolism', ""Cat's Claw/*chemistry"", 'Cell Membrane', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Proteins', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor']",2007/07/10 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/07/10 09:00'],"['2006/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2007 Nov;45(11):2206-18. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2007.05.016.

This study sought to compare the morbidity of Port-A-Cath insertions in acute leukemic patients with platelet counts below and above 50 x 10(9)/L. METHOD: Incidence and profile of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) and other complications were determined in 80 consecutive Port-A-Cath insertions in pediatric patients with acute leukemia from January 2002 to December 2004. Subgroup analysis was performed for patients with platelet levels below and above the recommended safe level of 50 x 10(9)/L. RESULTS: Twenty-two (27.5%) patients had insertions performed at platelet levels below the recommended level (median, 35.3; range, 10-49 x 10(9)/L); postoperative counts were correspondingly higher (median, 66.0; range, 20-207 x 10(9)/L) with perioperative platelet transfusion. Catheter-related bloodstream infection incidence was similar in patients with platelets less than and greater than the recommended threshold (18.2% vs 17.2%, respectively), and likewise for CRBSIs encountered in the immediate 30 postoperative days (4.6% and 5.2%, respectively). Only 2 episodes of postoperative bleeding occurred, both in the group with platelet counts greater than 50 x 10(9)/L, with an equally low incidence of other local and mechanical complications in both subgroups. Patient demographics and other preoperative blood parameters did not differ significantly. CONCLUSION: Preoperative thrombocytopenia was not associated with increased incidence of postoperative complications for Port-A-Cath insertions in acute leukemic children.","['Loh, Amos Hong Pheng', 'Chui, Chan Hon']","['Loh AH', 'Chui CH']","[""Department of Paediatric Surgery, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore 229899, Singapore. aloh@alumni.nus.edu.sg""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects/instrumentation', 'Catheters, Indwelling/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/epidemiology', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'Thrombocytopenia/*complications']",2007/07/10 09:00,2007/09/07 09:00,['2007/07/10 09:00'],"['2007/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2007 Jul;42(7):1180-4. doi: 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2007.02.008.,,,,"['S0022-3468(07)00116-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2007.02.008 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, with greater numbers of long-term survivors, the rising incidence of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) is concerning. Herein we report on 2 patients with sarcoma who developed a case of secondary mucoepidermoid carcinoma after chemotherapy treatment without associated radiation therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first series of mucoepidermoid carcinomas arising in pediatric patients treated for sarcoma without radiotherapy. METHODS: Long-term survivors of OS and ES currently undergoing routine follow-up care were reviewed and noted for the development of a new secondary malignancy. Details of their initial evaluation, previous therapies, resection techniques, pathologic findings, and follow-up compose this report. RESULTS: Two patients, a 17-year-old adolescent boy with OS and 16-year-old adolescent girl with ES, with secondary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland were identified. Both patients underwent primary resection and chemotherapy including alkylating agents, but neither received radiation. The mucoepidermoid carcinomas developed 27 months and 132 months after completion of therapy, respectively, and were noted on routine yearly follow-up. Fine-needle aspiration was nondiagnostic on each, and parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve was performed. Pathology revealed low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma with tumor extending to the deep margins for both lesions, and radiotherapy to the parotid bed was administered. There were no surgical complications. One patient is alive, without evidence of recurrent mucoepidermoid carcinoma after 4 years; the other recently completed radiotherapy and is disease-free after 12 months. CONCLUSION: Primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland accounts for less than 10% of all head and neck tumors in childhood.

RESULTS: Obtain two stable hybridomas, 4D6 and 5C2, which could continuously secret specific anti-OX40L monoclonal antibodies. The following biological activity studies showed that these monoclonal antibodies could both recognize the natural OX40L expressed on the mature DC, especially the OX40L on the several leukemia cell lines, such as Jurkat, SHI-1, U937 etc. Furthermore, they could also suppress the proliferation of SHI-1 in vitro.

Withdrawal of IL-15 led to upregulation of Bim and, accordingly, both Bim-deficient and Foxo3a-/- NK cells were resistant to cytokine deprivation. Finally, IL-15-mediated inactivation of Foxo3a and cell survival were dependent on phosphotidylinositol-3-OH kinase.

A recently developed nonlinear mathematical model for cell dynamics is used to design the controller (medication dosage). First, a nominal controller is designed based on the principle of optimal dynamic inversion. This controller can treat the nominal model patients (patients who can be described by the mathematical model used here with the nominal parameter values) effectively. However, since the system parameters for a realistic model patient can be different from that of the nominal model patients, simulation studies for such patients indicate that the nominal controller is either inefficient or, worse, ineffective; i.e. the trajectory of the number of cancer cells either shows non-satisfactory transient behavior or it grows in an unstable manner. Hence, to make the drug dosage history more realistic and patient-specific, a model-following neuro-adaptive controller is augmented to the nominal controller. In this adaptive approach, a neural network trained online facilitates a new adaptive controller. The training process of the neural network is based on Lyapunov stability theory, which guarantees both stability of the cancer cell dynamics as well as boundedness of the network weights. From simulation studies, this adaptive control design approach is found to be very effective to treat the CML disease for realistic patients. Sufficient generality is retained in the mathematical developments so that the technique can be applied to other similar nonlinear control design problems as well.","['Padhi, Radhakant', 'Kothari, Mangal']","['Padhi R', 'Kothari M']","['Department of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India. padhi@aero.iisc.ernet.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,8506513,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', '*Models, Biological', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/07/10 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/07/10 09:00'],"['2006/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Comput Methods Programs Biomed. 2007 Sep;87(3):208-24. doi: 10.1016/j.cmpb.2007.05.011.

In the present study we investigate the splice pattern as well as the possible effects of mutating the alternative splice sites on the oncogenic properties of the B-lymphomagenic Akv murine leukemia virus. RESULTS: By exon-trapping procedures we have identified a novel gammaretroviral exon, resulting from usage of alternative splice acceptor (SA') and splice donor (SD') sites located in the capsid region of gag of the B-cell lymphomagenic Akv murine leukemia virus. To analyze possible effects in vivo of this novel exon, three different alternative splice site mutant viruses, mutated in either the SA', in the SD', or in both sites, respectively, were constructed and injected into newborn inbred NMRI mice. Most of the infected mice (about 90%) developed hematopoietic neoplasms within 250 days, and histological examination of the tumors showed that the introduced synonymous gag mutations have a significant influence on the phenotype of the induced tumors, changing the distribution of the different types as well as generating tumors of additional specificities such as de novo diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and histiocytic sarcoma. Interestingly, a broader spectrum of diagnoses was made from the two single splice-site mutants than from as well the wild-type as the double splice-site mutant. Both single- and double-spliced transcripts are produced in vivo using the SA' and/or the SD' sites, but the mechanisms underlying the observed effects on oncogenesis remain to be clarified. Likewise, analyses of provirus integration sites in tumor tissues, which identified 111 novel RISs (retroviral integration sites) and 35 novel CISs (common integration sites), did not clearly point to specific target genes or pathways to be associated with specific tumor diagnoses or individual viral mutants. CONCLUSION: We present here the first example of a doubly spliced transcript within the group of gammaretroviruses, and we show that mutation of the alternative splice sites that define this novel RNA product change the oncogenic potential of Akv murine leukemia virus.","['Sorensen, Annette Balle', 'Lund, Anders H', 'Kunder, Sandra', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Schmidt, Jorg', 'Wang, Bruce', 'Wabl, Matthias', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Sorensen AB', 'Lund AH', 'Kunder S', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Schmidt J', 'Wang B', 'Wabl M', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, Denmark. abs@statsbiblioteket.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,['0 (RNA Splice Sites)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Exons', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics', '*Genes, gag', 'Histiocytic Disorders, Malignant/virology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/virology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA Splice Sites/*genetics', 'Sarcoma/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",2007/07/10 09:00,2007/09/05 09:00,['2007/07/10 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2007 Jul 6;4:46. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-4-46.,,,"['R01 CA100266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['1742-4690-4-46 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-4-46 [doi]']",,,20070706,,PMC1936429,,,,,,,,,

Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) polymorphisms are the major determinants of interindividual differences in the severe toxicity or efficacy of 6MP. Four variant alleles, TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B, and TPMT*3C, are responsible over the 80% of low or undetectable enzyme activity. The frequencies of these variants were investigated among 106 children with ALL in Turkish population. TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C were the only deficiency alleles detected in Turkish population with an allele frequency of 0.9% for both. While *3C allele frequency in Turkish population was found to be very similar to Asian and other Caucasian populations, *3A allele frequency was significantly (P < 0.05) lower. So far, studies showed that the genetic polymorphisms of other drug metabolizing enzymes like CYP2E1, CYP1A1, GSTM1/ T1 in Turkish population were similar to Caucasian populations. However, we found that the distribution of TPMT polymorphisms in Turkish population was significantly lower than those in other Caucasians like British, French, and Italian whereas the distributions of TPMT variants were found to be very similar to Kazak population which is also Caucasian in ethnic origin. In this study, the clinical histories of the patients in the sample population were also examined, retrospectively. The patients with heterozygous or homozygous mutant genotypes had developed severe neutropenia and infection during 6MP therapy. The study provides the first data on the frequency of common TPMT variants in the Turkish population, based on analysis of pediatric patients with ALL.","['Tumer, Tugba Boyunegmez', 'Ulusoy, Gulen', 'Adali, Orhan', 'Sahin, Gurses', 'Gozdasoglu, Sevgi', 'Arinc, Emel']","['Tumer TB', 'Ulusoy G', 'Adali O', 'Sahin G', 'Gozdasoglu S', 'Arinc E']","['Biochemistry Graduate Programme and Department of Biological Sciences, Middle East Technical University, 06531 Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Inactivation, Metabolic/genetics', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/deficiency/*genetics', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Prodrugs/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",2007/07/10 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/07/10 09:00'],"['2007/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2007 Oct;82(10):906-10. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20947.,,,,['10.1002/ajh.20947 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We present an approach for relative quantification of methylated gene sequences. The technique combines conventional PCR and LightCycler fluorescence PCR. In the conventional PCR step, bisulfite-modified molecules are selectively enriched, irrespective of their methylation status, and used as template in the second step, the LightCycler fluorescence PCR, which includes methylation-specific primers and fluorescently labeled probes. After amplification, a stepwise increase in temperature leads to the generation of melting curves reflecting fluorescence emission induced by disassociation of the probe-target complexes. Quantification is based on calculation of the peak areas for melting curves using a Gaussian fit curve. The area under this curve indicates the relative amounts of methylated sequences in each sample. RESULTS: By normalizing the peak areas by template concentrations, a methylation index was calculated for each sample. This approach was then used to carry out a relative quantification of p16INK4A gene methylation in bone marrow and blood mononuclear cells from patients with positive translocation status. CONCLUSIONS: If validated in further studies, this approach represents a highly specific technique that can be used in analyzing paired samples of cancer patients.","['Deligezer, Ugur', 'Esin Akisik, Ebru', 'Dalay, Nejat']","['Deligezer U', 'Esin Akisik E', 'Dalay N']","['Department of Basic Oncology, Oncology Institute, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Transition Temperature']",2007/07/10 09:00,2007/10/06 09:00,['2007/07/10 09:00'],"['2007/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2007;45(7):867-73. doi: 10.1515/CCLM.2007.146.,,,,['10.1515/CCLM.2007.146 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test the hypothesis that some cells with pluripotency characteristics remain following the differentiation of embryoid bodies (EB) into monolayer cells, we transformed mouse ES cells using constructs comprised of the mTert promoter coupled to green fluorescent protein. In this manner, EBs could be identified as showing gradually diminishing expression of the fluorescent marker as a consequence of differentiation. After 2 weeks of incubation, however, small groups of fluorescent cells remained in the differentiated monolayer. When these cells were isolated, cultured and expanded under ES cell culture conditions, they recovered their ES cell morphology (herein denoted ES-EB). We found by immunocytochemistry, reverse transcription-PCR and bisulphite analysis that despite the fact that some of these ES-EB lost their capacity to express some pluripotency markers characteristic of ES cells and undergo the epigenetic modification (hypo-methylation) of some retrotransposons (RT), after several passages in ES media, the cell colonies recovered their capacity for both pluripotency marker expression and RT methylation. Furthermore, when assessed for their ability to form chimeras, most ES-EB lines were unable to do so, although they recovered this potential for chimera production after some passages in ES cell media. Our results highlight the need for specific screening of differentiated cells before their therapeutic use and indicate that under adequate culture conditions, cells that loose their potential for expressing key markers of pluripotency can recover this fundamental embryonic stem cell property.","['Ramirez, Miguel A', 'Pericuesta, Eva', 'Fernandez-Gonzalez, Raul', 'Pintado, Belen', 'Gutierrez-Adan, Alfonso']","['Ramirez MA', 'Pericuesta E', 'Fernandez-Gonzalez R', 'Pintado B', 'Gutierrez-Adan A']","['Department of Animal Reproduction, INIA, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Int J Dev Biol,The International journal of developmental biology,8917470,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MuERV-L protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroelements)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Intracisternal A-Particle', 'Genetic Markers', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroelements/genetics']",2007/07/10 09:00,2007/10/06 09:00,['2007/07/10 09:00'],"['2007/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Dev Biol. 2007;51(5):397-407. doi: 10.1387/ijdb.062255mr.,,,,"['062255mr [pii]', '10.1387/ijdb.062255mr [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical dose of 4-HPR, however, is limited by residual-associated toxicities, indicating a need for a less toxic drug. In this study, we show that 4-hydroxybenzylretinone (4-HBR), the unhydrolyzable analogue of 4-HPR, is effective in producing apoptosis in a variety of 4-HPR-sensitive cell lines, including breast cancer, neuroblastoma, and leukemia cells. We also show through the use of a pan-caspase inhibitor that this 4-HBR-induced apoptosis is dependent, at least in part, on caspase activity. 4-HBR is shown to exhibit binding to the retinoic acid receptors (RAR) at concentrations necessary to induce cell death and induces expression of all-trans-retinoic acid-responsive genes that can be blocked by a RAR pan-antagonist. However, through the use of this RAR pan-antagonist, 4-HBR-induced apoptosis and cell death is shown to be independent of the RAR signaling pathway. To further characterize the mechanism of action of 4-HBR, expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced genes GADD153 and Bcl-2-binding component 3 was examined. These mRNAs are shown to be rapidly induced in 4-HBR-treated and 4-HPR-treated breast cancer cells, and this up-regulation is also shown to be independent of the RARs. These results suggest that a stress-mediated apoptotic cascade is involved in the mechanism of action of these retinoids.","['Anding, Allyson L', 'Chapman, Jason S', 'Barnett, Derek W', 'Curley, Robert W Jr', 'Clagett-Dame, Margaret']","['Anding AL', 'Chapman JS', 'Barnett DW', 'Curley RW Jr', 'Clagett-Dame M']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (4-hydroxybenzylretinone)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fenretinide/*analogs & derivatives', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoids/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/*biosynthesis', 'Vitamin A/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2007/07/10 09:00,2007/07/28 09:00,['2007/07/10 09:00'],"['2007/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jul 1;67(13):6270-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0727.,,,['CA49837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['67/13/6270 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0727 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hereby, we clarify how these COOH-terminal alterations functionally cooperate to delocalize NPM to the cytoplasm. Using a Rev(1.4)-based shuttling assay, we measured the nuclear export efficiency of six different COOH-terminal NES motifs identified in NPM mutants and found significant strength variability, the strongest NES motifs being associated with NPM mutants retaining W288. When artificially coupled with a weak NES, W288-retaining NPM mutants are not exported efficiently into cytoplasm because the force (W288) driving the mutants toward the nucleolus overwhelms the force (NES) exporting the mutants into cytoplasm. We then used this functional assay to study the physiologic NH(2)-terminal NES motifs of wild-type NPM and found that they are weak, which explains the prominent nucleolar localization of wild-type NPM. Thus, the opposing balance of forces (tryptophans and NES) seems to determine the subcellular localization of NPM. The fact that W288-retaining mutants always combine with the strongest NES reveals mutational selective pressure toward efficient export into cytoplasm, pointing to this event as critical for leukemogenesis.","['Bolli, Niccolo', 'Nicoletti, Ildo', 'De Marco, M Felicetta', 'Bigerna, Barbara', 'Pucciarini, Alessandra', 'Mannucci, Roberta', 'Martelli, Maria Paola', 'Liso, Arcangelo', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Fabbiano, Francesco', 'Martelli, Massimo F', 'Henderson, Beric R', 'Falini, Brunangelo']","['Bolli N', 'Nicoletti I', 'De Marco MF', 'Bigerna B', 'Pucciarini A', 'Mannucci R', 'Martelli MP', 'Liso A', 'Mecucci C', 'Fabbiano F', 'Martelli MF', 'Henderson BR', 'Falini B']","['Section of Hematology and Immunology, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",2007/07/10 09:00,2007/07/28 09:00,['2007/07/10 09:00'],"['2007/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jul 1;67(13):6230-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0273.,,,,"['67/13/6230 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0273 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Galectin-1 is an endogenous carbohydrate-binding protein that induces death of leukemia and lymphoma cells, breast cancer cells, and the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line, but not other prostate cancer cell lines. To understand the mechanism of galectin-1 sensitivity of LNCaP cells compared with other prostate cancer cells, we characterized glycan ligands that are important for conferring galectin-1 sensitivity in these cells, and analyzed expression of glycosyltransferase genes in galectin-1-sensitive, prostate-specific antigen-positive (PSA(+)) LNCaP cells compared with a galectin-1-resistant PSA(-) LNCaP subclone. We identified one glycosyltransferase, core 2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, which is down-regulated in galectin-1-resistant PSA(-) LNCaP cells compared with galectin-1-sensitive PSA(+) LNCaP cells. Intriguingly, this is the same glycosyltransferase required for galectin-1 susceptibility of T lymphoma cells, indicating that similar O-glycan ligands on different polypeptide backbones may be common death trigger receptors recognized by galectin-1 on different types of cancer cells. Blocking O-glycan elongation by expressing alpha2,3-sialyltransferase 1 rendered LNCaP cells resistant to galectin-1, showing that specific O-glycans are critical for galectin-1 susceptibility. Loss of galectin-1 susceptibility and synthesis of endogenous galectin-1 has been proposed to promote tumor evasion of immune attack; we found that galectin-1-expressing prostate cancer cells killed bound T cells, whereas LNCaP cells that do not express galectin-1 did not kill T cells. Resistance to galectin-1-induced apoptosis may directly contribute to the survival of prostate cancer cells as well as promote immune evasion by the tumor.","['Valenzuela, Hector F', 'Pace, Karen E', 'Cabrera, Paula V', 'White, Rachel', 'Porvari, Katja', 'Kaija, Helena', 'Vihko, Pirkko', 'Baum, Linda G']","['Valenzuela HF', 'Pace KE', 'Cabrera PV', 'White R', 'Porvari K', 'Kaija H', 'Vihko P', 'Baum LG']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095-1732, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Galectin 1)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Galectin 1/*biosynthesis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Polysaccharides/metabolism', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/*biosynthesis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",2007/07/10 09:00,2007/07/28 09:00,['2007/07/10 09:00'],"['2007/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jul 1;67(13):6155-62. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4431.,,,"['T32CA09056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['67/13/6155 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4431 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified a panel of 33 genes differentially expressed in prednisolone sensitive versus resistant ALL cells from newly diagnosed children. Here we used bioinformatics to identify resistance genes most likely to contain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in their promoter region. The highest priority gene was SMARCB1, a core member of the SWI/SNF complex which promotes glucocorticoid effects through nucleosome remodeling. We identified several SNPs in the SMARCB1 promoter in lymphoblastoid cells from 90 individuals in the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) panel. Among these SNPs, the -228G>T SNP (allele frequency 9.4%) was the only one that significantly increased reporter activity in human ALL cell lines. Furthermore, we identified nuclear protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family, member 1 (PARP1) as a nuclear protein binding to the SMARCB1 promoter and showed that the -228 SNP significantly altered PARP1 binding affinity. The -228G>T SNP altered SMARCB1 mRNA and protein levels and a positive association was found between the SMARCB1 mRNA level and both the -228 genotype and prednisolone sensitivity in CEPH cell lines. Finally, knockdown experiments performed in human ALL cell lines confirmed that lower SMARCB1 expression increased prednisolone resistance. In summary, we provide functional evidence that SMARCB1 is involved in prednisolone resistance and identified a promoter SNP that alters the level of SMARCB1 mRNA and protein expression and the binding of PARP1 to the SMARCB1 promoter.","['Pottier, Nicolas', 'Cheok, Meyling H', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Assem, Mahfoud', 'Tracey, Lorraine', 'Obenauer, John C', 'Panetta, John C', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Evans, William E']","['Pottier N', 'Cheok MH', 'Yang W', 'Assem M', 'Tracey L', 'Obenauer JC', 'Panetta JC', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SMARCB1 Protein)', '0 (SMARCB1 protein, human)', '0 (Steroids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'SMARCB1 Protein', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steroids/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2007/07/10 09:00,2008/01/25 09:00,['2007/07/10 09:00'],"['2007/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2007 Oct 1;16(19):2261-71. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddm178.

The finding that idarubicin-induced DNA damage is repaired before cell death is initiated encouraged us to examine the role of DNA repair for the cytotoxicity of idarubicin in human promyelocytic HL60 leukaemia cells. We found that DNA double strand breaks induced by a 90 min transient exposure to 0.5 microgml(-1) idarubicin were rapidly repaired throughout the whole population, while topo IIalpha itself was degraded. In spite of DNA repair, the vast majority of cells died within 40 h. Using differential staining of the chromatids and microscopic evaluation of DNA break points, we found evidence for a high number of false ligations of loose DNA strands arising from the inhibition of topo IIalpha action by idarubicin. If mainly actively transcribed genes are affected, this results in a disruption of vital genetic information, of regulatory sequences and, ultimately, in induction of the cell death pathway. Our results confirm the hypothesis that misrepair of DNA damage is a decisive event in idarubicin-induced cell death. They are discussed in the context of topo IIalpha-function and the currently known mechanisms of DNA double strand break repair.","['Dartsch, Dorothee C', 'Gieseler, Frank']","['Dartsch DC', 'Gieseler F']","['Hamburg University, Institute of Pharmacy, Bundesstr. 45, 20146 Hamburg, Germany. dorothee.dartsch@chemie.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,DNA Repair (Amst),DNA repair,101139138,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Death', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*physiology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*toxicity', 'Models, Biological', 'Time Factors']",2007/07/10 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/07/10 09:00'],"['2006/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,DNA Repair (Amst). 2007 Nov;6(11):1618-28. doi: 10.1016/j.dnarep.2007.05.007.

Most of these elements have degenerated. However, a few of them have conserved their coding capacities and could still have a role in physiological and pathological processes. OBJECTIVES To investigate whether reverse transcriptase (RT) of human endogenous retroelements can be expressed at the protein level and can also be functional, and to associate RT expression and activity to a pathological situation, namely psoriasis. METHODS: Expression of RT proteins was investigated by immunohistochemistry on normal (n = 11), psoriatic (n = 19) and atopic (n = 12) skin sections and by Western blot on normal skin protein extracts. RT activity was measured by a colorimetric method in protein extracts from normal (n = 17) and lesional psoriatic (n = 35) skin. Two assays were performed in each extract: one was optimized for Moloney murine leukaemia virus or mammalian C-type retroviruses, and the other for mouse mammary tumour virus or D-type retroviruses. RESULTS: RT proteins were detected in the uppermost layer of the epidermis and in a few dermal cells of normal skin. The main protein had a molecular weight of 57 kDa. An increased number of RT-positive cells was stained in the psoriatic lesion both within the epidermis and within the dermal compartment. In addition, a massive staining was noted in Munro's abscesses. Finally, RT activities were 2-3 times higher in psoriatic protein extracts than in normal skin protein extracts. CONCLUSIONS: Active endogenous retroelements can produce functional RT proteins. In normal skin, we observed RT expression in all samples tested whereas RT activity was barely detectable. In psoriatic samples, the number of RT-positive cells was increased, as was the RT activity. This latter characteristic allowed us to determine a subset of psoriatic samples with an increased Mg(2+) RT activity.

This study sought the prognostic relevance of leucocytosis for survival and leukaemic or fibrotic transformation. Amongst 459 patients with PV seen at our institution in recent years (median age, 60 years; 56% males), 146 deaths and 88 leukaemic (n = 34) or fibrotic (n = 54) transformations were documented. Arterial or venous thrombosis occurred in 14% and 9% of patients at diagnosis and in 25% and 15% during follow-up, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified the advanced age (P < 0.0001), leucocytosis (leucocyte count >/=15 x 10(9)/l; P = 0.0006) and arterial thrombosis at diagnosis (P = 0.01) as independent predictors of inferior survival. In the absence of the first two risk factors, median survival was projected at 272 months as opposed to 108 months in the presence of both risk factors (P < 0.0001). Leucocytosis was also identified as an independent predictor of both leukaemic transformation and venous thrombosis during follow-up. Time-to-event analysis did not disclose a significant association between single or multiple cytotoxic drug exposure and either leukaemic or fibrotic transformation. The current study highlighted the prognostic relevance of leucocytosis on various aspects of the disease in PV.","['Gangat, Naseema', 'Strand, Jacob', 'Li, Chin-Yang', 'Wu, Wenting', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Gangat N', 'Strand J', 'Li CY', 'Wu W', 'Pardanani A', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Laboratory Medicine, and Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality', 'Leukocytosis/*complications/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Polycythemia Vera/*immunology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Thrombosis/immunology/mortality']",2007/07/07 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/07/07 09:00'],"['2007/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Aug;138(3):354-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06674.x.,,,,"['BJH6674 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06674.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumulation of beta-catenin was measured by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells revealed expression of Wnt genes, including WNT2B in 33%, WNT5A in 42%, WNT10B in 58% and WNT16B in 25% of cases. The Wnt receptors, (Frizzled) FZD7 and FZD8 were also expressed in most cases while FZD3, FZD4 and FZD9 were occasionally detected. Stimulation of ALL cells with Wnt-3a activated canonical Wnt signalling with increased expression and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. This resulted in a 1.7- to 5.3-fold increase in cell proliferation, which was associated with enhanced cell cycle entry. A significant increase in the survival of ALL cells under conditions of serum deprivation was also observed. Microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway led to altered expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis in normal and leukaemic B-cell progenitors. Our results demonstrate that Wnt-3a provides proliferative and survival cues in ALL cells. This data suggests that targeting the Wnt signalling pathway may be a useful therapeutic strategy in ALL.","['Khan, Naveed I', 'Bradstock, Kenneth F', 'Bendall, Linda J']","['Khan NI', 'Bradstock KF', 'Bendall LJ']","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney, SW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (WNT3A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt3 Protein)', '0 (Wnt3A Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Wnt3 Protein', 'Wnt3A Protein', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",2007/07/07 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/07/07 09:00'],"['2007/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Aug;138(3):338-48. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06667.x.,,,,"['BJH6667 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06667.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review examines the relationship between the acute and chronic myeloid leukaemias and cells with DC properties. DCs are non-dividing terminally differentiated cells, and ex vivo leukaemic cells or cell lines show little similarity to DCs. However, many leukaemias differentiate further in response to defined stimuli, and retain a degree of lineage plasticity. Therefore, several studies have explored the response of leukaemic cells to the in vitro regimens used to differentiate ex vivo primary DCs. Recent data suggest that the most 'dendritic-like' cells can be derived from more undifferentiated myeloid leukaemias, such as the myelomonocytic Mutz-3 cell line. These findings have important implications for understanding the developmental origins of DCs, for harnessing the APC properties of this class of tumour to stimulate the therapeutic anti-tumour immunity, and for developing useful models for the study of human DC physiology and pathology. There is a strong rationale for further exploration of this class of tumour and its relationship to the normal DC.","['Rasaiyaah, Jane', 'Yong, Kwee', 'Katz, David R', 'Kellam, Paul', 'Chain, Benjamin M']","['Rasaiyaah J', 'Yong K', 'Katz DR', 'Kellam P', 'Chain BM']","['Department of Immunology and Molecular Pathology, UCL, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology']",2007/07/07 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/07/07 09:00'],"['2007/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Aug;138(3):281-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06622.x.,66,,,"['BJH6622 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06622.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laboratory studies have demonstrated that iron is essential for Aspergillus growth and virulence. METHODS: In the current study, the authors retrospectively evaluated the bone marrow iron stores (BMIS) in patients with leukemia as well as recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with IA (n = 33) and those without fungal infections (n = 33). The first available bone marrow biopsy specimens prior to the IA diagnosis or date of hospitalization (control group) were assessed in a blinded fashion using a standardized scoring system (0-4). Both groups were comparable with regard to clinical characteristics and classic risk factors for IA. RESULTS: The majority of patients with IA (70%) were found to have increased BMIS (score >or=3) compared with the control patients (16%) (P < .0001). Increased BMIS was found to be an independent risk factor for IA on multivariate analysis (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The prospective validation of BMIS for risk stratification in patients with leukemia or those who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is needed.","['Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P', 'Chamilos, Georgios', 'Lewis, Russell E', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Raad, Issam I', 'Manning, John T', 'Han, Xin']","['Kontoyiannis DP', 'Chamilos G', 'Lewis RE', 'Giralt S', 'Cortes J', 'Raad II', 'Manning JT', 'Han X']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas M.

METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients were assessed before and one year following SCT, using a generic and disease-related version of the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW) and the EORTC QLQ-C30. Results of the QLQ-C30 were compared with Swedish norm values. RESULTS: A majority of the patients reported concerns related to health before as well as one year after SCT, recorded by both instruments. Mean scores produced by the SEIQoL-DW, and four scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, showed a change over time, indicating improved quality of life one year after SCT. In comparison with Swedish norm values for the EORTC QLQ-C30, SCT recipients reported a worse functioning. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to well-known disease and treatment-related problems, areas not typically included in standardized instruments were nominated in the disease-related SEIQoL-DW. Such areas included positive aspects, e.g. a changed view of life and oneself. The results support the use of the generic and disease-related SEIQoL-DW to achieve a comprehensive picture of patient's clinical situation under treatment or when recovering from illness.","['Wettergren, L', 'Sprangers, M', 'Bjorkholm, M', 'Langius-Eklof, A']","['Wettergren L', 'Sprangers M', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Langius-Eklof A']","['Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Division of Nursing, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. lena.wettergren@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*psychology', 'Hodgkin Disease/psychology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/psychology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/psychology/*therapy', 'Personality Inventory/statistics & numerical data', 'Psychometrics', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Reference Values', 'Remission Induction', 'Sick Role', 'Sickness Impact Profile']",2007/07/07 09:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2007/07/07 09:00'],"['2007/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Psychooncology. 2008 Apr;17(4):338-46. doi: 10.1002/pon.1240.,,,,['10.1002/pon.1240 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,

The compound, temporarily designated as PKH-3, was shown to inhibit the activity of topoisomerase I with IC50 about 1.0 mM. Concentration of 10 microM PKH-3 caused 50% growth inhibition of human cancer cell U937. PKH-3-induced cell death was characterized with the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and pro-caspase 3. Furthermore, PKH-3 induced the fragmentation of DNA into multiples of 180 b.p. (an apoptotic DNA ladder), indicating that the inhibitor triggered apoptosis. This induction of apoptosis by PKH-3 was also confirmed using flow cytometry analysis.

We here evaluated, whether AMN107 is also able to induce apoptosis in Bcr-Abl-negative cells of lymphatic origin. The B-cell lines DOHH-2 and WSU-NHL and the T-cell lines Jurkat and HUT78 were incubated with increasing amounts of AMN107 corresponding to clinically achievable dosages. Subsequently, induced molecular changes were assessed by FACS analysis, Western blot, and enzyme activity assays. Although AMN107 exhibited only a minor apoptosis-inducing effect in the T-cell lines, it exerted a considerable, dose-dependent cytotoxicity in the B-cell lines. Using selective caspase-inhibitors, we show that apoptosis in responder cell lines critically relies on activation of caspase-6 and caspase-9. Cell lines sensitive and resistant towards AMN107 can be discriminated by their differential expression of Src-kinases. Although the AMN107-sensitive cell lines DOHH-2 and WSU-NHL exhibited low or no expression of the Src-kinases Lck, phosphorylated Lck, and Yes with a concomitant high expression of Hck, Lyn, and phosphorylated Lyn, the expression pattern of these kinases was inverse in the AMN107-resistant T-cell lines.

The high failure rate of the IGH assays for this set of FFPE lymphomas cannot be explained by systematic problems with DNA extraction or amplification because the same IGH assays resulted in a low failure rate (3/32, 9%) for FFPE small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia specimens and for fresh frozen FL specimens (1/6, 17%).

To evaluate this hypothesis, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted a multi-institutional phase II trial of single agent bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory classical HL. Thirty patients received bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, 11 and every 21 days for a median of 2 cycles (range, 1 - 8).

ALL has traditionally been viewed as a genetic disease; however, epigenetic defects also play an important role. DNA promoter methylation has gained increasing recognition as an important mechanism for transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes. Hypermethylation may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukemias providing an alternative route to gene mutation. We have reported that gene methylation in ALL cells is the most important way to inactivate cancer-related genes in this disease. In fact, this epigenetic event can help to inactivate tumor-suppressive apoptotic or growth-arresting responses and has prognostic impact in B- and T-ALL. The presence in individual tumors of multiple genes simultaneously methylated is an independent factor of poor prognosis in both childhood and adult ALL in terms of disease-free survival and overall survival. Moreover, methylation status is able to redefine the prognosis of selected ALL groups with well-established prognostic features.","['Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio', 'Barrios, Manuel', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Heiniger, Anabel', 'Torres, Antonio', 'Agirre, Xabier']","['Roman-Gomez J', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Barrios M', 'Prosper F', 'Heiniger A', 'Torres A', 'Agirre X']","['Hematology Department, Reina Sofia Hospital, Cordoba, Spain. peperosa@teleline.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['*DNA Methylation', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Survival Analysis']",2007/07/07 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/07/07 09:00'],"['2007/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Jul;48(7):1269-82. doi: 10.1080/10428190701344899.,100,,,"['780392715 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701344899 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten dup(1q)-positive BLs/ALLs were investigated by tiling resolution (32k) array CGH analysis, which revealed that the proximal breakpoints in all cases were near-centromeric, in eight of them clustering within a 1.4 Mb segment in 1q12-21.1.

Surprisingly, intrinsic homo-oligomeric DNA binding by the fusion proteins is also dispensable. Importantly, higher-order RXR/RARalpha fusion hetero-oligomeric complexes that aberrantly recruit transcriptional corepressors to downstream targets are essential for transformation. Intervention of RXR-dependent pathways by panRXR-agonists or RXRalpha shRNAs suppresses RARalpha fusion-mediated transformation.

METHODS: Physician survey, retrospective database review, and literature search. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: History of RB and development of sAML, management of RB (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy), age at diagnosis of RB and leukemia, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, and current status of patient (alive or dead). RESULTS: Fifteen patients with sAML were identified; 13 occurred in childhood. Mean latent period from RB to AML diagnosis was 9.8 years (median, 42 months). Nine cases were of the M2 or M5 FAB subtypes. Twelve patients (79 %) had received chemotherapy with a topoisomerase II inhibitor, 8 (43%) had received chemotherapy with an epipodophyllotoxin. Ten children died of their leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Acute myelogenous leukemia is a rare secondary malignancy among retinoblastoma patients, many of whom were treated with primary or adjuvant chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used two stocks from both the parental L5,178Y-R cell line and the repair-deficient radiosensitive subline, L5,178Y-S, to assess telomere length. We used terminal restriction fragment analysis and flow-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) telomere length assessment to determine telomere lengths in the related radiosensitive and non-radiosensitive cell lines. Each cell line was further tested for retention of its original radiation response phenotype using cell growth assays after treatment with ionizing radiation. RESULTS: One stock of L5,178Y-R cells had long telomeres, whereas the other stock had short telomeres. Likewise, one stock of L5,178Y-S cells had long telomeres, whereas the other stock had short telomeres. Telomere lengths in these cell lines were relatively stable for over 80 divisions in culture. Each cell line was confirmed to have retained its original radiosensitivity phenotype.

Aberrations in methylation play a causal role in a variety of diseases, including cancer. Recent studies have established that like mutation, methylation-mediated gene silencing often leads to tumorigenesis. Paradoxically, genome-wide DNA hypomethylation may also play a causal role in carcinogenesis by inducing chromosomal instability and spurious gene expression. Since methylation does not alter DNA base sequence, much attention has been focused recently on developing small molecule inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases that can potentially be used as anticancer agents. Vidaza (5-azacytidine), marketed by Pharmion (Boulder, CO, USA), was the first DNA methyltransferase inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chemotherapy against myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a heterogeneous bone marrow disorder. Recently MGI Pharma Inc. (Bloomington, MN, USA) got FDA approval to market Dacogen (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, or decitabine) for treating MDS patients. These drugs were used earlier against certain anemias to induce expression of fetal globin genes. Interest in clinical trials of these drugs as anticancer agents has been renewed only recently because of reversal of methylation-mediated silencing of critical genes in cancer. Clinical trials have shown that both drugs have therapeutic potential against leukemia such as MDS, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In contrast, their effectiveness with solid tumors appears to be less promising, which challenges researchers to develop inhibitors with more efficacy and less toxicity. The major hindrance of their usage as anticancer agents is their instability in vivo as well as the toxicity secondary to their excessive incorporation into DNA, which causes cell cycle arrest. Gene expression profiling in cancer cells revealed that antineoplastic property of these drugs is mediated through both methylation-dependent and -independent pathways. Recently, we have shown that treatment of cancer cells with these cytidine analogues also induces proteasomal degradation of DNA methyltransferase 1, the ubiquitously expressed enzyme upregulated in almost all cancer cells. Development of related stable drugs that can facilitate gene activation in cancer cells by enhancing degradation of DNA methyltransferases without being incorporated into DNA would be ideal for chemotherapy. In this monograph we review historical perspective and recent advances on the molecular mechanisms of action and clinical applications of these DNA hypomethylating agents.","['Ghoshal, Kalpana', 'Bai, Shoumei']","['Ghoshal K', 'Bai S']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, College of Medicine, and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. ghoshal.1@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",Spain,Drugs Today (Barc),"Drugs of today (Barcelona, Spain : 1998)",101160518,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2007/07/07 09:00,2007/10/06 09:00,['2007/07/07 09:00'],"['2007/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs Today (Barc). 2007 Jun;43(6):395-422. doi: 10.1358/dot.2007.43.6.1062666.,252,,"['R01 CA086978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA86978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['1062666 [pii]', '10.1358/dot.2007.43.6.1062666 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally, chemotherapy is used to eliminate cancer cells and to restore normal bone marrow function. Simultaneous action of cytostatic drugs on bone marrow angiogenesis decreases the formation of new capillaries and improves therapeutic effect. However, chemotherapeutic agents may also be cytodestructive for cellular elements of other tissues, particularly the vascular endothelium, which can lead to various cardiovascular complications. In this work, we studied the effects of 2 cytostatic drugs, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and daunorubicin (DNR), on cultured human vascular (i.e., umbilical) endothelial cells (ECs). Ara-C and DNR were added to cultured cells at concentrations ranging from 1 ng/mL to 100 microg/mL. Drug effects were studied using phase-contrast microscopy, cell viability tests, BRDU incorporation, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and cell cloning. At various concentrations, ara-C and DNR are able to induce morphological and functional changes in cultured cells related to either cytostatic or cytotoxic action. Moreover, ara-C-treated cultured cells displayed significant disturbances in cell adhesion molecule expression and interaction with blood leukocytes. Preliminary data obtained on acute leukemia patients undergoing standard cytostatic therapy (""7+3"" regimen) have shown that concentration of the circulating ECs was significantly increased compared with the control group and could be as high as 500-1500 cells/mL of blood. Results obtained suggest that anticancer chemotherapy may induce systemic damage of vascular endothelium related to massive cell loss and (or) alterations of endothelial function.","['Romanov, Yuri A', 'Chervontseva, Alevtina M', 'Savchenko, Valery G', 'Smirnov, Vladimir N']","['Romanov YA', 'Chervontseva AM', 'Savchenko VG', 'Smirnov VN']","['Laboratory of Human Stem Cells, Institute of Experimental Cardiology, National Cardiology Research Center, 3rd Cherepkovskaya Str. 15-A, Moscow 121552, Russian Federation. romanov@cardio.ru']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Canada,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,0372712,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/cytology']",2007/07/07 09:00,2007/10/17 09:00,['2007/07/07 09:00'],"['2007/07/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Can J Physiol Pharmacol. 2007 Mar-Apr;85(3-4):396-403. doi: 10.1139/y07-045.,,,,"['y07-045 [pii]', '10.1139/y07-045 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human HCF-1-E2F interactions are versatile: their associations and binding to E2F-responsive promoters are cell-cycle selective, and HCF-1 displays coactivator properties when bound to the E2F1 activator and corepressor properties when bound to the E2F4 repressor. During the G1-to-S phase transition, HCF-1 recruits the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) and Set-1 histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferases to E2F-responsive promoters and induces histone methylation and transcriptional activation.

Am-80, Tamibarotene, binds to retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) more specifically than all-trans retinoic acid. We studied the tumor cell suppressive effects of Am-80, with respect to cytotoxicity and growth inhibition using eight myeloid and lymphoid malignant cells in culture (HL-60, HL-60R, K-562, Kasumi-1, MEG01, Raji, U266B1, and U937). The effects of Am-80 were examined during 9 days of incubation with 10(-7)-10(-5) M of Am-80 in culture medium, which was changed every 3 days. HL-60 were the only cells sensitive to Am-80-induced cytotoxicity; the latter reached more than 95% after 9 days of incubation, and death was primarily through apoptosis. The total mass of RARalpha in HL-60 was significantly greater (p<0.006) than in ATRA-resistant HL-60 (HL-60R) as well as all of other cells tested. However, in all cells excluding HL-60, Am-80 induced time- and dose-dependent cell growth inhibition without noticeable cytotoxicity. TGF-beta2 was released into the media containing cells incubated with Am-80 for 3 days. A dose-dependent increment of phosphorylation of Smad-2 was also detected. The relative amount of secreted TGF-beta2 correlated with the growth inhibition rates in all cells tested excluding HL-60, and with the total mass of RARalpha in the cells (p=0.0137). Our results indicate that Am-80-induced cell-type non-specific growth inhibition is mediated by TGF-beta2, where the total mass of RARalpha could be an important regulatory factor in hematologic malignant cells.","['Jimi, Shiro', 'Mashima, Kota', 'Matsumoto, Taichi', 'Hara, Shuji', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Tamura, Kazuo']","['Jimi S', 'Mashima K', 'Matsumoto T', 'Hara S', 'Suzumiya J', 'Tamura K']","['Central Laboratory of Pathology and Morphology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka 814-0180, Japan. sjimi@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta2)', '08V52GZ3H9 (tamibarotene)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Benzoates/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoids/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta2/*metabolism']",2007/07/06 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/07/06 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Aug;31(2):397-404.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although >96% of patients with Ph+ALL achieved complete remission (CR) with imatinib-combined chemotherapy in a phase II clinical trial conducted by the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG), 26% of them experienced hematological relapse in a short time after achievement of CR. In this study, to establish a prediction system for risk of relapse, we analyzed gene expression profiles of 23 bone marrow samples from patients with Ph+ALL using cDNA microarray consisting of 27,648 cDNA sequences. Using the 19 randomly-selected test cases, we identified 16 genes that were expressed significantly differently between patients with (n=8) and without (n=11) continuous response; from the list of 16 genes, we selected the 6 'predictive' genes and constructed a numerical scoring system by which the two groups were clearly separated, with positive scores for the former and the negative scores for the latter. Scoring of 4 cases that were reserved from the original 23 cases predicted correctly their clinical responses. In addition, three cases whose BCR-Abl transcript levels failed to reduce sufficiently after induction therapy, also revealed negative scores. We also developed a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR-based prediction system that could be feasible for routine clinical use.

DLX genes (1-7), with large CpG islands in their 5' region, are implicated in a number of processes among which haematopoiesis. They are characterized by highly dynamic spatio-temporal expression and supposed to be involved in resistance to apoptosis of several tumor cell lines. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) hypermethylation is a common phenomenon frequently associated with poor prognosis in specific genetic childhood leukemia subgroups. These data together with the presence of large CpG islands in the up-stream regions of the DLX genes make them attractive candidates for methylation regulated gene expression and leukemia related aberrancies. To validate the role of DLX genes in paediatric B-ALL cells, we studied two cell lines and two groups of patients with paediatric chromosomal rearrangements: MLL-AF4 and TEL-AML1, respectively. Analysis of methylation and gene expression patterns of DLX3 in 64 specimens of B-lineage ALL revealed that DLX3 presents aberrant methylation in paediatric B-ALL patients. In vitro experiments with 5-Aza-2'dC on leukemia cell lines, confirmed by Western blot analysis, indicated that the methylation of DLX3 CpG islands has a functional role and interferes with the DLX3 gene and DLX3 protein expression in B-ALL cells. Importantly, hypermethylation of DLX3 significantly reduces its expression in MLL-AF4 rearranged leukemias while methylation is almost absent in TEL-AML1 positive ALL specimens. These results show that differential DLX3 methylation could be a new epigenetic marker for genotypic B-cell leukemia subgroup with high-risk features.","[""Campo Dell'Orto, Marta"", 'Banelli, Barbara', 'Giarin, Emanuela', 'Accordi, Benedetta', 'Trentin, Luca', 'Romani, Massimo', 'te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","[""Campo Dell'Orto M"", 'Banelli B', 'Giarin E', 'Accordi B', 'Trentin L', 'Romani M', 'te Kronnie G', 'Basso G']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Padova, I-35128 Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Distal-less homeobox proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', '*DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2007/07/06 09:00,2007/09/12 09:00,['2007/07/06 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2007 Aug;18(2):417-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have examined the central nervous system (CNS) transduction efficiencies and patterns of a self-inactivating simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac)-derived lentiviral vector pseudotyped with glycoproteins from the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), the amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV4070Aenv), the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-GP), the Ross River virus (RRV-GP) and the rabies virus (RV-G). All glycoproteins were efficiently incorporated into SIV virions, allowing efficient transduction of neuronal cell lines as well as of primary dissociated mouse brain cell cultures. After injection of highly concentrated vector stocks into the striatum of adult mice, quantitative analyses revealed high transduction efficiency with VSV-G pseudotypes, while LCMV-GP and RV-G pseudotypes exhibited moderate transduction efficiencies. MLV4070Aenv and RRV-GP pseudotypes, however, showed only weak levels of transduction after stereotactic injection into the brain. Regarding cell tropism in vivo, VSV-G-pseudotyped SIV vectors transduced neuronal as well as glial cells, whereas all other pseudotypes preferentially transduced neuroglial cells. In addition, we analyzed the influence of the central polypurine tract (cPPT) in context of the VSV-G-pseudotyped SIV transfer vector for infection of brain cells. Deletion of the cPPT sequence from the transfer vector decreased the in vivo transduction efficiency by fourfold, and, more importantly, this modification changed the transduction pattern, since these vectors were no longer able to infect neuronal cells in vivo. Vector injection into the brain did elicit a humoral immune response in the injected hemisphere; however, no gross signs of inflammation could be detected. Analysis of the biodistribution of the vector revealed that, besides the injected brain region, no vector-specific sequences could be detected in any of the organs evaluated. These data indicate SIV vectors as efficient gene delivery vehicles for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","['Liehl, B', 'Hlavaty, J', 'Moldzio, R', 'Tonar, Z', 'Unger, H', 'Salmons, B', 'Gunzburg, W H', 'Renner, M']","['Liehl B', 'Hlavaty J', 'Moldzio R', 'Tonar Z', 'Unger H', 'Salmons B', 'Gunzburg WH', 'Renner M']","['Research Institute for Virology and Biomedicine, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Brain/immunology/*metabolism', 'Brain Diseases/therapy', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corpus Callosum/virology', 'Corpus Striatum/virology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*genetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",2007/07/06 09:00,2007/12/11 09:00,['2007/07/06 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2007 Sep;14(18):1330-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3302988.

Hyperbilirubinemic Gunn rats, a model of CN-1, were injected at 2 days of age with lentiviral or oncoretroviral vectors encoding the human B-UGT1. After injection, bilirubinemia was normalized for up to 95 weeks. Bilirubin conjugates were present in the bile, demonstrating liver transduction. PCR and enzyme activity analysis confirmed gene and phenotype correction in liver. We observed that when using a strong viral promoter, a complete correction was achieved with less than 5% of B-UGT1 copy per haploid genome and after a reconstitution of 12% B-UGT1 normal activity. Liver histology remained normal throughout the experiment and tissue distribution analysis revealed preferential hepatocyte transduction after systemic delivery. Finally, no adverse immune response occurred even after induction of nonspecific liver inflammation, suggesting immune ignorance to the therapeutic protein.

Computer algorithms that in silico predict HLA class I and class II binding, proteasome cleavage patterns and transporter associated with antigen processing translocation are now available to expedite epitope identification. The advent of genomics allows a high-throughput screening for tumor-specific transcripts and mutations, with that identifying novel shared and unique TAA. The increasing power of mass spectrometry and proteomics will lead to the direct identification from the tumor cell surface of numerous novel tumor-specific HLA class I and class II presented ligands. Together, the expanded repertoire of tumor-specific T-cell epitopes will enable more precise immunomonitoring and the development of effective epitope-defined adoptive T-cell transfer and multi-epitope-based vaccination strategies targeting epitopes derived from a wider diversity of TAA presented in a broader array of HLA molecules.","['Kessler, J H', 'Melief, C J M']","['Kessler JH', 'Melief CJ']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Whether responses to 5-Azacytidine are achieved by demethylation of key genes or by cytotoxicity is unclear. Of 34 patients with MDS or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) treated with 5-Azacytidine, 7 achieved complete remissions (CR) (21%) and 6 achieved haematological improvement. All six had less than 5% bone marrow (BM) blasts at the time of haematological improvements (HI) (2 had pre-existing refractory anaemia (RA), 4 had refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB)). A further patient with RAEB had blast reduction to less than 5% without HI. Five of the seven (71%) complete responders had chromosome 7 abnormalities. BM CR predicted longer overall survival (OS) (median 23 versus 9 months, P=0.015). Bisulphite genomic sequencing (BGS) of the CDKN2B (p15(INK4b)) promoter showed low level, heterogeneous pretreatment methylation (mean 12.2%) in 14/17 (82%) patients analysed. Lower baseline methylation occurred in responders (9.8% versus 16.2% in non-responders P=0.07). No response was seen in patients with >24% methylation, in whom p15(INK4b) mRNA was not expressed. 5-Azacytidine reduced CDKN2B methylation by mean 6.8% in 8/17 (47%) patients, but this did not correlate with response. At 75 mg/m(2), cell death (reduced BM cellularity (P=0.001) and increased apoptosis (P=0.02)) rather than demethylation of CDKN2B correlates with response.

Heparanase activity plays a decisive role in biological processes associated with remodeling of the extracellular matrix, such as cancer metastasis, angiogenesis and inflammation. In the hematopoietic system, heparanase is thought to be associated with normal differentiation and function of myeloid cells and platelets. We investigated heparanase polymorphisms in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), Hodgkin's disease (HD) and multiple myeloma (MM). Significant correlation was found between rs11099592 and rs6535455 heparanase gene (HPSE) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ALL (chi2(1d.f.)=4.96, P=0.026). Genotype frequency comparisons revealed a significant association with rs4693602 (chi2(2d.f.)=7.276, P=0.026) in MM patients and rs4364254 (chi2(2d.f.)=6.226, P=0.044) in AML patients. Examination of HPSE gene mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR indicated a significant low HPSE gene expression level in ALL patients and a high expression level in MM and AML patients, compared to healthy controls. Moreover, statistically significant correlation was found between heparanase mRNA expression level and three HPSE gene SNPs (rs4693608, rs11099592 and rs4364254) among healthy individuals. These data suggest that certain HPSE gene SNPs may contribute to basal heparanase gene expression and that alterations in this gene are an important determinant in the pathogenesis of ALL, AML and MM.","['Ostrovsky, O', 'Korostishevsky, M', 'Levite, I', 'Leiba, M', 'Galski, H', 'Vlodavsky, I', 'Nagler, A']","['Ostrovsky O', 'Korostishevsky M', 'Levite I', 'Leiba M', 'Galski H', 'Vlodavsky I', 'Nagler A']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunobiology, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Frequency', 'Glucuronidase/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2007/07/06 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/07/06 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Nov;21(11):2296-303. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404821.

ALL maintenance therapy utilizes low-dose 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate (MTX), while maintenance in APL primarily consists of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). 6MP and MTX as used in ALL are also now usually added to maintenance ATRA for APL, based on data suggesting an improved disease-free survival. Although the mechanism of action of MTX and 6MP as maintenance is unknown, low-dose cytotoxic agents are potent inducers of differentiation in vitro. Thus, we studied whether maintenance therapy in ALL, like ATRA in APL, may be inducing terminal differentiation of ALL progenitors. The APL cell line NB4, the ALL cell lines REH and RS4;11, and patients' ALL blasts were incubated with ATRA, 6MP, and MTX in vitro. All three drugs inhibited the clonogenic growth of the APL and ALL cell lines without inducing immediate apoptosis, but associated with induction of phenotypic differentiation. The three drugs similarly upregulated lymphoid antigen expression, while decreasing CD34 expression, on patients' ALL blasts. These data suggest that induction of leukemia progenitor differentiation plays an important role in the mechanism of action of maintenance therapy in ALL.","['Lin, T L', 'Vala, M S', 'Barber, J P', 'Karp, J E', 'Smith, B D', 'Matsui, W', 'Jones, R J']","['Lin TL', 'Vala MS', 'Barber JP', 'Karp JE', 'Smith BD', 'Matsui W', 'Jones RJ']","['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxins/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2007/07/06 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/07/06 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Sep;21(9):1915-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404823.

In Phase I and Phase II clinical studies of nilotinib in patients with a variety of leukemias, infrequent instances of reversible, benign elevation of bilirubin were observed. Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) glucuronidates bilirubin in humans, and a polymorphism in the promoter of the gene that encodes it has been associated with hyperbilirubinemia during treatment with a number of drugs. Pharmacogenetic analysis of that TA-repeat polymorphism found an association between the (TA)7/(TA)7 genotype and risk of hyperbilirubinemia in Phase I patients with imatinib-resistant/intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or relapsed/refractory Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); this result was replicated in two separate analyses of the chronic phase (CP) and accelerated phase (AP) CML arms of a Phase II study. As nilotinib is not known to be glucuronidated by UGT1A1, the combined impact of inhibition of UGT1A1 activity by nilotinib and genetic polymorphism is the most likely cause of the increased rate of hyperbilirubinemia.","['Singer, J B', 'Shou, Y', 'Giles, F', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Hsu, Y', 'Robeva, A S', 'Rae, P', 'Weitzman, A', 'Meyer, J M', 'Dugan, M', 'Ottmann, O G']","['Singer JB', 'Shou Y', 'Giles F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Hsu Y', 'Robeva AS', 'Rae P', 'Weitzman A', 'Meyer JM', 'Dugan M', 'Ottmann OG']","['Clinical Pharmacogenetics, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. jonathan.singer@novartis.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (UGT1A1 enzyme)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bilirubin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hyperbilirubinemia/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Recurrence', 'Risk']",2007/07/06 09:00,2007/12/12 09:00,['2007/07/06 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Nov;21(11):2311-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404827.

Expression profiling of a series of 160 CLL patients allowed interrogating the genes presumably playing a role in pathogenesis, relating the expression of functionally relevant signatures with the time to treatment. First, we identified genes relevant to the biology and prognosis of CLL to build a CLL disease-specific oligonucleotide microarray. Second, we hybridized a training series on the CLL-specific chip, generating a biology-based predictive model. Finally, this model was validated in a new CLL series. Clinical variability in CLL is related with the expression of two gene clusters, associated with B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, including nuclear factor-kappaB1 (NF-kappaB1). The expression of these clusters identifies three risk-score groups with treatment-free survival probabilities at 5 years of 83, 50 and 17%. This molecular predictor can be applied to early clinical stages of CLL. This signature is related to immunoglobulin variable region somatic hypermutation and surrogate markers. There is a molecular heterogeneity in CLL, dependent on the expression of genes defining BCR and MAPK/NF-kappaB clusters, which can be used to predict time to treatment in early clinical stages.","['Rodriguez, A', 'Villuendas, R', 'Yanez, L', 'Gomez, M E', 'Diaz, R', 'Pollan, M', 'Hernandez, N', 'de la Cueva, P', 'Marin, M C', 'Swat, A', 'Ruiz, E', 'Cuadrado, M A', 'Conde, E', 'Lombardia, L', 'Cifuentes, F', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Garcia-Marco, J A', 'Piris, M A']","['Rodriguez A', 'Villuendas R', 'Yanez L', 'Gomez ME', 'Diaz R', 'Pollan M', 'Hernandez N', 'de la Cueva P', 'Marin MC', 'Swat A', 'Ruiz E', 'Cuadrado MA', 'Conde E', 'Lombardia L', 'Cifuentes F', 'Gonzalez M', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Piris MA']","['Molecular Pathology Program, Spanish National Cancer Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Multigene Family', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/genetics/*metabolism']",2007/07/06 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/07/06 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Sep;21(9):1984-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404831.

Except of their direct anti-myeloma effect, these agents also alter the interactions between myeloma cells and marrow microenvironment. Several recent studies have investigated their potential effect on myeloma bone disease. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that IMiDs reduce osteoclast formation and function in vitro. Clinical studies have confirmed that thalidomide reduces markers of bone resorption, while lenalidomide induces osteoclast arrest in myeloma patients. However, IMiDs seem to have no effect on osteoblast exhaustion present in myeloma. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib restores abnormal bone remodeling through the inhibition of osteoclast function and the increase in osteoblast differentiation and activity in vitro. In myeloma patients, bortezomib reduces biochemical markers of bone resorption and normalizes the RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio, while at the same time increases bone formation markers reducing levels of dickkopf-1 protein. Whether these effects are direct and not only a consequence of the agents' antimyeloma activity is not totally clear.

In a few cases, definitive assignment cannot be achieved because blasts express antigens of more than one lineage. A subset of these, referred to as acute bilineal leukemias (aBLLs), is characterized by the presence of more than one population of blasts, each comprising a single lineage. We identified 19 cases of aBLL, including 10 mixed T and myeloid (T-My) and nine mixed B and myeloid (B-My); no mixed B and T cases were identified. Cytogenetic data were available for 16 patients. Three of seven patients with B-My had a t(9;22)(q34q11.2), two had 11q23 translocations and one had del(9). Two of nine patients with T-My had 2p13 translocations; five had other unrelated abnormalities. Of 16 patients with outcome data, only six achieved complete remission and only two remain free of disease 2.5 and 4.5 years after chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. aBLL is a rare disease that combines B or T and myeloid blasts. Cytogenetic abnormalities of t(9;22) and 11q23 are common in, and may be restricted to, B-My cases, while T-My cases have frequent but generally non-recurring abnormalities.

Here we report the identification of a somatic mutation in human breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers that results in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid 17 (E17K) in the lipid-binding pocket of AKT1. Lys 17 alters the electrostatic interactions of the pocket and forms new hydrogen bonds with a phosphoinositide ligand. This mutation activates AKT1 by means of pathological localization to the plasma membrane, stimulates downstream signalling, transforms cells and induces leukaemia in mice. This mechanism indicates a direct role of AKT1 in human cancer, and adds to the known genetic alterations that promote oncogenesis through the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT pathway. Furthermore, the E17K substitution decreases the sensitivity to an allosteric kinase inhibitor, so this mutation may have important clinical utility for AKT drug development.","['Carpten, John D', 'Faber, Andrew L', 'Horn, Candice', 'Donoho, Gregory P', 'Briggs, Stephen L', 'Robbins, Christiane M', 'Hostetter, Galen', 'Boguslawski, Sophie', 'Moses, Tracy Y', 'Savage, Stephanie', 'Uhlik, Mark', 'Lin, Aimin', 'Du, Jian', 'Qian, Yue-Wei', 'Zeckner, Douglas J', 'Tucker-Kellogg, Greg', 'Touchman, Jeffrey', 'Patel, Ketan', 'Mousses, Spyro', 'Bittner, Michael', 'Schevitz, Richard', 'Lai, Mei-Huei T', 'Blanchard, Kerry L', 'Thomas, James E']","['Carpten JD', 'Faber AL', 'Horn C', 'Donoho GP', 'Briggs SL', 'Robbins CM', 'Hostetter G', 'Boguslawski S', 'Moses TY', 'Savage S', 'Uhlik M', 'Lin A', 'Du J', 'Qian YW', 'Zeckner DJ', 'Tucker-Kellogg G', 'Touchman J', 'Patel K', 'Mousses S', 'Bittner M', 'Schevitz R', 'Lai MH', 'Blanchard KL', 'Thomas JE']","['Division of Integrated Cancer Genomics, Translational Genomics Research Institute, 445 N.

METHODS: Twenty-four patients with acute or chronic leukemia treated by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) were randomly divided into a test group and a control group. The patients in the test group were treated with rhIL-11 since the 13th day after PBSCT (1.5mg/d),while the control group were given symptomatic treatment. RESULTS: The average time for the platelet to recover to the level of 20 x 10(9)/L was 20.8 days in the test group, and 26.0 days in control group respectively, there was significant difference (P<0.01). The average time for the platelet to recover to the level of 50 x 10(9)/L was 25.7 days in the test group, and 32.3 days in the control group respectively, there was also significant difference (P<0.01). The average time for the platelet transfusion was 2.2 in the test group, 4.1 in the control group, and there was significantly different (P<0.01). The average number of megakaryocytes was 12.2 in the test group, 4.8 in the control group on 30th day after the transplantation,and there was significant difference(P<0.01). The main side effects of rhIL-11 were nausea, vomit, debility, headache, dizzy and pain of injection site, and the degree was all Iapproximately II grade. CONCLUSION: rhIL-11 has definite recuperative effect on the recovery of the platelet after PBSCT.

Also to evaluate cardiac markers to quantify cardiotoxicity, and identify cost-effectiveness studies and future research priorities. DATA SOURCES: Eight electronic databases were searched from inception to January 2006. Bibliographies of related papers were assessed for relevant studies and experts contacted to identify additional published references. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the evidence was undertaken using a priori methods. RESULTS: Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria of the review, each considering a different cardioprotective intervention; all trials included children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and one also included children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, all had methodological limitations. No cost-effectiveness studies were identified. One RCT and six cohort studies on the use of cardiac markers met the inclusion criteria of the review, but also had methodological limitations. Of the two RCTs that considered continuous infusion versus bolus (rapid) infusion, one found that continuous infusion of doxorubicin did not offer any cardioprotection over bolus; the other suggested that continuous infusion of daunorubicin had less cardiotoxicity than bolus. Two studies considered cardioprotective agents, one concluded that dexrazoxane prevents or reduces cardiac injury without compromising the antileukaemic efficacy of doxorubicin and the other reported a protective effect of coenzyme Q10 on cardiac function during anthracycline therapy. One RCT suggested that cardiac troponin T can be used to assess the effectiveness of the cardioprotective agent dexrazoxane. Two cohort studies considering atrial natriuretic peptide and two considering brain (B-type) natriuretic peptide suggested that these chemicals are elevated in some subgroups of children treated with anthracyclines for cancer. N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide levels were significantly elevated in children treated with anthracyclines who had cardiac dysfunction. One cohort study found that serum lipid peroxide was higher in younger children treated with doxorubicin than correspondingly aged children not receiving doxorubicin. No differences in carnitine levels were found in children treated with doxorubicin and a group of healthy children in one cohort study. CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of technologies for reducing or preventing cardiotoxicity and about the use of cardiac markers in children as the evidence is limited in quantity and quality. The lack of standardisation for monitoring and reporting cardiac performance is problematic. Not all studies report effectiveness in terms of cardiac outcomes and event-free survival with supporting statistical analyses. Studies are mostly small and of short duration, making generalisation difficult. Increasing numbers of survivors of childhood cancer treated with anthracyclines will experience cardiac damage and require long-term surveillance and management. This will have an impact on cardiac services and costs. Diverse medical problems and other late sequelae that affect cardiac outcome will have an impact on other specialist services. Mechanisms to reduce or prevent cardiotoxicity from anthracycline therapy and cardiac markers to improve monitoring could alter the extent of this impact on service provision. RCTs of the different methods for reducing or preventing cardiotoxicity in children treated with anthracyclines for cancer with long-term follow-up are needed to determine whether the technologies influence the development of cardiac damage. Cost-effectiveness research is also required.","['Bryant, J', 'Picot, J', 'Levitt, G', 'Sullivan, I', 'Baxter, L', 'Clegg, A']","['Bryant J', 'Picot J', 'Levitt G', 'Sullivan I', 'Baxter L', 'Clegg A']","['Southampton Health Technology Assessments Centre, Wessex Institute for Health Research and Development, University of Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Health Technol Assess,"Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)",9706284,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cardiovascular Agents)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/*adverse effects/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cardiovascular Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced/diagnosis/*prevention & control', 'Heart Failure/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",2007/07/06 09:00,2007/09/22 09:00,['2007/07/06 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Health Technol Assess. 2007 Jul;11(27):iii, ix-x, 1-84. doi: 10.3310/hta11270.",44,,,"['05/34/01 [pii]', '10.3310/hta11270 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report mechanisms of action of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, depsipeptide (FK228) in BCR/ABL-expressing cell lines and its effectiveness in imatinib-resistant cells from patients with blast crisis of CML. FK228 potently induced apoptosis of TF-1 BCR/ABL, K562, and H7 BCR/ABL cells. We found that histone H4, BCR/ABL, heat shock protein 90 (HSP-90), p53, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, and retinoblastoma protein (Rb) were acetylated in the treated cells. Cells were also blocked in G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle and activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was blocked, but p38MAPK (p38) was activated. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) were suppressed, and common results of apoptotic induction were observed, such as caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation. Although p38 was phosphorylated after FK228 treatment, histone H4 acetylation, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis were not inhibited by treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580. We also found that human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) ShRNA-transfected cells demonstrated decreased FK228-induced apoptosis. Of clinical relevance, FK228-induced apoptosis of imatinib-resistant primary cells from patients with CML, who had progressed to blast crisis (BC) while receiving therapy with imatinib. In conclusion, FK228 potently induces apoptosis of CML cells by acetylation and degradation of BCR/ABL protein. Our study suggests how FK228 may mediate its effects on imatinib-resistant CML cells.","['Okabe, Seiichi', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Nakajima, Akihiro', 'Sashida, Goro', 'Gotoh, Akihiko', 'Broxmeyer, Hal E', 'Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Okabe S', 'Tauchi T', 'Nakajima A', 'Sashida G', 'Gotoh A', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan. okabe@tokyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Depsipeptides/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/07/06 09:00,2007/12/18 09:00,['2007/07/06 09:00'],"['2007/07/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2007 Jun;16(3):503-14. doi: 10.1089/scd.2007.9994.,,,,['10.1089/scd.2007.9994 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to quantitatively detect different pesticides (propoxur and cypermethrin) in meconium from 49 newborn babies from the Philippines. The generation of t(8;21) was determined in the corresponding umbilical cord blood samples by detection of the AML1-ETO fusion transcripts derived from t(8;21) using nested RT-PCR. Levels for the AML1-ETO fusion transcripts were quantitated by real-time RT-PCR in the t(8;21) positive cord blood samples. AML1-ETO fusion transcript forms were characterized by RT-PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: In the present study using umbilical cord blood samples obtained from infants whose prenatal exposure to the pesticide, propoxur, was determined by meconium analysis, we showed that (i) incidence of t(8;21) in the exposed group was two-fold higher than that in the unexposed group; and (ii) the levels for AML1-ETO fusion transcripts resulting from t(8;21) positively correlated with propoxur concentrations in meconium. Similar heterogeneity in the fusion transcripts was detected in the t(8;21) positive cord blood samples as in our previous study with t(8;21) AML patients. CONCLUSION: These results further confirm the prenatal origin of t(8;21) and establish a significant correlation between prenatal pesticide exposures and the generation of t(8;21). They suggest that prenatal pesticide exposures may be causal factors for the generation of leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations.","['Lafiura, Katherine M', 'Bielawski, Dawn M', 'Posecion, Norberto C Jr', 'Ostrea, Enrique M Jr', 'Matherly, Larry H', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Lafiura KM', 'Bielawski DM', 'Posecion NC Jr', 'Ostrea EM Jr', 'Matherly LH', 'Taub JW', 'Ge Y']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Pesticides)', 'BFH029TL73 (Propoxur)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood', 'Fetus', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics', 'Maternal Exposure/adverse effects', 'Meconium/chemistry', 'Pesticides/analysis', 'Pregnancy', 'Propoxur/*analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Oct 15;49(5):624-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21283.,,,"['CA92308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD039428/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1002/pbc.21283 [doi]'],,,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Oct 15;49(5):607-8.

The aim was to evaluate heart muscle function in asymptomatic adult survivors of ALL treated in early childhood in relation to the combined effects of AC and other potential cardiotoxic factors. PROCEDURE: Twenty-three young adult ALL survivors who had all received treatment with median 120 (120-400) mg AC/m(2) before the onset of puberty were examined median 21 years after remission and compared with 12 healthy controls. Basal echocardiography including two-dimensional (2D) M-mode and Doppler examination was performed, followed by a maximal exercise stress test and stress echocardiography immediately after stress test and after 5 min recovery. RESULTS: We found significant differences in systolic function between patients and controls at maximal exercise despite absence of reported symptoms from the patients. The most marked difference was in ejection fraction at stress 59.5% (32.6-81.1) and 77.3% (66.2-85.3), respectively (P < 0.00006). Ten out of 23 patients reduced their ejection fraction at stress compared with at rest; this was not found in any of the controls. Cardiovascular risk factors such as GH deficiency and a high proportion of trunk fat did not have an impact on cardiac function. CONCLUSIONS: With very long follow up in a homogenous cohort of ALL survivors, we found subclinical cardiac dysfunction with exercise stress echocardiography even after low doses of AC.","['Jarfelt, M', 'Kujacic, V', 'Holmgren, D', 'Bjarnason, R', 'Lannering, B']","['Jarfelt M', 'Kujacic V', 'Holmgren D', 'Bjarnason R', 'Lannering B']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Haematology and Oncology, Cardiovascular Institute, Sahlgrenska Academy at Goteborg University, Goteborg, Sweden. marianne.jarfelt@vgregion.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Echocardiography, Doppler', '*Echocardiography, Stress', '*Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced/*physiopathology', 'Human Growth Hormone/deficiency', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Nov;49(6):835-40. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21289.,,,,['10.1002/pbc.21289 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated that PKCalpha is selectively anchored to mitochondria by PICK1 in fibroblasts NIH 3T3. In this study, we show that over-expression of PICK1 in leukemia REH confers resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis, which requires an interaction with PKCalpha as the non-interacting mutant PICK1 loses the pro-survival activity. The PKCalpha selective inhibitor Go6976 also abolishes the anti-apoptotic effect indicating a requirement for PKC activity. Disruption of PICK1/PKCalpha interactions by inhibitory peptides significantly increases cellular susceptibility to etoposide. Similar effects are also observed in HL60 cells, which exhibit an intrinsic resistance to etoposide. Molecular analysis shows that the wild type PICK1, but not the non-interacting mutant, prevents the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential with a coincident increase in phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2(Ser70) and a decrease in dimerization of the pro-apoptotic Bax.

Here, we systematically analyzed lentiviral vectors containing the following promoters: the human elongation factor 1alpha (EF1alpha) promoter, the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early region enhancer-promoter, the composite CAG promoter (consisting of the CMV immediate early enhancer and the chicken beta-actin promoter), the human phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK) promoter, the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) long terminal repeat (LTR), or the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) LTR. Our results show that the EF1alpha promoter directed robust transgene expression at every stage of mouse ES cell differentiation, whereas the CMV promoter drove transgene expression only during late stages. Similarly, the CAG and PGK promoters drove transgene expression at a significant level only during late stages. The MSCV LTR and the GALV LTR exhibited much lower promoter activities at all stages. Interestingly, mouse ES cells transduced with the EF1alpha promoter-containing lentiviral vector lost most of their transgene expression during in vitro differentiation to neural precursors and neuronal cells. Our results demonstrate that different cellular and viral promoters exhibit very distinct and dynamic properties not only in terms of promoter strength but also with respect to differentiation stage-specific activity.","['Hong, Sunghoi', 'Hwang, Dong-Youn', 'Yoon, Soonsang', 'Isacson, Ole', 'Ramezani, Ali', 'Hawley, Robert G', 'Kim, Kwang-Soo']","['Hong S', 'Hwang DY', 'Yoon S', 'Isacson O', 'Ramezani A', 'Hawley RG', 'Kim KS']","['Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory, McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Belmont, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 1)', 'EC 2.7.2.3 (Phosphoglycerate Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/genetics/physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1/genetics', 'Phosphoglycerate Kinase/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors']",2007/07/05 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2007 Sep;15(9):1630-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.mt.6300251.

Burkitt lymphomas (BLs) still have poor outcome in patients with bone marrow (BM) or central nervous system (CNS) involvement when treated with standard-dose chemotherapy. We have prospectively evaluated the LMB86 regimen in 63 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with stage IV (BM and/or CNS involvement) BL consecutively recruited between November 1992 and January 2006. At BL diagnosis, the median CD4 cell count was 239 x 10(6)/L (range, 16-1188 x 10(6)/L). BM and CNS involvement were present in 55 (80%) and 48 (76%) patients, respectively. Forty-four patients (70%) achieved complete response. Seven treatment-related deaths occurred and all patients experienced severe BM toxicity. With a median follow-up of 66 months (range, 6-165 months), 11 patients relapsed. The estimate 2-year overall survival and disease-free survival were 47.1% (95% CI, 34-59.1) and 67.8% (95% CI, 51-80), respectively. We identified 2 poor prognosis factors: low CD4 count and ECOG more than 2. Patients with 0 or 1 factor had good outcome (2-year survival: 60%) contrasting with patients with 2 factors (2-year survival: 12%). We conclude that LMB86 regimen is highly effective in advanced HIV-related BL and should be proposed for patients with CD4 count higher than 200 x 10(6)/L or ECOG of 2 or less.","['Galicier, Lionel', 'Fieschi, Claire', 'Borie, Raphael', 'Meignin, Veronique', 'Daniel, Marie-Therese', 'Gerard, Laurence', 'Oksenhendler, Eric']","['Galicier L', 'Fieschi C', 'Borie R', 'Meignin V', 'Daniel MT', 'Gerard L', 'Oksenhendler E']","['Departments of Clinical Immunology, Hopital St Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France. lionel.galicier@sls.aphp.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Oct 15;110(8):2846-54. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-10-051771.

We have shown before that the frequency of such CD34(+)CD38(-) cells at diagnosis correlates with minimal residual disease (MRD) frequency after chemotherapy and with survival. Specific targeting of CD34(+)CD38(-) cells might thus offer therapeutic options. Previously, we found that C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1) has high expression on the whole blast compartment in the majority of AML cases. We now show that CLL-1 expression is also present on the CD34(+)CD38(-) stem- cell compartment in AML (77/89 patients). The CD34(+)CLL-1(+) population, containing the CD34(+)CD38(-)CLL-1(+) cells, does engraft in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice with outgrowth to CLL-1(+) blasts. CLL-1 expression was not different between diagnosis and relapse (n = 9). In remission, both CLL-1(-) normal and CLL-1(+) malignant CD34(+)CD38(-) cells were present. A high CLL-1(+) fraction was associated with quick relapse. CLL-1 expression is completely absent both on CD34(+)CD38(-) cells in normal (n = 11) and in regenerating bone marrow controls (n = 6). This AML stem-cell specificity of the anti-CLL-1 antibody under all conditions of disease and the leukemia-initiating properties of CD34(+)CLL-1(+) cells indicate that anti-CLL-1 antibody enables both AML-specific stem-cell detection and possibly antigen-targeting in future.","['van Rhenen, Anna', 'van Dongen, Guus A M S', 'Kelder, Angele', 'Rombouts, Elwin J', 'Feller, Nicole', 'Moshaver, Bijan', 'Stigter-van Walsum, Marijke', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Jan Schuurhuis, Gerrit']","['van Rhenen A', 'van Dongen GA', 'Kelder A', 'Rombouts EJ', 'Feller N', 'Moshaver B', 'Stigter-van Walsum M', 'Zweegman S', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Jan Schuurhuis G']","['Department of Hematology, VU [Vrije Universiteit] University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CLEC12A protein, human)', '0 (CLEC12A protein, mouse)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*metabolism']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Oct 1;110(7):2659-66. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-03-083048.

However, the molecular mechanisms of TLX1 deregulation remain unclear and various transcript levels in the absence of 10q24 abnormalities have been reported. A reproducible and accurate delineation of TLX1(+) T-ALL will be necessary for proper therapeutic stratification. We have studied 264 unselected T-ALLs (171 adults and 93 children) and show that T-ALLs expressing high levels of TLX1 (n = 35, 13%), defined as a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) level of TLX1 greater than 1.00 ABL, form a homogeneous oncogenic group, based on their uniform stage of maturation arrest and oncogenetic and transcriptional profiles. Furthermore, TLX1-high T-ALLs harbor molecular TLX1 locus abnormalities in the majority (31/33), a proportion largely underestimated by standard karyotypic screening. T-ALLs expressing TLX1 at lower levels (n = 57, 22%) do not share these characteristics. Prognostic analysis within the adult LALA94 and GRAALL03 prospective protocols demonstrate a better event-free survival (P = .035) and a marked trend for longer overall survival (P = .059) for TLX1-high T-ALLs, while the expression of lower levels of TLX1 does not impact on prognosis. We propose that TLX1(+) T-ALLs be defined as cases expressing TLX1/ABL ratios greater than 1 and/or demonstrating TLX1 rearrangement.

Here, we reveal the novel finding that oligomerization of leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) functions to prevent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and to retain LARG in the cytoplasm. We establish that oligomerization is mediated by a predicted coiled-coil sequence (amino acids 1507-1520) in the extreme C terminus of LARG and that substitution of isoleucines 1507/1510 with alanines disrupts homo-oligomerization and leads to nucleocytoplasmic shuttling via the CRM1 nuclear transport pathway. In addition, we demonstrate that induced dimerization of an otherwise nuclear monomeric LARG mutant promotes cytoplasmic localization. Furthermore, we establish that nuclear import of monomeric LARG is mediated by the nuclear localization sequence (29)PTDKKQK(35) in the extreme N terminus. We propose that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling provides a mechanism for spatially regulating the activity of LARG toward its cytoplasmic targets and potentially new nuclear targets.","['Grabocka, Elda', 'Wedegaertner, Philip B']","['Grabocka E', 'Wedegaertner PB']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Thomas Jefferson University, 233 S. 10 Street, 839 BLSB, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (ARHGEF12 protein, human)', '0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biopolymers/chemistry/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Transport', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2007 Oct;72(4):993-1002. doi: 10.1124/mol.107.035162.

Here, we demonstrate that interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment upregulates TRIM5alpha mRNA in rhesus monkey cells, which correlates with the enhanced TRIM5alpha-mediated pre- and postintegration blocks of human immunodeficiency virus replication. In human cells, IFN-alpha increases the levels of TRIM5alpha mRNA, resulting in enhanced antiviral activity against N-tropic murine leukemia virus infection. These observations indicate that the TRIM5alpha-mediated antiviral effects can be orchestrated by the conventional innate immune response. It is conceivable that TRIM5alpha plays an essential role in controlling both the initial retroviral exposure and the subsequent viral dissemination in vivo.","['Sakuma, Ryuta', 'Mael, Amber A', 'Ikeda, Yasuhiro']","['Sakuma R', 'Mael AA', 'Ikeda Y']","['Molecular Medicine Program, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5(alpha) protein, rhesus monkey)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC Deaminases', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/immunology/metabolism', 'HIV Infections/immunology/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*drug effects/immunology', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology/metabolism', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects/immunology']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/10/18 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Sep;81(18):10201-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00419-07.

In the New World species owl monkey the coding region for the viral binding B30.2 domain of TRIM5alpha has been replaced by a cyclophilin A (CypA) pseudogene by retrotransposition. The resultant TRIM5-CypA fusion protein restricts human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), as well as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), by recruitment of the CypA domain to the incoming viral capsids. Infectivity is rescued by agents such as cyclosporine that disrupt CypA binding to its substrates. Mice encode an antiviral restriction factor called Fv1 (for Friend virus susceptibility gene 1), which is active against murine leukemia virus and related to endogenous gag sequences. Here we show that fusing CypA to Fv1 generates a restriction factor with the antiviral specificity of TRIMCyp but the antiviral properties of Fv1. Like TRIMCyp, Fv1-Cyp restricts HIV-1 and FIV and is sensitive to inhibition by cyclosporine. TRIM5alpha is known to have a short half-life and block infectivity before viral reverse transcription. We show that Fv1-Cyp has a long half-life and blocks after reverse transcription, suggesting that its longer half-life gives the restricted virus the opportunity to synthesize DNA, leading to a later block to infection. This notion is supported by the observation that infectivity of Fv1-Cyp restricted virus can be rescued by cyclosporine for several hours after infection, whereas virus restricted by TRIMCyp is terminally restricted after around 40 min. Intriguingly, the Fv1-Cyp-restricted HIV-1 generates closed circular viral DNA, suggesting that the restricted virus complex enters the nucleus.","['Schaller, Torsten', 'Ylinen, Laura M J', 'Webb, Benjamin L J', 'Singh, Shalene', 'Towers, Greg J']","['Schaller T', 'Ylinen LM', 'Webb BL', 'Singh S', 'Towers GJ']","['MRC Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, Department of Infection, Royal Free and University College London Medical School, 46 Cleveland Street, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aotidae', 'Capsid/immunology/metabolism', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclophilin A/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'HIV-1/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcription/genetics/immunology', 'Virus Internalization']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/10/18 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Sep;81(18):10055-63. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00616-07.

In the current study we show that NK cells are unable to kill HTLV-1-infected primary CD4+ T cells. Exposure of NK cells to interleukin-2 (IL-2) resulted in only a marginal increase in their ability to kill HTLV-1-infected primary CD4+ T cells. This inability of NK cells to kill HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells occurred despite the down-modulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, one of the ligands for the major NK cell inhibitory receptor, by HTLV-1 p12(I) on CD4+ T cells. One reason for this diminished ability of NK cells to kill HTLV-1-infected cells was the decreased ability of NK cells to adhere to HTLV-1-infected cells because of HTLV-1 p12(I)-mediated down-modulation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and ICAM-2. We also found that HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells did not express ligands for NK cell activating receptors, NCR and NKG2D, although they did express ligands for NK cell coactivating receptors, NTB-A and 2B4. Thus, despite HTLV-1-mediated down-modulation of MHC-I molecules, HTLV-1-infected primary CD4+ T cells avoids NK cell destruction by modulating ICAM expression and shunning the expression of ligands for activating receptors.","['Banerjee, Prabal', 'Feuer, Gerold', 'Barker, Edward']","['Banerjee P', 'Feuer G', 'Barker E']","['Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Rush University Medical Center, 1735 West Harrison Street, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD244 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (ICAM2 protein, human)', '0 (IL2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '0 (SLAMF6 protein, human)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (p12I protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '169535-43-7 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1', 'Transcription Factors/*immunology/metabolism', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/10/18 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Sep;81(18):9707-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00887-07.

Mutation of the PPPY motif arrests particle assembly at an early stage and abolishes ubiquitination of MA. Similar effects are seen when Gag is expressed in the presence of a truncated form of WWP1 that lacks the catalytically active HECT domain (C2WW). To understand the role of ubiquitination in budding, we mutated the four lysines in MA to arginines and identified lysine 74 as the unique site of ubiquitination. Virus-like particles produced by the K74R mutant did not contain ubiquitinated MA and showed a fourfold reduction in the release of infectious particles. Furthermore, the K74R mutation rendered assembly hypersensitive to C2WW inhibition; K74R Gag budding was inhibited at significantly lower levels of expression of C2WW compared with wild-type Gag. This finding indicates that the interaction between Gag and WWP1 is required for functions other than Gag ubiquitination. Additionally, we show that the PPPY(-) mutant Gag exerts a strong dominant-negative effect on the budding of wild-type Gag, further supporting the importance of recruitment of WWP1 to achieve particle assembly.","['Heidecker, Gisela', 'Lloyd, Patricia A', 'Soheilian, Ferri', 'Nagashima, Kunio', 'Derse, David']","['Heidecker G', 'Lloyd PA', 'Soheilian F', 'Nagashima K', 'Derse D']","['National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA. heidecke@ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (WWP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/genetics', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Ubiquitin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Assembly/*physiology']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/10/18 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Sep;81(18):9769-77. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00642-07.

We and other investigators have mutagenized rodent cells and isolated mutant cell lines resistant to retrovirus infection. Since there are differences in the efficiency of single round infection with VSVG pseudotyped HIV-1 on cells of different species, we conducted a genetic screen to isolate human cells resistant to HIV-1 infection. We chemically mutagenized human HeLa cells and validated our ability to isolate mutants at test diploid loci. We then executed a screen to isolate HeLa cell mutants resistant to infection by an HIV-1 vector coding for a toxic gene product. RESULTS: We isolated two mutant cell lines that exhibit up to 10-fold resistance to infection by HIV-1 vectors. We have verified that the cells are resistant to infection and not defective in gene expression. We have confirmed that the resistance phenotype is not due to an entry defect. Fusion experiments between mutant and wild-type cells have established that the mutations conferring resistance in the two clones are recessive. We have also determined the nature of the block in the two mutants. One clone exhibits a block at or before reverse transcription of viral RNA and the second clone has a retarded kinetic of viral DNA synthesis and a block at nuclear import of the preintegration complex. CONCLUSION: Human cell mutants can be isolated that are resistant to infection by HIV-1. The mutants are genetically recessive and identify two points where host cell factors can be targeted to block HIV-1 infection.","['Lech, Patrycja', 'Somia, Nikunj V']","['Lech P', 'Somia NV']","['Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology and Genetics Graduate Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. lechx001@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Genes, Recessive', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', '*Mutagenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Internalization', 'Virus Replication']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/09/07 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2006/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2007 Jul 3;4:45. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-4-45.,,,"['P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI060470/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA77598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI60470/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['1742-4690-4-45 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-4-45 [doi]']",,,20070703,,PMC1925114,,,,,,,,,

Recently, Dauer and co-workers presented a modified protocol for differentiation of human monocytes into mature DCs within 48 hours (Fast DC). Here we report a functional comparison of the two strategies for generation of DCs from human monocytes with adaptions for large-scale clinical use. METHODS: The Elutra Cell Selection System was used to isolate monocytes after collection of leukapheresis product. The enriched monocytes were cultured in gas permeable Teflon bags with IL-4 and GM-CSF for 24 hours (Fast DC) or 5 days (Standard DC) to obtain immature DCs. The cells were then transfected with mRNA from the leukemia cell line Jurkat E6 by electroporation and incubated for additional 24 h or 2 days in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and PGE2) to obtain mature DCs. RESULTS: Mature Fast DC and Standard DC displayed comparable levels of many markers expressed on DC, including HLA-DR, CD83, CD86, CD208 and CCR7. However, compared to Standard DC, mature Fast DC was CD14high CD209low. Fast DC and Standard DC transfected with Jurkat E6-cell mRNA were equally able to elicit T cell specifically recognizing transfected DCs in vitro. IFNgamma-secreting T cells were observed in both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets.

Declining donor CD3 chimaerism beyond day+100 was treated with pre-emptive donor lymphocyte infusion (pDLI). The median age of patients was 53.0 years (range: 19-72 years), and the median follow-up was 690 d (range:168-1470 d). Patients achieving full CD3 donor chimaerism (FDC, n = 46) by day+100 had a significantly inferior disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to patients with mixed donor chimaerism (MDC, n = 59). Twenty patients had stable MDC and did not require pDLI. Patients attaining early FDC had a higher transplant-related mortality compared to those who maintained stable levels of MDC (P = 0.02), with no difference between the FDC and pDLI groups (P = 0.07). There was no difference in relapse between all three groups (P = 0.21).

The reported incidence varies from 1% to 36%, depending on the chemotherapy protocol and whether the reported cases are symptomatic or detected on screening radiography. The risk is thought to arise from increased thrombin generation at diagnosis combined with reduced thrombin inhibitory capacity due to depletion of circulating anti-thrombin (AT) by asparaginase. A number of patient and treatment variables have been reported to influence the risk of thrombosis including hereditary thrombophilia, early insertion of central venous catheters and exposure to a combination of steroids and asparaginase during induction. Erwinia asparaginase is associated with a lower risk of thrombosis compared with Escherichia coli asparaginase. The majority of symptomatic thromboses are related to central venous catheters and involve the upper venous system. Central nervous system thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses is a unique feature of asparaginase-related thrombosis and is reported to occur in 1-3% of patients. Conclusive evidence to support the use of anti-coagulant treatment or AT concentrates for primary prevention is lacking, as is evidence for the efficacy of AT concentrates in the management of established thrombosis. Preventative strategies are hampered by conflicting data on factors that would enable identification of those at highest risk of thrombosis.","['Payne, Jeanette H', 'Vora, Ajay J']","['Payne JH', 'Vora AJ']","[""Department of Paediatric Haematology, Sheffield Children's Hospital, Sheffield, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombophilia/complications', 'Thrombosis/*complications/prevention & control']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Aug;138(4):430-45. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06677.x.

Measurement of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and T-cell receptor beta (TCRBV) CDR3 repertoire is a means of quantifying recent thymic T-cell production and reflecting antigen-specific T-cell clones proliferation. METHODS: We used real-time quantitative PCR to detect TRECs from 43 Chinese patients who underwent three kind of allo-HSCT without T-cell depletion. RT-PCR was performed to amplify 24 subfamily genes of TCRBV in 24 patients of them. RESULTS: For haploidentical-D group, the TRECs numbers were lower up to 24 months. For matched-sibling donor (MSD) group, the recovery of TRECs was faster than those of other two groups. TRECs values in matched-unrelated donor (MUD) were in the middle. During 2-19 months after transplantation, there were 6-16 BV subfamilies expressed and 33-48% of them were polyclones. The usage rate of TCRBV and percentage of polyclones in haploidentical-D were less than those of other two groups. Twenty-three CDR3 molecules were obtained from nine patients who were potentially associated with GVHD or CMV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing the changes of TCRBV repertoire and measuring TRECs during immune reconstitution would be useful to determine the host's current immune status and ability of T-cell immune reconstitution and also to find antigen-specific T-cell clones in the three kinds of HSCT.","['Fu, Yue Wen', 'Wu, De Pei', 'Cen, Jian Nong', 'Feng, Yu Feng', 'Chang, Wei Rong', 'Zhu, Zi Ling', 'Qiu, Qiao Chen', 'Zhu, Ping']","['Fu YW', 'Wu DP', 'Cen JN', 'Feng YF', 'Chang WR', 'Zhu ZL', 'Qiu QC', 'Zhu P']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'China', 'Female', 'Health', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/09/01 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Aug;79(2):138-45. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00885.x.

We used imatinib interim therapy for four consecutive patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We monitored the patient status for minimal residual disease by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Imatinib was administered on an interim schedule after each chemotherapy course. After the first imatinib cycle, all patients remained in sustained complete hematologic remission (CHR) with a decrease in the breakpoint cluster region of the Abelson oncogene locus transcript. All patients received a second imatinib cycle following consolidation and showed sustained CHR, including two cases with complete molecular remission. All cases underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in favorable condition, and are still alive with a leukemia-free status at 6, 6, 9, and 25 months after HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: As a first-line interim therapy, imatinib appears to be a useful treatment strategy to provide a bridge to HSCT in patients with Ph+ AML.

Binding of cytokines to these subunits activates multiple signaling cascades, including the Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway. We used compartmentalized cultures of sympathetic neurons and immunocytochemical analyses of STAT3 to examine the mechanisms involved in retrograde signaling of LIF from distal neurites (DN) to cell bodies. Addition of LIF to the DN of these neurons triggers the activation and nuclear translocation of STAT3. Inhibition of Jak activity in the cell bodies prevented LIF-induced retrograde activation of STAT3, while block of Jak activity in the DN had no effect on the appearance of activated STAT3 in the nucleus. These results show that the transport of activated Jak is not the main mechanism mediating retrograde signaling. Although there is an increase in phosphorylated STAT3 in the neurites after distal stimulation, the transport of activated STAT3 is not necessary for retrograde signaling. Our results are consistent with a signaling endosome model for retrograde signaling, in which the LIF/glycoprotein 130/LIF receptor/Jak complex is internalized and transported to activate STAT3 in the cell body.","[""O'Brien, Jennifer J"", 'Nathanson, Neil M']","[""O'Brien JJ"", 'Nathanson NM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neurites/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology']",2007/07/05 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2007 Oct;103(1):288-302. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.04736.x.

The question of whether IFN-alpha-responsive patients can experience further improvements with imatinib has not been answered. Imatinib offers clear quality of life advantages. Furthermore, patients who achieve a major molecular response (MMR) while receiving imatinib are likely to remain progression free. METHODS: A total of 23 patients treated for a median of 4.5 years with IFN-alpha (range, 1.6-14.3 years) who had achieved a complete (Philadelphia chromosome [Ph] negative, n = 15 patients) or near-complete (1-10% Ph, n = 8 patients) cytogenetic response were studied. The primary objective was to determine whether ceasing therapy with IFN-alpha and switching to 12 months of imatinib treatment at a dose of 400 mg/day could improve the molecular response as assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction of BCR-ABL transcript levels. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: Every patient who had not achieved an MMR while receiving IFN-alpha (n = 16 patients) achieved an MMR after a median of 3 months of imatinib treatment. Significant BCR-ABL reductions (median, 63-fold; range, 18-425-fold) occurred in 15 of these patients. Every patient who had already achieved an MMR while receiving IFN-alpha (n = 7 patients) maintained an MMR while receiving imatinib. No patients discontinued imatinib due to toxicity, but 1 patient withdrew consent. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that switching IFN-alpha-responsive patients to imatinib leads to a rapid improvement in achieving an MMR, a response with established prognostic value, and is well tolerated. The study should help patients and their physicians make evidence-based decisions regarding the potential benefits and risks of switching to imatinib.","['Branford, Susan', 'Hughes, Timothy', 'Milner, Alvin', 'Koelmeyer, Rachel', 'Schwarer, Anthony', 'Arthur, Chris', 'Filshie, Robin', 'Moreton, Susan', 'Lynch, Kevin', 'Taylor, Kerry']","['Branford S', 'Hughes T', 'Milner A', 'Koelmeyer R', 'Schwarer A', 'Arthur C', 'Filshie R', 'Moreton S', 'Lynch K', 'Taylor K']","['Division of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, SA, Australia. susan.branford@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Patient Dropouts', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/09/18 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Aug 15;110(4):801-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22842.,,,,['10.1002/cncr.22842 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerical data on the nuclear diameter and size in these cells are missing in the literature. Therefore the nuclei of myeloblasts and promyelocytic cells were measured in bone marrow smears of patients suffering from chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia since the general morphology of granulocytic progenitors is very similar to those in non-leukemic persons. Moreover, the increased granulopoiesisinthese patients provided a satisfactory number of early granulocytic progenitors for karyometric measurements. Nuclear diameter in digitised and processed images of these cells was measured directly on the monitor screen at magnification 4300x using a computerised photoprogram. The nuclear mean diameter in both myeloblasts and promyelocytes ranged between 11 and 13 microm. Cells with smaller or larger nuclei were observed less frequently. Since the nuclear size depends on the cell cycle stage, a possibility exists that both granulocytic progenitors are mostly in the S and less frequently in G1 or G2 phase. Thus, the mean nuclear diameter, i.e. nuclear size, might be useful in helping to estimate the cell cycle stage of these cells in bone marrow smears at the single cell level. In addition, the results of the present study also indicated that the nuclear diameter in myeloblasts as well as promyelocytes of studied patients was not substantially influenced by the cytostatic therapy with imatinib mesylate.","['Smetana, Karel', 'Mikulenkova, Dana', 'Klamova, Hana']","['Smetana K', 'Mikulenkova D', 'Klamova H']","['Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus/*pathology', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interphase', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2006 Oct;11(5):399-401. doi: 10.1080/10245330600915925.,,,,"['769858551 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330600915925 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This work was conducted on 63 ALL children (40 males and 23 females) with age range 4.5 months-16 years (mean = 7.76 years). They included 37 cases who attained true remission and 26 complicated by failure of remission, early relapse or death. They were subjected to history, clinical examination and investigations including CBC, BM examination, karyotyping, FISH for translocations and flow cytometry for immunophenotyping and minimal residual disease diagnosis. RESULTS: Cases aged < 5 years; male sex with organomegaly had better remission although statistically insignificant. Initially low Hb < 8 gm/dl, high WBCs and platelet counts > 50,000/mm(3) also showed better but non-significant remission rates. Most of our cases were L(2) with better remission compared to other immunophenotypes. Forty informative karyotypes were subdivided into 15 hypodiploid, 10 pseudodiploid, 8 normal diploid and 7 hyperdiploid cases; the best remission rates were noticed among the most frequent ploidy patterns. Chromosomes 9, 11 and 22 were the most frequently involved by structural aberrations followed by chromosomes 5, 12 and 17. Resistance was noted with aberrations not encountered among remission group; deletions involving chromosomes 2p, 3q, 10p and 12q; translocations involving chromosome 5; trisomies of chromosomes 16 and 21; monosomies of 5 and X and inversions of 5 and 11. CONCLUSIONS: Cytogenetic and molecular characterizations of childhood ALL may add prognostic criteria for optimal therapy allocation.","['Settin, A', 'Al Haggar, M', 'Al Dosoky, T', 'Al Baz, R', 'Abdelrazik, N', 'Fouda, M', 'Aref, S', 'Al-Tonbary, Y']","['Settin A', 'Al Haggar M', 'Al Dosoky T', 'Al Baz R', 'Abdelrazik N', 'Fouda M', 'Aref S', 'Al-Tonbary Y']","[""Genetic Unit, Mansoura University Children's Hospital, Egypt.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2006 Oct;11(5):341-9. doi: 10.1080/10245330600938174.,,,,"['769824384 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330600938174 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Around 9% of FA patients develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which makes FA a good genetic model to study leukemogenesis. To date, however, no information exists on the functional integrity of the hematopoietic system of FA patients during the period in which they develop AML. Herein, we report on the characterization of hematopoietic progenitor cells from a pediatric FA patient that developed AML. Our results show that significant changes occurred in the hematopoietic system of the patient from the time he presented with FA to the time he developed AML. Such changes included marrow cellularity, frequency of CD34(+) cells and CFC, as well as proliferation potential of progenitor cells in liquid cultures supplemented with recombinant cytokines. Interestingly, no significant changes in the karyotype of marrow cells were observed, indicating that progression from FA into AML may proceed without major chromosomal alterations (i.e. translocations and/or deletions). This study represents one of the first steps towards the cellular characterization of the hematopoietic system in FA patients that develop AML.","['Velez-Ruelas, Maria Antonieta', 'Martinez-Jaramillo, Guadalupe', 'Arana-Trejo, Rosa Maria', 'Mayani, Hector']","['Velez-Ruelas MA', 'Martinez-Jaramillo G', 'Arana-Trejo RM', 'Mayani H']","['Pediatrics Department, Gabriel Mancera Hospital, Mexican Institute of Social Security, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Child', 'Disease Progression', 'Fanconi Anemia/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*pathology', 'Male']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2006 Oct;11(5):331-4. doi: 10.1080/10245330500397703.,,,,"['769862346 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330500397703 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with measurable disease, performance status 0 to 2, no prior therapy, and adequate organ function were eligible. Paclitaxel (110 mg/m2, administered intravenously on day 1), topotecan (1.5 mg/m2, administered orally on days 2 to 4), and etoposide (160 mg/m2, administered orally on days 5 to 7 every 21 days), with filgrastim for two cycles, were followed by chest irradiation to 70 Gy (to postinduction tumor volume) concurrent with carboplatin (area under the curve of 5, administered intravenously on day 1) and etoposide (100 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 every 21 days) without filgrastim for three cycles (five chemotherapy cycles total). We aimed to determine the response rates to induction and overall therapy, overall and failure-free survival, and toxicity. The primary statistical endpoint was to differentiate between complete response rates of 50 and 70% for the overall treatment program. RESULTS: Between June 2001 and January 2003, 65 patients were enrolled, but one never started therapy, and one was ineligible. Patient characteristics included male/female, 27/36; white/black/other/unknown, 58/3/1/1; median age 62 (range, 38-78); performance status 0/1/2, 27/33/3. Induction chemotherapy resulted in six (10%) complete responses and 35 (56%) partial responses. Overall response to chemoradiotherapy included 27 (43%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 30-56%) complete responses and 24 (38%) partial responses. Median progression-free survival is 12 months (95% CI, 9-15 months). Median overall survival is 20 months (95% CI, 16-24 months). Frequent (>20%) grade 3/4 toxicities during all therapy included neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and dysphagia. One patient died of febrile neutropenia, one died of febrile neutropenia and typhlitis, and one patient who declined transfusion for anemia died of cardiac ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: This treatment regimen has significant activity in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer but did not meet our prospectively defined criteria for further investigation in this setting. The addition of etoposide and the use of a sequenced administration schedule did not seem to improve overall activity beyond our prior experience with a topotecan-paclitaxel doublet.","['Miller, Antonius A', 'Wang, Xiaofei F', 'Bogart, Jeffrey A', 'Hodgson, Lydia D', 'Rocha Lima, Caio M S', 'Radford, James E', 'Vokes, Everett E', 'Green, Mark R']","['Miller AA', 'Wang XF', 'Bogart JA', 'Hodgson LD', 'Rocha Lima CM', 'Radford JE', 'Vokes EE', 'Green MR']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA. aamiller@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2007 Jul;2(7):645-51. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0b013e318074bbf5.,,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)'],"['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['10.1097/JTO.0b013e318074bbf5 [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)31125-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new functional operability (FO) algorithm incorporates peak exercise Vo2 earlier in the preoperative assessment to determine which patients require preoperative radionuclear studies. This algorithm has not been studied in a multicenter study. METHODS: The CALGB (Cancer and Leukemia Group B) performed a prospective multi-institutional study to investigate the use of primary exercise Vo2 measurement for the prediction of surgical risk. Patients with known or suspected resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were eligible. Exercise testing including measurement of peak oxygen uptake (Vo2), spirometry, and single breath diffusion capacity (DLCO) was performed on each patient. Nuclear perfusion scans were obtained on selected high-risk patients. After surgery, morbidity and mortality data were collected and correlated with preoperative data. Mortality and morbidity were retrospectively compared by algorithm-based risk groups. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-six patients with suspected lung cancer from nine institutions underwent thoracotomy with or without resection; 57 study patients did not undergo thoracotomy. Patients who underwent surgery had a median survival time of 30.9 months, whereas patients who did not undergo surgery had a median survival time of 15.6 months. Among the 346 patients who underwent thoracotomy, 15 patients died postoperatively (4%), and 138 patients (39%) exhibited at least one cardiorespiratory complication postoperatively. We found that patients who had a peak exercise Vo2 of <65% of predicted (or a peak Vo2/kg <16 ml/min/kg) were more likely to suffer complications (p = 0.0001) and were also more likely to have a poor outcome (respiratory failure or death) if the peak Vo2 was <15 ml/min/kg (p = 0.0356). We also found a subset of 58 patients who did not meet FO algorithm criteria for operability, but who still tolerated lung resection with a 2% mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide multicenter validation for the use of exercise Vo2 for preoperative assessment of lung cancer patients, and we encourage an aggressive approach when evaluating these patients for surgery.","['Loewen, Gregory M', 'Watson, Dorothy', 'Kohman, Leslie', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Shennib, Hani', 'Kernstine, Kemp', 'Olak, Jemi', 'Mador, M Jeffery', 'Harpole, David', 'Sugarbaker, David', 'Green, Mark']","['Loewen GM', 'Watson D', 'Kohman L', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Shennib H', 'Kernstine K', 'Olak J', 'Mador MJ', 'Harpole D', 'Sugarbaker D', 'Green M']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA. gregory.loewen@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Forced Expiratory Volume', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/*metabolism/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morbidity/trends', 'Oxygen Consumption/*physiology', '*Pneumonectomy', 'Preoperative Care/*methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Spirometry', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2007 Jul;2(7):619-25. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0b013e318074bba7.,,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],"['CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['10.1097/JTO.0b013e318074bba7 [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)31121-7 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that FTY significantly inhibited but did not prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in lethally irradiated or nonirradiated allogeneic recipients. Although most studies implicate prevention of lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs as the primary mechanism of action, our data indicate that FTY effects on the host are more likely to be responsible for GVHD inhibition. FTY reduced splenic CD11c+ cells by 50%, and similarly reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responder frequencies in the spleen early after transplantation. Imaging of GFP+ effectors indicated that FTY modified donor effector T-cell migration to secondary lymphoid organs, but did not uniformly trap T cells in lymph nodes or prevent early effector migration to GVHD parenchymal target organs. Administration of FTY only prior to transplantation inhibited GVHD, indicating that the primary function of FTY may be targeted to host cells. FTY was additive with regulatory T cells for GVHD inhibition. FTY slightly impaired but did not abrogate a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect against C1498, a myeloid leukemia. Our data further define the mechanisms of action and provide insight as to the potential clinical uses of FTY in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients.","['Taylor, Patricia A', 'Ehrhardt, Michael J', 'Lees, Christopher J', 'Tolar, Jakub', 'Weigel, Brenda J', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'Serody, Jonathan S', 'Brinkmann, Volker', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Taylor PA', 'Ehrhardt MJ', 'Lees CJ', 'Tolar J', 'Weigel BJ', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Serody JS', 'Brinkmann V', 'Blazar BR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, 420 Delaware Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*therapy', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Propylene Glycols/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Nov 1;110(9):3480-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-087940.

In this study we investigated the expression and subcellular localization of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in endothelial cells. Our results show the expression of the 70-kDa AChE in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. We also describe, for the first time, a nuclear and cytoskeleton-bound AChE isoform with approximately 55 kDa detected in endothelial cells. This novel isoform is decreased in response to vascular endothelial growth factor via the proteosomes pathway, and it is down-regulated in human leukemic T-cells as compared with normal T-cells, suggesting that the decreased expression of the 55-kDa AChE protein may contribute to an angiogenic response and associate with tumorigenesis. Importantly, we show that its nuclear expression is not endothelial cell-specific but also evidenced in non-neuronal and neuronal cells. Concerning neuronal cells, we can distinguish an exclusively nuclear expression in postnatal neurons in contrast to a cytoplasmic and nuclear expression in embryonic neurons, suggesting that the cell compartmentalization of this new AChE isoform is changed during the development of nervous system. Overall, our studies suggest that the 55-kDa AChE may be involved in different biological processes such as neural development, tumor progression, and angiogenesis.","['Santos, Susana Constantino Rosa', 'Vala, Ines', 'Miguel, Claudia', 'Barata, Joao T', 'Garcao, Pedro', 'Agostinho, Paula', 'Mendes, Marta', 'Coelho, Ana V', 'Calado, Angelo', 'Oliveira, Catarina R', 'e Silva, Joao Martins', 'Saldanha, Carlota']","['Santos SC', 'Vala I', 'Miguel C', 'Barata JT', 'Garcao P', 'Agostinho P', 'Mendes M', 'Coelho AV', 'Calado A', 'Oliveira CR', 'e Silva JM', 'Saldanha C']","['Instituto de Biopatologia Quimica, Faculdade de Medicina de Lisboa, 1649-028 Lisboa, Portugal. sconstantino@fm.ul.pt']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'N9YNS0M02X (Acetylcholine)']",IM,"['Acetylcholine/metabolism', 'Acetylcholinesterase/*biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Central Nervous System/embryology/enzymology', 'Cytoskeleton/*enzymology', 'Endothelial Cells/*enzymology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*enzymology', 'Organ Specificity', 'PC12 Cells', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/10/30 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Aug 31;282(35):25597-603. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M700569200.

METHODS: Charts were reviewed for all pediatric patients with leukemia and lymphoma diagnosed between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2002. Data were collected through April 1, 2004. RESULTS: A total of 575 charts were reviewed; 529 patients were included in the analysis. A total of 482 (345 leukemia, 137 lymphoma) patients were evaluated on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole dosed 2 consecutive days per week for 268074 patient-days. No breakthrough cases were documented in compliant patients; 2 noncompliant patients developed P. carinii pneumonia. A total of 238 patients who were on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and 13 patients who were receiving an alternative medication prophylaxis were evaluated for neutropenia during maintenance therapy. The median number of maintenance days on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was 605.5 days and on alternative drug was 617 days. The median number of neutropenic maintenance days on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was 15.5 days and on the alternative drug was 16 days. The median proportion of neutropenic days per patient was 0.029 on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and 0.022 on the alternative drug. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent dosing of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole on 2 consecutive days per week is an effective alternative prophylactic regimen for P. carinii pneumonia in pediatric patients with leukemia and lymphoma. This analysis does not support a difference in neutropenia during maintenance therapy between patients who are treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole versus an alternative drug.","['Lindemulder, Susan', 'Albano, Edythe']","['Lindemulder S', 'Albano E']","[""Children's Hospital, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, 1056 E 19th Ave, B115, Denver, CO 80218, USA. lindemulder.susan@tchden.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)']",IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/*prevention & control', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/complications/*prevention & control', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/08/04 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2007 Jul;120(1):e47-51. doi: 10.1542/peds.2006-1360.

The safety of these cells in autologous settings has been shown. We performed a phase I study of allogeneic (donor's) CIK cells in patients relapsing after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). DESIGN AND METHODS: Eleven patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (n=4), Hodgkin's disease (n=3), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, (n=1), pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=1) and myelodysplasia (n=2), all of whom had relapsed after sibling (n=6) or matched unrelated donor (n=5) HSCT, entered this study. RESULTS: Before CIK administration, six patients had received other salvage treatments including chemotherapy (n=5), radiotherapy (n=1) and unmanipulated donor lymphocytes (n=6) without any significant tumor response. The median number of CIK infusions was two (range 1-7) and the median number of total CIK cells was 12.4x106/kg (range 7.2-87.4). The infusions were well tolerated and no acute or late infusion-related reactions were recorded. Acute GVHD (grade I and II) was observed in four patients, 30 days after the last CIK infusion, and progressed into extensive chronic GVHD in two cases. Disease progression and death occurred in six patients. One patient had stable disease, one had hematologic improvement and three achieved complete responses. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the production of allogeneic CIK cells is feasible under clinical-grade conditions, well tolerated and may contribute to clinical responses.","['Introna, Martino', 'Borleri, Gianmaria', 'Conti, Elena', 'Franceschetti, Marta', 'Barbui, Anna Maria', 'Broady, Raewyn', 'Dander, Erica', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe', ""D'Amico, Giovanna"", 'Biagi, Ettore', 'Parma, Matteo', 'Pogliani, Enrico M', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Baronciani, Donatella', 'Grassi, Anna', 'Golay, Josee', 'Barbui, Tiziano', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro']","['Introna M', 'Borleri G', 'Conti E', 'Franceschetti M', 'Barbui AM', 'Broady R', 'Dander E', 'Gaipa G', ""D'Amico G"", 'Biagi E', 'Parma M', 'Pogliani EM', 'Spinelli O', 'Baronciani D', 'Grassi A', 'Golay J', 'Barbui T', 'Biondi A', 'Rambaldi A']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Gene Therapy G.

We analyzed whether regulatory T cells can be generated in co-cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and MSC. DESIGN AND METHODS: MSC were obtained from the bone marrow of four healthy donors and nine patients with acute leukemia in complete remission following chemotherapy. Short-term (4 days) co-cultures of MSC and autologous or allogeneic PBMC were set up, the lymphocytes harvested and their regulatory activity assessed. RESULTS: Lymphocytes harvested from MSC-PBMC co-cultures strongly inhibit (up to 95%) mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), recall to alloantigen, and CD3- or PHA-induced lymphocyte proliferation. These lymphocytes, termed regulatory cells (Regc), were all CD45+CD2+ with variable proportions of CD25+ cells (range 40-75% n=10) and a minor fraction expressed CTLA4 (2-4%, n=10) or glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factcor receptor-related gene (0.5-4% n=10). Both CD4+ and CD8+ Regc purified from MSC-PBMC co-cultures strongly inhibited lymphocyte proliferation at a 1:100 Regc:responder cell ratio. CD4+ Regc expressed high levels of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) mRNA while CD8+ Regc did not. The effectiveness of Regc, whether CD4+ or CD8+, was 100-fold higher than that of CD4+CD25+high regulatory T cells. Regc were also generated from highly purified CD25- PBMC or CD4+ or CD8+ T cell subsets. Soluble factors, such as interleukin-10, transforming growth factor-b and prostaglandin E2 did not appear to be involved in the generation of Regc or in the Regc-mediated immunosuppressive effect. Furthermore, cyclosporin A did not affect Regc generation or the immunosuppression induced by Regc. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that powerful regulatory CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes are generated in co-cultures of PBMC with MSC. This strongly suggests that these regulatory cells may amplify the reported MSC-mediated immunosuppressive effect.","['Prevosto, Claudia', 'Zancolli, Marta', 'Canevali, Paolo', 'Zocchi, Maria Raffaella', 'Poggi, Alessandro']","['Prevosto C', 'Zancolli M', 'Canevali P', 'Zocchi MR', 'Poggi A']","['Laboratory of Experimental Oncology D, National Cancer Research Institute, 16132-Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*cytology']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Jul;92(7):881-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11240.,,,,['10.3324/haematol.11240 [doi]'],,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2007 Jul;92(7):872-7.

Such ""selective modulator"" ligands are known for several receptors. Potent pyrazolo-glucocorticoid (11beta,16alpha)-21-(Acetyloxy)-11,17-dihydroxy-6,16-dimethyl-2'-phenyl-2'H-pregn a-2,4,6-trieno[3,2-c]pyrazol-20-one) cortivazol activates the glucocorticoid receptor to regulate gene expression and can bring about apoptosis of leukemic CEM cells resistant to (9-fluoro-11,17-dihydroxy-17-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-10,13,16-trimethyl-6,7,8,11,12,14, 15,16-octahydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthren-3-one) dexamethasone. We therefore tested the hypothesis that cortivazol and dexamethasone regulate non-identical sets of genes in CEM cells. We found that while cortivazol and dexamethasone overlap in regulation of most genes, each steroid regulates an exclusive set of transcripts in clone CEM-C7-14 (sensitive to apoptosis by both dexamethasone and cortivazol) and clone CEM-C1-15 (dexamethasone-resistant but cortivazol-sensitive). Fifty-seven genes were regulated uniquely to a statistically significant extent by cortivazol in both clones. Many of the cortivazol specific genes are key components of various signal transduction pathways. Our data clearly show cortivazol to be a selective modulator of GR action.","['Miller, Aaron L', 'Webb, M Scott', 'Thompson, E Brad']","['Miller AL', 'Webb MS', 'Thompson EB']","['The University of Texas Medical Branch, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 301 University Blvd, Galveston, TX 77555-1068, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Steroids,Steroids,0404536,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Pregnatrienes)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'YM183K0H63 (cortivazol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mifepristone/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Pregnatrienes/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*agonists/metabolism']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Steroids. 2007 Sep;72(9-10):673-81. doi: 10.1016/j.steroids.2007.05.004.

Aberrant PTK activity resulting from gene mutation (often accompanying chromosome translocation) or overexpression of these enzymes plays an etiologic role in several clonal hematopoietic malignancies. Other than the causative effect of PTK product of the bcr/abl fusion gene on chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), more evidence suggests that mutated tyrosine kinases are pivotal in the pathogenesis of most of other chronic myeloproliferative disorders, such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). And the exciting results in several dependent groups in 2005 showed that a single nucleotide JAK2 somatic mutation (JAK2V617F mutation) was found to be involved in the pathogenesis of polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF). In the leukogenesis of acute myeloid leukemias (AML), the losing of the control of the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells was principally the results of the aberrant PTK activity, such as FLT3 and C-kit overexpression.

Although some patients with leukemia have achieved complete remission according to the clinical and morphological criteria, there are still very low numbers of malignant cells that can not be discriminated by morphology and remained in bone marrow, which is called minimal residual disease (MRD) and is the main reason leading to relapse. MRD detection has an important significance for designing treatment protocols. Several methods of MRD detection have been developed. These include conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), flow-cytometric immunophenotyping (FCM), Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, etc. Each of these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages, so not all of them are suitable for clinical MRD detection because of several inherent disadvantages, such as limited sensitivity, time-consuming, high cost, or requiring high-quality DNA or RNA. For example, the sensitivities of conventional cytogenetics, FISH, FCM and Southern blot approaches for MRD monitoring are 10(-1) - 10(-2), 10(-2), 10(-3) - 10(-4) and 10(-1), respectively. Relatively, PCR can reach a good sensitivity of 10(-4) - 10(-6), and show more advantages, such as fast, specific, simple and low-cost, as well as minimal amounts of DNA or RNA for detection, etc., so PCR has its specific features for MRD detection. In this review, the progress on the detection technique for screening leukemia specific marker by muitiplex PCR and FQ-PCR in recent years are summarized.","['He, Ying-Yi', 'Ye, Tie-Zhen']","['He YY', 'Ye TZ']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College, Guangzhou 510120, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2007/07/04 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Jun;15(3):652-6.,15,,,['1009-2137(2007)03-0652-05 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that the incidence of MAL in acute leukemia was 9.6%. Morphologically, the subtypes of M(1) and M(2) were predominant in AML, while L(2) in ALL. The median of white blood cell count in MAL was significantly higher than that of non-mixed-lineage cases (AML and ALL) observed during the same period (P < 0.05).

All these work are the primary part for finding effective drugs in the treatment of leukemia via the way of ID4 expression regulation. According to the data in GenBank and Internet platform, the 5'-untranslated sequence just upstream of ID4 ORF was virtually cloned. TESS, Genomatix and GenBank databank were used to analyze the cis elements in this area. RSA was used to find the distribution patterns for all these possible elements. SAGE and GEO datasets were used to find active substances which have the effect on the ID4 expression. The rsults indicated that ID4 had a type II promoter with a typical TATA box-45 bp upstream the transcriptional original site. There were a lot of various cis elements in the 5'-untranslated region upstream, including both positive element candidates such as Sp1, c-Myb, abaA, GR, ER, Zeste and C/EBPalpha and negative element candidates such as CCAAT-binding factor, GCF, WT1-KTS, HiNF-C and EGR2.

Significant relations between MRD level and presenting leukocyte count, blast percentage in PB were also found in the patients with presenting leukocyte count < 25 x 10(9)/L. TEL-AML1 expression level at diagnosis of MRD negative patients was lower than that of MRD positive ones. It is concluded that therapy after induction of remission is of importance by the fact that 45.71% children with TEL-AML1(+) ALL did not achieve molecular remission at the end of induction of remission. The effectiveness of prednisone trial predicts the MRD level. In addition, presenting leukocyte count, blast percentage in PB and TEL-AML1 expression level at diagnosis may have an effect on MRD level to some extent.","['Li, Zhi-Gang', 'Zhao, Wei', 'Gao, Zhao', 'Wu, Min-Yuan', 'Zhang, Yong-Hong', 'Shi, Hui-Wen', 'Xie, Jing']","['Li ZG', 'Zhao W', 'Gao Z', 'Wu MY', 'Zhang YH', 'Shi HW', 'Xie J']","['Hematological Center, Beijing Children Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2007/07/04 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2007 Jun;15(3):523-7.,,,,['1009-2137(2007)03-0523-05 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that there were immature cells (2% - 10%) and erythroblast, and puncture of bone marrow revealed myelodysplastic features involving multiple hemopoietic lineages in bone marrow of 19 patients. Flow cytometry indicated that the expression frequency of Gly-A in M(6) significantly increased (66.67 +/- 23.86)% and higher than that in M(1), M(2), M(3), M(4) and M(5) (P < 0.01). The expression frequencies of HLA-DR (60.00 +/- 24.79%), CD34 (40.00 +/- 24.79%), CD38 (33.33 +/- 23.86%) in M(6) were high, and the frequencies of myeloid immunophenotypes CD13 (66.67 +/- 23.86%), MPO (33.33 +/- 23.86%), CD33 (46.67 +/- 25.25%), CD15 (33.33 +/- 23.86%), CD117 (46.67 +/- 25.25%) were common as well in M(6).

Strong correlations between these expression levels and functional assays, particularly at the early stage of cell differentiation, have usually not been observed. An effective molecular diagnostic to properly identify the differentiation state of mouse ES cells, prior to further experimentation, is needed. RESULTS: A novel molecular pattern recognition procedure has been developed to diagnose the differentiation state of ES cells. This is based on mRNA transcript levels of genes differentially expressed between ES cells and their differentiating progeny. Large publicly available ES cell data sets from various platforms were used to develop and test the diagnostic model. Signature patterns consisting of five gene expression levels achieved high accuracy at determining the cell state (sensitivity and specificity > 97%). CONCLUSION: The effective ES cell state diagnostic scheme described here can be implemented easily to assist researchers in identifying the differentiation state of their cultures. It also provides a step towards standardization of experiments relying on cells being in the stem cell or differentiating state.","['Yap, Daniel Y L', 'Smith, David K', 'Zhang, Xue W', 'Hill, Jeffrey']","['Yap DY', 'Smith DK', 'Zhang XW', 'Hill J']","['Bioinformatics Institute, Matrix, Singapore. daniely@bii.a-star.edu.sg']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/09/05 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2006/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2007 Jul 3;8:210. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-8-210.,,,,"['1471-2164-8-210 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-8-210 [doi]']",,,20070703,,PMC1931595,,,,,,,,,

Anti-prion protein monoclonal antibodies are invaluable for structure-function studies of PrP molecules. Furthermore recent in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies can prevent the incorporation of PrPc into propagating prions. In the present article, we show two new human phage antibodies, isolated on recombinant hamster prion protein (rHaPrP). RESULTS: We adopted an antibody phage display strategy to isolate specific human antibodies directed towards rHaPrP which has been used as a bait for panning the synthetic ETH-2 antibody phage library. Two phage antibodies clones named MA3.B4 and MA3.G3 were isolated and characterized under genetic biochemical and immunocytochemical aspects. The clones were found to recognize the prion protein in ELISA studies. In flow-cytometry studies, these human single chain Fragment variable (scFv) phage-antibodies show a well defined pattern of reactivity on human lymphoblastoid and myeloid cells. CONCLUSION: Sequence analysis of the gene encoding for the antibody fragments and antigen recognition patterns determined by flow-cytometry analysis indicate that the isolated scFvs recognize novel epitopes in the PrPc molecule. These new anti PrPc human antibodies are unique reagents for prion protein detection and may represent a biologic platform to develop new reagents to treat PrPsc associated disease.","['Flego, Michela', 'Ascione, Alessandro', 'Zamboni, Silvia', 'Dupuis, Maria L', 'Imperiale, Valentina', 'Cianfriglia, Maurizio']","['Flego M', 'Ascione A', 'Zamboni S', 'Dupuis ML', 'Imperiale V', 'Cianfriglia M']","['Section of Pharmacogenetics, Drug Resistance and Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Drug Research and Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy. michela.flego@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Biotechnol,BMC biotechnology,101088663,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Prions)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*immunology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Prions/*immunology']",2007/07/04 09:00,2007/09/05 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2006/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Biotechnol. 2007 Jul 2;7:38. doi: 10.1186/1472-6750-7-38.,,,,"['1472-6750-7-38 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6750-7-38 [doi]']",,,20070702,,PMC1933425,,,,,,,,,

Axons of neurons in the spinal cord lateral motor column (LMC), as defined by a transcription factor code, are thought to innervate limb target tissues exclusively. Axons of the medial and lateral LMC divisions appear to execute a binary decision at the base of the limb as they choose between ventral and dorsal limb trajectories. The cellular logic that guides motor axon trajectory choices into non-limb tissues such as the ventral flank remains unclear. RESULTS: We determined the spinal cord motor column origin of motor nerves that innervate ventral flank tissues at hindlimb level. We found unexpectedly that a subset of medial LMC axons innervates ventral non-limb mesenchyme at hindlimb level, rather than entering ventral limb mesenchyme. We also found that in a conditional BmprIa mutant where all ventral hindlimb mesenchyme is converted to a dorsal identity, all medial LMC axons are redirected into the ventral flank, while lateral LMC axons innervate the bidorsal limb. CONCLUSION: We have found that medial LMC neurons innervate both ventral flank and limb targets. While normally only a subset of medial LMC axons innervate the flank, all are capable of doing so. Furthermore, LMC axons execute a ternary, rather than binary, choice at the base of the limb between ventral flank, ventral limb and dorsal limb trajectories. When making this choice, medial and lateral LMC axons exhibit different and asymmetric relative preferences for these three trajectories. These data redefine the LMC as a motor column that innervates both limb and body tissues.","['Luria, Victor', 'Laufer, Ed']","['Luria V', 'Laufer E']","['Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. avl@columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Neural Dev,Neural development,101286574,"['0 (Ephrins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 beta)', '0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Eph Family)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Body Patterning/*genetics', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Ephrins/genetics', 'Extremities/*embryology/*innervation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics', 'Growth Cones/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics', 'LIM-Homeodomain Proteins', 'Mesoderm/cytology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Motor Neurons/cytology/*physiology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/innervation/physiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Eph Family/genetics', 'Spinal Cord/cytology/*embryology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2007/07/04 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Neural Dev. 2007 Jul 2;2:13. doi: 10.1186/1749-8104-2-13.,,,"['R01 NS047510/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS047510-03/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']","['1749-8104-2-13 [pii]', '10.1186/1749-8104-2-13 [doi]']",,,20070702,,PMC1949814,,,,,,,,,

However, no data have been reported on VZV infection after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report a retrospective analysis of VZV infection in 192 allogeneic PBSCT recipients. Twenty-seven patients (14%) received long-term prophylaxis of low-dose acyclovir (200 mg twice daily orally > or =3 months) for recurrent oral (n=21) or genital herpes simplex virus infection (n=5) or for a previous history of recurrent VZV infection (n=1). RESULTS: Forty-two patients (22%) developed VZV infections: localized (n=37) and disseminated infection (n=5). The incidence of VZV infection at 1 and 3 years was 19.3+/-3.3% and 36.8+/-5.2%, respectively. Complications included post-herpetic neuralgia (n=18, 43%), secondary bacterial infections (n=3), and intracranial hemorrhage (n=1) with 2 deaths. A higher risk factor for VZV infection was pre-transplant diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD): chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (P=0.021, 52.5% in LPD vs. 32.6% in non-LPD group). The use of low-dose acyclovir prophylaxis (P=0.043, 14.7% in acyclovir vs. 41.6% in nonacyclovir group) was found to be protective. Although no VZV infection episodes were noted during the period of acyclovir prophylaxis, 3 episodes of VZV infection were noted after acyclovir cessation. CONCLUSION: The incidence of VZV infection after PBSCT was high at 36.8%, with patients transplanted for LPDs at higher risk. The long-term use of low-dose acyclovir may be protective for VZV infection, although it does not completely prevent rebound of late VZV infection.","['Kim, D H', 'Messner, H', 'Minden, M', 'Gupta, V', 'Kuruvilla, J', 'Wright, J', 'Lipton, J']","['Kim DH', 'Messner H', 'Minden M', 'Gupta V', 'Kuruvilla J', 'Wright J', 'Lipton J']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Princess Margaret Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', 'X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)']",IM,"['Acyclovir/*therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Herpes Simplex/*prevention & control', 'Herpes Zoster/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2007/07/04 09:00,2008/05/17 09:00,['2007/07/04 09:00'],"['2007/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2008 Apr;10(2):90-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3062.2007.00247.x.

Quantitative comparisons to the ""normal"" counterpart cell line, MCF-10A, expressing 350-fold lower levels of Keratin 8 and other breast cancer cell lines expressing higher levels were performed using real-time PCR. Extraordinarily high levels of trimethyl histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) were found primarily in the first intron of the Keratin 8 gene stretching from 400 to 2000 bp downstream from the promoter in all breast cancer cells lines but not in MCF-10A cells. The highest levels of histone H3K4 trimethylation in MCF-7 cells ranged from 70% to 80% over input within 1200 bp of this region. Knockdown of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL), the specific methyltransferase for histone H3K4, with MLL-specific siRNA decreased histone H3K4 trimethylation on the Keratin 8 gene and decreased Keratin 8 mRNA levels.

It is inactive when bound to guanosine diphosphate and active when bound to GTP. When mutated, the gene produces an abnormal protein resistant to GTP hydrolysis by GTPase, resulting in a constitutively active GTP-bound protein that stimulates a critical network of signal transduction pathways that lead to cellular proliferation, survival and differentiation. At least three downstream effector pathways have been described, including Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and RalGDS, but they are not completely understood. Ras pathways are also important downstream effectors of several receptor tyrosine kinases localized in the cell membrane, most notably the BCR-ABL fusion protein seen in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. An important consideration in designing strategies to block Ras stimulatory effect is that Ras proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, but require post-translational modifications and attachment to anchor proteins or membrane binding sites in the cell membrane to be biologically active. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) are probably the best-studied class of Ras inhibitors in hematologic malignancies. They block the enzyme farnesyl-transferase (FTase), which is essential for post-translational modification. However, it has been observed that the Ras proteins also can be geranylgeranylated in the presence of FTIs, thus allowing membrane localization and activation, which limits their effectiveness. It is now hypothesized that their mechanism of action may be through FTase inhibition involving other signal transduction pathways. S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid, which was first designed as a prenylated protein methyltransferase inhibitor, has shown in vitro activity against all activated Ras proteins by dislodging them from their membrane-anchoring sites. Here, Ras biology, its signaling pathways and its implications as a therapeutic target in hematologic malignancies are reviewed.","['Alvarado, Yesid', 'Giles, Francis J']","['Alvarado Y', 'Giles FJ']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia, Box 428, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,101135662,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Genes, ras/*drug effects/physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",2007/07/03 09:00,2007/08/23 09:00,['2007/07/03 09:00'],"['2007/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs. 2007 May;12(2):271-84. doi: 10.1517/14728214.12.2.271.,123,,,['10.1517/14728214.12.2.271 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased PAI-1 was found in atherosclerotic lesions, and high PAI-1 plasma levels were associated with coronary heart disease. Smooth muscle cells (SMC) are a major source of PAI-1 within the vascular wall, and PAI-1 was implicated in SMC migration, proliferation, and apoptosis. We treated human coronary artery SMC (HCASMC) and human aortic SMC (HASMC) with the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) ligands cardiotrophin-1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), or oncostatin M (OSM). Only OSM increased PAI-1 antigen and activity production significantly in these cells up to 20-fold. OSM upregulated mRNA specific for PAI-1 up to 4.5-fold in these cells. HCASMC and HASMC express gp130, OSM receptor, IL-6 receptor, and LIF receptor. OSM induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and Akt phosphorylations in HASMC. A phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor and a mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor reduced Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, respectively, and abolished OSM-induced PAI-1 upregulation. A janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription inhibitor, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, or c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase inhibitor I did not inhibit the OSM-dependent PAI-1 induction. OSM enhanced proliferation of both HCASMC and HASMC by 77 and 90%, respectively. We hypothesize that, if the effect of OSM on PAI-1 expression in smooth muscle cells is operative in vivo, it could, via modulation of fibrinolysis and extracellular proteolysis, be involved in the development of vascular pathologies such as plaque progression, destabilization and subsequent thrombus formation, and restenosis and neointima formation.","['Demyanets, Svitlana', 'Kaun, Christoph', 'Rychli, Kathrin', 'Rega, Gersina', 'Pfaffenberger, Stefan', 'Afonyushkin, Taras', 'Bochkov, Valery N', 'Maurer, Gerald', 'Huber, Kurt', 'Wojta, Johann']","['Demyanets S', 'Kaun C', 'Rychli K', 'Rega G', 'Pfaffenberger S', 'Afonyushkin T', 'Bochkov VN', 'Maurer G', 'Huber K', 'Wojta J']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Flavone induces apoptosis which is accompanied by caspase activation and p16, p21 and TRAIL over-expression in human myeloid leukemia cells. Use of ex vivo myeloid leukemia patients blasts confirms that both the full acetonic Feijoa extract and its derived Flavone are able to induce apoptosis. In both cell lines and myeloid leukemia patients blasts the apoptotic activity of Feijoa extract and Flavone is accompanied by increase of histone and non-histone acetylation levels and by HDAC inhibition. Our findings show for the first time that the Feijoa apoptotic active principle is the Flavone and that this activity correlates with the induction of HDAC inhibition, supporting the hypothesis of its epigenetic pro-apoptotic regulation in cancer systems.","['Bontempo, Paola', 'Mita, Luigi', 'Miceli, Marco', 'Doto, Antonella', 'Nebbioso, Angela', 'De Bellis, Floriana', 'Conte, Mariarosaria', 'Minichiello, Annunziata', 'Manzo, Fabio', 'Carafa, Vincenzo', 'Basile, Adriana', 'Rigano, Daniela', 'Sorbo, Sergio', 'Castaldo Cobianchi, Rosa', 'Schiavone, Ettore Mariano', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'De Simone, Mariacarla', 'Vietri, MariaTeresa', 'Cioffi, Michele', 'Sica, Vincenzo', 'Bresciani, Francesco', 'de Lera, Angel R', 'Altucci, Lucia', 'Molinari, Anna Maria']","['Bontempo P', 'Mita L', 'Miceli M', 'Doto A', 'Nebbioso A', 'De Bellis F', 'Conte M', 'Minichiello A', 'Manzo F', 'Carafa V', 'Basile A', 'Rigano D', 'Sorbo S', 'Castaldo Cobianchi R', 'Schiavone EM', 'Ferrara F', 'De Simone M', 'Vietri M', 'Cioffi M', 'Sica V', 'Bresciani F', 'de Lera AR', 'Altucci L', 'Molinari AM']","['Dipartimento di Patologia Generale, Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli, vico L.

TP was expressed at higher levels in tumor tissues compared to the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues in a variety of human carcinomas. High expression of TP is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. To investigate the effect of TP on cisplatin-induced apoptosis, human leukemia Jurkat cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant (L148R) TP cDNA. Jurkat cells transfected with TP cDNA (Jurkat/TP) and mutant TP cDNA (Jurkat/TPMu) expressed high levels of TP, while Jurkat/CV cells which were transfected with a control vector did not express TP. A high TP enzyme activity was detected in Jurkat/TP cells, but not in Jurkat/CV and Jurkat/TPMu cells. Sensitivities to cisplatin of these cells were determined by MTT assay. IC50 values for cisplatin of Jurkat/CV, Jurkat/TP, and Jurkat/TPMu cells were 4.50, 14.08, 13.40 microM, respectively. Jurkat/TP and Jurkat/TPMu cells were about three times more resistant to cisplatin than Jurkat/CV cells. TP inhibited activation of caspase 3, 9 and mitochondrial cytochrome c release induced by cisplatin. These findings suggest a mechanism by which TP confers the resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, mutant TP that has no enzymatic activity also suppressed the cisplatin-induced apoptosis. These suggest that TP molecules have cytoprotective functions against cytotoxic agents.","['Ikeda, Ryuji']",['Ikeda R'],"['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Kagoshima University Hospital, Kagoshima City, Japan. ikeda@m.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.4.2.4 (Thymidine Phosphorylase)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Thymidine Phosphorylase/chemistry/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/07/03 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/07/03 09:00'],"['2007/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2007 Jul;127(7):1097-102. doi: 10.1248/yakushi.127.1097.,12,,,"['JST.JSTAGE/yakushi/127.1097 [pii]', '10.1248/yakushi.127.1097 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contractility studies and molecular approaches were employed to demonstrate the expression patterns and functional activity of the RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway in the lower urinary tract. Frequency-response curves (1-32 Hz) and concentration-response curves (CRC) to carbachol (CCh, 0.01-30 microM), phenylephrine (PE, 0.01-300 microM) and endothelin-1 (ET-1, 0.01-100 nM) were significantly attenuated (p<0.01) following incubation with the Rho-kinase inhibitors H-1152 (0.1-1 microM), Y-27632 (1-10 microM) or HA-1077 (10 microM). Addition of Rho-kinase inhibitors also markedly reduced (p<0.01) the contractions evoked by either KCl (80 mM) or alpha,beta-methylene ATP (alpha,beta-mATP, 10 microM). Among the Rho-kinase inhibitors tested, H-1152 was approximately 9-16 times more potent than Y-27632 or HA-1077. In addition, basal tone of detrusor and trigonal strips was reduced following addition of Y-27632 (10 microM), H-1152 (1 microM) and HA-1077 (10 microM). The expression of RhoA, RhoGDI, leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) and p115RhoGEF was similar among the detrusor, trigone and urethra, whereas Rho-kinase alpha, Rho-kinase beta and PDZ-RhoGEF protein levels were significantly lower in the urethra. Components of the RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling are expressed in detrusor, trigonal and urethral smooth muscle and dynamically regulate contraction and tone.

Unfortunately, its use has also been associated with agranulocytosis. We have investigated the metabolism of AG by myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the formation of an MPO protein free radical. We hypothesized that AG oxidation by MPO/H2O2 would produce an AG cation radical that, in the absence of a biochemical reductant, would lead to the oxidation of MPO. We utilized a novel anti-DMPO antibody to detect DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) covalently bound to protein, which forms only by the reaction of DMPO with a protein free radical. We found that AG metabolism by MPO/H2O2 induced the formation of DMPO-MPO, which was inhibited by MPO inhibitors and ascorbate. Glutethimide, a congener of AG that lacks the aromatic amine, did not cause DMPO-MPO formation, indicating the necessity of oxidation of the aniline moiety in AG. When analyzed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, we detected a phenyl radical adduct, derived from AG, which may be involved in the free radical formation on MPO. Furthermore, we also found protein-DMPO adducts in MPO-containing, intact human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). MPO was affinity-purified from HL-60 cells treated with AG/H2O2 and was found to contain DMPO. These findings were also supported by the detection of protein free radicals with electron spin resonance in the cellular cytosolic lysate. The formation of an MPO protein free radical is believed to be mediated by one of two free radical drug metabolites of AG, one of which was characterized by spin trapping with 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane. These results are the first demonstration of MPO free-radical detection by the anti-DMPO antibody that results from drug oxidation. We propose that drug-dependent free radical formation on MPO may play a role in the origin of agranulocytosis.","['Siraki, Arno G', 'Bonini, Marcelo G', 'Jiang, JinJie', 'Ehrenshaft, Marilyn', 'Mason, Ronald P']","['Siraki AG', 'Bonini MG', 'Jiang J', 'Ehrenshaft M', 'Mason RP']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology and Chemistry, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, 111 Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA. sirakia@niehs.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Aromatase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Nitrogen Oxides)', '0 (Nitroso Compounds)', '0O54ZQ14I9 (Aminoglutethimide)', '5351-17-7 (4-aminobenzhydrazide)', '7170JZ1QF3 (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'C8I4BVN78E (Glutethimide)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'GFQ4MMS07W (nitroxyl)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'JGX6N17V2U (tert-nitrosobutane)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/chemistry/metabolism', 'Agranulocytosis/chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Aminoglutethimide/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Aniline Compounds/chemistry/metabolism', 'Aromatase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/chemistry/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cyclic N-Oxides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Free Radicals/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Glucose/chemistry/metabolism', 'Glutethimide/chemistry/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry/metabolism', 'Nitrogen Oxides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Nitroso Compounds/chemistry/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry']",2007/07/03 09:00,2007/10/10 09:00,['2007/07/03 09:00'],"['2007/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2007 Jul;20(7):1038-45. doi: 10.1021/tx6003562.

Primitive normal hematopoietic cells were modified to express the BCR/ABL and Nup98/HoxA9 translocation products, and a distinct LSC population, with the aberrant immunophenotype of lineage(-), Kit(+/-), Flt3(+), Sca(+), CD34(+), and CD150(-), was identified. In vivo studies were then performed to assess the response of LSCs to therapeutic insult. Treatment of animals with the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate induced specific modulation of blasts and progenitor cells but not stem- cell populations, thereby recapitulating events inferred to occur in human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. In addition, challenge of leukemic mice with total body irradiation was selectively toxic to normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), suggesting that LSCs are resistant to apoptosis and/or senescence in vivo.

Although this TRIM39 variant encodes the NH(2)-terminal RING finger (RF), B-box, and coiled-coil (RBBC) domains of TRIM39, instead of a complete COOH-terminal B30.2 domain, this TRIM39 isoform contains the COOH-terminal portion of Rpp21, a component of RNase P. RT-PCR demonstrated that the TRIM39 variant, which we refer to as TRIM39R, is transcribed in the human fetal lung and in rat pulmonary artery SMC. Indirect immunofluorescence using an antibody generated against the conserved domains of TRIM39 and TRIM39R revealed the proteins in speckled intranuclear structures in human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) and human epidermal carcinoma line (HEp-2) cells. PKGI phosphorylated a typical PKGI/PKA phosphorylation domain in a conserved region of TRIM39 and TRIM39R. Additional studies demonstrated that PKGI interacts with both isoforms of TRIM39 in yeast cells and phosphorylates both isoforms of TRIM39 in human cell lines. Although PKGI has been observed to interact with proteins that regulate cytoskeletal function and gene expression, this investigation shows for the first time that PKGI interacts with tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, which, through diverse molecular pathways, are often observed to regulate important aspects of cellular homeostasis.","['Roberts, Jesse D Jr', 'Chiche, Jean-Daniel', 'Kolpa, Emily M', 'Bloch, Donald B', 'Bloch, Kenneth D']","['Roberts JD Jr', 'Chiche JD', 'Kolpa EM', 'Bloch DB', 'Bloch KD']","['Department of Anesthesia, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. roberts@cvrc.mgh.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Unfortunately, no existing technology has the sensitivity to measure the low numbers of tumor cells (<1 CTC per ml of whole blood) that characterize minimal levels of disease. We present a method, intravital flow cytometry, that noninvasively counts rare CTCs in vivo as they flow through the peripheral vasculature. The method involves i.v. injection of a tumor-specific fluorescent ligand followed by multiphoton fluorescence imaging of superficial blood vessels to quantitate the flowing CTCs. Studies in mice with metastatic tumors demonstrate that CTCs can be quantitated weeks before metastatic disease is detected by other means. Analysis of whole blood samples from cancer patients further establishes that human CTCs can be selectively labeled and quantitated when present at approximately 2 CTCs per ml, opening opportunities for earlier assessment of metastatic disease.","['He, Wei', 'Wang, Haifeng', 'Hartmann, Lynn C', 'Cheng, Ji-Xin', 'Low, Philip S']","['He W', 'Wang H', 'Hartmann LC', 'Cheng JX', 'Low PS']","['Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'KB Cells', 'Leukemia L1210/blood/*pathology', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/blood/*pathology']",2007/07/03 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/07/03 09:00'],"['2007/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jul 10;104(28):11760-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0703875104.

Statistical experimental design allowed the study of the influence of component amounts on the characteristics of nanoparticles. Mean particle diameter ranged from 180 nm to 350 nm. After 24 h, while the cisplatin-alginate complex released almost all the drug in saline-buffered solution at pH 7.4, approximately 40% w/w of total cisplatin was released from negative nanoparticles and roughly 50% w/w from positive ones. The same cumulative amounts of released drug were found after 48 h, with a progressive reduction to lower values up to 6 days. Drug loading of nanoparticles with a positive zeta potential (43 mV-60 mV) ranged from 13% w/w to 21% w/w and particle yield, referred to total polymers, was about 15% w/w (50% w/w if referred to cisplatin-alginate complex). Nanoparticles with a negative zeta potential (-34 mV) were obtained with a yield of 40% w/w and a drug loading of 18% w/w. These nanoparticles were the least active on all cell lines tested, while the cytotoxic activity of the positive nanoparticles was similar to or lower than that of cisplatin, probably depending on the combination of sizes and zeta potential values, on P388 murine and A2780 human cells. On A549 human cells, the nanoparticles with the smallest size and the lowest positive zeta potential were more active than cisplatin and showed a similar capability in inducing apoptosis in A2780 human cells. These results indicate that cisplatin complexes with polycarboxylate polymers can be transformed into cisplatin particulate carriers of high potential interest.","['Cafaggi, S', 'Russo, E', 'Stefani, R', 'Leardi, R', 'Caviglioli, G', 'Parodi, B', 'Bignardi, G', 'De Totero, D', 'Aiello, C', 'Viale, M']","['Cafaggi S', 'Russo E', 'Stefani R', 'Leardi R', 'Caviglioli G', 'Parodi B', 'Bignardi G', 'De Totero D', 'Aiello C', 'Viale M']","['Dipartimento di Chimica e Tecnologie Farmaceutiche ed Alimentari, via Brigata Salerno 13, 16147 Genova, Italy. cafaggi@dictfa.unige.it <cafaggi@dictfa.unige.it>']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Alginates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Buffers)', '0 (Hexuronic Acids)', '8A5D83Q4RW (Glucuronic Acid)', '9012-76-4 (Chitosan)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Alginates/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/analysis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Buffers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chitosan/*chemistry', 'Cisplatin/analysis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Glucuronic Acid/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Hexuronic Acids/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology', 'Particle Size', 'Static Electricity']",2007/07/03 09:00,2007/10/18 09:00,['2007/07/03 09:00'],"['2007/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2007 Aug 16;121(1-2):110-23. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2007.05.037.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The nutritional status was assessed in 24 patients. Biochemical and anthropometric indices of nutritional status as well as body fat and resting energy expenditure were assessed. The levels of acute phase proteins were estimated at the same time. All parameters were evaluated during the day before starting a conditioning regimen, after chemotherapy completion and every 7 days until engraftment, at least 3 times after stem cells infusion. Wilcoxon test and canonical analysis were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: The measurement of body weight and estimation of transferrin levels can be useful for the nutritional assessment during allogeneic HSCT from sibling donors. Prealbumin level, measured 8 days after the conditioning regimen, can be helpful to make a decision for TPN. Statistically significant differences were found in the levels of biochemical indices of nutritional status and in resting energy expenditure (REE) between patients who received stem cells from the bone marrow and from peripheral blood. Values were lower and decreased earlier after transplantation when bone marrow was the source of HSCT. CONCLUSION: These findings may indicate that the influence of transplantation procedures over patients' nutritional status is bigger when bone marrow is used as a source of hematopoietic stem cells.","['Rzepecki, R', 'Barzal, J', 'Sarosiek, T', 'Oborska, S', 'Szczylik, C']","['Rzepecki R', 'Barzal J', 'Sarosiek T', 'Oborska S', 'Szczylik C']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Oncology, Military Institute of Health Services, Warsaw, Poland. piotr_rzepecki@poczta.onet.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers/*analysis/blood', 'Body Weight', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nutrition Assessment', '*Nutritional Status']",2007/06/30 09:00,2007/09/08 09:00,['2007/06/30 09:00'],"['2007/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J BUON. 2007 Apr-Jun;12(2):253-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TF5 stimulates many assays of T cell-mediated immunity. We found that TF5 substantially suppressed proliferation of the rat C6 glioma and MMQ pituitary adenoma cell lines. Our current research using the promyelocytic cell line HL-60 suggests that TF5 also prevents proliferation of human myeloid leukemia cells. Our objective is the purification and chemical characterization of TF5 peptide components responsible for inhibition of HL-60 proliferative capacity. Using the inhibition of HL-60 cell proliferation, we have chemically characterized TF5 using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE). Vital dye-exclusion, oxidative metabolism of chromogenic dyes, and clonogenic growth profiles were used to determine rates of HL-60 proliferation. Our results identified an approximately 6000 Da component of TF5 capable of inducing HL-60 growth arrest. Synchronized HL-60 cells exposed to TF5 and its various constituents were subjected to cytometric analysis by flow cytometry. TF5-treated HL-60 cells had an increased subdiploid faction (i.e., sub-G1) compared to control cells. TF5 also increased Annexin V staining in randomly cycling HL-60 cells. Thus, a TF5 subfraction possesses growth-suppressive activity for human myeloid neoplasms. Our results indicate that this effect is characterized by at least one hallmark of apoptosis.

Lymphocytic accumulations were detected in pleural and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids in all patients except for one who presented with neutrophilic alveolitis. Pleural biopsies revealed lymphocytic infiltration in one patient and myeloid infiltration in another.

Mitochondria-associated Bcl-2 family members are important regulators of programed cell death. The mechanism whereby hypoxia alters the mitochondrial apoptotic rheostat is essential to our understanding of placental disease. Herein, myeloid cell leukemia factor-1 (Mcl-1) isoform expression was examined in physiological/pathological models of placental hypoxia. Preeclamptic placentae were characterized by caspase-dependent cleavage of death-suppressing Mcl-1L and switch toward cell death-inducing Mcl-1S. In vitro, Mcl-1L cleavage was induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation in villous explants, whereas Mcl-1L overexpression under hypoxia-reoxygenation rescued trophoblast cells from undergoing apoptosis. Cleavage was mediated by caspase-3/-7 because pharmacological caspase inhibition prevented this process. Altitude-induced chronic hypoxia was characterized by expression of Mcl-1L; resulting in a reduction of apoptotic markers (cleaved caspase-3/-8 and p85 poly-ADP-ribose polymerase). Moreover, in both physiological (explants and high altitude) and pathological (preeclampsia) placental hypoxia, decreased trophoblast syncytin expression was observed. Hence, although both pathological and physiological placental hypoxia are associated with slowed trophoblast differentiation, trophoblast apoptosis is only up-regulated in preeclampsia, because of a hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced switch in generation of proapoptotic Mcl-1 isoforms.","['Soleymanlou, Nima', 'Jurisicova, Andrea', 'Wu, Yuanhong', 'Chijiiwa, Mari', 'Ray, Jocelyn E', 'Detmar, Jacqui', 'Todros, Tullia', 'Zamudio, Stacy', 'Post, Martin', 'Caniggia, Isabella']","['Soleymanlou N', 'Jurisicova A', 'Wu Y', 'Chijiiwa M', 'Ray JE', 'Detmar J', 'Todros T', 'Zamudio S', 'Post M', 'Caniggia I']","['Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (syncytin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*physiopathology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Oxygen/pharmacology', 'Placenta/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pre-Eclampsia/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Culture Techniques', 'Transfection', 'Trophoblasts/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism']",2007/06/30 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/06/30 09:00'],"['2007/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2007 Aug;171(2):496-506. doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2007.070094.

One of the agents being investigated for this purpose in preclinical studies is 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D), which can convert myeloid leukemia cells into normal monocyte-like cells, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood. Here, we report that 1,25D upregulates the expression of hKSR-2, a new member of a small family of proteins that exhibit evolutionarily conserved function of potentiating ras signaling. The upregulation of hKSR-2 is direct, as it occurs in the presence of cycloheximide, and occurs primarily at the transcriptional level, via activation of vitamin D receptor, which acts as a ligand-activated transcription factor. Two VDRE-type motifs identified in the hKSR-2 gene bind VDR-RXR alpha heterodimers present in nuclear extracts of 1,25D-treated HL60 cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that these VDRE motifs bind VDR in 1,25D-dependent manner in intact cells, coincident with the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to these motifs. Treatment of the cells with siRNA to hKSR-2 reduced the proportion of the most highly differentiated cells in 1,25D-treated cultures. These results demonstrate that hKSR-2 is a direct target of 1,25D in HL60 cells, and is required for optimal monocytic differentiation.","['Wang, Xuening', 'Wang, Tian-Tian', 'White, John H', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Wang X', 'Wang TT', 'White JH', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Avenue, C-543, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (ZK159222)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (KSR-1 protein kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Calcitriol/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/physiology', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/06/30 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/06/30 09:00'],"['2007/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2007 Aug 15;313(14):3034-45. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.05.021.

In this study, we show that BCR/ABL could upregulate sphingosine kinase-1 (SPK1) expression via multiple signal pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), leading to increase cellular SPK1 activity in CML cells. Retrovirus-mediated overexpression of bcr-abl gene in NIH-3T3, Ba/F3 and HL-60 cells results in upregulation and increased cellular activity of SPK1, whereas treatment of CML cells with specific inhibitors of the BCR/ABL, PI3K, MAPK and JAK2 pathways decreases BCR/ABL-induced SPK1 expression and cellular activity. BCR/ABL also induces upregulation of Mcl-1 expression in CML cells. Inhibition of SPK1 by adenovirus-mediated transfer of small interfering RNA or N,N-dimethylsphingosine reduced expression of Mcl-1 in CML cells. Our data indicated that BCR/ABL induces SPK1 expression and increases its cellular activity, leading to upregulation of Mcl-1 in CML cells. SPK1 silencing enhances the STI571-induced apoptosis of CML cell lines.

Previously, we have shown that ectopic expression of the zinc finger transcription factor Egr-1 in M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells promotes terminal differentiation with interleukin-6 (IL-6). In addition, we have shown that deregulated expression of the oncogene E2F-1 blocks the myeloid terminal differentiation program, resulting in proliferation of immature cells in the presence of IL-6. Here it is shown that the positive regulator of differentiation Egr-1 abrogates the E2F-1-driven block in myeloid terminal differentiation. The M1E2F-1/Egr-1 cells underwent G(0)/G(1) arrest and functional macrophage maturation following treatment with IL-6. Furthermore, Egr-1 diminished the aggressiveness of M1E2F-1 leukemias and abrogated the leukemic potential of IL-6-treated M1E2F-1 cells. Previously, we reported that Egr-1 abrogated the block in terminal myeloid differentiation imparted by deregulated c-myc, which blocks differentiation at a later stage than E2F-1, resulting in cells that have the characteristics of functionally mature macrophages that did not undergo G(0)/G(1) arrest. Taken together, this work extends and highlights the tumor suppressor role of Egr-1, with Egr-1 behaving as a tumor suppressor against two oncogenes, each blocking myeloid differentiation by a different mechanism. These findings suggest that Egr-1 and/or Egr-1 target genes may be useful tools to treat or suppress oncogene-driven hematological malignancies.","['Gibbs, J D', 'Liebermann, D A', 'Hoffman, B']","['Gibbs JD', 'Liebermann DA', 'Hoffman B']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (E2f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Egr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology/*prevention & control', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",2007/06/30 09:00,2008/01/23 09:00,['2007/06/30 09:00'],"['2007/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Jan 3;27(1):98-106. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210627.

We investigated the biological and clinical significance of FLT3-ITD and/or NPM1-Mt in this context. METHODS: We analysed 89 AML patients according to whether NPM1 and FLT3-ITD were single mutants, double mutants, or wild type for both. RESULTS: FLT3-ITD was detected in 19 of 89 patients (21.3%), while NPM1-Mt was detected in 19 of 89 patients (21.3%); eight of 89 patients (9.0%) carried both FLT3-ITD and NPM1-Mt. By multivariate analysis, white blood cell count and peripheral blood blast cell count at diagnosis were significantly higher in patients with FLT3-ITD but not in those with only NPM1-Mt. NPM1-Mt was significantly related to female gender, normal karyotype, and M4 or M5 disease according to French-American-British criteria. In addition, leukaemic blast cells with NPM1-Mt, FLT3-ITD, or both expressed CD34 less frequently than wild-type blasts (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.005 respectively), while myelomonocytic markers such as CD11b and CD14 were expressed more frequently in patients with NPM1-Mt. CONCLUSION: FLT3-ITD may increase potential for cell proliferation to produce a leukaemic population; NPM1-Mt may cause cells to develop along the myelomonocytic lineage. Extensive analyses and detailed experiments will be required to clarify how NPM1 and FLT3 mutations interact in leukaemogenesis.","['Mori, Yasuo', 'Yoshimoto, Goichi', 'Kumano, Takashi', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Iino, Tadafumi', 'Takenaka, Katsuto', 'Iwasaki, Hiromi', 'Harada, Naoki', 'Kinukawa, Naoko', 'Nagafuji, Koji', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Harada, Mine']","['Mori Y', 'Yoshimoto G', 'Kumano T', 'Miyamoto T', 'Iino T', 'Takenaka K', 'Iwasaki H', 'Harada N', 'Kinukawa N', 'Nagafuji K', 'Teshima T', 'Shimoda K', 'Akashi K', 'Harada M']","['Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology/*metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2007/06/30 09:00,2007/07/24 09:00,['2007/06/30 09:00'],"['2007/06/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Jul;79(1):17-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00866.x.,,,,"['EJH866 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00866.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the frequency of NPM1 mutations in pediatric AML, we sequenced NPM1 in the diagnostic blasts from 93 pediatric AML patients. Six cases harbored NPM1 mutations, with each case lacking common cytogenetic abnormalities. To explore the phenotype of the AMLs with NPM1 mutations, gene expression profiles were obtained using Affymetrix U133A microarrays. NPM1 mutations were associated with increased expression of multiple homeobox genes including HOXA9, A10, B2, B6 and MEIS1. As dysregulated homeobox gene expression is also a feature of MLL-rearranged leukemia, the gene expression signatures of NPM1-mutated and MLL-rearranged leukemias were compared. Significant differences were identified between these leukemia subtypes including the expression of different HOX genes, with NPM1-mutated AML showing higher levels of expression of HOXB2, B3, B6 and D4. These results confirm recent reports of perturbed HOX expression in NPM1-mutated adult AML, and provide the first evidence that the NPM1-mutated signature is distinct from MLL-rearranged AML. These findings suggest that mutated NPM1 leads to dysregulated HOX expression via a different mechanism than MLL rearrangement.","['Mullighan, C G', 'Kennedy, A', 'Zhou, X', 'Radtke, I', 'Phillips, L A', 'Shurtleff, S A', 'Downing, J R']","['Mullighan CG', 'Kennedy A', 'Zhou X', 'Radtke I', 'Phillips LA', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Downing JR']","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (HOXB2 protein, human)', '0 (HOXB6 protein, human)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2007/06/29 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/06/29 09:00'],"['2007/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Sep;21(9):2000-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404808.

To investigate the influence of BCR-ABL on centrosomes, we performed long-term in vitro experiments employing the conditionally p210BCR-ABL-expressing (tetracycline-inducible promoter) human monocytic cell line U937p210BCR-ABL/c6 as a model of CML chronic phase. Centrosome hypertrophy was detectable after 4 weeks of transgene expression onset, increasing up to a rate of 25.7% aberrant cells within 13 weeks of propagation. This concurred with clonal expansion of aneuploid cells displaying a hyperdiploid phenotype with 57 chromosomes. Partial reversibility of centrosome aberrations (26-8%) was achieved under prolonged propagation (14 weeks) after abortion of induction and bcr-abl silencing using small interfering RNA. Therapeutic doses of imatinib did not revert the aberrant phenotype, but counteracted the observed reverting effect of bcr-abl gene expression switch off. Suggesting a mechanistic model that features distinct abl-related tyrosine kinase activity levels as essential determinants of centrosomal integrity, this is the first report mechanistically linking p210BCR-ABL oncoprotein activity to centrosomal hypertrophy.","['Giehl, M', 'Fabarius, A', 'Frank, O', 'Erben, P', 'Zheng, C', 'Hafner, M', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Seifarth, W']","['Giehl M', 'Fabarius A', 'Frank O', 'Erben P', 'Zheng C', 'Hafner M', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hehlmann R', 'Seifarth W']","['III.

WPRE is most effective when placed downstream of the transgene, proximal to the polyadenylation signal. We hypothesized that WPRE likely reduces viral mRNA readthrough transcription by improving transcript termination, which in turn would increase viral titers and expression. Using a Cre-lox-mediated plasmid-based assay, we found significant readthrough transcription from gamma-retroviral vector (RV) long terminal repeat (wt RV-LTR) and RV LTR with a self-inactivating deletion (SIN RV-LTR). WPRE, when placed upstream of the RV LTRs, significantly reduced readthrough transcription. Readthrough, present at much lower levels with the SIN HIV-1 LV-LTR, was also reduced with WPRE. When placed in RV vectors, WPRE increased total RV genomic mRNA; and increased viral titers from transiently transfected 293T cells and stable PG13 producer cells by 7- to 15-fold. The mechanism of increased titers and expression was not due to increased nuclear mRNA export, increased rate of viral transcription or a significant increase in viral mRNA half-life. Our results showed that WPRE improved vector genomic transcript termination to increase titers and expression from RVs.","['Higashimoto, T', 'Urbinati, F', 'Perumbeti, A', 'Jiang, G', 'Zarzuela, A', 'Chang, L-J', 'Kohn, D B', 'Malik, P']","['Higashimoto T', 'Urbinati F', 'Perumbeti A', 'Jiang G', 'Zarzuela A', 'Chang LJ', 'Kohn DB', 'Malik P']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Pathology, Keck School of Medicine University of Southern California, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hepatitis B Virus, Woodchuck/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Reading Frames', '*Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes']",2007/06/29 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/06/29 09:00'],"['2007/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2007 Sep;14(17):1298-304. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3302979.

The most notable exceptions were the derivation of non-human primate ES cell lines followed shortly thereafter by their derivation of human ES cells. Despite the apparent common origin and the similar pluripotency of mouse and human embryonic stem cells, recent studies have revealed that they use different signalling pathways to maintain their pluripotent status. Mouse ES cells depend on leukaemia inhibitory factor and bone morphogenetic protein, whereas their human counterparts rely on activin (INHBA)/nodal (NODAL) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Here we show that pluripotent stem cells can be derived from the late epiblast layer of post-implantation mouse and rat embryos using chemically defined, activin-containing culture medium that is sufficient for long-term maintenance of human embryonic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that activin/Nodal signalling has an evolutionarily conserved role in the derivation and the maintenance of pluripotency in these novel stem cells. Epiblast stem cells provide a valuable experimental system for determining whether distinctions between mouse and human embryonic stem cells reflect species differences or diverse temporal origins.","['Brons, I Gabrielle M', 'Smithers, Lucy E', 'Trotter, Matthew W B', 'Rugg-Gunn, Peter', 'Sun, Bowen', 'Chuva de Sousa Lopes, Susana M', 'Howlett, Sarah K', 'Clarkson, Amanda', 'Ahrlund-Richter, Lars', 'Pedersen, Roger A', 'Vallier, Ludovic']","['Brons IG', 'Smithers LE', 'Trotter MW', 'Rugg-Gunn P', 'Sun B', 'Chuva de Sousa Lopes SM', 'Howlett SK', 'Clarkson A', 'Ahrlund-Richter L', 'Pedersen RA', 'Vallier L']","[""Department of Surgery and Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Culture Media)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)']",IM,"['Activins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Signal Transduction']",2007/06/29 09:00,2007/08/07 09:00,['2007/06/29 09:00'],"['2007/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 2007 Jul 12;448(7150):191-5. doi: 10.1038/nature05950.

Allo-HSCT research has focused on the GVL target antigens and effector mechanisms, and on potential approaches to exploit GVL independently of GVHD. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) achieves the most powerful anti-leukemic responses, and this approach is often used in combination with nonmyeloablative transplant regimens to optimize GVL and reduce GVHD. Serial, dose-escalating, and CD8(+) T-cell-depleted DLI have been introduced into clinical practice, while other variants of DLI have so far been explored only in animal models. The role of naturally occurring regulatory T cells in transplantation tolerance is being increasingly acknowledged, and murine studies indicate the potential ability of T cells to regulate GVHD while maintaining GVL. Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the importance of host-type chimerism, particularly for antigen-presenting cells, in determining the occurrence of DLI-induced GVL. Murine studies could assist in the development of clinical strategies targeted at antigen-presenting cells. Clinical studies exploiting natural killer-cell-mediated antitumor reactivity in the context of killer inhibitory receptor-ligand-mismatched allo-HSCT have provided promising results.","['Sprangers, Ben', 'Van Wijmeersch, Bart', 'Fevery, Sabine', 'Waer, Mark', 'Billiau, An D']","['Sprangers B', 'Van Wijmeersch B', 'Fevery S', 'Waer M', 'Billiau AD']","['Laboratory of Experimental Transplantation, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Nat Clin Pract Oncol,Nature clinical practice.

We studied eight childhood cancer patients (age 1.5-16 y) on 2 d, i.e. the day before chemotherapy and 3-5 d after. Chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis and diarrhea were scored on a World Health Organization toxicity scale. Stable isotope tracers were used to measure first-pass splanchnic leucine uptake and whole-body leucine kinetics. Patients showed increased mucositis and/or diarrhea toxicity scores (p < 0.0001) after chemotherapy. Systemic availability of enterally administered leucine was not significantly affected by chemotherapy (before 60%, after 90%, p = 0.46). Interestingly, five patients already showed a negative leucine balance before chemotherapy. In conclusion, most children receiving chemotherapy are already catabolic before start of a new cycle of chemotherapy.

Significant species differences and regional specification of stem cells necessitates determining the effects of growth factors on human spinal cord stem cells. Fetal spinal cords were dissociated and expanded as neurospheres in medium with bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or BMP4 and LIF. First-generation neurospheres comprised a heterogeneous population of neural cell types and after plating emergent cells included neurons, oligodendrocytes and GFAP(+) cells which coexpressed stem cells markers and those of the neuronal lineage and were thus identified as GFAP(+) neural precursor cells (NPC). When plated, neurospheres maintained in BMP4 demonstrated a reduced proportion of emergent oligodendrocytes from 13 to 4%, whereas LIF had no statistically significant effect on cell type distribution. Combining BMP4 and LIF reduced the proportion of oligodendrocytes to 3% and that of neurons from 37 to 16% while increasing the proportion of GFAP(+) NPC from 45 to 79%. After 10 passages in control media aggregates gave rise to multiple neural phenotypes and only continued passage of neurospheres in the presence of BMP4 and LIF resulted in unipotent aggregates giving rise to only astrocytes. These results provide a means of obtaining pure populations of human spinal-cord derived astrocytes, which could be utilized for further studies of cell replacement strategies or in vitro evaluation of therapeutics.","['Weible, Michael W 2nd', 'Chan-Ling, Tailoi']","['Weible MW 2nd', 'Chan-Ling T']","['Bosch Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (BMP4 protein, human)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Astrocytes/*drug effects', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Drug Synergism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Neuronal Plasticity/drug effects', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Spinal Cord/*cytology/*embryology']",2007/06/29 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/06/29 09:00'],"['2007/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Glia. 2007 Aug 15;55(11):1156-68. doi: 10.1002/glia.20539.,,,,['10.1002/glia.20539 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

Both subtypes can manifest as indolent or aggressive disorders. T-LGL leukemia is associated with cytopenias and autoimmune diseases and most often has an indolent course and good prognosis. Rheumatoid arthritis and Felty syndrome are frequent. NK-LGL leukemias can be more aggressive. LGL expansion is currently hypothesized to be a virus (Ebstein Barr or human T-cell leukemia viruses) antigen-driven T-cell response that involves disruption of apoptosis. The diagnosis of T-LGL is suggested by flow cytometry and confirmed by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies. Clonality is difficult to determine in NK-LGL but use of monoclonal antibodies specific for killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) has improved this process. Treatment is required when T-LGL leukemia is associated with recurrent infections secondary to chronic neutropenia. Long-lasting remission can be obtained with immunosuppressive treatments such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine A.

Although the Gag-derived myristoylation signal targets the v-Abl protein to the plasma membrane, the protein contains the entire MA and p12 sequences and a small number of CA-derived residues. To understand the role of Gag sequences in transformation, mutants lacking portions of these sequences were examined for the effects of these deletions on v-Abl function and localization. Deletion of the N-terminal third of p12 or all of p12 enhanced the transformation of both pre-B cells and NIH 3T3 cells. In contrast, deletions in MA or a deletion removing all of Gag except the first 34 amino acids important for myristoylation highly compromised the ability to transform either cell type. Although all of the mutant proteins retained kinase activity, those defective in transformation were reduced in their ability to activate Erk, suggesting a role for Gag sequences in v-Abl signaling. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that a v-Abl protein retaining only the first 34 amino acids of Gag localized to the nucleus. These data indicate that Gag sequences are important for normal v-Abl signaling and that they suppress nuclear localization of the molecule.","['Yi, Chae-Ryun', 'Rosenberg, Naomi']","['Yi CR', 'Rosenberg N']","['Molecular Microbiology Graduate Program, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Tufts Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*physiology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/analysis/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Transport', 'Sequence Deletion']",2007/06/29 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/06/29 09:00'],"['2007/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Sep;81(17):9461-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00735-07.

Available data regarding IA among Asian patients are limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine patients' characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes of patients with IA in a Tertiary-care Hospital in Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors retrospectively reviewed medical and laboratory records of adult patients with IA from January 2000 to December 2005. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients were identified and classified as proven (n = 35), probable (n = 10), and possible IA (n = 49) according to the criteria designed for cancer patients (EORTC/MSG). Mean +/- SD age was 48 +/- 19 (range, 17-89) years old and 54 patients (57%) were male. Acute leukemia was the most common underlying condition (30%). Major predisposing factors were neutropenia (39%), chemotherapy (34%), and receiving corticosteroid therapy (25%). Common sites of infection were lungs (68%), sinus (17%), and eyes (8%). Aspergillus fumigatus (67%) was the most frequently isolated species. Amphotericin B followed by itraconazole was the mainstay of treatment. Thirty-six patients (38%) had complete or partial response to therapy whereas 44 patients (47%) died due to aspergillosis. Multivariate analysis showed that corticosteroid therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 10.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-110.15, p = 0.047] and pulmonary infection [HR 18.06; 95% CI 4.28-76.17, p < 0.001] were significant predictive factors of death. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiology and outcomes of IA among Thai patients were comparable to those in Western countries.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Myeloblasts for drug resistance testing were obtained from the bone marrow either on diagnosis or at relapse, before the HSCT procedure and were tested by the MTT assay. RESULTS: Children who relapsed after transplantation showed higher ex vivo resistance of the leukemic blasts to etoposide, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, fludarabine, mitoxantrone and treosulfan than those who stayed in remission. Despite being nondiscriminative, the combined ex vivo drug resistance profile to fludarabine, treosulfan and etoposide (FTE score) was the strongest prognostic factor by multivariate analysis.

To investigate the functions of MLF1IP, its subnuclear localization was studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MLF1IP was tagged with green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Fibrillarin was tagged with red fluorescent protein (DsRed). EGFP-tagged MLF1IP deletion vectors were also constructed. Plasmid-constructs were transfected into human cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells or monkey kidney fibroblast COS-7 cells, and the localization was studied by either confocal fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Ectopically expressed MLF1IP was localized mainly in the nucleolus. In some cells, small dot-like particles of MLF1IP fluorescence were observed in the nucleoplasm. Co-staining of fibrillarin disclosed that MLF1IP was co-localized with fibrillarin in the nucleolus. Deletion mutants of MLF1IP revealed that the N-terminal bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) was responsible for nucleolar targeting. CONCLUSION: MLF1IP was localized mainly in the nucleolus through the N-terminal bipartite NLS and partly in the nucleoplasm featuring small dot-like particles. These findings suggest that MLF1IP may have multi-functions and its different localizations may contribute to carcinogenesis.","['Suzuki, Hideaki', 'Arakawa, Yasuhiro', 'Ito, Masaki', 'Saito, Shinobu', 'Takeda, Nobuakira', 'Yamada, Hisashi', 'Horiguchi-Yamada, Junko']","['Suzuki H', 'Arakawa Y', 'Ito M', 'Saito S', 'Takeda N', 'Yamada H', 'Horiguchi-Yamada J']","['Department of General Medicine, Institute of DNA Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishi-Shinbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8461, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (CENPU protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (fibrillarin)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Nucleolus/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/analysis/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis/chemistry/metabolism']",2007/06/29 09:00,2007/07/28 09:00,['2007/06/29 09:00'],"['2007/06/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2007 May-Jun;27(3B):1423-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study tested the hypothesis that an oncofoetal protein, foetal haemoglobin (HbF) is a potential tumour marker in embryonic tumours, useful for management. An immunohistochemical investigation of HbF blood cell (Fc) distribution was carried out in tumours and in bone marrow samples from 83 children and 13 adults with various embryonic tumours (blastomas), and in bone marrow samples of 24 leukaemia patients. In the three, main blastoma types, nephroblastoma (Wilms' tumour), neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma, where all the patients, except two, were children, around 80% of the tumour samples had Fc within proliferating blood vessels and spaces between tumour cells. In parallel, clusters of Fc, mostly F-erythroblasts (Feb), were distributed in the bone marrow of some of those patients and in the bone marrow of 79% of the leukaemia patients. Foetal haemoglobin, as well as being a potential prognostic cancer marker, is a potential indicator of DNA hypomethylation implicated in the development of these tumours, as well as in others previously noted for the presence of HbF.","['Wolk, M', 'Martin, J E', 'Nowicki, M']","['Wolk M', 'Martin JE', 'Nowicki M']","['Department of Histopathology, Royal London Hospital, Centre for pathology, Institute of Cell and Molecular Sciences, Queen Mary School of Medicine and Dentistry, The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, London, UK. wolk1@bezwqint.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*blood/classification']",2007/06/28 09:00,2007/10/03 09:00,['2007/06/28 09:00'],"['2007/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2007 Aug 6;97(3):412-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6603867.

Here, we estimated relapse risks according to disease characteristics. Between 1997 and 2006, 834 consecutive patients (median age, 55 years; range, 5-74 years) received related (n = 498) or unrelated (n = 336) HCT after 2 Gy total body irradiation alone (n = 171) or combined with fludarabine (90 mg/m(2); n = 663). Relapse rates per patient year (PY) at risk, corrected for follow-up and competing nonrelapse mortality, were calculated for 29 different diseases and stages. The overall relapse rate per PY was 0.36. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM) in remission (CR), low-grade or mantle cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (CR + partial remission [PR]), and high-grade NHL-CR had the lowest rates (0.00-0.24; low risk). In contrast, patients with advanced myeloid and lymphoid malignancies had rates of more than 0.52 (high risk). Patients with lymphoproliferative diseases not in CR (except Hodgkin lymphoma and high-grade NHL) and myeloid malignancies in CR had rates of 0.26-0.37 (standard risk). In conclusion, patients with low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders experienced the lowest relapse rates, whereas patients with advanced myeloid and lymphoid malignancies had high relapse rates after nonmyeloablative HCT.

When administered at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (10-15 microM), sorafenib potently induced apoptosis in imatinib mesylate-resistant cells expressing high levels of Bcr/Abl, cells exhibiting a Bcr/Abl-independent, Lyn-dependent form of resistance, and CD34(+) cells obtained from imatinib-resistant patients. In addition, Ba/F3 cells expressing mutations rendering them resistant to IM (e.g., E255K, M351T) or to IM, dasatinib, and nilotinib (T315I) remained fully sensitive to sorafenib. Induction of apoptosis by sorafenib was associated with rapid and pronounced down-regulation of Mcl-1 and diminished signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 phosphorylation and reporter activity but only very modest and delayed inactivation of the Bcr/Abl downstream target Crkl. Moreover, transfection with a constitutively active STAT5 construct partially but significantly protected cells from sorafenib lethality. Ba/F3 cells expressing Bcr/Abl mutations were as sensitive to sorafenib-induced Mcl-1 down-regulation and dephosphorylation of STAT5 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E as wild-type cells. Finally, stable knockdown of Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) with short hairpin RNA in K562 cells significantly diminished sorafenib lethality, arguing strongly for a functional role of this proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member in the lethality of this agent. Together, these findings suggest that sorafenib effectively induces apoptosis in highly imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, most likely by inhibiting or down-regulating targets (i.e., STAT5 and Mcl-1) downstream or independent of Bcr/Abl.","['Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Nguyen, Tri K', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rahmani M', 'Nguyen TK', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/drug effects', 'Sorafenib']",2007/06/28 09:00,2007/10/20 09:00,['2007/06/28 09:00'],"['2007/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2007 Sep;72(3):788-95. doi: 10.1124/mol.106.033308.

However, most studies in survivors of childhood cancer focused on only 1 late effect. OBJECTIVE: To assess the total burden of adverse health outcomes (clinical or subclinical disorders [""adverse events""]) following childhood cancer in a large cohort of childhood cancer survivors with long-term and complete medical follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Retrospective cohort study of 1362 five-year survivors of childhood cancer treated in a single institution in the Netherlands between 1966 and 1996. All survivors were invited to a late-effects clinic for medical assessment of adverse events. Adverse events occurring before January 2004 were graded for severity in a standardized manner. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment-specific prevalence of adverse events (according to severity) at end of follow-up and relative risk of high or severe burden of disease (> or =2 severe or > or =1 life-threatening or disabling adverse events) associated with various treatments. RESULTS: Medical follow-up was complete for 94.3% of survivors (median follow-up, 17.0 years). The median attained age at end of follow-up was 24.4 years. Almost 75% of survivors had 1 or more adverse events, and 24.6% had 5 or more adverse events. Furthermore, 40% of survivors had at least 1 severe or life-threatening or disabling adverse event. A high or severe burden of adverse events was observed in 55% of survivors who received radiotherapy only and 15% of survivors treated with chemotherapy only, compared with 25% of survivors who had surgery only (adjusted relative risks, 2.18 [95% confidence interval, 1.62-2.95] and 0.65 [95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.90], respectively). A high or severe burden of adverse events was most often observed in survivors of bone tumors (64%) and least often in survivors of leukemia or Wilms tumor (12% each). CONCLUSIONS: In young adulthood, a substantial proportion of childhood cancer survivors already has a high or severe burden of disease, particularly after radiotherapy. This underscores the need for lifelong risk-stratified medical surveillance of childhood cancer survivors.","['Geenen, Maud M', 'Cardous-Ubbink, Mathilde C', 'Kremer, Leontien C M', 'van den Bos, Cor', 'van der Pal, Helena J H', 'Heinen, Richard C', 'Jaspers, Monique W M', 'Koning, Caro C E', 'Oldenburger, Foppe', 'Langeveld, Nelia E', 'Hart, Augustinus A M', 'Bakker, Piet J M', 'Caron, Huib N', 'van Leeuwen, Flora E']","['Geenen MM', 'Cardous-Ubbink MC', 'Kremer LC', 'van den Bos C', 'van der Pal HJ', 'Heinen RC', 'Jaspers MW', 'Koning CC', 'Oldenburger F', 'Langeveld NE', 'Hart AA', 'Bakker PJ', 'Caron HN', 'van Leeuwen FE']","[""Late Effects Study Group and Outpatient Clinic/Polikliniek Late Effecten Kindertumoren (PLEK), Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', '*Cost of Illness', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Morbidity', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Survivors']",2007/06/28 09:00,2007/06/29 09:00,['2007/06/28 09:00'],"['2007/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2007 Jun 27;297(24):2705-15. doi: 10.1001/jama.297.24.2705.,,,,"['297/24/2705 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.297.24.2705 [doi]']",,,,,,,"['JAMA. 2007 Jun 27;297(24):2762-4.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: An 850-bed tertiary care hospital, which is also a referral site for patients with acute leukemia. PATIENTS: Fifty-five adult patients who started empiric antifungal therapy for febrile neutropenia between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2003, encompassing 58 treatment episodes (defined as a hospitalization during which empiric antifungal therapy was administered). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Medical charts, including patients' pharmacy and laboratory data, were reviewed. Twenty-six and 32 episodes of L-AmB and voriconazole use, respectively, were identified. No significant differences between the L-AmB and voriconazole groups were noted at baseline. Rates of fever resolution (54% vs 59%, p=0.791) and breakthrough invasive fungal infections (11% vs 12%, p>0.999) were similar for the L-AmB and voriconazole episodes. Premature drug discontinuation due to the prescriber's perceived lack of efficacy occurred most frequently in the voriconazole group (25% vs 8%, p=0.160). Survival was significantly higher in the voriconazole than in the L-AmB group (100% vs 77%, p=0.006). Adverse effects that were significantly more common in the L-AmB group than in the voriconazole group were elevated serum creatinine levels (27% vs 3%, p=0.017) and electrolyte disturbances (19% vs 0%, p=0.014). Adverse effects reported more frequently in the voriconazole group than in the L-AmB group were visual disturbances (9% vs 0%, p=0.245) and elevated hepatic enzyme levels (9% vs 8%, p>0.999). Mean drug expenditures/episode for initial empiric antifungal therapy were lower for voriconazole than for L-AmB ($1593 vs $4144, or $153 vs $380/day). CONCLUSION: Our institution's algorithm incorporating voriconazole into the empiric management of febrile neutropenia was associated with effectiveness outcomes comparable to those observed with L-AmB as well as a lower frequency of adverse effects and overall expenditures for antifungal drugs.","['Shehab, Nadine', 'DePestel, Daryl D', 'Mackler, Emily R', 'Collins, Curtis D', 'Welch, Kathleen', 'Erba, Harry P']","['Shehab N', 'DePestel DD', 'Mackler ER', 'Collins CD', 'Welch K', 'Erba HP']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/drug therapy/economics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitalization/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy/economics', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",2007/06/28 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2007/06/28 09:00'],"['2007/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2007 Jul;27(7):970-9. doi: 10.1592/phco.27.7.970.,,,,['10.1592/phco.27.7.970 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Several cell lines representing various hematological malignancies were treated in vitro with the study drugs alone or in combinations. Flow cytometry was used to assess cell death rates and reative oxygen species production. Glutathione and ATP levels were determinded using a photometric and a luminometric assay, respectively. Cell death was characterised by fluorescence microscopy and DNA fragmentation analysis. RESULTS: PRT increased cytotoxicity of ATO in seven out of eight cell lines. Addition of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) further potentiated cytotoxicity of the combined treatment. When combined with PRT and BSO, clinically achievable concentrations of ATO (2.5 microM) induced cytotoxicity rates of 80-98% after 24 h. Importantly, lymphocytes from healthy donors were largely unaffected by these treatment modalities, also after growth stimulation in cell culture. N-acetylcysteine inhibited the cytotoxic effects of the triple combination. Treatment of leukemic cells with ATO, PRT and BSO rapidly depleted cells from glutathione, induced oxidative stress and decreased intracellular ATP levels.

PERSPECTIVES: Evidence was selected and reviewed by one member of the Hematology Disease Site Group (dsg) of Cancer Care Ontario's Program in Evidence-Based Care (pebc) and by methodologists. The practice guideline report was reviewed and approved by the Hema-tology dsg, which comprises hematologists, medical and radiation oncologists, and a patient representative. As part of an external review process, the report was disseminated to obtain feedback from practitioners in Ontario. OUTCOMES: Outcomes of interest were overall survival, quality of life, response rates and duration, and adverse event rates. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review of the medline, embase, HealthStar, cinahl, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to search for primary articles and practice guidelines. The evidence informed the development of clinical practice recommendations. The evidence review and recommendations were appraised by a sample of practitioners from Ontario, Canada, and were modified in response to the feedback received. The systematic review and modified recommendations were approved by a review body within the pebc. RESULTS: The literature review found no published randomized controlled trials (rcts) that evaluated alem-tuzumab alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of relapsed or refractory cll. One rct evaluated alemtuzumab administered to consolidate a complete or partial response to first-line fludarabine-containing chemotherapy. That study was stopped early because of excessive grades 3 and 4 infection-related toxicity in the alemtuzumab arm. Patients receiving alemtuzumab experienced significantly improved progression-free survival as compared with patients undergoing observation. Six single-arm studies evaluated disease response with administration of alemtuzumab as a single agent in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory cll post-fludarabine. The pooled overall response rate was 38% (complete response: 6%; partial response: 32%). Adverse events associated with the use of alemtuzumab were commonly reported and included serious infusion-related, hematologic, and infection-related toxicities. RECOMMENDATION: This evidence-based recommendation applies to adult patients with B-cell cll. Treatment with alemtuzumab is a reasonable option for patients with progressive and symptomatic cll that is refractory to both alkylator-based and fludarabine-based regimens. QUALIFYING STATEMENTS: The evidence supporting treatment with alemtuzumab comes principally from case series that evaluated disease response as the primary outcome measure. Patients should be informed that any possible beneficial effect of alemtuzumab on other outcome measures such as duration of response, quality of life, and overall survival are not supported in evidence and currently remain speculative. Treatment with alemtuzumab is associated with significant and potentially serious treatment-related toxicities. Patients must be carefully informed of the uncertain balance between potential risks of harm and the chance for benefit reported in studies. Given the current substantial uncertainty in this balance, patient preferences will likely play a large role in determining the appropriate treatment choice. Given the potential toxicities associated with alemtuzumab, and given the limited nature of the agent's testing in clinical trials in broad populations of patients with cll, the use of alemtuzumab in patients with important comorbidities may be associated with excessive risks.","['Fraser, G', 'Smith, C A', 'Imrie, K', 'Meyer, R']","['Fraser G', 'Smith CA', 'Imrie K', 'Meyer R']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,,,,2007/06/28 09:00,2007/06/28 09:01,['2007/06/28 09:00'],"['2007/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/28 09:01 [medline]', '2007/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2007 Jun;14(3):96-109. doi: 10.3747/co.2007.118.,,"[""Hematology Disease Site Groupof Cancer Care Ontario's Program in Evidence-Based"", 'Care']",,['10.3747/co.2007.118 [doi]'],,,,,PMC1899355,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we have studied the effects of CDDO and its imidazolide derivative (CDDO-Im) on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), using patients' CLL cells and a mouse model of CLL and small B cell lymphoma (SBL). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CDDO and CDDO-Im efficiently induced apoptosis of malignant human and mouse B-cells ex vivo, although CDDO-Im was over 10-fold more potent than CDDO. Treating mice with CLL/SBL with liposome-formulated CDDO or CDDO-Im resulted in significant reductions of B cells in blood, spleen and lung. CDDO-Im was shown to be more potent than CDDO, while treatment with empty liposomes had no impact on disease. CDDO-Im treatment initially resulted in an increase of circulating B cells, which correlates with a reduction in resident lymphocytes in spleen, and lungs, suggesting that CDDO-Im induces mobilization of tumor cells from lymphoid organs and infiltrated tissues into the circulation. Analysis of blood cells recovered from treated mice also showed that CDDO-Im is a potent inducer of tumor cells death in vivo. Furthermore, CDDO-Im efficiently eradicated mouse CLL/SBL cells but had little effect on the viability of normal B and T cells in vivo. SIGNIFICANCE: The presented data demonstrate that triterpenoids CDDO and CDDO-Im reduce leukemia and lymphoma burden in vivo in a transgenic mouse model of CLL/SBL, and support the clinical testing of CDDO-based synthetic triterpenoids in patients with CLL.","['Kress, Christina L', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Martinez-Garcia, Vanesa', 'Krajewska, Maryla', 'Lefebvre, Sophie', 'Hyer, Marc L', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Reed, John C', 'Zapata, Juan M']","['Kress CL', 'Konopleva M', 'Martinez-Garcia V', 'Krajewska M', 'Lefebvre S', 'Hyer ML', 'McQueen T', 'Andreeff M', 'Reed JC', 'Zapata JM']","['Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2/*physiology']",2007/06/28 09:00,2007/06/28 09:01,['2007/06/28 09:00'],"['2007/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/28 09:01 [medline]', '2007/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2007 Jun 27;2(6):e559. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0000559.,,,"['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI070859/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA089346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0000559 [doi]'],,,20070627,,PMC1891436,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20070801'],,

METHODS: With Trizol reagent, the total RNA was extracted from healthy rhesus liver tissue. By mutant Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (MMLV-RT), the first-strand cDNA was synthesized from purified mRNA, and subsequently the second-strand cDNA was generated via E. coli DNA polymerase I . Then, the EcoR I adapter was added to the synthesized double-strand cDNA, which was subsequently digested by Xho I restriction enzyme and fractionated with CHROMA APIN-400 column. The fractionated cDNA fragments to be longer than 0. 5 kb were ligated into lambda ZAP express vector to form the phagemid cDNA recombinants, which were further packaged into the lambda ZAP cDNA library according to the standard protocol with phage lambda Gold packaging extract. In order to get more stable clones with larger quantity, the primary library was amplified through infecting the host strain XL1-Blue MRF'. Then, the library titre, recombinant rate and length of inserted cDNA were measured, respectively. RESULTS: The capacity of the primary stand or unamplified library was 1. 2X 10(6) pfu. The titers of the unamplified library or the amplified library was 1.1 X 10(6) mixture, pfu/mL or 7. 7 X 10(9) pfu/mL respectively, the percentages of recombinants were 99. 3% and 98. 2%, and the average lengths of the inserts were 2.0 kb and 2. 3 kb, respectively.

To assess the mechanisms involved in this secretion, the differential effect of cytokines was tested in in vitro cultures of NHL cells. A significant induction of sHLA-G level was shown in T-NHL in contrast with B-NHL and normal equivalent cells, after cytokine stimulation with (i) interferongamma (IFNgamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, (ii) IL-10 and (iii) transforming growth factor beta. An impact of microenvironment on sHLA-G expression was found in B-NHL as shown by the in vitro effect of addition of normal monocytes. Finally, a functional effect of sHLA-G molecules purified from pathologic plasma was demonstrated by their strong capacity to inhibit T-cell proliferation at concentrations currently observed during these disorders. These results suggest that functional sHLA-G molecules are upregulated in lymphoproliferative disorders which can support their potential immunomodulatory role during this pathology.","['Sebti, Yasmine', 'Le Maux, Amelie', 'Gros, Frederic', 'De Guibert, Sophie', 'Pangault, Celine', 'Rouas-Freiss, Nathalie', 'Bernard, Marc', 'Amiot, Laurence']","['Sebti Y', 'Le Maux A', 'Gros F', 'De Guibert S', 'Pangault C', 'Rouas-Freiss N', 'Bernard M', 'Amiot L']","['UPRES Immunologie Hematologie, Universite de Rennes 1, Rennes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*blood', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*blood', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Interleukins/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Prospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/06/27 09:00,2007/09/18 09:00,['2007/06/27 09:00'],"['2007/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Jul;138(2):202-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06647.x.,,,,"['BJH6647 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06647.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some t(1;19)-positive ALLs are negative for this chimaera. We here report an alternative TCF3/PBX1 transcript, fusing exon 17 of TCF3 with exon 5 of PBX1, in a paediatric t(1;19)-positive ALL. The different breakpoints made this hybrid undetectable by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using standard TCF3 and PBX1 primers. Hence, ALLs with t(1;19) that test negative for TCF3/PBX1 should be analysed further before excluding this alternative fusion. Furthermore, we have characterised the genomic translocation breakpoints in eight TCF3/PBX1-positive ALLs; four cases with a balanced t(1;19) and four with an unbalanced der(19)t(1;19). It has previously been suggested that the breakpoints are clustered, particularly in TCF3, and that N-nucleotides are frequently present in the fusion junctions. Three of seven investigated TCF3 intron 16 breakpoints were within the previously described 14 base pair-cluster, and all but two junctions harboured N-nucleotides. The PBX1 breakpoints were more dispersed, although still clustered in two regions. This confirms that most t(1;19) rearrangements may arise by a combination of illegitimate V(D)J recombination and non-homologous end joining.","['Paulsson, Kajsa', 'Jonson, Tord', 'Ora, Ingrid', 'Olofsson, Tor', 'Panagopoulos, Ioannis', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Paulsson K', 'Jonson T', 'Ora I', 'Olofsson T', 'Panagopoulos I', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2007/06/27 09:00,2007/09/18 09:00,['2007/06/27 09:00'],"['2007/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Jul;138(2):196-201. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06644.x.,,,,"['BJH6644 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06644.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complicated neutropenia may lead to reduction and/or delay of systemic anti-cancer treatment, which may compromise outcome. Haematopoietic growth factors have the ability to augment haematopoietic cell cycling and are used to facilitate more dose-intense treatments and to decrease treatment-related complications. This review focuses on randomised trials that investigated the use of colony-stimulating factors (CSF) to prevent treatment-related febrile complications in haematological malignancies in (younger) adult patients. In general, these studies demonstrated that CSF reduced the duration of severe neutropenia but not always its febrile complications; therefore inconsistent results regarding clinically relevant reduction of hospitalisation, duration of therapeutic antibiotics, infection-related or disease-related mortality and economic effects were reported.

Standard primary treatment remains a combination of corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. There is no standard therapy for those who fail to respond to corticosteroids.

We developed a novel method using antibodies to direct MMLV to vascular endothelium. We have given the term immunovirosomes to the complexes formed between viruses, liposomes, and antibodies. These immunovirosomes improve the transduction efficiency of the viruses and alter their tropism. We have shown improved transduction when immunovirosomes were targeted at the endocytic receptors CD71 and CD62E/P and rather less good delivery when targeted at CD106. The enhancement of the transduction efficiency was transient, however, suggesting that rerouting the entry pathway of viruses alters the expression properties of the viruses.","['Tan, Peng H', 'Xue, Shao-An', 'Wei, Bin', 'Holler, Angelika', 'Voss, Ralf-Holger', 'George, Andrew J T']","['Tan PH', 'Xue SA', 'Wei B', 'Holler A', 'Voss RH', 'George AJ']","['Department of Immunology, Division of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK. p.tan@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Virosomes)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'E-Selectin/immunology/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', '*Liposomes', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/immunology/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Tropism', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/immunology/metabolism', 'Virosomes/metabolism']",2007/06/27 09:00,2007/08/10 09:00,['2007/06/27 09:00'],"['2006/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2007 Mar-Apr;13(3-4):216-26. doi: 10.2119/2006-00052.Tan.,,,,['10.2119/2006-00052.Tan [doi]'],,,,,PMC1892767,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to test whether the reverse is true, namely whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligands have direct effects upon the activity of the endocannabinoid metabolizing enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Fatty acid amide hydrolase activity was measured in rat brain homogenates, C6 glioma and RBL2H3 basophilic leukaemia cells. Cellular uptake of anandamide was also assessed in these cells. KEY RESULTS: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activators inhibited the metabolism of the endocannabinoid anandamide in rat brain homogenates with an order of potency MCC-555 > indomethacin approximately ciglitazone approximately 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) approximately pioglitazone > rosiglitazone > troglitazone. The antagonists BADGE, GW9662 and T0070907 were poor inhibitors of anandamide hydrolysis. The inhibition by ciglitazone was competitive and increased as the pH of the assay buffer was decreased; the K(i) value at pH 6.0 was 17 microM. In intact C6 glioma cells assayed at pH 6.2, significant inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis was seen at 3 microM ciglitazone, whereas 100 microM was required to produce significant inhibition at pH 7.4. Ciglitazone also interacted with monoacylglycerol lipase as well as with cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Ciglitazone may be useful as a template for the design of novel dual action anti-inflammatory agents which are both inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase and agonists at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.","['Lenman, A', 'Fowler, C J']","['Lenman A', 'Fowler CJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Umea University, SE-901 87 Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', 'EC 3.1.1.23 (Monoacylglycerol Lipases)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (fatty-acid amide hydrolase)', 'U8QXS1WU8G (ciglitazone)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Brain/enzymology', 'Brain Neoplasms/enzymology/pathology', 'Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Design', '*Endocannabinoids', 'Glioma/enzymology/pathology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Monoacylglycerol Lipases/drug effects/metabolism', 'PPAR gamma/*agonists', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Thiazolidinediones/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",2007/06/27 09:00,2007/11/01 09:00,['2007/06/27 09:00'],"['2007/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2007 Aug;151(8):1343-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0707352.

We compared the expression of TCL1 in B-cell tumors with their differentiation stage. As with normal B-cell subsets, uniform TCL1 expression was characteristic of tumors of pregerminal center derivation such as precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (85%, 47/55) and mantle cell lymphoma (84%, 49/58), and was more variable in follicular lymphoma (57%, 28/49). Large B-cell lymphoma was less frequently positive for TCL1 (36%, 18/50), especially among cases of the activated B-cell type. All types of Hodgkin lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, and post-germinal center-derived tumors, including plasma cell myeloma and MALT lymphoma, were negative for TCL1, except for 1 case. In nearly all TCL1-expressing tumors, as with normal B cells, variations in cellular TCL1 levels were related to the proliferation and microenvironmental factors. In normal B cells, cell lines and primary B-cell tumor samples, TCL1 downmodulation occurred after prolonged cytokine treatment and/or B-cell receptor stimulation. In contrast to mature T-cell tumors where TCL1 expression is always indicative of an activating TCL1 gene translocation, TCL1 expression in B-cell tumors parallels its regulation in non-neoplastic B cells. Therefore, TCL1 expression can be used diagnostically as an indicator of the differentiation stage of a given B-cell tumor.","['Herling, Marco', 'Patel, Kaushali A', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Chang, Kong-Chao', 'Rassidakis, George Z', 'Ford, Richard', 'Jones, Dan']","['Herling M', 'Patel KA', 'Hsi ED', 'Chang KC', 'Rassidakis GZ', 'Ford R', 'Jones D']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, M.

The Treg set of cells, also called T suppressor cells, play an essential role in natural Treg-mediated suppression of various types of immune cells. Suppression can be manifest by a cell-cell contact set of events, and recent evidence also supports soluble mediators. FOXP3 was previous identified as a passive transcriptional repressor which associates with nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, and calcineurin-dependent 2 (NFATc2) as well as several other transcriptional factors including nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) and acute myeloid leukemia 1(AML1)/runt-related transcription factor 1(RUNX1). We found FOXP3 could actively repress transcription by recruiting distinct histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases to function as a co-repressor complex. The identification of enzymatic factors operative as essential participants in FOXP3-mediated transcriptional repression provides a practical basis for therapeutically modulating the activity of FOXP3 in immune suppression.

SUMMARY: A 75-year-old man went to a hematology clinic in April 2005 because of anemia and thrombocytopenia. He was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In May 2005, the patient was started on induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin. During the induction phase, the patient received platelet transfusions on multiple occasions without any evidence of transfusion reactions. He went into partial remission and received two cycles of cytarabine and idarubicin followed by one cycle of high-dose cytarabine. In March 2006, the patient relapsed, and he received dose number one of the first cycle of gemtuzumab ozogamicin at a dose of 9 mg/m2 on March 28, 2006. He tolerated the infusion. He had received multiple platelet transfusions during the week before gemtuzumab infusion without reaction but received no transfusions on the same day as the gemtuzumab infusion. On April 4, 2006, the patient received an infusion of gemtuzumab at 11 a.m., and he received 6 units of leukocyte-depleted, irradiated platelets at 6:40 p.m. At 1 a.m. the next morning, the patient developed fever and shortness of breath and went into severe distress. Despite treatment, the patient died shortly after. CONCLUSION: A patient with AML developed severe respiratory distress and died after receiving gemtuzumab and 6 units of platelets on the same day. The fact that he had previously received gemtuzumab and platelets safely on separate days suggests that the gemtuzumab-platelet combination contributed to a fatal hypersensitivity reaction.","['Hanbali, Amr', 'Wollner, Ira', 'Neme, Klodiana', 'Ulreich, Cynthia']","['Hanbali A', 'Wollner I', 'Neme K', 'Ulreich C']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI 48202, USA. ahanbal1@hfhs.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/*adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*etiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects']",2007/06/27 09:00,2007/07/21 09:00,['2007/06/27 09:00'],"['2007/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2007 Jul 1;64(13):1401-2. doi: 10.2146/ajhp060612.,,,,"['64/13/1401 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp060612 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differential diagnosis between the HES and the related chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) relied on the identification of signs of clonality that allowed, when present, the reclassification of patients as CEL.

According to the World Health Organization classification, this clonal abnormality has been proposed as a new surrogate marker for chronic eosinophilic leukemia diagnosis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction protocols were developed for an accurate del(4)(q12q12) and FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene detection. Here, we report a patient with a rare FIP1L1 intron 16 breakpoint located outside of the reported FIP1L1 breakpoint region (ie, from FIP1L1 introns 9 to 13). This case illustrates the risk of false-negative results with diagnostic procedures that do not take into account the occurrence of rare FIP1L1 breakpoints.

Although the majority of CML patients are responsive to imatinib, a subset of patients loses the response and some progress to accelerated- or blast-phase CML. The understanding of mechanisms of imatinib resistance has led to the development of novel BCR-ABL inhibitors; among these, dasatinib emerged as the most promising, being approximately 300-fold more potent than imatinib; it also inhibits SRC family kinases. Preliminary data, after the introduction of dasatinib in clinical trials, in patients with CML, suggest that this drug is safe and well tolerated; furthermore, the majority of patients with imatinib-resistant disease achieved objective responses, although the durability of responses remains to be defined. Recently, dasatinib emerged as a potent inhibitor of imatinib-resistant protein tyrosine kinase (KIT) activation loop mutants and it is able to induce apoptosis in mast cell and leukemic cell lines expressing these mutations.

The retina and vitreous were involved in 12 of the ocular relapses, the anterior segment leukemic infiltrate in nine, glaucoma in five, opportunistic infection in four, cranial nerve palsies in three, proptosis and hypotony in two. Conjunctival hemorrhage, choroidal infiltrate and cataract were present in one relapse each. The optic nerve was involved in nine relapses, which is a serious condition that requires immediate intervention to save the patient's sight. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain and orbit was useful in differentiating between optic nerve infiltrate and papilledema. Most ocular relapses responded well to chemotherapy except relapses with optic nerve and anterior segment infiltrate, which required irradiation to save the patient's sight and prevent further relapses. In conclusion, the presented data have shown that ocular leukemia is not rare and emphasizes the importance of early ophthalmologic examination and radiation.","['Badeeb, O', 'Tashkandi, I', 'Omar, A', 'Anwer, M', 'Farwan, K', 'Dabbagh, A', 'Walid, M']","['Badeeb O', 'Tashkandi I', 'Omar A', 'Anwer M', 'Farwan K', 'Dabbagh A', 'Walid M']","['Departments of Ophthalomology, Hematology and Radiology, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Ann Saudi Med,Annals of Saudi medicine,8507355,,,,1995/05/01 00:00,1995/05/01 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Saudi Med. 1995 May;15(3):222-6. doi: 10.5144/0256-4947.1995.222.,,,,"['15-222 [pii]', '10.5144/0256-4947.1995.222 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1-ETO is a DNA binding transcription factor and has been demonstrated to play a critical role in promoting leukemogenesis. Therefore, it is important to define the molecular mechanism of AML1-ETO in the regulation of gene expression. Here, we report that the effect of AML1-ETO on the promoter of multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1) gene, a known AML1-ETO target, is highly cell type specific. Besides observing repression of the MDR1 promoter in C33A and CV-1 cells as reported previously, AML1-ETO strongly activated the promoter in K562 and B210 cells. More importantly, this activation required both the AML1 and ETO portions of the fusion protein, but did not depend on the AML1 binding site in MDR1 promoter. Furthermore, results from promoter deletion analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggested that this activation effect was likely through the influence of the general transcription machinery rather than promoter-specific factors. Based on these data, we propose that AML1-ETO may have opposing effects on gene expression depending on the various conditions of the cellular environment.","['Hines, Robert', 'Boyapati, Anita', 'Zhang, Dong-Er']","['Hines R', 'Boyapati A', 'Zhang DE']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, MEM-L51, The Scripps Research Institute, 10550 N.

Identification of the genes involved in malignant transformation is a pre-requisite for understanding cancer and improving its diagnosis and treatment. Quite a few of the genes that have been implicated in cancer are mutant or aberrantly expressed versions of genes that are important mediators of the normal growth that occurs during development. An important example of this is Vav1, a cytoplasmic signal transducer protein initially identified as an oncogene. Physiological expression of Vav1 is restricted to the hematopoietic system, where its best-known function is as a GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange factor for Rho/Rac GTPases, an activity strictly controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation. Vav1 was shown to regulate cytoskeletal rearrangement during activation of hematopoietic cells. Vav1 can also mediate other cellular functions including activation of the JNK, ERK, Ras, NF-kB, and NFAT pathways, in addition to association with numerous adapter proteins such as Shc, NCK, SLP-76, GRB2, and Crk. Although the oncogenic form of Vav1 has not been detected in clinical human tumors, its wild-type form has recently been implicated in mammalian malignancies such as neuroblastoma, melanoma, pancreatic tumors and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This review addresses the physiological function of wild-type Vav1, its mode of activation as an oncogene, and its emerging role as a transforming protein in human cancer.","['Katzav, Shulamit']",['Katzav S'],"['The Hubert H.

METHODS: Children and adolescents treated for ALL (n = 40; mean age 11.8 years, range 8.5-15.4) and healthy controls (n = 42; mean age 11.8, range 8.11-15.0) were assessed through a cross-sectional approach using the Pediatric Quality of Life inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 and the Wechsler Intelligent Scale for children-III (WISC-III). RESULTS: Children and adolescents treated for ALL reported on average significantly lower HRQOL compared to healthy controls: the mother's proxy-report showed significantly lower HRQOL for their children, as did the father's proxy-report, measured by the PedsQL 4.0 Total Scale and Psychosocial Health Scale. Intellectual functioning as measured by the WISC-III Full Scale IQ was below that of the control group, but still within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences found between children treated for ALL and their control group for the PedsQL Psychosocial Health Scale may indicate that the complex illness-treatment experience can make children more vulnerable with regard to psychosocial sequels, in spite of otherwise satisfactory physical and intellectual functioning.

Since then, several new cases have been reported. Recently a possible accidental release of radionuclides in 1986 was hypothesized. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the childhood leukemia incidence in this area since 1990. METHODS: All incident cases (< 15 years of age) were ascertained during 1990-2005 within a 5-km radius of the Krummel nuclear power plant. We derived standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) using county and national leukemia incidence rates as referents. We stratified analyses by calendar period and attained age, and by subdividing the study region into areas north versus south of the Elbe river. RESULTS: Fourteen cases were ascertained in the study area, whereas 4.0 were expected based on national referent rates [1990-2005: SIR = 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.9-5.9]. The excess was not confined to the early 1990s; for the more recent time period 1999-2005, the SIR is still elevated (SIR = 2.7; 95% CI, 0.9-6.2). SIRs of greatest magnitude were observed for children 0-4 years of age (SIR = 4.9; 95% CI, 2.4-9.0) and for residents south of the Elbe (SIR = 7.5; 95% CI, 2.8-16.4). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence in this region is significantly higher than the childhood leukemia incidence for Germany as a whole. To date, no unique hazards have been identified in this population. The fact that the elevated rates have persisted in this community for > 15 years warrants further investigation.","['Hoffmann, Wolfgang', 'Terschueren, Claudia', 'Richardson, David B']","['Hoffmann W', 'Terschueren C', 'Richardson DB']","['Institute for Community Medicine, Section Epidemiology of Health Care and Community Health, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany. wolfgang.hoffmann@uni-greifswald.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Power Plants', 'Radioactive Hazard Release']",2007/06/26 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2007 Jun;115(6):947-52. doi: 10.1289/ehp.9861.

We hypothesized that prophylactic SDAP and PPC transfusions are clinically equivalent after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT). We studied all transfusions administered to 33 patients with AML/MDS during the first 100 days after busulfan-based, myeloablative HSCT. All donor-recipient pairs were ABO identical. Transfusion threshold was a platelet count < or =15 x 10(9)/l. The corrected increment (CCI) was used for all comparisons. Median time to platelet engraftment was 13 days (n=30). PPC transfusions (n=105) were ABO compatible, while 10% of 41 SDAP were not (P=0.006). Median post-transfusion platelet count was 51K/microl (5-118K) after SDAP and 36K/microl (3-115K) after PPC (P=0.0004). Median CCI was 14.178 (SDAP) versus 7.793 (PPC) (P=0.0001).

In AML, the recurring t(5;11)(q35;p15.5) translocation fuses NSD1 to nucleoporin-98 (NUP98). Here, we present the first characterization of the transforming properties and molecular mechanisms of NUP98-NSD1. We demonstrate that NUP98-NSD1 induces AML in vivo, sustains self-renewal of myeloid stem cells in vitro, and enforces expression of the HoxA7, HoxA9, HoxA10 and Meis1 proto-oncogenes. Mechanistically, NUP98-NSD1 binds genomic elements adjacent to HoxA7 and HoxA9, maintains histone H3 Lys 36 (H3K36) methylation and histone acetylation, and prevents EZH2-mediated transcriptional repression of the Hox-A locus during differentiation. Deletion of the NUP98 FG-repeat domain, or mutations in NSD1 that inactivate the H3K36 methyltransferase activity or that prevent binding of NUP98-NSD1 to the Hox-A locus precluded both Hox-A gene activation and myeloid progenitor immortalization. We propose that NUP98-NSD1 prevents EZH2-mediated repression of Hox-A locus genes by colocalizing H3K36 methylation and histone acetylation at regulatory DNA elements. This report is the first to link deregulated H3K36 methylation to tumorigenesis and to link NSD1 to transcriptional regulation of the Hox-A locus.","['Wang, Gang G', 'Cai, Ling', 'Pasillas, Martina P', 'Kamps, Mark P']","['Wang GG', 'Cai L', 'Pasillas MP', 'Kamps MP']","['Department of Pathology, University of California at San Diego, School of Medicine, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NUP98-NSD1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (NSD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/physiology', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/06/26 09:00,2007/09/07 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2006/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2007 Jul;9(7):804-12. doi: 10.1038/ncb1608.

In unilineage monocytic culture generated by haematopoietic progenitor cells these miRNAs are downregulated, whereas the transcription factor acute myeloid leukaemia-1 (AML1; also known as Runt-related transcription factor 1, Runx1) is upregulated at protein but not mRNA level. As miRNAs 17-5p, 20a and 106a bind the AML1 mRNA 3'UTR, their decline may unblock AML1 translation. Accordingly, transfection with miRNA 17-5p-20a-106a suppresses AML1 protein expression, leading to M-CSF receptor (M-CSFR) downregulation, enhanced blast proliferation and inhibition of monocytic differentiation and maturation. Treatment with anti-miRNA 17-5p, 20a and 106a causes opposite effects. Knockdown of AML1 or M-CSFR by short interfering RNA (siRNA) mimics the action of the miRNA 17-5p-20a-106a, confirming that these miRNAs target AML1, which promotes M-CSFR transcription. In addition, AML1 binds the miRNA 17-5p-92 and 106a-92 cluster promoters and transcriptionally inhibits the expression of miRNA 17-5p-20a-106a. These studies indicate that monocytopoiesis is controlled by a circuitry involving sequentially miRNA 17-5p-20a-106a, AML1 and M-CSFR, whereby miRNA 17-5p-20a-106a function as a master gene complex interlinked with AML1 in a mutual negative feedback loop.","['Fontana, Laura', 'Pelosi, Elvira', 'Greco, Paolo', 'Racanicchi, Serena', 'Testa, Ugo', 'Liuzzi, Francesca', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Brunetti, Ercole', 'Grignani, Francesco', 'Peschle, Cesare']","['Fontana L', 'Pelosi E', 'Greco P', 'Racanicchi S', 'Testa U', 'Liuzzi F', 'Croce CM', 'Brunetti E', 'Grignani F', 'Peschle C']","['Department of Haematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161, Rome, Italy. lfontana@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis', '*Up-Regulation']",2007/06/26 09:00,2007/09/07 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2007/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2007 Jul;9(7):775-87. doi: 10.1038/ncb1613.

We screened the sequenced peptides for those compatible with the motives of the respective HLA class I alleles. Then, we narrowed down the candidate peptides according to the differential expression of their source proteins between ATL cells and normal CD4 T cells. Among these candidates, we focused on cyclin-dependent kinaselike 5 (CDKL5) because it was highly expressed in several ATL cell lines and some ATL clinical samples but not in normal CD4 T cells.

CDKL5-stimulated bulk CD8 T cells exerted higher cytotoxicity against CDKL5 peptide-loaded autologous Epstein Barr virus-transformed B cell line (LCL) than against unloaded LCL. Furthermore these T cells had strong cytotoxic activity against HLA-B*62-positive CDKL5-positive but not HLA-B*62-negative CDKL5-positive ATL cells. These results demonstrate that CDKL5 is a novel tumor (leukemia) antigen in ATL and that the HLA-B*62-restricted CDKL5 peptide can be used for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated immunotherapy.

In the present study, we have investigated at the molecular level why parental drug-sensitive tumor cells do not respond to Trichostatin A and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, two iHDACs that promote apoptosis in drug-resistant leukaemia cells. Taking murine leukaemia L1210 cells as a model, we have determined that: (i) PKC-alpha expression is more elevated in parental L1210 than in drug-resistant L1210/R cells, (ii) activation of PKC neutralizes iHDACs-mediated apoptosis in L1210/R cells, (iii) depletion of PKC in parental L1210 cells results in a positive response to iHDACs-mediated apoptosis, and (iv) transfection of a mutant constitutively active PKC-alpha form in L1210/R cells makes the cells refractory to apoptosis induction by iHDACs. These results allow us to conclude that activation/high expression of PKC-alpha protects parental drug-sensitive L1210 cells from iHDACs-mediated apoptosis. Thus, determination of PKC-alpha levels/activity in leukaemia seems to be relevant when choosing efficient chemotherapy protocols based on the use of apoptosis-inducing anticancer drugs.","['Castro-Galache, Maria D', 'Menendez-Gutierrez, Maria P', 'Carrasco Garcia, Estefania', 'Garcia-Morales, Pilar', 'Martinez-Lacaci, Isabel', 'Saceda, Miguel', 'Ferragut, Jose A']","['Castro-Galache MD', 'Menendez-Gutierrez MP', 'Carrasco Garcia E', 'Garcia-Morales P', 'Martinez-Lacaci I', 'Saceda M', 'Ferragut JA']","['Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular, Universidad Miguel Hernandez, Avda. de la Universidad s/n., 03202 Elche, Alicante, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vorinostat']",2007/06/26 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2007/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2007;39(10):1877-85. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2007.05.007.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) each represents a heterogeneous complex of disorders, with genetic abnormalities presenting in more than 80% of ALLs and more than 90% of AMLs. The diagnostic gold standard and classification of leukaemia involves various methods including morphology, cytochemistry, cytogenetics and molecular genetics, immunophenotyping, and molecular biology. These diagnostic methods are a prerequisite for individual treatment strategies and for the evaluation of treatment response especially considering that many distinct types of acute leukemia are known to carry predictable prognoses and warrant specific therapy. The quantification of gene expression is essential in determination of tailored therapeutic decisions. Microarray technology offers the possibility of quantifying thousands of genes in a single analysis, thus potentially becoming an essential tool for molecular classification to be used in routine leukaemia diagnostics. MLL+ leukaemia is a perfect example as to the exact correspondence between gene expression and protein expression evaluated by flow cytometry. Applying computational analysis to flow cytometry results, it is possible to distinguish the MLL+ acute leukemia from MLL- acute leukemia using as the top ranked antigen some top ranked genes described in the Microarray evaluation. Key markers discriminating different leukemia phenotypes can be identified by univariate hypothesis testing from a data set of immunophenotypic markers described by two variables, one reflecting the intensity of expression (MESF) and the other the pattern of distribution (CV). A current multi center study called Microarray Innovations in Leukemia (MILE Study) uses higher density gene chips providing nearly complete coverage of the human genome. The study which has analyzed thus far 1837 retrospective cases shows that each important leukemia subtype has a specific genetic fingerprint, meaning that different combinations of genes whose expression is linked to each subtype can be identified allowing for patient tailored therapy. Moreover, the study has achieved 97% diagnostic accuracy on samples from tested patients. Statistical analysis has shown a high concordance level between standard diagnostic procedures and those of the microarray technology--globally around 95.6%. Additionally it is possible to correctly classify some subgroups incorrectly identified using gold standard methods. Thus, from a technical viewpoint, gene expression profiling in tandem with flow cytometry should be a viable alternative to standard diagnostic approaches. Whether gene expression profiling will become a practical diagnostic alternative remains to be seen.","['Basso, Giuseppe', 'Case, Colette', ""Dell'Orto, Marta Campo""]","['Basso G', 'Case C', ""Dell'Orto MC""]","['Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Pediatric Department, University of Padova, Via Giustiniani 3, Padova, 35128, Italy. giuseppe.basso@unipd.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['*Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Risk Assessment']",2007/06/26 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2007/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2007 Sep-Oct;39(2):164-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.05.004.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunoscreening of the cDNA library was performed with sera from a CML patient. Two isolated antigens were used to evaluate the expression pattern using Northern blot analysis and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were also performed for serological analysis. RESULTS: We identified 14 positive clones, representing five different antigens. Of these, two genes were further validated. One (clone 70) was the human polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase 1 (PNPT1), which is the type I interferon (alpha/beta-responsive gene). The mRNA of clone 70 was ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues. The other gene (clone 57) was the heat shock 70-kDa protein 4-like (HSPA4L), which is a member of the heat shock protein 110 family, whose mRNA is strongly expressed in normal human testis and overexpressed in leukemia cells. Seroactivity against HSPA4L was detected in 6 of 9 acute myeloid leukemia patients, 4 of 10 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, 9 of 11 CML patients, and none of 10 healthy volunteers. Leukemia patients had higher titer of the antibodies against the protein than healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HSPA4L, a member of heat shock protein, is highly expressed by leukemia cells, and elicit humoral immune responses in leukemia patients, and it might be a potential target for antileukemia therapy and an antigen-specific immunotherapy for leukemia.","['Takahashi, Hidenobu', 'Furukawa, Tatsuo', 'Yano, Toshio', 'Sato, Naoko', 'Takizawa, Jun', 'Kurasaki, Tori', 'Abe, Takashi', 'Narita, Miwako', 'Masuko, Masayoshi', 'Koyama, Satoru', 'Toba, Ken', 'Takahashi, Masuhiro', 'Aizawa, Yoshifusa']","['Takahashi H', 'Furukawa T', 'Yano T', 'Sato N', 'Takizawa J', 'Kurasaki T', 'Abe T', 'Narita M', 'Masuko M', 'Koyama S', 'Toba K', 'Takahashi M', 'Aizawa Y']","['Division of Hematology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (HSP110 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPA4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antibody Formation', 'Cell Line', 'HSP110 Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology']",2007/06/26 09:00,2007/08/03 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2005/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2007/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Jul;35(7):1091-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.03.015.,,,,"['S0301-472X(07)00198-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.03.015 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main end points were overall response rate (ORR) and toxicity; secondary end points were feasibility of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) collection, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival (OS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 42 fit elderly patients with high-dose (HD) idarubicin plus HD-cytarabine (Ara-C), with amifostine. RESULTS: We observed one treatment-related death (2%). The main extrahematological toxicity was represented by grade III to IV infections in 64% of patients. Hematological toxicity was acceptable with 15 days (range, 9-29 days) to reach >500 x 10(6)/L absolute neutrophil count and 16 days (range, 3-39 days) to achieve an unsupported platelet count >20,000 x 10(6)/L.

CONCLUSION: According to the intention to treat criteria all patients were analyzed for outcomes. Five-year OS was 19%, with median follow-up of 38 months. Patients with unfavorable cytogenetic and those with secondary AML had poorer OS; about 40% of patients could mobilize a sufficient amount of PBSC for autologous stem cell transplantation.","['Olivieri, Attilio', 'Capelli, Debora', 'Troiani, Emanuela', 'Poloni, Antonella', 'Montanari, Mauro', 'Offidani, Massimo', 'Discepoli, Giancarlo', 'Leoni, Pietro']","['Olivieri A', 'Capelli D', 'Troiani E', 'Poloni A', 'Montanari M', 'Offidani M', 'Discepoli G', 'Leoni P']","['Department of Hematology, Medical School, University of Ancona, Ancona, Italy. attilo.olivieri@ospedalesancarlo.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amifostine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/06/26 09:00,2007/08/03 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2006/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2007/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Jul;35(7):1074-82. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.03.013.,,,,"['S0301-472X(07)00196-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.03.013 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Human myeloid leukemia cells HL-60 and U937 were used. Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (Dym) was performed using 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'- tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide ( JC-1). Apoptosis and cellular nitric oxide (NO) were detected by flow cytometry using Annexin V and NO sensor dye. Superoxide anion was measured with a fluorescent plate reader by dihydroethidium (DHE). Cytotoxicity was analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay. RESULTS: 2-ME resulted in viability decrease in a dose-dependent manner. 2-ME treatment also generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), including NO and superoxide anions, which resulted in mitochondria damage. 2-ME-induced apoptosis was correlated with an increase in ROS. The quenching of ROS with N-acetyl-L-cysteine protected leukemia cells from 2-ME cytotoxicity and prevented apoptosis induction by 2-ME. Furthermore, the addition of manumycin, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, significantly enhanced apoptosis induced by 2-ME. CONCLUSION: Cellular ROS generation plays an important role in the cytotoxic effect of 2-ME. It is possible to use ROS generation agents, such as manumycin, to enhance the antileukemic effect. The combination strategy needs further in vivo justification and may have potential clinical application.","['She, Miao-rong', 'Li, Jing-gao', 'Guo, Kun-yuan', 'Lin, Wei', 'Du, Xin', 'Niu, Xin-qing']","['She MR', 'Li JG', 'Guo KY', 'Lin W', 'Du X', 'Niu XQ']","['Department of Hematology, Guangdong Provincial Peopleos Hospital, Guangzhou 510080, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '6I2QW73SR5 (2-Methoxyestradiol)', 'OIQ298X4XD (manumycin)']",IM,"['2-Methoxyestradiol', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Polyenes/pharmacology', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tubulin Modulators/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2007/06/26 09:00,2009/04/21 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2007 Jul;28(7):1037-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7254.2007.00604.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1745-7254.2007.00604.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four of the 90 transformants (4.4%) presented in blastic transformation, and 86 cases (95.5%) evolved from a well-defined chronic phase. Twenty-nine (32.2%) of the patients underwent lymphoid blastic transformation, while 28 (31.1%) were myeloid, seven (7.8%) were myelomonocytic, four (4.4%) were monocytic or erythroblastic, six (6.7%) were megakaryoblastic, ten (11.1%) were of mixed lineage, and two (2.2%) were unclassifiable. The lymphoid blast cells were uniformly common acute lymphocytic leukemia (i.e., Ia and CD10 positive), whereas the myeloid transformations were predominantly Ia negative. Mixed phenotype blasts were also predominantly Ia positive (i.e., 8 of 10), with varying positively for CD10 and myeloid/monocyctic markers. We conclude that blast crisis in chronic myeloid leukemia occurs in Saudi patients in a pattern similar to that seen in patients elsewhere, and that surface Ia antigen positivity in lymphoblast cells is a reliable marker for differentiating lymphoid from nonlymphoid crisis, in which the Ia antigen is not usually demonstrable.","['Roberts, G T', 'Padmos, M A', 'Clink, H', 'Spence, D G', 'Ernst, P', 'Sheth, K V']","['Roberts GT', 'Padmos MA', 'Clink H', 'Spence DG', 'Ernst P', 'Sheth KV']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Department of Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Ann Saudi Med,Annals of Saudi medicine,8507355,,,,1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Saudi Med. 1991 May;11(3):271-5. doi: 10.5144/0256-4947.1991.271.,,,,"['11-271 [pii]', '10.5144/0256-4947.1991.271 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All leukemic patients examined had either oral ulcerations, fungal infection, gingival enlargement, or gingival bleeding that necessitated further medical attention. This study indicated that Saudi leukemic patients desperately require better oral health care. Additional specialist dental centers staffed by appropriately trained dental personnel are urgently needed to provide oral health care for these patients.","['Gazi, M', 'Ashri, N', 'Lambourne, A']","['Gazi M', 'Ashri N', 'Lambourne A']","['Department of Preventive Dental Sciences, Divisions of Peridontics, College of Dentistry, Department of Family and Community Medicine, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Ann Saudi Med,Annals of Saudi medicine,8507355,,,,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Saudi Med. 1991 Mar;11(2):184-8. doi: 10.5144/0256-4947.1991.184.,,,,"['11-184 [pii]', '10.5144/0256-4947.1991.184 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Symptoms in mastocytosis are caused by biological mediators released from MC and/or the infiltration of neoplastic MC in various organs, the skin and the bone marrow being predominantly involved. A WHO consensus classification for mastocytosis exists, which is widely accepted and includes three major categories: (1) Cutaneous mastocytosis (CM), a benign disease in which MC infiltration is confined to the skin, is preferentially seen in young children and exhibits a marked tendency to regress spontaneously. (2) Systemic mastocytosis (SM) which is commonly diagnosed in adults and includes four major subtypes: (i) indolent SM (ISM, the most common form involving mainly skin and bone marrow); (ii) a unique subcategory termed SM with an associated non-mast cell clonal hematological disease (SM-AHNMD); (iii) aggressive SM usually presenting without skin lesions, and (iv) MC leukemia, probably representing the rarest variant of human leukemias. (3) The extremely rare localized extracutaneous MC neoplasms, either presenting as malignancy (MC sarcoma) or as benign tumor termed extracutaneous mastocytoma. Diagnostic criteria for mastocytosis are available and are widely accepted. SM criteria include one major criterion (multifocal compact tissue infiltration by MC) and four minor criteria: (1) prominent spindling of MC; (2) atypical immunophenotype of MC with coexpression of CD2 and/or CD25 (antigens which have not been found to be expressed on normal/reactive MC); (3) activating (somatic) point mutations of the c-kit proto-oncogene usually involving exon 17, with the imatinib-resistant type D816V being most frequent, and (4) persistently elevated serum tryptase level (>20 ng/ml). To establish the diagnosis of SM, at least one major and one minor criterion, or at least three minor criteria, have to be fulfilled. The natural clinical course of mastocytosis is variable. Most patients, in particular those with CM and ISM, remain in an indolent stage over many years or even decades, while others, in particular those with aggressive SM, SM-AHNMD, or mast cell leukemia, show a progressive course, usually with a fatal outcome.","['Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Sotlar, Karl', 'Valent, Peter']","['Horny HP', 'Sotlar K', 'Valent P']","['Institute of Pathology, Ansbach, Germany. horny@pathologie-ansbach.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'CD2 Antigens/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/analysis', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Mast Cells/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Mastocytosis/classification/*diagnosis/enzymology/pathology/therapy', 'Mastocytosis, Cutaneous/diagnosis/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/diagnosis/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis/genetics', 'Skin/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Tryptases/analysis', 'World Health Organization']",2007/06/26 09:00,2007/08/10 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2007;74(2):121-32. doi: 10.1159/000101711.,62,,,"['000101711 [pii]', '10.1159/000101711 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morphological examination of the bone marrow requires both bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow trephine biopsy. Immunohistochemistry of bone marrow biopsy with markers reactive in paraffin-embedded tissues represents a powerful diagnostic tool; its results can be easily correlated with those obtained by other techniques such as flow cytometry and genetic analysis, and above all, the clinical findings. The role of the bone marrow biopsy will be particularly stressed in this review article. Particular emphasis is being given to the correct identification of cases of myeloid neoplasms associated with myelofibrosis and for which the bone marrow biopsy represents the only available diagnostic mean. Moreover, the often low cellular yield of the bone marrow aspirate in these cases may also be insufficient to obtain adequate cytogenetic information. Such cases include two subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia which typically cause diagnostic difficulties: acute megakaryoblastic leukemia and acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis (acute myelosclerosis). Acute myeloid leukemia with multilineage dysplasia, therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) will also be discussed. The value of bone marrow biopsy in this group of disorders is generally well established. In MDS, in particular, bone marrow biopsy may help in confirming a suspected diagnosis by excluding reactive conditions in which dyshematopoietic changes may also be observed. It can increase the diagnostic accuracy and helps in refining the IPPS risk evaluation system. Among the alterations detected by bone marrow biopsy, a prognostically important finding is the presence of aggregates or clusters of immature myeloid precursor cells (myeloblasts and promyelocytes). These can also be identified by immunohistochemistry with CD34, an antigen expressed in progenitor and early precursor marrow cells, which can be used to demonstrate pathological accumulations of blasts in aggressive subtypes of myeloid neoplasms. Immunohistologic analysis is especially helpful in cases of MDS with fibrosis and cases with hypocellular marrows (hypoplastic MDS). In both of these variants, the presence of reticulin fibrosis or fatty changes in the bone marrow can make accurate disease characterization very difficult or impossible using bone marrow aspirates. Finally, the important group of the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorders can only be accurately categorized by a careful multiparametric approach in which the bone marrow biopsy exerts a pivotal role.","['Orazi, Attilio']",['Orazi A'],"['Indiana University School of Medicine, Division of Hematopathology, Indianapolis, IN 4622-5200, USA. aorazi@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reticulin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/classification/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/classification/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Reticulin/analysis']",2007/06/26 09:00,2007/08/10 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2007;74(2):97-114. doi: 10.1159/000101709.,59,,,"['000101709 [pii]', '10.1159/000101709 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consensus on definition and EUMNET grading.,89-96,"OBJECTIVE: Myelofibrosis (MF) implies an increase in the bone marrow (BM) fiber content without referring to quantity or quality (reticulin vs. collagen). METHODS: This review on chronic myeloproliferative disorders is based on initial and sequential BM biopsies, clinical data and follow-up examinations. A semiquantitative grading system for MF approved by a panel of experts was applied. RESULTS: In chronic myelogenous leukemia, minimal reticulin to advanced collagen MF is detectable at presentation in about 30% of patients. Significant correlations between BM and clinical features, but especially prognosis, are evident. Chronic idiopathic MF includes a prodromal stage showing no or little reticulin and no relevant MF with myeloid metaplasia (MMM). A stepwise evolution is demonstrable and associated with corresponding clinical data. Usually MMM is the diagnostic guideline for this disorder and consequently early stages with accompanying thrombocytosis may clinically mimic essential thrombocythemia. MF of various degrees may be observed in polycythemia vera depending on the progress of disease. Terminal stages (spent phase) reveal overt collagen corresponding with MMM. If diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia regards characteristic BM features, no relevant MF is seen at presentation and transformation into MMM is neglectable for many years. CONCLUSION: To recognize dynamics of the disease process in chronic myeloproliferative disorders, an easily to reproduce scoring system for MF has been proposed. The clinical diagnosis of MMM does not include initial-early reticulin MF and therefore fails to detect prodromal stages.","['Thiele, Jurgen', 'Kvasnicka, Hans M']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,"['0 (Reticulin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology', 'Collagen/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/classification/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/classification/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/pathology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/classification/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Reticulin/analysis', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*Terminology as Topic', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/pathology']",2007/06/26 09:00,2007/08/10 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2007;74(2):89-96. doi: 10.1159/000101708.,83,,,"['000101708 [pii]', '10.1159/000101708 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction of MAGE into clinical practice of leukemia diagnosis will require comprehensive assessment of variation due to the methodologies. Here we systematically assessed the impact of three different total RNA isolation procedures on variation in expression data: method A: lysis of mononuclear cells, followed by lysate homogenization and RNA extraction; method B: organic solvent based RNA isolation, and method C: organic solvent based RNA isolation followed by purification. RESULTS: We analyzed 27 pediatric acute leukemias representing nine distinct subtypes and show that method A yields better RNA quality, was associated with more differentially expressed genes between leukemia subtypes, demonstrated the lowest degree of variation between experiments, was more reproducible, and was characterized with a higher precision in technical replicates. Unsupervised and supervised analyses grouped leukemias according to lineage and clinical features in all three methods, thus underlining the robustness of MAGE to identify leukemia specific signatures. CONCLUSION: The signatures in the different subtypes of leukemias, regardless of the different extraction methods used, account for the biggest source of variation in the data. Lysis of mononuclear cells, followed by lysate homogenization and RNA extraction represents the optimum method for robust gene expression data and is thus recommended for obtaining robust classification results in microarray studies in acute leukemias.","[""Campo Dell'Orto, Marta"", 'Zangrando, Andrea', 'Trentin, Luca', 'Li, Rui', 'Liu, Wei-min', 'te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Kohlmann, Alexander']","[""Campo Dell'Orto M"", 'Zangrando A', 'Trentin L', 'Li R', 'Liu WM', 'te Kronnie G', 'Basso G', 'Kohlmann A']","['University of Padua, Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostic, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Padua, Italy. marta.campodellorto@unipd.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Solvents)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA/metabolism', '*RNA, Neoplasm', 'Solvents/chemistry']",2007/06/26 09:00,2007/09/05 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2007 Jun 22;8:188. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-8-188.,,,,"['1471-2164-8-188 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-8-188 [doi]']",,,20070622,,PMC1925098,,,,,,,,,

Focus was on studies that calculated standardized rates for individual facilities. Due to variability between study designs, eight separate analyses were performed stratified by age and zone. One hundred and thirty-six sites were used in at least one analysis. Unadjusted, fixed effects and random effects models were used. Meta-rates greater than one were found in all models at all stratification levels often achieving statistical significance. Caution must be used when interpreting these results. The meta-analysis was able to show an increase in childhood leukaemia near nuclear facilities, but does not support a hypothesis to explain the excess. Each type of model utilized has limitations. Fixed effects models give greater weight to larger studies; however, population density may be a risk factor. Random effects models give greater weight to smaller studies that may be more likely to be affected by publication bias. A limitation of the overall study design is that standardized rates must be available for individual sites which led to exclusion of studies that only calculated rates for multiple sites and those that presented other statistical methods. Further, dose-response studies do not support excess rates found near nuclear facilities.

Double transversion missense and nonsense mutations were detected in one DLBL and one adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Silent mutations were found in two DLBL. Detailed histomorphological study showed that cases harboring p53 missense mutation with/without nonsense mutation tended to have larger nuclei with much more prominent nucleoli. Cytomorphometric analysis was therefore conducted by measuring the gross area of 100 lymphoma cell nuclei in 44 cases and the results were compared between lymphomas harboring p53 missense mutation with/without nonsense mutation and lymphomas harboring p53 silent mutation or lacking mutation. It was found that the lymphomas harboring p53 missense mutation with/without nonsense mutation had a highly significantly larger nuclear gross area than lymphomas with silent p53 mutation or lacking mutation (two-sample t-test, P < 0.00001; Exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < 0.00001).

Recent evidence has shown that miRNA misexpression correlates with progression of various human cancers. Friend erythroleukemia has been used as an excellent system for the identification and characterization of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved in neoplastic transformation. Using this model, we have isolated a novel integration site designated Fli-3, from a Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)-induced erythroleukemia. The Fli-3 transcription unit is a murine homologue of the human gene C13orf25 that includes a region encoding the mir-17-92 miRNA cluster. C13orf25 is the target gene of 13q31 chromosomal amplification in human B-cell lymphomas and other malignancies. The erythroleukemias that have acquired either insertional activation or amplification of Fli-3 express higher levels of the primary or mature miRNAs derived from mir-17-92. The ectopic expression of Fli-3 in an erythroblastic cell line switches erythropoietin (Epo)-induced differentiation to Epo-induced proliferation through activation of the Ras and PI3K pathways. Such a response is associated with alteration in the expression of several regulatory factors, such as Spi-1 and p27 (Kip1). These findings highlight the potential of the Fli-3 encoding mir-17-92 in the development of erythroleukemia and its important role in hematopoiesis.","['Cui, Jiu-Wei', 'Li, You-Jun', 'Sarkar, Aloke', 'Brown, Jeremy', 'Tan, Ye-Hui', 'Premyslova, Marina', 'Michaud, Crystal', 'Iscove, Norman', 'Wang, Guan-Jun', 'Ben-David, Yaacov']","['Cui JW', 'Li YJ', 'Sarkar A', 'Brown J', 'Tan YH', 'Premyslova M', 'Michaud C', 'Iscove N', 'Wang GJ', 'Ben-David Y']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Multigene Family', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",2007/06/26 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Oct 1;110(7):2631-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-10-053850.

Central questions refer to the biological consequences of adducts and to the relationship between background DNA damage and exposure-related increments. These questions were addressed by measuring the two DNA adducts 7-methylguanine (7-mG) and O(6)-methyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (O(6)-mdGuo) by LC-MS/MS in parallel to two biological endpoints of genotoxicity (comet assay and in vitro micronucleus test), using large batches of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells treated with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The background level of 7-mG was 1440 adducts per 10(9) nucleotides while O(6)-mdGuo was almost 50-fold lower (32 adducts per 10(9) nucleotides). In the comet assay and the micronucleus test, background was in the usual range seen with smaller batches of cells (2.1% Tail DNA and 12 micronuclei-containing cells per 1000 binucleated cells, respectively). For the comparison of the four endpoints for dose-related increments above background in the low-response region we assumed linearity at low dose and used the concept of the ""doubling dose"", i.e., we estimated the concentration of MMS necessary to double the background measures. Doubling doses of 4.3 and 8.7microM MMS were deduced for 7-mG and O(6)-mdGuo, respectively. For doubling the background measures in the comet assay and the micronucleus test, 5 to 15-fold higher concentrations of MMS were necessary (45 and 66microM, respectively). This means that the contribution of an increase in DNA methylation to biological endpoints of genotoxicity is overestimated. For xenobiotics that generate adducts without background, the difference is even more pronounced because the dose-response curve starts at zero and the limit of detection of an increase is not affected by background variation. Consequences for the question of thresholds in dose-response relationships and for the setting of tolerable exposure levels are discussed.","['Brink, Andreas', 'Schulz, Berta', 'Stopper, Helga', 'Lutz, Werner K']","['Brink A', 'Schulz B', 'Stopper H', 'Lutz WK']","['Department of Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Versbacher Str. 9, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Mutagens)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '661J4K04NB (7-methylguanine)', ""964-21-6 (O(6)-methyl-2'-deoxyguanosine)"", 'AT5C31J09G (Methyl Methanesulfonate)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'DNA Adducts/analysis/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA Breaks/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Methyl Methanesulfonate/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutagens/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2007/06/26 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2007 Dec 1;625(1-2):94-101. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2007.05.007.

With optical tweezers, microgravity can be simulated in roots of the alga Chara. Surprisingly, microgravity reduces growth. In some plant cells, CW lasers, in principle suited primarily for optical tweezers, can be used as microbeam. Also, it is shown that natural killer cells mount an attack on leukemia cells even in the absence of specificity, just induced by exerting force with optical tweezers. Finally, with the help of a laser microbeam, lesions can be induced to study wound healing after heart infarction.

Erythroleukemia cells do not differentiate and grow indefinitely in the absence of erythropoietin. Activation of the transcription factor PU.1, encoded by the Sfpi-1 gene, is thought to be responsible for the transformed phenotype. These cells can overcome the blockage and reinitiate their differentiation program when exposed to some chemical inducers such as hexamethylene bisacetamide. In this study, we established cell cultures that were capable to proliferate unconstrained in the presence of the inducer. Resistant cell lines restart erythroid differentiation, though, if forced to exit the cell cycle or by overexpressing the transcription factor GATA-1.

The regulation of this balanced process is mainly achieved by polarization of the stem cell along its apical-basal axis and the basal localization and asymmetric segregation of cell fate determinants solely to the differentiating cell. It has long been speculated that disturbance of this process can induce a cancer-like state. Recent molecular genetic evidence in Drosophila melanogaster suggests that impaired polarity formation in neuroblast stem cells results in symmetric stem cell divisions, whereas defects in progenitor cell differentiation leads to mutant cells that are unable to differentiate but rather continue to proliferate. In both cases, the net result is unrestrained self-renewal of mutant stem cells, eventually leading to hyperproliferation and malignant neoplastic tissue formation. Thus, deregulated stem cells can play a pivotal role in Drosophila tumor formation. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that so-called cancer stem cells may drive the growth and metastasis of human tumors too. Indeed, cancer stem cells have already been identified in leukemia, and in solid tumors of the breast and brain. In addition, inappropriate activation of pathways promoting the self-renewal of somatic stem cells including defects in asymmetric cell division has been shown to cause neoplastic proliferation and cancer formation. Taken together, these data indicate that evolutionary conserved mechanisms regulate stem and progenitor cell self-renewal and tumor suppression via asymmetric cell division control.","['Caussinus, Emmanuel', 'Hirth, Frank']","['Caussinus E', 'Hirth F']","['Division of Cell Biology, Biozemtrum, University of Basel, Klingelbergstrasse 50/70, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland. emmanuel.caussinus@unibas.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Prog Mol Subcell Biol,Progress in molecular and subcellular biology,0233223,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology']",2007/06/26 09:00,2007/08/29 09:00,['2007/06/26 09:00'],"['2007/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prog Mol Subcell Biol. 2007;45:205-25. doi: 10.1007/978-3-540-69161-7_9.,60,,['G0701498/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],['10.1007/978-3-540-69161-7_9 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their early development in fetal liver is largely unknown. To characterize fetal HpSTCs in the liver, in which hepatic development and hematopoiesis occur in parallel, we determined the phenotypic characteristics of HpSTCs from rat fetal livers, using a strategy focused on vitamin A. Storage of vitamin A in the cytoplasm is a unique characteristic of HpSTCs, permitting identification of them by vitamin A-specific autofluorescence (vA+) when excited with UV light using flow cytometry. A characteristic vA+ cell population was identified in liver as early as 13 days post coitum; it had a surface phenotype of RT1A- intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1+ vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1+ beta3-integrin+. Although nonspecific autofluorescent cells were found with the antigenic profile of RT1A- ICAM-1+ VCAM-1+, they were beta3-integrin- and proved to be hepatoblasts, bipotent hepatic parenchymal progenitors. In addition to expression of classic HpSTC markers, the vA+ cells were able to proliferate continuously in a serum-free hormonally defined medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor, which was found to be a key factor for their replication. These results demonstrated that the vA+ cells are fetal HpSTCs with extensive proliferative activity. Furthermore, the vA+ cells strongly express hepatocyte growth factor, stromal-derived factor-1alpha, and Hlx (homeobox transcription factor), indicating that they play important roles for hepatic development and hematopoiesis. The abilities to isolate and expand fetal HpSTCs enable further investigation into their roles in early liver development and facilitate identification of possibly novel signals of potential relevance for liver diseases.","['Kubota, Hiroshi', 'Yao, Hsin-lei', 'Reid, Lola M']","['Kubota H', 'Yao HL', 'Reid LM']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Physiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA. hiroshi@vmas.kitasato-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (histocompatibility antigens RT, rat)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/cytology', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary/*physiology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/metabolism', 'Integrin beta3/metabolism', 'Liver/blood supply/*cytology/*embryology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Organogenesis/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Vitamin A/*metabolism']",2007/06/23 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/06/23 09:00'],"['2007/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2007 Sep;25(9):2339-49. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2006-0316.

Because infection by viruses, such as human T-cell leukemia virus type I and Epstein-Barr virus, induces expression of the redox-regulating molecule, thioredoxin (TRX), we hypothesized that neurotropin would also be capable of regulating the redox balance and could be applied for the therapeutics of lung diseases caused by oxidative stress, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Neurotropin enhanced mRNA expression of the redox-regulating molecules, glutathione peroxidase and catalase and, particularly, TRX, in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Neurotropin also increased the cellular TRX content and regulated TRX release from cells. The cytoprotective effects of neurotropin against hydrogen peroxide and cigarette smoke extracts was demonstrated by an attenuation of lactate dehydrogenase release from oxidant-exposed A549 cells and the inhibition of apoptosis. This cytoprotection was linked with reduced activity of intracellular oxidants. Furthermore, neurotropin enhanced TRX expression in mouse lungs and ameliorated cigarette smoke-induced lung injury in mice, suggesting that its cytoprotective effects in lung epithelial cells are mediated through the induction of redox-regulating molecules that reduce intracellular oxidative activity.","['Hoshino, Yuma', 'Nakamura, Takayuki', 'Sato, Atsuyasu', 'Mishima, Michiaki', 'Yodoi, Junji', 'Nakamura, Hajime']","['Hoshino Y', 'Nakamura T', 'Sato A', 'Mishima M', 'Yodoi J', 'Nakamura H']","['Thioredoxin Project, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Translational Research Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan. yuma@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (Analgesics)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (TXN protein, human)', '0 (Txn1 protein, mouse)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '57657-35-9 (neurotropin)']",IM,"['Analgesics/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoprotection/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Polysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Thioredoxins/*metabolism']",2007/06/23 09:00,2007/11/01 09:00,['2007/06/23 09:00'],"['2007/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2007 Oct;37(4):438-46. doi: 10.1165/rcmb.2006-0402OC.

Chromosomal rearrangements are common in these hematopoietic diseases. Translocation t(14;18), the long-arm deletion of chromosome 6 [del(6q)], and trisomy 12 are frequently observed in lymphoma patients. Rearrangements of the MLL gene located on chromosome 11q23, such as t(4;11) and t(6;11), are common in therapy-related leukemias resulting from treatment with topoisomerase II inhibiting drugs. To examine numerical and structural changes in these chromosomes (2, 4, 6, 11, 12, 14, and 18), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was employed on metaphase spreads from workers exposed to benzene (n = 43) and matched controls (n = 44) from Shanghai, China. Aneuploidy (both monosomy and trisomy) of all seven chromosomes was increased by benzene exposure. Benzene also induced del(6q) in a dose-dependent manner (P(trend) = 0.0002). Interestingly, translocations between chromosomes 14 and 18, t(14;18), known to be associated with follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma, were increased in the highly exposed workers (P < 0.001). On the other hand, translocations between chromosome 11 and other partner chromosomes that are found in therapy-induced leukemias were not increased. These data add weight to the notion that benzene can induce t(14;18) and del(6q) found in lymphoma, but do not support the idea that benzene induces t(4;11) or t(6;11).

Importantly, mutations of the Notch protein and components of its signaling pathway have been implicated in an array of human diseases (T-cell leukemia and other cancers, Multiple Sclerosis, CADASIL, Alagille Syndrome, Spondylocostal Dysostosis). In mammals, Notch becomes activated upon binding of its extracellular domain to ligands (Delta and Jagged/Serrate) that are present on the surface of apposed cells. The extracellular domain of Notch contains up to 36 tandem Epidermal Growth Factor-like (EGF) repeats. Many of these EGF repeats are modified at evolutionarily-conserved consensus sites by an unusual form of O-glycosylation called O-fucose. Work from several groups indicates that O-fucosylation plays an important role in ligand mediated Notch signaling. Recent evidence also suggests that the enzyme responsible for addition of O-fucose to Notch, protein O-fucosyltransferase-1 (POFUT1), may serve a quality control function in the endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, some of the O-fucose moieties are further elongated by the action of members of the Fringe family of beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases. The alteration in O-fucose saccharide structure caused by Fringe modulates the response of Notch to its ligands. Thus, glycosylation serves an important role in regulating Notch activity. This review focuses on the role of glycosylation in the normal functioning of the Notch pathway. As well, potential roles for glycosylation in Notch-related human diseases, and possible roles for therapeutic targeting of POFUT1 and Fringe in Notch-related human diseases, are discussed.","['Rampal, Raajit', 'Luther, Kelvin B', 'Haltiwanger, Robert S']","['Rampal R', 'Luther KB', 'Haltiwanger RS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Institute for Cell and Developmental Biology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, 11794-5215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Curr Mol Med,Current molecular medicine,101093076,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG1 protein, human)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)', '0 (delta protein)', '28RYY2IV3F (Fucose)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)']",IM,"['Alagille Syndrome/*enzymology/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'CADASIL/*enzymology/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/enzymology/pathology', 'Fucose/genetics/metabolism', 'Fucosyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*enzymology/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein Modification, Translational', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', '*Signal Transduction/genetics']",2007/06/23 09:00,2007/09/20 09:00,['2007/06/23 09:00'],"['2007/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Mol Med. 2007 Jun;7(4):427-45. doi: 10.2174/156652407780831593.,,,"['R01 GM061126/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008444/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM61126/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['10.2174/156652407780831593 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historically, the murine system has been central to modeling human leukemia in vivo. A greater knowledge of the molecular lesions underlying particular subtypes of leukemia has led to the generation of genetically engineered murine models, generally involving the knockin or knockout of certain genes and fusion genes at their normal genetic locus. However, the most predominant in vivo models for preclinical drug testing have been human leukemia xenografts. Successful engraftment of all subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, most subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia as well as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been described in various immune-deficient murine hosts.

To speed research and decrease costs, there is increasing interest in moving new drugs into clinical trials in potentially active combinations based upon pre-clinical testing data. Because testing drug combinations in animals is expensive and complex, defining drug combinations initially in cell culture assays is essential. For in vitro testing we employ a panel of well-characterized cell lines and DIMSCAN, a semi-automatic fluorescence-based digital image microscopy system that quantifies relative total (using a DNA stain) or viable [using fluorescein diacetate (FDA)] cell numbers in tissue culture multi-well-plates ranging from 6 to 384 wells per plate. DIMSCAN is a rapid and efficient tool for conducting in vitro cytotoxicity assays across a 4 log dynamic range. The specificity of detecting viable cells with FDA is achieved by use of digital image processing and chemical quenching of fluorescence in non-viable cells with eosin Y. Cytotoxicity measured by DIMSCAN was found to be comparable to manual trypan blue dye exclusion counts or colony formation in soft agar, but with a significantly wider dynamic range, that enables drug combination studies used to detect synergistic or antagonistic interactions in cell lines from both solid tumors and leukemias. While different mathematical models have been proposed for evaluating drug interactions, which can be classified as synergistic (combinations demonstrating greater than the additive activity expected from each agent alone), additive, or antagonistic (drugs showing less activity in combination than expected from the sum of each agent alone), we generally find the Combination Index method (as developed by Chou, et al.) to be the most suitable for evaluating of drug interactions in cell culture assays.","['Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Kang, Min H', 'Keshelava, Nino', 'Maurer, Barry J']","['Reynolds CP', 'Kang MH', 'Keshelava N', 'Maurer BJ']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Institute for Pediatric Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California and Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. preynolds@chla.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Microcomputers', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/06/23 09:00,2007/07/20 09:00,['2007/06/23 09:00'],"['2007/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2007 Jun;8(6):765-71. doi: 10.2174/138945007780830845.,,,"['CA100895/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81403/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82830/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.2174/138945007780830845 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such agents include signal transduction, cell cycle, histone deacetylase, Hsp90, proteasome, and Bcl-2 family member inhibitors, among others. While most of these agents have been or are currently being evaluated in adult patients with acute leukemia, experience in childhood leukemia is very limited. Although the use of such targeted agents as potentiators of conventional cytotoxic agent activity represents a logical approach, an emerging body of evidence suggests that neoplastic cells in general, and leukemic cells in particular, are highly susceptible to a therapeutic strategy in which survival signaling and cell cycle regulatory pathways are simultaneously disrupted. In in vitro studies, highly synergistic antileukemic interactions have been reported between CDK and HDAC inhibitors; HDAC and proteasome inhibitors; Bcl-2 antagonists and CDK inhibitors; MEK/ERK and Chk1 inhibitors, and proteasome and CDK inhibitors, among other combinations. Some of these strategies, including combinations of HDAC and CDK inhibitors, and CDK and proteasome inhibitors, have now entered the clinical arena in patients with leukemia and other hematologic malignancies. Based upon preclinical results to date, there is reason to suspect that such strategies might prove to be active against several types of childhood leukemia.

To substantially expand the limited data on diagnostic accuracy and completeness for lymphoproliferative (LP) tumors in such databases, we conducted a retrospective investigation of close to 1,000 cases diagnosed during 4 decades in Sweden. We identified and reviewed medical records for 494 LP tumor patients reported to the population-based Swedish Cancer registry and 503 LP tumor patients identified from hospitals in Sweden among patients with LP tumors diagnosed during 1964-2003. The stratified samples were randomly selected from patients according to LP subtype, over 4 equal calendar periods, and among 6 selected hospitals of diverse size and from different geographic regions. We found 97.9% of reported LP tumor cases to fulfill current diagnostic criteria for having an LP tumor and observed 89.7% to have accurate LP tumor subtype. The overall completeness of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma cases in the Cancer registry was 95-99% but was lower for the more indolent tumors, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (87.9%) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (68.1%). We observed increased overall under-ascertainment for patients diagnosed above age 80 (27%) and among individuals diagnosed before 1973 (12%). In conclusion the diagnostic accuracy and completeness for classically defined LP tumor entities in the Swedish Cancer registry is high. However, we found under-ascertainment of patients with indolent LP tumors, particularly among patients diagnosed at older ages, with early-stage disease and diagnosed in earlier years.","['Turesson, Ingemar', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Kristinsson, Sigurdur Y', 'Goldin, Lynn R', 'Caporaso, Neil E', 'Landgren, Ola']","['Turesson I', 'Linet MS', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Kristinsson SY', 'Goldin LR', 'Caporaso NE', 'Landgren O']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Malmo University Hospital, University of Lund, Malmo, Sweden. ingemar.turesson@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",2007/06/23 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/06/23 09:00'],"['2007/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 Nov 15;121(10):2260-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22912.,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1002/ijc.22912 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

We report here that the seco-steroid synthesized to have resistance to intracellular degradation and low calcemia-inducing activity, 1alpha-hydroxymethyl-3beta-16-ene-24,24-difluoro-25-hydroxy-vitamin D(3) (JKF), induces monocytic differentiation in four established human myeloid leukemia cell lines, HL60, U937, THP-1, NB-4, and murine myeloid leukemia cells WEHI-3B D(-). JKF has differentiation-inducing potency which is slightly lower than the physiologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)(2)vitamin D(3) (1,25D). However, simultaneous addition of carnosic acid (CA), an antioxidant, and SB20190 (SB), an inhibitor of p38MAP kinase, increases the differentiation efficiency of JKF to a level similar to the level observed when 1,25D is used in such combinations. We also show for the first time that SB inhibits the phosphorylation of MAPKAPK2, a downstream target of p38MAPK, but upregulates the phosphorylation of at least one of the isoforms of JNK (p46 JNK1) and of c-jun in all four human myeloid cell lines studied here. These studies indicate that the JNK1 pathway is positively associated with monocytic differentiation of several subtypes of myeloid leukemia cells arrested at different developmental stages. Further, since JKF is less calcemic than 1,25D, the data suggest that JKF combined with CA and SB is likely to have a therapeutic advantage over 1,25D-based experimental regimens for myeloid leukemias.","['Zhang, Jing', 'Posner, Gary H', 'Danilenko, Michael', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Zhang J', 'Posner GH', 'Danilenko M', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (JK 1624F2-1)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Pyridines)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '66772-14-3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Vitamin D/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2007/06/23 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/06/23 09:00'],"['2006/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2007 Jun-Jul;105(1-5):140-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2007.01.003.

In the United Kingdom the proportion of people aged 50 and over has increased by 45% since 1951 and this proportion is set to increase by a further 36% by the year 2031, so the United Kingdom does indeed have an expanding ageing population. However, the increase in cancer incidence affects people across the whole age spectrum. To test the hypothesis that the age of onset of cancer (overall and specific) in England and Wales is decreasing over time we have developed The Cancer Incidence Temporality Index (CITI), which gives a crude measurement of the portion of the population, in which cancer incidence is rising fastest over time: I=(SigmaO(a)/ SigmaE(a))/(SigmaO(a)/SigmaE(a)), where I is the CITI value, O is the observed number of cases and E is the expected number of cases; 'a' and 'b' refer to separate summation ranges for younger and older age groups. Population data and cancer incidence data in England and Wales, 1971-1999 were obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics. The trends in CITI values have been shown graphically for cancer overall and for specific tumour sites. The impact of diagnostic testing is also addressed. The results of this study suggest that the average age of onset of prostate, breast and cervical cancer is temporally decreasing. The study also suggests that for cancer overall the trend for the age of onset of cancer in males has stabilised since 1990 and has started to reverse in females from 1995 despite the expanding ageing population. A similar trend is observed for leukaemias. The CITI analysis for colon cancer shows that the age of onset in both males and females is increasing over time. The trend for ovarian cancer is similar to that for colon cancer. The CITI analysis for NHL in males is similar to that for colon cancer, however, in females the trend stabilised after 1990. The CITI may aid prediction of changes in the age of onset of cancer and thus aid targeted aetiological research. In addition, we suggest the need for a mathematical model, which may measure the changes in the age of onset of cancer in units of time.","['Newby, J A', 'Busby, C C', 'Howard, C V', 'Platt, M J']","['Newby JA', 'Busby CC', 'Howard CV', 'Platt MJ']","['Developmental Toxico-Pathology Research Group, Department of Human Anatomy and Cell Biology, The University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GE, UK. jackan@liverpool.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Population', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Sex Factors', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Wales/epidemiology']",2007/06/22 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2007/06/22 09:00'],"['2007/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2007 Dec;61(10):623-30. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2007.05.002.

Firstly, low dose, continuous use of 13-cisRA has been shown to provide limited or no clinical benefit in neuroblastoma patients, whereas a high-dose, intermittent regimen resulted in a significant improvement in event-free survival. This suggests that dose levels and therefore plasma concentrations of drug are important determinants of 13-cisRA efficacy. Secondly, the currently used 13-cisRA dosing regimen of 160 mg/m(2)/day results in a >10-fold variation in plasma concentrations, with plasma concentrations observed in a significant percentage of patients below those required for activity in neuroblastoma cells in vitro. Importantly, there would appear to be limited intra-patient variation in 13-cisRA plasma concentrations, i.e. those patients with lower 13-cisRA plasma concentrations following a single dose of 13-cisRA are likely to have similarly low concentrations following all doses of 13-cisRA on subsequent courses. As 13-cisRA is given as chronic treatment, those patients experiencing lower plasma concentrations on the current dosing regimen will potentially be exposed to sub-therapeutic concentrations of drug for the entire 6 month treatment period. While this type of pharmacokinetic monitoring approach may prove to be beneficial in the short term, an increased knowledge of pharmacogenetic factors influencing to the metabolism of 13-cisRA may ultimately allow us to identify patients who may be less likely to benefit from treatment due to an increased rate of parent drug metabolism. In this respect, pharmacogenetic studies assessing the relative expression levels or mutations in enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) and particularly CYP26 are needed to assess any potential association with rate of metabolism in vivo.","['Veal, Gareth', 'Rowbotham, Sophie', 'Boddy, Alan']","['Veal G', 'Rowbotham S', 'Boddy A']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Framington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Therapie,Therapie,0420544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Pharmacogenetics']",2007/06/22 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/06/22 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Therapie. 2007 Mar-Apr;62(2):91-3. doi: 10.2515/therapie:2007020.

METHODS: The clinical data of children with newly diagnosed leukemia from hospitals of various cities or counties of Hunan Province between 2002 and 2005 were collected and reviewed. RESULTS: There were 803 children with leukemia during 2002-2005. Acute lymphoid leukemia was most commonly seen (597/803, 74.35%), followed by acute non-lymphoid leukemia (192/803, 23.91%) and chronic myelocytic leukemia (14/803, 1.74%). There were no significant differences in the clinical type and the prevalence of leukemia between males and females. The prevalence of newly diagnosed childhood leukemia in the urban area was noticeably higher than that in the rural area (2.02/10(5) vs 1.50/10(5), P < 0.05). 41.79% of children with newly diagnosed leukemia from the urban area received treatments but only 22.80% of patients from the rural area received treatments (P < 0.05).

Analogous to B-cell lymphomas, in which the immunoglobulin (IgH) receptor loci are frequently targeted by chromosomal translocations, the T-cell receptor (TCR) gene loci are affected by translocations in a subset of precursor T-cell malignancies. In a large-scale analysis of 245 paraffin-embedded mature T-NHLs, arranged in a tissue microarray format and using improved FISH assays for the detection of breakpoints in the TCRalpha/delta, TCRbeta, and TCRgamma loci, we provide evidence that mature T-NHLs other than T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) also occasionally show a chromosomal rearrangement that involves the TCRalpha/delta locus. In particular, one peripheral T-cell lymphoma (not otherwise specified, NOS) with the morphological variant of Lennert lymphoma displayed a chromosomal translocation t(14;19) involving the TCRalpha/delta and the BCL3 loci. A second case, an angio-immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AILT), carried an inv(14)(q11q32) affecting the TCRalpha/delta and IgH loci.

However, the biological functions and contributions to cancer progression of survivin splice variants are controversially discussed. We here show that the intracellular localization of these splice variants depends on a Crm1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES) present in survivin, surviving(-2B) and survivin(-3B), but absent in survivin(-deltaEx3) and survivin(-2alpha). Survivin isoforms lack an active nuclear import signal and are able to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion. Only survivin(-3B) but none of the other splice variants is cytoprotective and able to efficiently interact with chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) proteins. The NES together with efficient CPC formation is required for the cytoprotective activity of survivin isoforms, as well as for their correct localization and function during cell division. In the tumours from breast, colorectal, head and neck cancer, lymphoma and leukemia patients, survivin and survivin(-2B) were found overexpressed. However, survivin was the predominant form detected, and the other survivin isoforms were only expressed at low levels in tumours. Our data provide a molecular rationale for the localization and activity of survivin variants, and conclude that survivin isoforms are unlikely to modulate survivin in trans in cancer patients.","['Knauer, Shirley K', 'Bier, Carolin', 'Schlag, Peter', 'Fritzmann, Johannes', 'Dietmaier, Wolfgang', 'Rodel, Franz', 'Klein-Hitpass, Ludger', 'Kovacs, Adorian F', 'Doring, Claudia', 'Hansmann, Martin-Leo', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Kunkel, Martin', 'Brochhausen, Christoph', 'Engels, Knut', 'Lippert, Burkhard M', 'Mann, Wolf', 'Stauber, Roland H']","['Knauer SK', 'Bier C', 'Schlag P', 'Fritzmann J', 'Dietmaier W', 'Rodel F', 'Klein-Hitpass L', 'Kovacs AF', 'Doring C', 'Hansmann ML', 'Hofmann WK', 'Kunkel M', 'Brochhausen C', 'Engels K', 'Lippert BM', 'Mann W', 'Stauber RH']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, University Hospital of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Export Signals)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Survivin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Y031I2N1EO (leptomycin B)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*metabolism', 'Cisplatin', 'Cytoprotection/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Export Signals/*genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survivin']",2007/06/22 09:00,2008/01/25 09:00,['2007/06/22 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Jun 15;6(12):1502-9.

Here, we demonstrate that p12(I) inhibits the phosphorylation of LAT, Vav, and phospholipase C-gamma 1 and decreases NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) activation upon engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with anti-CD3 antibody. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p12(I) localizes to membrane lipid rafts and, upon engagement of the TCR, relocalizes to the interface between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, defined as the immunological synapse. A p12(I) knockout molecular clone of HTLV-1 expresses more virus upon antigen stimulation than the isogenic wild type, suggesting that, by decreasing T-cell responsiveness, p12(I) curtails viral expression. Thus, p12(I) has contrasting effects on TCR signaling: it down-regulates TCR in a LAT-dependent manner on one hand, and on the other, it increases calcium release in a LAT-independent manner. The negative regulation of T-cell activation by p12(I) may have evolved to minimize immune recognition of infected CD4(+) T cells, to impair the function of infected cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, and to favor viral persistence in the infected host.","['Fukumoto, Risaku', 'Dundr, Miroslav', 'Nicot, Christophe', 'Adams, Anthony', 'Valeri, Valerio W', 'Samelson, Lawrence E', 'Franchini, Genoveffa']","['Fukumoto R', 'Dundr M', 'Nicot C', 'Adams A', 'Valeri VW', 'Samelson LE', 'Franchini G']","['Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-5065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (LAT protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (p12I protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Phospholipase C gamma/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins']",2007/06/22 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/06/22 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Sep;81(17):9088-99. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02703-06.

We screened a random peptide library within the receptor-binding domain of a feline leukemia virus retroviral Envelope (FeLV Env) protein for productive infection of feline AH927 cells. One variant, A5, obtained with altered tropic properties acquired the ability to use the solute carrier protein family 35 member F2 (SLC35F2) as a receptor. The SLC35F2 protein is a presumed transporter of unknown function predicted to encode 8 to 10 transmembrane-spanning regions and is not homologous to any identified retroviral receptor. Expression of the feline SLC35F2 cDNA in nonpermissive cells renders the cells susceptible to infection by A5 virus, with remarkably high titers in the range of 10(5) infectious units per ml. The human SLC35F2 ORF also functioned as the retroviral receptor, albeit at lower efficiency than the feline homologue. The successful selection of a novel molecule, the SLC35F2 transporter/channel-type protein, as a receptor by the FeLV Env backbone suggests that multipass transmembrane proteins may be particularly suited for use in productive viral entry and fusion. The analysis of retroviral Env libraries randomized in the receptor-binding domain offers a viable means to develop viral vectors targeted to specific cell types in the absence of known targeting ligands.","['Sarangi, Anindita', 'Bupp, Keith', 'Roth, Monica J']","['Sarangi A', 'Bupp K', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SLC35F2 protein, human)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*pathogenicity', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Peptide Library', 'Receptors, Virus/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Retroviridae', 'Retroviridae Infections/etiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/etiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism/*physiology']",2007/06/22 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/06/22 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jun 26;104(26):11032-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0704182104.

Recent studies uncovered specific miRNA expression profiles in human malignancies. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying cancer-specific miRNA expression are largely unknown. miRNA biogenesis consists of a series of steps beginning with generation of a primary transcript, termed pri-miRNA, and continuing into excision of a stem-loop hairpin structure within pri-miRNA by the nuclear RNaseIII enzyme Drosha, transportation to the cytoplasm, and further processing by a second RNaseIII enzyme Dicer, into a 22-base mature duplex RNA. In principle, alteration in any step during this maturation process could affect miRNA production. The ALL-1 (also termed MLL) gene was originally isolated by virtue of its involvement in recurrent chromosome translocations associated with acute leukemias, particularly in infant and therapy-related leukemias. These translocations result in the fusion of ALL-1 with partner genes and the consequent production of chimeric leukemogenic proteins. Here, we identify specific miRNAs up-regulated in leukemias triggered by All1 fusions. Further, we demonstrate coimmunoprecipitation of the All1/Af4 and All1/Af9 fusions with Drosha, disrupted by treatment with DNase I. Finally, we present evidence from ChIP experiments for All1 fusion protein-mediated recruitment of Drosha to target genes encoding miRNAs. Such recruitment may underlie the enhanced expression of the relevant miRNAs.","['Nakamura, Tatsuya', 'Canaani, Eli', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Nakamura T', 'Canaani E', 'Croce CM']","['*Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (ALL1-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (DROSHA protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (Ribonuclease III)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Ribonuclease III/metabolism/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/06/22 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/06/22 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jun 26;104(26):10980-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0704559104.

In the present investigation, we analyzed the inhibitory effects of ART on angiogenesis and on VEGF production in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562 cells in vitro and in vivo. In order to analyze the effect of ART on VEGF secretion in K562 cells, we examined the level of VEGF secreted in conditioned media (CM) by ELISA assay. The result showed that ART could decrease the VEGF level in CM of K562 cells, even at a lower concentration (2 micromol/l, P<0.01). The inhibitory effect of in vitro angiogenesis was tested on aortic sprouting in fibrin gel. ART could effectively suppress the stimulating angiogenic ability of CM by pretreated with K562 cells for 48 h in a time-dependent manner (days 3-14). The antiangiogenic effect of ART was further evaluated in vivo in chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) neovascularization model. The result indicated that the stimulating angiogenic activity was decreased in response to the K562 cells treated with ART or the CM from K562 cells pretreated with ART in a dose-dependent manner (3-12 micromol/l). Furthermore, we analyzed the level of VEGF expression by western blot and detected the form of VEGF mRNA by RT-PCR in K562 cells. The experiments showed that ART could inhibit the VEGF expression, correlated well with the level of VEGF secreted in CM.

The particular characteristics of this malignancy diagnosed during the first months of life have provided remarkable insights into the etiology of the disease. The pro-B, CD10 negative immunophenotype is typically found in infant acute leukemia, and the most common genetic alterations are the rearrangements of the MLL gene. In addition, the TEL/AML1 fusion gene is most frequently found in children older than 24 months. A molecular study on a Brazilian cohort (age range 0-23 months) has detected TEL/AML1+ve (N = 9), E2A/PBX1+ve (N = 4), PML/RARA+ve (N = 4), and AML1/ETO+ve (N = 2) cases. Undoubtedly, the great majority of genetic events occurring in these patients arise prenatally. The environmental exposure to damaging agents that give rise to genetic changes prenatally may be accurately determined in infants since the window of exposure is limited and known. Several studies have shown maternal exposures that may give rise to leukemogenic changes. The Brazilian Collaborative Study Group of Infant Acute Leukemia has found that mothers exposed to dipyrone, pesticides and hormones had an increased chance to give birth to babies with infant acute leukemia [OR = 1.48 (95%CI = 1.05-2.07), OR = 2.27 (95%CI = 1.56-3.31) and OR = 9.08 (95%CI = 2.95-27.96)], respectively. This review aims to summarize recent clues that have facilitated the elucidation of the biology of early childhood leukemias, with emphasis on infant acute leukemia in the Brazilian population.","['Emerenciano, M', 'Koifman, S', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, M S']","['Emerenciano M', 'Koifman S', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Divisao de Medicina Experimental, Centro de Pesquisa, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/etiology/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects']",2007/06/22 09:00,2008/02/07 09:00,['2007/06/22 09:00'],"['2006/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2007 Jun;40(6):749-60. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2007000600002.,60,,,"['S0100-879X2007000600002 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2007000600002 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given its increasing use as initial therapy, we examined if lenalidomide had any impact on the ability to collect peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). We studied the entire cohort of patients with myeloma undergoing PBSC mobilization at our institution during a 5-year period, comparing the results between patients receiving different initial therapies. Among those mobilized with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone, there was a significant decrease in total CD34(+) cells collected (P<0.001), average daily collection (P<0.001), day 1 collection (P<0.001) and increased number of aphereses (P=0.004) in patients treated with lenalidomide compared to those receiving dexamethasone, thalidomide-dexamethasone or VAD. A similar trend was seen in those mobilized with chemotherapy and G-CSF. A trend was seen towards decreased PBSC yield with increasing duration of lenalidomide therapy as well as increasing age (P=0.002). There was no effect on quality of PBSC collected based on similar engraftment across all groups. We recommend collection of PBSC within 6 months of initiation of therapy with lenalidomide containing regimens to minimize the risk of mobilization failures.","['Kumar, S', 'Dispenzieri, A', 'Lacy, M Q', 'Hayman, S R', 'Buadi, F K', 'Gastineau, D A', 'Litzow, M R', 'Fonseca, R', 'Roy, V', 'Rajkumar, S V', 'Gertz, M A']","['Kumar S', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Lacy MQ', 'Hayman SR', 'Buadi FK', 'Gastineau DA', 'Litzow MR', 'Fonseca R', 'Roy V', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Gertz MA']","['Divisions of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. kumar.shaji@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'VAD protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2007/06/22 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/06/22 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Sep;21(9):2035-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404801.

The purpose of this study was to examine the molecular and functional effects of proteasome inhibition in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, we aimed to compare the outcome of proteasome versus selective NF-kappaB inhibition using bortezomib (PS-341) and I-kappaB kinase inhibitor PS-1145. Primary human osteoclasts were derived from CD14+ precursors in presence of RANKL and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Both bortezomib and PS-1145 inhibited osteoclast differentiation in a dose- and time-dependent manner and furthermore, the bone resorption activity of osteoclasts. The mechanisms of action involved in early osteoclast differentiation were found to be related to the inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, whereas the later phase of differentiation and activation occurred due to inhibition of p38, AP-1 and NF-kappaB activation. The AP-1 blockade contributed to significant reduction of osteoclastic vascular endothelial growth factor production. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that proteasomal inhibition should be considered as a novel therapeutic option of cancer-induced lytic bone disease.","['von Metzler, I', 'Krebbel, H', 'Hecht, M', 'Manz, R A', 'Fleissner, C', 'Mieth, M', 'Kaiser, M', 'Jakob, C', 'Sterz, J', 'Kleeberg, L', 'Heider, U', 'Sezer, O']","['von Metzler I', 'Krebbel H', 'Hecht M', 'Manz RA', 'Fleissner C', 'Mieth M', 'Kaiser M', 'Jakob C', 'Sterz J', 'Kleeberg L', 'Heider U', 'Sezer O']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, and Deutsches Rheumaforschungszentrum, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (PS1145)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF11 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Resorption/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Female', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'RANK Ligand/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2007/06/22 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/06/22 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Sep;21(9):2025-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404806.

Therefore, the role of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signaling in growth and survival of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells was investigated. Expression of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and its ligand IGF-I were detected in a panel of human AML blasts and cell lines. IGF-I and insulin promoted the growth of human AML blasts in vitro and activated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathways. IGF-I-stimulated growth of AML blasts was blocked by an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, downregulation of the class Ia PI3K isoforms p110beta and p110delta by RNA interference impaired IGF-I-stimulated Akt activation, cell growth and survival in AML cells. Proliferation of a panel of AML cell lines and blasts isolated from patients with AML was inhibited by the IGF-IR kinase inhibitor NVP-AEW541 or by an IGF-IR neutralizing antibody. In addition to its antiproliferative effects, NVP-AEW541 sensitized primary AML blasts and cell lines to etoposide-induced apoptosis. Together, our data describe a novel role for autocrine IGF-I signaling in the growth and survival of primary AML cells. IGF-IR inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutic agents may represent a novel approach to target human AML.","['Doepfner, K T', 'Spertini, O', 'Arcaro, A']","['Doepfner KT', 'Spertini O', 'Arcaro A']","[""Division of Clinical Chemistry and Biochemistry, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2007/06/22 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/06/22 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Sep;21(9):1921-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404813.

The study included 32 leukaemia patients, 19 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 13 with acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), and 11 normal individuals (control group). Basic investigations for the diagnosis of AML and ALL were performed, including blood picture, bone marrow aspirate, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping for detection of subtypes. Detection of CYP2D6, NQO1, GSTM1 and GSTT1 genetic polymorphisms used a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. A follow-up was made for association between the outcome of patients and different patterns of genetic polymorphisms. Results demonstrate a significant increase in the frequency of CYP2D6 wild-type and GSTM1 null genotypes in the acute leukaemia group compared with the control. Studying the relationship between polymorphisms of these genes and the outcome of our cases revealed the wild genotype of CYP2D6 significantly influenced the outcome of acute leukaemia particularly in AML cases, while GSTM1 null genotype was associated with bad prognosis among the ALL group. The study also revealed that patients with combined mutant CYP2D6/present GSTM1/present GSTT1 achieved the best prognosis, suggesting synergistic impact of these genetic polymorphisms on the outcome of acute leukaemia cases. This case-control study suggests a contribution of CYP2D6 and GSTM1 null variants in the development of acute leukaemia. In addition, GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes were apparently related to response, side effects and prognosis of patients with AML.","['Eyada, Tayseer K', 'El Ghonemy, Ehsan G', 'El Ghoroury, Eman A', 'El Bassyouni, Soheir O', 'El Masry, Mahmoud K']","['Eyada TK', 'El Ghonemy EG', 'El Ghoroury EA', 'El Bassyouni SO', 'El Masry MK']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,"['EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/enzymology/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/enzymology/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",2007/06/22 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/06/22 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2007 Jul;18(5):489-95. doi: 10.1097/MBC.0b013e3281eec930.,,,,"['10.1097/MBC.0b013e3281eec930 [doi]', '00001721-200707000-00015 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In principle, patients without matched sibling donors and older patients might benefit from transplantation of autologous hematopoietic peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) obtained during remission. Even patients who have clinically recovered from aplastic anemia have diminished hematopoietic progenitor cells, so the practicability of PBPC mobilization in these individuals is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The feasibility of PBPC mobilization in nine patients with a history of sAA was evaluated. Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (10 microg/kg) was administered subcutaneously for 5 days and followed by a 12-L leukapheresis procedure. RESULTS: Only two of the nine patients had sufficient mobilization of CD34 cells to merit collection; in these cases sufficient CD34 cells were obtained for autologous transplantation should the need arise. CONCLUSION: PBPC collection is feasible only in a fraction of recovered AA patients.","['Sloand, Elaine M', 'Read, Elizabeth J', 'Scheinberg, Phillip', 'Tang, Yong', 'More, Kenneth', 'Leitman, Susan F', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw', 'Young, Neal S']","['Sloand EM', 'Read EJ', 'Scheinberg P', 'Tang Y', 'More K', 'Leitman SF', 'Maciejewski J', 'Young NS']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the Mark O.

Monocyte chemotactic protein-(MCP-1)/CCL2 was the first chemokine described to elicit influx of monocyte/macrophages into tumors. Application of chemokines as anti-tumoral therapy to attract immunocompetent cells and to mediate the mounting of an efficient anti-tumoral response has been tested as a method to combat cancer for some years now. However, these chemokine-related therapy has not yet been approved for clinical application, although it has been tested succesfully in animal models for years now. A different kind of approach for chemokine anti-cancer therapy involves angiostatic chemokines. These chemokines inhibit pro-angiogenic tumoral factors, thereby limiting tumor growth and metastasis. Recently, we described a most potent new angiostatic chemokine, namely a variant of platelet factor 4, designated PF-4var/CXCL4L1. With regard to hematological tumors we described a new plasma chemokine, PARC/CCL18, that can be used to distinguish between pediatric patients with acute lymfoid leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. Whether this elevated plasma concentration of PARC/CCL18 is the cause of the pathology or the consequence of a disturbed cytokine balance is not clear at the moment.","['Struyf, S', 'Van Damme, J']","['Struyf S', 'Van Damme J']","['Laboratorium voor Moleculaire Immunologie, Rega Instituut, KULeuve, Minderbroedersstraat 10, B 3000, Leuven.']",['dut'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Belgium,Verh K Acad Geneeskd Belg,Verhandelingen - Koninklijke Academie voor Geneeskunde van Belgie,0413210,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCL18 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Chemokines/blood/*immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Chemokines, CC/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis']",2007/06/22 09:00,2007/07/10 09:00,['2007/06/22 09:00'],"['2007/06/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Verh K Acad Geneeskd Belg. 2007;69(3):149-65.,21,,,,Rol van plasma-chemokinen bij kanker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively evaluated the charts of 80 consecutive patients, with 89 hematopoietic stem cell transplants for hematologic malignancies. The results of early initiation of DF treatment in 14 patients with SOS are presented in this study. Fourteen patients, 8 males and 6 females % median age 40.5 years (range, 16-46 years) were diagnosed to have SOS. Disease severity was classified as severe in 6 (42.85%), moderate in 4 (28.57%), and mild in 4 (28.57%) patients. We treated 14 patients with DF for a median of 21.5 days (range, 4-39 days). All 14 patients received DF after the diagnosis of SOS. Three patients with severe and all of the patients with mild to moderate SOS responded to treatment with complete resolution of SOS-related signs and symptoms. All patients responding to DF were alive at 100 days posttransplantation. There was no significant drug-related side effect among patients treated with DF. With an overall response rate of 78.56% and a 50% complete response rate in severe SOS cases and minimal side effects, we suggest that DF is the best available agent to treat SOS.","['Sucak, G T', 'Aki, Z S', 'Yagci, M', 'Yegin, Z A', 'Ozkurt, Z N', 'Haznedar, R']","['Sucak GT', 'Aki ZS', 'Yagci M', 'Yegin ZA', 'Ozkurt ZN', 'Haznedar R']","['Department of Hematology, Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Besevler, Ankara, Cankaya 06500, Turkey. aysucak@gazi.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,"['0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Polydeoxyribonucleotides)', '438HCF2X0M (defibrotide)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Group Incompatibility', 'Female', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Heparin/therapeutic use', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polydeoxyribonucleotides/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/06/21 09:00,2007/09/18 09:00,['2007/06/21 09:00'],"['2006/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplant Proc. 2007 Jun;39(5):1558-63. doi: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2007.01.075.,,,,"['S0041-1345(07)00322-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transproceed.2007.01.075 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It occurs when neoplastic cells enter cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways, causing diffuse infiltration of the subarachnoid space of the brain and spinal cord. Definitive diagnosis is established by the demonstration of malignant cells in the CSF. However, in certain circumstances the presence of leptomeningeal enhancement on brain or spinal MRI may be sufficient to make the diagnosis. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment may delay neurologic progression and can lead to prolonged survival and improvement of neurologic function in certain patients. The prognosis depends on the underlying malignancy but is often poor, with a median survival of 4 months, and most treatment interventions are palliative. Nevertheless, some patients respond to treatment, and some survive beyond 1 or 2 years after diagnosis. Areas of radiographic bulky disease or symptomatic tumor should receive radiotherapy. Intrathecal chemotherapy is most effective in patients with lymphoma, leukemia, or breast cancer and without evidence of bulky disease on neuroimaging. Intrathecal chemotherapy requires normal CSF flow, and the most commonly used agents are methotrexate, cytarabine, and thiotepa. In lieu of intrathecal therapy, systemic chemotherapy may occasionally be indicated in select patients in part based on its ability to penetrate into bulky disease. When hydrocephalus occurs, ventriculoperitoneal shunting frequently leads to rapid clinical improvement. There is hope that progress in diagnostic modalities and the development of more effective intrathecal antineoplastic drugs may decrease neurologic morbidity and improve quality of life and survival.","['Drappatz, Jan', 'Batchelor, Tracy T']","['Drappatz J', 'Batchelor TT']","[""Jan Drappatz, MD Harvard Medical School, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center, Center for Neuro-Oncology, 44 Binney Street SW 430, Boston, MA 02115, USA. jdrappatz@partners.org.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Curr Treat Options Neurol,Current treatment options in neurology,9815940,,,,2007/06/21 09:00,2007/06/21 09:01,['2007/06/21 09:00'],"['2007/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/21 09:01 [medline]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Treat Options Neurol. 2007 Jul;9(4):283-93. doi: 10.1007/s11940-007-0014-5.,,,,['10.1007/s11940-007-0014-5 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeted inactivation of C/EBPalpha in mice demonstrates its importance in the proper development and function of liver, adipose tissue, lung and haematopoietic tissues. C/EBPalpha is highly expressed in these differentiated tissues where it controls differentiation-dependent gene expression and inhibits cell proliferation. Learning more about the precise molecular functions of the C/EBPalpha protein and how these are affected by leukaemogenic mutations should lead to an improved understanding of the cellular functions that are disrupted in patients with AML. Decreased expression of C/EBPalpha but not C/EBPalpha mutation has been shown in patients with granulocytic leukaemias that are associated with translocations t(8;21), inv (16) or t(15;17). Derived fusion proteins repress C/EBPalpha expression. Differentiation therapy of some AML types is based on restoring C/EBPalpha function. However, apparently normal C/EBPalpha is overexpressed in BCP-ALL harbouring the translocation t(14; 19)(q32; q13). C/EBPalpha may exhibit oncogenic as well as tumour suppressor properties in human leukaemogenesis. C/EBPalpha mutations were not found in non-haematopoietic cancers. DNA hypermethylation of the upstream C/EBPalpha promoter region is responsible for very low C/EBPalpha expression in human lung and endometrial cancer. C/EBPalpha expression may be a biomarker for early detection of these cancers and DNA-modifying drugs such as demethylating agents and/or histone deacetylase inhibitors could be used in the treatment of these malignancies.","['Fuchs, O']",['Fuchs O'],"['Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.

The prognostic impact for several parameters was assessed by univariate and by multivariate analyses using the Cox regression model. Three-year probabilities of non-relapse mortality (34 vs. 54%; p = 0.9) did not differ in the MA and non-MA groups, but differences were observed in the disease-free survival (DFS) (43 vs. 17%; p = 0.1) and the relapse rate (RR) (29 vs. 62%; p = 0.01).

The mutations occurred most frequently in M5 and M0 subtypes of AML. They were mainly associated with the normal karyotype. All patients harboring FLT3/ITD had a higher number of white blood cells than patients without it (p = 0.027).

As for disease-free survival, the difference between FLT3/ITD-positive and FLT3/ITD-negative patients was not statistically significant (Log rank = 0.78; p = 0.3764). In multivariate analysis, the presence of FLT3/ITD mutations was the most significant prognostic factor for both OS and CR rate (p = 0.0287; relative risk = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.06-2.82). However, in the group of patients with the intermediate-risk karyotype, the mere presence of FLT3/ITD was not associated with inferior clinical outcome.

However, changes in the pattern of FLT3/D835 mutations in initial and relapsed AML were observed. Our results indicate an association of FLT3/ITD with the adverse outcome in AML patients treated with standard induction chemotherapy.

SJG-136 rapidly induced DNA crosslinking in primary CLL cells which was concentration-dependent. Further, the level of crosslinking correlated with sensitivity to SJG-136-induced apoptosis (P=0.001) and higher levels of crosslinking were induced by the combination of SJG-136 and fludarabine (P=0.002). All of the samples tested (n=40) demonstrated synergy between SJG-136 and fludarabine (mean combination index (CI)=0.54+/-0.2) and this was even retained in samples derived from patients with fludarabine resistance (mean CI=0.62+/-0.3). Transcription of the excision repair enzyme, ERCC1, was consistently increased (20/20) in response to SJG-136 (P<0.0001). In contrast, fludarabine suppressed ERCC1 transcription (P=0.04) and inhibited SJG-136-induced ERCC1 transcription when used in combination (P=0.001). Importantly, the ability of fludarabine to suppress ERCC1 transcription correlated with the degree of synergy observed between SJG-136 and fludarabine (r(2)=0.28; P=0.017) offering a mechanistic rationale for the synergistic interaction.

The present investigation was done to elucidate the role of cAMP-response element-binding (CREB) protein in this system. Jurkat T cells were treated with 100-1,000 ng/ml TRAIL for time intervals up to 24 h in the presence or absence of selective pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3-K/Akt (LY294002) or p38 MAPK (SB253580) pathways. Upon TRAIL treatment, a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells as well as in caspase-3 activity was observed. A further enhancement of apoptotic cell death was obtained with the use of CREB1 siRNA technology, as demonstrated by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis showed a high constitutive level of CREB phosphorylation at Ser(133) in Jurkat T cells under normal serum culture conditions. Under low serum culture conditions, an early (within 1 h) and transient increase in CREB phosphorylation was detected in response to both TRAIL doses and reduced upon pre-treatment with LY294002 or SB253580, demonstrating the PI3-K/Akt- and p38 MAPK-dependency of this effect. The parallel analysis in immune fluorescence demonstrated the nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated form upon treatment with 100 ng/ml TRAIL, whereas the immune labeling was mainly detectable in the cytoplasm compartment upon the higher more cytotoxic dose. These results let us hypothesize that CREB activation can be an important player in the complex cross-talk among pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways in this peculiar cell model.","['Caravatta, Luciana', 'Sancilio, Silvia', 'di Giacomo, Viviana', 'Rana, Rosalba', 'Cataldi, Amelia', 'Di Pietro, Roberta']","['Caravatta L', 'Sancilio S', 'di Giacomo V', 'Rana R', 'Cataldi A', 'Di Pietro R']","[""Dipartimento di Biomorfologia, Universita G. d'Annunzio, Chieti-Pescara, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Caspase 3/analysis/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Histidine/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles', 'Indoles', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Necrosis/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Pyridines', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Transfection', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/analysis']",2007/06/21 09:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['2007/06/21 09:00'],"['2007/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2008 Jan;214(1):192-200. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21186.,,,,['10.1002/jcp.21186 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

It occurs most frequently secondary to a history of myelogenous leukemia as extramedullary relapse. New treatment regimens, including allogeneic stem cell transplantation, extensive use of donor lymphocyte infusion, and second transplantation, are associated with increased rates of chloroma of up to 21%. The purpose of this article is to highlight the sites of involvement as well as the morphologic and imaging features of chloroma in patients with myelogenous leukemia. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation now represents the treatment of choice for leukemia and for patients with leukemia relapse. Therefore, the rate of chloroma is likely to increase. Because clinical and laboratory data are frequently not indicative, radiologic diagnosis of chloroma will become more important.","['Fritz, Jan', 'Vogel, Wichard', 'Bares, Roland', 'Horger, Marius']","['Fritz J', 'Vogel W', 'Bares R', 'Horger M']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Eberhard-Karls-University Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Strasse 3, 72076 Tubingen, Germany. jan.fritz@gmx.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

In previous work, we found that a catalytically active group V secreted phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)-V) was required for COX-2 induction, but the nature of the sPLA(2)-V metabolite involved was not defined. In this study, we identify lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) as the sPLA(2)-V downstream mediator involved in COX-2 induction by LPS-stimulated macrophages. Inhibition of sPLA(2)-V by RNA interference or by the cell-permeable compound scalaradial blocked LPS-induced COX-2 expression, and this inhibition was overcome by incubating the cells with a nonhydrolyzable lysoPC analog, but not by arachidonic acid or oleic acid. Moreover, inhibition of sPLA(2)-V by scalaradial also prevented the activation of the transcription factor c-Rel, and such an inhibition was also selectively overcome by the lysoPC analog. Collectively, these results support a model whereby sPLA(2)-V hydrolysis of phospholipids upon LPS stimulation results in lysoPC generation, which in turn regulates COX-2 expression by a mechanism involving the transcriptional activity of c-Rel.","['Ruiperez, Violeta', 'Casas, Javier', 'Balboa, Maria A', 'Balsinde, Jesus']","['Ruiperez V', 'Casas J', 'Balboa MA', 'Balsinde J']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Spanish National Research Council and University of Valladolid School of Medicine, Valladolid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Homosteroids)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Sesterterpenes)', '0 (Terpenes)', '53527-28-9 (scalaradial)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Group V Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Pla2g5 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*biosynthesis/metabolism/physiology', 'Enzyme Induction/immunology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Group V Phospholipases A2', 'Homosteroids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/enzymology/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/enzymology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel/physiology', 'Sesterterpenes', 'Terpenes/pharmacology']",2007/06/21 09:00,2007/08/08 09:00,['2007/06/21 09:00'],"['2007/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Jul 1;179(1):631-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.179.1.631.,,,,"['179/1/631 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.179.1.631 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elimination of SHIP-2 from BMMCs has no effect on FcepsilonRI-triggered calcium flux, tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPKs or in actin depolymerization following activation. Rather, we observe that absence of SHIP-2 results in increased activation of the small GTPase Rac-1 and in enhanced microtubule polymerization upon FcepsilonRI engagement. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL 2H3) cells show that SHIP-2 interacts with the FcepsilonRI beta-chain, Gab2 and Lyn and that unlike SHIP-1, it does not associate with SHC in mast cells. Our results report a negative regulatory role of SHIP-2 on mast cell activation that is calcium independent and distinct from the regulation by SHIP-1.","['Leung, Wai-Hang', 'Bolland, Silvia']","['Leung WH', 'Bolland S']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 12441 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20852, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Inpp5d protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Inppl1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Inppl1 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Down-Regulation/*immunology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Immunoglobulin E/*physiology', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Mast Cells/cytology/enzymology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'Rats']",2007/06/21 09:00,2007/08/08 09:00,['2007/06/21 09:00'],"['2007/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Jul 1;179(1):95-102. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.179.1.95.,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['179/1/95 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.179.1.95 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Top2-based chemotherapy has been associated with higher incidences of secondary malignancies, notably the development of acute myeloid leukemia in VP-16-treated patients. This association is suggestive of a link between carcinogenesis and Top2-mediated DNA damage. We show here that VP-16-induced carcinogenesis involves mainly the beta rather than the alpha isozyme of Top2. In a mouse skin carcinogenesis model, the incidence of VP-16-induced melanomas in the skin of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-treated mice is found to be significantly higher in TOP2beta(+) than in skin-specific top2beta-knockout mice. Furthermore, VP-16-induced DNA sequence rearrangements and double-strand breaks (DSBs) are found to be Top2beta-dependent and preventable by cotreatment with a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting the importance of proteasomal degradation of the Top2beta-DNA cleavage complexes in VP-16-induced DNA sequence rearrangements. VP-16 cytotoxicity in transformed cells expressing both Top2 isozymes is, however, found to be primarily Top2alpha-dependent. These results point to the importance of developing Top2alpha-specific anticancer drugs for effective chemotherapy without the development of treatment-related secondary malignancies.","['Azarova, Anna M', 'Lyu, Yi Lisa', 'Lin, Chao-Po', 'Tsai, Yuan-Chin', 'Lau, Johnson Yiu-Nam', 'Wang, James C', 'Liu, Leroy F']","['Azarova AM', 'Lyu YL', 'Lin CP', 'Tsai YC', 'Lau JY', 'Wang JC', 'Liu LF']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Design', 'Etoposide/adverse effects', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/drug therapy/etiology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2007/06/21 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/06/21 09:00'],"['2007/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jun 26;104(26):11014-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0704002104.

The protein mediates activation through multiple interactions with transcriptional activators, coactivators, and chromatin remodeling complexes. However, the mechanisms involved in HCF-1-dependent transcriptional stimulation were undefined. By using a minimal HCF-1-dependent promoter and a model activator, the varicella zoster IE62 protein, it was determined that HCF-1 was not required for the assembly of the RNAPII basal complex, which depended solely on IE62 in conjunction with the cellular factor Sp1. In contrast, HCF-1 was required for recruitment of the histone methyltransferases Set1 and MLL1 (mixed-lineage leukemia 1), leading to histone H3K4 trimethylation and transcriptional activation. Similarly, in a varicella zoster virus lytic infection, HCF-1, Set1, and MLL1 were recruited to the viral genomic IE promoter, suggesting an essential role for HCF-1 in chromatin modification and remodeling during initiation of lytic infection. The results indicate that one biological rationale for the incorporation of the viral IE activators in the viral particle is to recruit HCF-1/histone methyltransferase complexes and promote assembly of the viral IE gene promoters into transcriptionally active chromatin. These studies also contribute to the model whereby the induced nuclear transport of HCF-1 in sensory neurons may be critical to the reactivation of latent herpesviruses by promoting the activation of chromatin modifications.","['Narayanan, Aarthi', 'Ruyechan, William T', 'Kristie, Thomas M']","['Narayanan A', 'Ruyechan WT', 'Kristie TM']","['Laboratory of Viral Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Building 4-131, 4 Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Host Cell Factor C1)', '0 (IE62 protein, Human herpesvirus 3)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Immediate-Early', 'HeLa Cells', 'Herpes Simplex/*etiology', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Host Cell Factor C1/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins']",2007/06/21 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/06/21 09:00'],"['2007/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jun 26;104(26):10835-40. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0704351104.

The link between low cholecalciferol concentration and bone diseases is well established, however there is also data suggesting that it may influence development and progression of different cancers and autoimmune diseases. The in vitro studies proved that the active vitamin D metabolite--1,25(OH)(2)D(3) may arrest the cell cycle progression, induce apoptosis as well as regulate T cells and antigen presenting cells function. Results of the in vivo experiments suggest that vitamin D deficiency accelerates development of autoimmune diseases and cancers in animals. Epidemiological studies imply that the vitamin D deficiency is also associated with the increased incidence of autoimmune diseases and cancers in people. The main determinant of vitamin D serum concentration in a human body is skin synthesis. The changes in the lifestyle, air pollution as well as a common use of sun screens caused that the contemporary European receives little sunlight compared to his ancestors. According to the recent epidemiological studies, the vitamin D concentrations in serum of people who live in high latitudes (above 34 degrees N/S), including Poland, is far from being sufficient. This paper reviews results of the recent studies concerning the potential role of the vitamin D in the development of cancers and autoimmune diseases, as well as provides guidelines for vitamin D supplementation.","['Kurylowicz, Alina', 'Bednarczuk, Tomasz', 'Nauman, Janusz']","['Kurylowicz A', 'Bednarczuk T', 'Nauman J']","['Zaklad Badawczo-Leczniczy Endokrynologii Instytutu Medycyny Doswiadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However, clinical utility has been limited by diminished T-cell function arising from the production process. To evaluate strategies for harnessing the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect while improving the safety and function of suicidal lymphocytes, we have developed techniques to produce fully functional, retrovirally transduced, HSV-TK-positive murine T cells (TK+TC). METHODS: Utilizing a murine major histocompatibility complex-matched transplant model, we evaluated the ability of TK+TC to generate a GVL effect and the ability to control GVHD in experiments where we varied the dose of TK+TC, ganciclovir (GCV) dose, the start of GCV administration (day 4, 7, 10, 13, 15, or 19) posttransplantation, and the GCV administration route (osmotic pump versus intraperitoneal). RESULTS: At TK+TC doses in excess of the standard lethal dose (SLD) of unmanipulated T-cells, GCV administration completely (2 x SLD) and partially (4 x SLD) controlled GVHD. Additionally, GVHD remained reversible despite delaying administration of GCV for a week after GVHD developed. Importantly, GVHD was controlled with a 1-log but not 2-log reduction in GCV dose, and this ""partial suicide"" preserved more circulating TK+TC compared with standard-dose GCV. Survival of leukemia-positive mice receiving TK+TC and GCV was significantly increased compared with control cohorts not receiving GCV or transplanted with unmanipulated T cells, thereby demonstrating a GVL effect. CONCLUSION: Retrovirally transduced suicidal lymphocytes generate a potent GVL effect while simultaneously enabling control of GVHD, which results in improved leukemia and GVHD-free survival.","['Kornblau, Steven M', 'Aycox, Preston G', 'Stephens, Clifton', 'McCue, L David', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Marini, Frank C']","['Kornblau SM', 'Aycox PG', 'Stephens C', 'McCue LD', 'Champlin RE', 'Marini FC']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Unit 448, M.

The millions of specificities in T-cell receptor (TCR) hypervariable complementarity- determining region 3 (CDR3) precludes detection of all T-cell populations by antibody-based flow cytometry. An alternative method, the TCR CDR3 spectratyping assay, involves multiple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses and is interpreted only qualitatively. In this study, we designed the first TCRbeeta-based oligonucleotide microarray and investigated its specificity, clonality discrimination, sensitivity of detection, and feasibility for monitoring T-cell population diversity in HSCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The array contains 27 TCR Vbeta probes and 13 Jbeta probes. TCRbeta repertoire diversity was detected with single PCR, microarray hybridization system, and Spotfire analysis software. RESULTS: TCRO-based microarray provides specific sequence-based information and can distinguish T-cell monoclonal expansion within a polyclonal population. We successfully used this microarray to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze T-cell population diversity in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants. CONCLUSION: This success suggests broad potential applications of the microarray for use in many other areas, including anti-tumor immunity, vaccination, autoimmunity, infectious diseases, and leukemia.

We thus put forward this strategy as an efficient in vitro HSC expansion tool, enabling a further step into the avenue of self-renewal molecular effectors.","['Cellot, Sonia', 'Krosl, Jana', 'Chagraoui, Jalila', 'Meloche, Sylvain', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Cellot S', 'Krosl J', 'Chagraoui J', 'Meloche S', 'Humphries RK', 'Sauvageau G']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics of Stem Cells, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ccnd3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mad protein, mouse)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",2007/06/20 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/06/20 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 May;35(5):802-16. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.02.013.,,,['R01 HL065430-07/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['S0301-472X(07)00119-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.02.013 [doi]']",,,,,PMC2752385,['NIHMS22804'],,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rac signaling was modulated by retroviral introduction of Racl-N17, Racl-V12, or by using the Rac inhibitor NSC23766. In long-term MS5 cocultures (leukemic) expansion, migration, adhesion, and presence of stem/progenitor cells were monitored in both normal as well as leukemic CD34+ cells. RESULTS: Inhibition of Rac signaling impaired migration and adhesion of cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells on MS5 stroma. Long-term inhibition of Rac during a 5-week coculture period on stroma prevented association of hematopoietic progenitors with the bone marrow stromal cells and resulted in a dramatic decrease in the primitive stem cell frequency (long-term culture-initiating cell) in a dose-dependent manner. Many of these phenotypes were reversed in the presence of activated Racl-V12, including improved migration toward, and association with, MS5 cells. CD34+ AML cells were characterized by elevated levels of Rac activity (five of seven patients) and enhanced migration and adhesion to MS5 bone marrow stroma as compared to CB CD34+ cells. A dramatic decrease was observed in the formation of leukemic cobblestone area-forming cells as well as strongly diminished clonal expansion in the presence of the Rac inhibitor NSC23766. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that Rac signal transduction is required for the maintenance and expansion of both normal as well as leukemic stem/progenitor cells by mediating their interaction with stromal cells.","['Rozenveld-Geugien, Marjan', 'Baas, Inge O', 'van Gosliga, Djoke', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['Rozenveld-Geugien M', 'Baas IO', 'van Gosliga D', 'Vellenga E', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (NSC 23766)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology']",2007/06/20 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/06/20 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 May;35(5):782-92. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.02.006.,,,,"['S0301-472X(07)00111-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.02.006 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This study analyzed mRNA and protein levels, gene transcription rates, and mRNA and protein stabilities of erythroid-specific transcription factors in lineage-restricted cells derived from the 32D cell line cultured either in interleukin-3 or erythropoietin. RESULTS: Erythroid 32D subclones expressed levels of Idl, Gata-2, and Scl comparable and levels of Eklf and Gata-1 higher than those expressed by myeloid subclones. While maintained in interleukin-3, erythroid cells remained immature despite their high expression of Gata-1, Gata-2, Scl, Eklf, and Idl. Switching the erythroid cells to erythropoietin induced cell maturation (within 48 hours) and reduced expression of Gata-2 and Idl (in 24 hours) but did not alter the expression of Gata-1. The effects of interleukin-3 were mostly mediated by increases in transcription rates (Scl and Gata-2), and that of erythropoietin was apparently due to increased mRNA and protein (Gata-1, Scl, and Eklf) stability. In particular, erythropoietin increased the stability of the processed and transcriptionally more active form of GATA-1 protein. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that interleukin-3 and erythropoietin cooperate to establish the lineage-specific transcription factor milieu of erythroid cells: interleukin-3 regulates mainly gene transcription and erythropoietin consistently increases mRNA and protein stability.","['Ghinassi, Barbara', 'Verrucci, Maria', 'Jelicic, Katija', 'Di Noia, Antonella', 'Migliaccio, Giovanni', 'Migliaccio, Anna Rita']","['Ghinassi B', 'Verrucci M', 'Jelicic K', 'Di Noia A', 'Migliaccio G', 'Migliaccio AR']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Idb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Time Factors']",2007/06/20 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/06/20 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 May;35(5):735-47. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.02.007.,,,['P01-CA108671-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['S0301-472X(07)00113-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.02.007 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyze if altered signals are coordinated and to evaluate their effect on this disease, we have investigated in acute myeloid leukemia samples (AML) the expression and activation status of procoagulant/proangiogenic tissue factor receptor (TF), angiogenic protein VEGF, its cell surface receptor, KDR, and two intracellular proteins involved in their regulation: extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB). Significantly higher mRNA and protein levels of VEGF, KDR, and TF were found in the AML samples versus controls. Enhanced ERK phosphorylation and NFkappaB activation in most AML samples were also found. In vitro MEK/ERK and NFkappaB-binding activity blockade suppressed the constitutive expression of TF, VEGF, and KDR. Anti-TF antibody treatment significantly suppressed VEGF and KDR expression as well as ERK activation, suggesting that TF expressed by AML cells may be both a regulatory target and a mediator of tumor-associated angiogenesis.

We assessed some of the problems in adult ALL patients (>12 years of age) in a tertiary care hospital of northwest India with modified BFM regimen. The diagnosis of ALL was made according to FAB criteria. The protocol consisted of Phase I & II induction, consolidation, reinduction and maintenance phases. CNS prophylaxis was administered with 24 Gy radiation and intrathecal methotrexate. One hundred and eighteen patients (72.9% males), aged 12-68 years (median 23 years) were treated from January 1997 till December 2003. Follow-up of patients was done till December 2005. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 85.6% patients after induction therapy and 40% patient relapsed. Most patients (23.7%) relapsed during the maintenance phase or after completion of chemotherapy. At least 15% of patients (15/101) after successful induction abandoned the treatment because of financial constraints, prolonged travel time to treatment facility and switching over to alternative medicines. Fatal infectious complications occurred in 19.5% of patients. The 3-year and 5-year event free survival rates were 29.8% and 21.6% respectively. In conclusion, modified BFM regimen resulted in high induction rates but relatively poor 5-year event free survival. Infections related death and post induction abandonment of treatment were the main reasons for poor overall results.","['Malhotra, Pankaj', 'Varma, Subhash', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Kumari, Savita', 'Das, Reena', 'Jain, Sanjay', 'Ahluwalia, Jasmina', 'Mahi, Sushil', 'Sharma, Suresh Chander', 'Radhika, Srinivasan']","['Malhotra P', 'Varma S', 'Varma N', 'Kumari S', 'Das R', 'Jain S', 'Ahluwalia J', 'Mahi S', 'Sharma SC', 'Radhika S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. malhotrapankaj@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Health Resources/economics/supply & distribution', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2007/06/20 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/06/20 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Jun;48(6):1173-8. doi: 10.1080/10428190701343255.,,,,"['779655173 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190701343255 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-six adult patients with primary CN-AML, younger than 60 years and treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 19808, were evaluated for ERG expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. They were then combined with 72 patients enrolled onto CALGB 9621 for analyses that included other molecular markers. RESULTS: Similar to patients enrolled onto CALGB 9621, high ERG expressers on CALGB 19808 had fewer complete remissions (CRs; P = .03) and worse event-free survival (EFS; P = .016) than low ERG expressers. In the combined set, high expressers (n = 55) had fewer CRs (P = .004) and shorter EFS (P < .001) than low expressers (n = 93). High ERG predicted failure to achieve CR (P = .004) after adjusting for BAALC expression (P = .04) and age (P = .008), and EFS (P = .004) after adjusting for FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; P < .001). Among patients without FLT3-ITD (FLT3-ITD negative), only high ERG predicted shorter EFS (P = .001). Among NPM1-mutated (NPM1 positive) patients, high ERG predicted shorter EFS (P = .003), after adjusting for FLT3-ITD (P < .001). When all three markers were considered together, in the favorable FLT3-ITD-negative/NPM1-positive subset, high ERG was the only factor predicting shorter EFS (P = .002). CONCLUSION: We validated ERG overexpression as an adverse predictor in CN-AML. Moreover, by using ERG expression levels, we improved the previously proposed molecular-risk classification of CN-AML based on the presence or absence of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations, given that we identified subsets with different outcome among FLT3-ITD-negative, NPM1-positive, and FLT3-ITD-negative/NPM1-positive patients.","['Marcucci, Guido', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Vukosavljevic, Tamara', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Langer, Christian', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Marcucci G', 'Maharry K', 'Whitman SP', 'Vukosavljevic T', 'Paschka P', 'Langer C', 'Mrozek K', 'Baldus CD', 'Carroll AJ', 'Powell BL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. guido.marcucci@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/06/20 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/06/20 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 1;25(22):3337-43. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.10.8720.

To develop therapies that effectively target LSC, one potential strategy is to identify cell surface markers that can distinguish LSC from normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In this study, we employ a signal sequence trap strategy to isolate cell surface molecules expressed on human AML-LSC and find that CD96, which is a member of the Ig gene superfamily, is a promising candidate as an LSC-specific antigen. FACS analysis demonstrates that CD96 is expressed on the majority of CD34(+)CD38(-) AML cells in many cases (74.0 +/- 25.3% in 19 of 29 cases), whereas only a few (4.9 +/- 1.6%) cells in the normal HSC-enriched population (Lin(-)CD34(+)CD38(-)CD90(+)) expressed CD96 weakly. To examine whether CD96(+) AML cells are enriched for LSC activity, we separated AML cells into CD96(+) and CD96(-) fractions and transplanted them into irradiated newborn Rag2(-/-) gamma(c)(-/-) mice. In four of five samples, only CD96(+) cells showed significant levels of engraftment in bone marrow of the recipient mice. These results demonstrate that CD96 is a cell surface marker present on many AML-LSC and may serve as an LSC-specific therapeutic target.","['Hosen, Naoki', 'Park, Christopher Y', 'Tatsumi, Naoya', 'Oji, Yusuke', 'Sugiyama, Haruo', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Krensky, Alan M', 'Weissman, Irving L']","['Hosen N', 'Park CY', 'Tatsumi N', 'Oji Y', 'Sugiyama H', 'Gramatzki M', 'Krensky AM', 'Weissman IL']","['Department of Pathology, Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford Cancer Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305-5323, USA. hnaoki@imed3.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD96 antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Biomarkers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2007/06/20 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/06/20 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jun 26;104(26):11008-13. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0704271104.

Lenalidomide has dramatic therapeutic effects in patients with low-risk MDS and a chromosome 5q31 deletion, resulting in complete cytogenetic remission in >60% of patients. The molecular basis of this remarkable drug response is unknown. To gain insight into the molecular targets of lenalidomide we investigated its in vitro effects on growth, maturation, and global gene expression in isolated erythroblast cultures from MDS patients with del(5)(q31). Lenalidomide inhibited growth of differentiating del(5q) erythroblasts but did not affect cytogenetically normal cells. Moreover, lenalidomide significantly influenced the pattern of gene expression in del(5q) intermediate erythroblasts, with the VSIG4, PPIC, TPBG, activin A, and SPARC genes up-regulated by >2-fold in all samples and many genes involved in erythropoiesis, including HBA2, GYPA, and KLF1, down-regulated in most samples. Activin A, one of the most significant differentially expressed genes between lenalidomide-treated cells from MDS patients and healthy controls, has pleiotropic functions, including apoptosis of hematopoietic cells. Up-regulation and increased protein expression of the tumor suppressor gene SPARC is of particular interest because it is antiproliferative, antiadhesive, and antiangiogenic and is located at 5q31-q32, within the commonly deleted region in MDS 5q- syndrome. We conclude that lenalidomide inhibits growth of del(5q) erythroid progenitors and that the up-regulation of SPARC and activin A may underlie the potent effects of lenalidomide in MDS with del(5)(q31). SPARC may play a role in the pathogenesis of the 5q- syndrome.","['Pellagatti, Andrea', 'Jadersten, Martin', 'Forsblom, Ann-Mari', 'Cattan, Helen', 'Christensson, Birger', 'Emanuelsson, Emma K', 'Merup, Mats', 'Nilsson, Lars', 'Samuelsson, Jan', 'Sander, Birgitta', 'Wainscoat, James S', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva']","['Pellagatti A', 'Jadersten M', 'Forsblom AM', 'Cattan H', 'Christensson B', 'Emanuelsson EK', 'Merup M', 'Nilsson L', 'Samuelsson J', 'Sander B', 'Wainscoat JS', 'Boultwood J', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DU, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Osteonectin)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Erythroblasts/drug effects/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Osteonectin/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/06/20 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/06/20 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jul 3;104(27):11406-11. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0610477104.

To determine the detectable incidence and clinical relevance of GATA1 mutations in DS newborns, we screened Guthrie cards from 590 DS infants for mutations in the GATA1 gene. Twenty-two (3.8%) of 585 evaluable infants harbored a predicted functional GATA1 mutation; 2 were identified exclusively within intron 1. Hispanic newborns were 2.6 times more likely to have a mutated GATA1 gene than non-Hispanics (P = .02). Two newborns with a GATA1 mutation subsequently developed AMKL, and none of the infants without a functional GATA1 mutation were reported to have developed leukemia. In addition to screening for TL, a GATA1 mutation at birth might serve as a biomarker for an increased risk of DS-related AMKL.","['Pine, Sharon R', 'Guo, Qianxu', 'Yin, Changhong', 'Jayabose, Somasundaram', 'Druschel, Charlotte M', 'Sandoval, Claudio']","['Pine SR', 'Guo Q', 'Yin C', 'Jayabose S', 'Druschel CM', 'Sandoval C']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Maria Fareri Children's Hospital and Westchester Medical Center, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Down Syndrome/complications/ethnology/*genetics', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/ethnology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",2007/06/20 09:00,2007/10/31 09:00,['2007/06/20 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Sep 15;110(6):2128-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-01-069542.

METHODS: On skin biopsies from 16 patients with biopsy-proven SS and/or PG, we performed an X-inactivation assay to detect clonal restriction of neutrophils. There were two patient categories based on known diseases at the time of diagnosis: patients with myeloproliferative disease and patients without myeloproliferative disease. RESULTS: Among seven patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and two with myelodysplastic syndrome, clonal restriction was found in five; three were homozygous, precluding analysis. Among the seven control patients, infiltrates were clonally restricted in five; one was polyclonal and the other was homozygous for the allele, precluding analysis. Of the five patients with clonally restricted infiltrates, one was subsequently diagnosed with myelodysplasia, one had unexplained neutropenia and an additional patient developed breast cancer. Overall, the incidence of clonality in both groups was the same, averaging 81%. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that clonality in neutrophilic dermatoses, while characteristic of underlying myeloid dyscrasia, is not observed exclusively in the setting of myeloproliferative diseases. The significance of clonal neutrophilic infiltrates unassociated with myeloproliferative disease is unclear, but it may have some implications regarding the pathogenesis of sterile neutrophilic infiltrates. Clonality is well described in the setting of lymphomatoid hypersensitivity, reflecting an overzealous response to antigenic stimuli. One could speculate a similar mechanism operational in cases of apparently reactive SS/PG associated with monoclonality; a localized form of cutaneous neutrophilic dyscrasia is also possible.","['Magro, Cynthia M', 'Kiani, Bahram', 'Li, Jingwei', 'Crowson, A Neil']","['Magro CM', 'Kiani B', 'Li J', 'Crowson AN']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA. cym2003@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Receptors, Androgen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromosomes, Human, X/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/*pathology', 'Pyoderma Gangrenosum/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Receptors, Androgen/genetics', 'Sweet Syndrome/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'X Chromosome Inactivation']",2007/06/20 09:00,2007/08/10 09:00,['2007/06/20 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2007 Jul;34(7):526-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.2006.00654.x.,,,,"['CUP654 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0560.2006.00654.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal epithelial differentiation seen in malignant transformation of keratinocytes is associated with changes in keratin expression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the phenotype of primary human adult keratinocytes expressing early genes of HPV8 with specific reference to their differentiation and cell cycle profile to determine whether early genes of HPV8 lead to changes that are consistent with transformation. The expression of HPV8 early genes either individually or simultaneously caused distinct changes in the keratinocyte morphology and induced an abnormal keratin expression pattern, that included simple epithelial (K8, K18, K19), hyperproliferation-specific (K6, K16), basal-specific (K14, K15) and differentiation-specific (K1, K10) keratins. Our results indicate that expression of HPV8 early genes disrupts the normal keratin expression pattern in vitro. Expression of HPV8-E7 alone caused polyploidy that was associated with decreased expression of p21 and pRb. Expression of individual genes or in combination differentially influenced cell morphology and cell cycle distribution which might be important in HPV8-induced keratinocyte transformation.","['Akgul, Baki', 'Ghali, Lucy', 'Davies, Derek', 'Pfister, Herbert', 'Leigh, Irene M', 'Storey, Alan']","['Akgul B', 'Ghali L', 'Davies D', 'Pfister H', 'Leigh IM', 'Storey A']","['Skin Tumour Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, London, UK. baki.akguel@web.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Exp Dermatol,Experimental dermatology,9301549,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alphapapillomavirus/*genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/metabolism/*virology', 'Keratins/*metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Polyploidy', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2007/06/20 09:00,2007/09/01 09:00,['2007/06/20 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Dermatol. 2007 Jul;16(7):590-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0625.2007.00569.x.,,,['A6695/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['EXD569 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0625.2007.00569.x [doi]']",,,,,PMC2423465,['UKMS1843'],,,,,,,['NLM: UKMS1843'],

HTLV-1 Tax can activate the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt signalling pathway, which is responsible for survival of HTLV-1-infected T-cells. HIFs (hypoxia-inducible factors) are transcriptional regulators that play a central role in the response to hypoxia. Overexpression of HIF-1alpha in many cancers is associated with a poor response to treatment and increased patient mortality. Our objectives in the present study were to investigate whether HIF-1 was activated in HTLV-1-infected T-cells and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of HIF-1 activation by focusing on the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. We detected a potent pathway that activated HIF-1 in the HTLV-1-infected T-cells under a normal oxygen concentration. Enhanced HIF-1alpha protein expression and HIF-1 DNA-binding activity were exhibited in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Knockdown of HIF-1alpha by siRNA (small interfering RNA) suppressed the growth and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) expression of the HTLV-1-infected T-cell line. HIF-1 protein accumulation and transcriptional activity were enhanced by Tax, which was inhibited by dominant-negative Akt. Importantly, mutant forms of Tax that are defective in activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway failed to induce HIF-1 transcriptional activity. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 suppressed HIF-1alpha protein expression, HIF-1 DNA-binding and HIF-1 transcriptional activity in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. In primary ATL cells, HIF-1alpha protein levels were strongly correlated with levels of phosphorylated Akt. The results of the present study suggest that PI3K/Akt activation induced by Tax leads to activation of HIF-1. As HIF-1 plays a major role in tumour progression, it may represent a molecular target for the development of novel ATL therapeutics.","['Tomita, Mariko', 'Semenza, Gregg L', 'Michiels, Canine', 'Matsuda, Takehiro', 'Uchihara, Jun-Nosuke', 'Okudaira, Taeko', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Taira, Naoya', 'Ohshiro, Kazuiku', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Tomita M', 'Semenza GL', 'Michiels C', 'Matsuda T', 'Uchihara JN', 'Okudaira T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Taira N', 'Ohshiro K', 'Mori N']","['Division of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara 903-0215, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adult', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/06/20 09:00,2007/09/05 09:00,['2007/06/20 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2007 Sep 1;406(2):317-23. doi: 10.1042/BJ20070286.,,,,"['BJ20070286 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20070286 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1948965,,,,,,,,,['Biochem J. 2011 Mar 15;434(3):571.

METHODS: Thirty-six untreated lymphoblastic lymphoma patients aged from 3 to 18 years were included, with 1 patient in stage II , 9 in stage III and 26 in stage IV. Of these 36 patients, 28 (77.7%) were diagnosed as T cell phenotype, 26 (72. 2%) were found to have mediastinal mass, 21 (58. 3%) had bone marrow involvement. All patients received chemotherapy of modified BFM-90 regimen consisting of induction remission, central nerve system prophylaxis, re-induction remission and maintenance therapy. Total treatment duration was two years. The difference from standard BFM-90 is that we omitted cranial radiotherapy but gave regular high dose methotrexate (MTX) iv infusion and intrathecal MTX therapy during maintenance therapy period. Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate survival rate. RESULTS: Of 36 patients, 32 (88%) achieved complete remission (CR) , 1 (2. 7%) partial remission (PR) with an overall response rate of 90.7%. One patient had disease progression ( DP). Two patients received autologous stem cell transplantation at CR1, and two patients received radiotherapy to mediastinum. Totally, 5 patients relapsed, while 2 of them were still alive after salvage chemotherapy. The other 3 died of tumor progression. Two patients died during induction remission, 1 of fungal septicemia, the other of cerebral hemorrhage; one PR and one DP patient died of disease, therefore, totally 7 patients died at last.

METHODS: Bisulfite-modified DNA was used as a template for PCR amplification, resulting in conversion of unmethylated cytosine, but not methylated cytosine, into thymine within CpG islands of interest. Five sets of oligonucleotide probes were designed to fabricate a DNA microarray to detect the methylation changes of E-cadherin gene CpG islands in acute leukemia.

RESULTS: Microarray assay was successfully used to quantitatively detect methylation changes of E-cadherin gene in 5 acute leukemia samples. Varying degree of methylation was detected in five regions and the hypermethylation region was the same. The result was validated by gene sequencing. CONCLUSION: Microarray assay may be applied as an useful tool for mapping methylation changes in multiple CpG loci and for leukemia research.

It is thought to arise from damage to specific regions of DNA, resulting in chromosome rearrangements or loss. For instance, a deletion on the long arm of chromosome 5 [e.g. del(5q31)] is common in AML patients previously treated with alkylating agents, such as melphalan, or exposed to benzene. Translocations of the MLL gene at 11q23 are frequently observed in AML arising from treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as etoposide. Our goal was to determine whether or not breakage at 5q31 and 11q23 is selectively induced by these chemical agents. To address this question, the comet assay combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (comet-FISH) was used to detect DNA breakage in the specific chromosomal regions in an in vitro model. TK6 lymphoblastoid cells were exposed to melphalan, etoposide or the benzene metabolite, hydroquinone (HQ), at various concentrations. HQ, melphalan and etoposide induced DNA breaks at both 5q31 and 11q23 chromosome regions in a dose-dependant manner. However, HQ produced significantly more DNA damage at 5q31 than at 11q23. Etoposide produce slightly more DNA damage at 11q23 and melphalan had a somewhat greater effect at 5q31, but not significantly so. Thus, HQ and melphalan act similarly, perhaps explaining some similarities between benzene- and alkylating agent-induced AML. Comet-FISH also appears to be a useful approach for detecting and comparing damage to specific chromosome regions of significance in leukaemogenesis.","['Escobar, Patricia A', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Vasishta, Ananth', 'Hubbard, Alan E', 'Zhang, Luoping']","['Escobar PA', 'Smith MT', 'Vasishta A', 'Hubbard AE', 'Zhang L']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, 140 Warren Hall, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Comet Assay/*methods', '*DNA Damage', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2007/06/19 09:00,2008/01/16 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2007 Sep;22(5):321-7. doi: 10.1093/mutage/gem020.

In this study, proteomic analysis of adaphostin-treated myeloid leukemia cell lines was used to further elucidate a mechanism of action. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HL60 and K562 cells treated with adaphostin for 6, 12, or 24 h were analyzed using two-dimensional PAGE. Differentially expressed spots were excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The contribution of the redox-active hydroquinone group in adaphostin was also examined by carrying out proteomic analysis of HL60 cells treated with a simple hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene) or H(2)O(2). RESULTS: Analysis of adaphostin-treated cells identified 49 differentially expressed proteins, the majority being implicated in the response to oxidative stress (e.g., CALM, ERP29, GSTP1, PDIA1) or induction of apoptosis (e.g., LAMA, FLNA, TPR, GDIS). Interestingly, modulation of these proteins was almost fully prevented by inclusion of an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine. Validation of the proteomic data confirmed GSTP1 as an adaphostin resistance gene. Subsequent analysis of HL60 cells treated with 1,4-dihydroxybenzene or H(2)O(2) showed similar increases in intracellular peroxides and an almost identical proteomic profiles to that of adaphostin treatment. Western blotting of a panel of cell lines identified Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) as correlating with adaphostin resistance. The role of SOD as a second adaphostin resistance gene was confirmed by demonstrating that inhibition of SOD using diethyldithiocarbamate increased adaphostin sensitivity, whereas transfection of SOD I attenuated toxicity. Importantly, treatment with 1,4-dihydroxybenzene or H(2)O(2) replicated adaphostin-induced Bcr/abl polypeptide degradation, suggesting that kinase inhibition is a ROS-dependent phenomenon. CONCLUSION: Adaphostin should be classified as a redox-active-substituted dihydroquinone.","['Stockwin, Luke H', 'Bumke, Maja A', 'Yu, Sherry X', 'Webb, Simon P', 'Collins, Jack R', 'Hollingshead, Melinda G', 'Newton, Dianne L']","['Stockwin LH', 'Bumke MA', 'Yu SX', 'Webb SP', 'Collins JR', 'Hollingshead MG', 'Newton DL']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Science Applications International Corporation Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (NSC 680410)', '0 (Oxidants)', 'PJY633525U (Adamantane)']",IM,"['Adamantane/*analogs & derivatives/classification/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/classification/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/classification/*pharmacology', 'Oxidants/classification/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Proteomics']",2007/06/19 09:00,2007/10/05 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Jun 15;13(12):3667-81. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0025.,,,['N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['13/12/3667 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0025 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes genomic/protein EPO-R expression and in vitro effects of recombinant human EPO (epoetin) in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL), and multiple myeloma (MM). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Blood samples were obtained from patients with B-CLL, MCL, and healthy volunteers, and bone marrow was obtained from MM patients. EPO-R mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR. EPO-R surface expression was investigated by flow cytometry using digoxigenin-labeled epoetin and polyclonal rabbit anti-EPO-R antibody for intracellular receptor. Tumor cell stimulation was determined in vitro using [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and CD69 expression after exposure to epoetin alpha or beta or darbepoetin alpha. RESULTS: EPO-R mRNA was detected in mononuclear cells from 32 of 41 (78%) B-CLL and 5 of 7 (71%) MCL patients, and 21 of 21 (100%) MM samples. Expression was also detected in highly purified T cells from six of eight B-CLL patients, four of four MM patients, and normal donor B and T cells. Surface EPO-R protein was not detected. Intracellular EPO-R staining with anti-EPO-R antibodies was unspecific. No tumor-stimulatory effect was observed with high epoetin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: EPO-R gene is frequently expressed in lymphoid malignancies and normal B and T cells. However, there was no surface protein expression and no epoetin-induced in vitro stimulation of tumor B cells, indicating that epoetin therapy in vivo is likely to be safe in patients with lymphoid malignancies.","['Kokhaei, Parviz', 'Abdalla, Amir Osman', 'Hansson, Lotta', 'Mikaelsson, Eva', 'Kubbies, Manfred', 'Haselbeck, Anton', 'Jernberg-Wiklund, Helena', 'Mellstedt, Hakan', 'Osterborg, Anders']","['Kokhaei P', 'Abdalla AO', 'Hansson L', 'Mikaelsson E', 'Kubbies M', 'Haselbeck A', 'Jernberg-Wiklund H', 'Mellstedt H', 'Osterborg A']","['Department of Oncology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/06/19 09:00,2007/10/05 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Jun 15;13(12):3536-44. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2828.,,,,"['13/12/3536 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2828 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through structure-activity relationship studies, MPC-6827 and its close structural analogue, MPI-0441138, were discovered as proapoptotic molecules and mitotic inhibitors with potencies at low nanomolar concentrations in multiple tumor cell lines. Photoaffinity and radiolabeled analogues of MPC-6827 were found to bind a 55-kDa protein, and this binding was competed by MPC-6827, paclitaxel, and colchicine, but not vinblastine. MPC-6827 effectively inhibited the polymerization of tubulin in vitro, competed with colchicine binding, and disrupted the formation of microtubules in a variety of tumor cell lines, which together showed the molecular target as tubulin. Treatment of MCF-7 breast carcinoma or Jurkat leukemia cells with MPC-6827 led to pronounced G2-M cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Apoptosis, as determined by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay, was preceded by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c translocation from mitochondria to nuclei, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.

These altered proteins acquire new dimerization properties that result in the assembly of inappropriate multimeric transcription complexes that deregulate hematopoietic programs and induce leukemogenesis. Recently, we reported that the fusion protein AML1/MDS1/EVI1 (AME), a product of a t(3;21)(q26;q22) associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia, displays a complex pattern of self-interaction. Here, we show that the 8th zinc finger motif of MDS1/EVI1 is an oligomerization domain involved not only in interaction of AME with itself but also in interactions with the parental proteins, RUNX1 and MDS1/EVI1, from which AME is generated. Because the 8th zinc finger motif is also present in the oncoprotein EVI1, we have evaluated the effects of the interaction between RUNX1 and EVI1 in vitro and in vivo. We found that in vitro, this interaction alters the ability of RUNX1 to bind to DNA and to regulate a reporter gene, whereas in vivo, the expression of the isolated 8th zinc finger motif of EVI1 is sufficient to block the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells, leading to cell death. As EVI1 is not detected in normal bone marrow cells, these data suggest that its inappropriate expression could contribute to hematopoietic transformation in part by a new mechanism that involves EVI1 association with key hematopoietic regulators, leading to their functional impairment.","['Senyuk, Vitalyi', 'Sinha, Kislay K', 'Li, Donglan', 'Rinaldi, Ciro R', 'Yanamandra, Sastry', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina']","['Senyuk V', 'Sinha KK', 'Li D', 'Rinaldi CR', 'Yanamandra S', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MDS1-EVI1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*chemistry/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Zinc Fingers/physiology']",2007/06/19 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jun 15;67(12):5658-66. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3962.,,,"['CA96448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL082935/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL72691/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL79580/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['67/12/5658 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3962 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we determine whether T-ALL mutations occur not only in Notch1 but also in the F-box protein hCdc4 (Sel-10, Ago, or Fbxw7), a negative regulator of Notch1. We show that the hCDC4 gene is mutated in leukemic cells from more than 30% of patients with pediatric T-ALL and derived cell lines. Most hCDC4 mutations found were missense substitutions at critical arginine residues (Arg(465), Arg(479), and Arg(505)) localized in the substrate-binding region of hCdc4. Cells inactivated for hCdc4 and T-ALL cells containing hCDC4 mutations exhibited an increased Notch1 protein half-life, consistent with the proposed role of hCdc4 in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of Notch1. Furthermore, restoration of wild-type but not mutant hCdc4 in HCT 116 hCDC4-negative cells led to an increased Notch1 ubiquitylation and decreased Notch1 signaling. These results show that hCdc4 mutations interfere with normal Notch1 regulation in vivo. Finally, we found that mutations in hCDC4 and NOTCH1 can occur in the same cancers and that patients carrying hCDC4 and/or NOTCH1 mutations have a favorable overall survival. Collectively, these data show that mutation of hCDC4 is a frequent event in T-ALL and suggest that hCDC4 mutations and gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH1 might synergize in contributing to the development of pediatric T-ALL leukemogenesis.","['Malyukova, Alena', 'Dohda, Takeaki', 'von der Lehr, Natalie', 'Akhoondi, Shahab', 'Corcoran, Martin', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Spruck, Charles', 'Grander, Dan', 'Lendahl, Urban', 'Sangfelt, Olle']","['Malyukova A', 'Dohda T', 'von der Lehr N', 'Akhoondi S', 'Corcoran M', 'Heyman M', 'Spruck C', 'Grander D', 'Lendahl U', 'Sangfelt O']","['Department of Oncology/Pathology, Cancer Center Karolinska, Karolinska Sjukhuset, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/metabolism']",2007/06/19 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jun 15;67(12):5611-6. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4381.,,,,"['67/12/5611 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4381 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,"['Cancer Res. 2008 Mar 15;68(6):2051.

Dia1 binds to the leukemia-associated Rho-GEF (LARG) through RhoA-dependent release of Dia1 autoinhibition. The FH2 domain stimulates the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of LARG in vitro.

These results may indicate a key role of TRIB1 (and MYC) overexpression in the pathogenesis of a certain AML subtype.","['Rothlisberger, Benno', 'Heizmann, Marc', 'Bargetzi, Mario J', 'Huber, Andreas R']","['Rothlisberger B', 'Heizmann M', 'Bargetzi MJ', 'Huber AR']","['Center of Laboratory Medicine, Kantonsspital Aarau, CH-5000 Arau, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (TRIB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', '*Ring Chromosomes']",2007/06/19 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2007 Jul 1;176(1):58-60. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2007.03.003.,,,,"['S0165-4608(07)00129-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2007.03.003 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all, 110 cases of AML/MDS were recruited based on the presence of chromosome 5 abnormalities under conventional cytogenetics and supplemented by a systematic fluorescence in situ hybridization study of chromosomes 5 and 7. The abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q) were deletions of various sizes and sometimes cryptic. The 5q abnormalities were associated with translocations in 54% of cases and were simple deletions in 46%. In 68% of cases, 5q deletions were associated with chromosome 7 abnormalities, and 90% of these presented a complex karyotype. Of the 110 patients, 28 had a hematopoietic disorder secondary to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both. Among 82 patients with de novo AML/MDS, 63 were older than 60 years. Chromosomal abnormalities often associated hypodiploidy and chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities in complex karyotypes, features resembling those of secondary hemopathies. Systematic investigation of the exposure to mutagens and oncogenes is thus essential to specify the factors potentially involved in MDS/AML with 5q abnormalities.","['Lessard, M', 'Helias, C', 'Struski, S', 'Perrusson, N', 'Uettwiller, F', 'Mozziconacci, M-J', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, M', 'Dastugue, N', 'Terre, C', 'Brizard, F', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, P', 'Mugneret, F', 'Barin, C', 'Herry, A', 'Luquet, I', 'Desangles, F', 'Michaux, L', 'Verellen-Dumoulin, C', 'Perrot, C', 'Van den Akker, J', 'Lespinasse, J', 'Eclache, V', 'Berger, R']","['Lessard M', 'Helias C', 'Struski S', 'Perrusson N', 'Uettwiller F', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Dastugue N', 'Terre C', 'Brizard F', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Mugneret F', 'Barin C', 'Herry A', 'Luquet I', 'Desangles F', 'Michaux L', 'Verellen-Dumoulin C', 'Perrot C', 'Van den Akker J', 'Lespinasse J', 'Eclache V', 'Berger R']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Hautepierre Hospital, Avenue Moliere, Strasbourg 67098, France.

However, recent studies have revealed that colonic adenocarcinomas can be efficiently and rapidly induced by combined treatment with PhIP and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), a potent inducer of colitis. In the present study, the authors investigated the effects of inflammation on PhIP-induced carcinogenesis using two mouse strains, C57BL/6J and MSM/Ms, showing distinct temporal profiles of inflammatory responses to DSS. A long-term carcinogenesis experiment conducted with a single i.g. administration of PhIP (200 mg/kg body weight), followed by DSS treatment in drinking water for 4-6 days, revealed an increase in tumor incidence in C57BL/6J mice in accordance with the DSS intake. In contrast, neoplastic lesions were rarely observed in the MSM/Ms strain. From the short-term exposure to DSS for 4 days, C57BL/6J mice demonstrated severe chronic colitis, accompanied by hyperplastic cryptal epithelium and extensive cellular infiltration. Splenomegaly and swelling of mesenteric lymph nodes were also evident for over 1 month as chronic symptoms of systemic immunological disturbance. However, no inflammatory lesions were detected in MSM/Ms mice. The present results provide strong evidence that prolonged chronic inflammatory responses induced by DSS are directly responsible for the observed enhancement of PhIP-induced large bowel carcinogenicity.","['Nakanishi, Masako', 'Tazawa, Hiroshi', 'Tsuchiya, Naoto', 'Sugimura, Takashi', 'Tanaka, Takuji', 'Nakagama, Hitoshi']","['Nakanishi M', 'Tazawa H', 'Tsuchiya N', 'Sugimura T', 'Tanaka T', 'Nakagama H']","['Biochemistry Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '9042-14-2 (Dextran Sulfate)', '909C6UN66T (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*chemically induced/etiology', 'Animals', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'Colitis/*chemically induced', 'Colon/drug effects/immunology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*chemically induced/etiology', 'Dextran Sulfate/administration & dosage/*toxicity', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', '*Species Specificity', 'Time Factors']",2007/06/19 09:00,2007/10/02 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2007 Aug;98(8):1157-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00528.x.

We have shown previously that MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) mRNA levels in K562 leukaemic cells exposed to cytotoxic drugs are up-regulated but P-glycoprotein expression is translationally blocked. In the present study we show that cytotoxic drugs down-regulate the Akt signalling pathway, leading to hypophosphorylation of the translational repressor 4E-BP [eIF (eukaryotic initiation factor) 4E-binding protein] and decreased eIF4E availability. The 5'-end of MDR1 mRNA adopts a highly-structured fold. Fusion of this structured 5'-region upstream of a reporter gene impeded its efficient translation, specifically under cytotoxic stress, by reducing its competitive ability for the translational machinery. The effect of cytotoxic stress could be mimicked in vivo by blocking the phosphorylation of 4E-BP by mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) using rapamycin or eIF4E siRNA (small interfering RNA), and relieved by overexpression of either eIF4E or constitutively-active Akt. Upon drug exposure MDR1 mRNA was up-regulated, apparently stochastically, in a small proportion of cells. Only in these cells could MDR1 mRNA compete successfully for the reduced amounts of eIF4E and translate P-glycoprotein. Consequent drug efflux and restoration of eIF4E availability results in a feed-forward relief from stress-induced translational repression and to the acquisition of drug resistance.","['Randle, Rebecca A', 'Raguz, Selina', 'Higgins, Christopher F', 'Yague, Ernesto']","['Randle RA', 'Raguz S', 'Higgins CF', 'Yague E']","['MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/*genetics/metabolism"", 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/genetics/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2007/06/19 09:00,2007/10/03 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2007 Sep 15;406(3):445-55. doi: 10.1042/BJ20070235.,,,,"['BJ20070235 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20070235 [doi]']",,,,,PMC2049040,,,,,,,,,

The number of nocturnal awakenings was related to fatigue by patient report; patients who experienced 20 or more awakenings had significantly higher fatigue scores than those with fewer awakenings. Nocturnal awakenings also were significantly associated with sleep duration by patient and parent report. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized pediatric patients with cancer who experience more nocturnal awakenings are more fatigued and sleep longer. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses may be able to control some of the factors that contribute to nocturnal awakenings and sleep environment interruptions that affect fatigue and sleep duration in hospitalized pediatric patients with cancer.","['Hinds, Pamela S', 'Hockenberry, Marilyn', 'Rai, Shesh N', 'Zhang, Lijun', 'Razzouk, Bassem I', 'McCarthy, Kathy', 'Cremer, Lola', 'Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos']","['Hinds PS', 'Hockenberry M', 'Rai SN', 'Zhang L', 'Razzouk BI', 'McCarthy K', 'Cremer L', 'Rodriguez-Galindo C']","[""Division of Nursing Research, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. pam.hinds@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Dyssomnias/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Fatigue/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/nursing', ""Patients' Rooms"", 'Pilot Projects', 'Texas']",2007/06/19 09:00,2007/09/01 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2007 Mar;34(2):393-402. doi: 10.1188/07.ONF.393-402.,,,['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['67MH51X6KPW3U235 [pii]', '10.1188/07.ONF.393-402 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) accelerates apoptosis in inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, but uniquely delays neutrophil apoptosis. Corresponding to the opposite effects of Dex on granulocyte apoptosis, we demonstrate that in neutrophils and eosinophils Dex oppositely affects expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1L. Mcl-1L expression declines over time in vitro; however, Dex maintains Mcl-1L expression in neutrophils. In contrast, Dex accelerates Mcl-1L protein loss in eosinophils. Neither Mcl-1S, a pro-apoptotic splice variant, nor Bax were affected. Dex treatment in the presence of a translation inhibitor stabilized existing Mcl-1L protein in neutrophils, while Mcl-1L stability in eosinophils was unaffected. Accordingly, delay of neutrophil apoptosis by Dex was prevented by antisense Mcl-1L siRNA. Our findings suggest that regulation of Mcl-1L degradation plays an important role in the opposite effects of Dex on granulocyte apoptosis.","['Sivertson, Kelly L', 'Seeds, Michael C', 'Long, David L', 'Peachman, Kristina K', 'Bass, David A']","['Sivertson KL', 'Seeds MC', 'Long DL', 'Peachman KK', 'Bass DA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/06/19 09:00,2007/09/06 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 2007 Mar;246(1):34-45. doi: 10.1016/j.cellimm.2007.05.003.

Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome occurred in 35.2% patients at diagnosis. Two-thirds of patients received allogeneic BMT in first complete remission (CR1) BMT. Salvage BMT was performed in 21 and 16 patients at second complete remission (CR2) and beyond CR2. Donors were human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings in 87 patients, and match-unrelated donors in 21 patients. Conditioning contained total body irradiation (TBI) in 92.6% patients. Overall survival (OS) for BMT at CR1 and BMT beyond CR1 were 46.2 and 20.3% at 15 years. Multivariate analyses (including age, sex, disease status, donor type, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), stem cell source, cytogenetics, grade 1/2 aGVHD and TBI-containing conditioning regimen) identified age<35, BMT at CR1 and grade 1/2 aGVHD as favorable factors for OS. Disease-free survival (DFS) for BMT at CR1 and beyond CR1 were 45.8 and 15.9% at 15 years, respectively, with BMT at CR1, age<35 and grade 1/2 aGVHD being favorable factors for DFS. Importantly, conventional adverse risk factors such as the Ph chromosome, B-cell phenotype and high leukocyte count were not associated with inferior survivals. In summary, the adverse impact of Ph chromosome, B-cell phenotype and high leukocyte count was overcome by allogeneic BMT. Matched unrelated donor transplantation appears promising.","['Chim, C S', 'Lie, A K W', 'Liang, R', 'Au, W Y', 'Kwong, Y L']","['Chim CS', 'Lie AK', 'Liang R', 'Au WY', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, 102 Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China. jcschim@hku.hk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/06/19 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007 Aug;40(4):339-47. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705734.

When testing established acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines we found the monocytic cell line THP-1 to be sensitive to IFN-alpha plus LPS induced apoptosis, which was partially dependent on caspase-8 and was associated with an enhanced expression of Fas/CD95. We extended our study to 29 short term blast lines from patients with AML and observed additive effects of IFN-alpha and LPS on cell death only with few samples indicating that sensitivity to IFN-alpha plus LPS inducible apoptosis is present in a fraction of AML samples only with no obvious correlation with certain FAB phenotypes.","['Lehner, Manfred', 'Bailo, Marco', 'Stachel, Daniel', 'Roesler, Wolf', 'Parolini, Ornella', 'Holter, Wolfgang']","['Lehner M', 'Bailo M', 'Stachel D', 'Roesler W', 'Parolini O', 'Holter W']","[""Laboratory of Cellular Therapy, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's University Hospital, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuernberg, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 8/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*physiology']",2007/06/19 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Dec;31(12):1729-35. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.05.001.

METHOD: Twenty-five patients aged 61-78 years (median 70 years) with de novo (n = 17) or secondary (n = 8) AML (cytogenetic risk: favourable 2, intermediate 18, adverse 2, unknown 3) from eight Australian centres were enrolled. Treatment comprised mitoxantrone 6 mg/m(2) intravenously daily for 3 days, cytarabine 10mg/m(2) subcutaneously every 12 hours for 7-14 days and etoposide 100mg orally for 7-14 days. RESULTS: The treatment was generally well tolerated, and 13 patients (52%) achieved a complete remission (CR). One patient achieved a partial remission but died on day 28 due to pneumonia. Five patients (20%) had no response, whilst six (24%) died on or before day 30 and so were not evaluable. The median overall survival (OS) was 6.5 months, and the median remission duration was 7.7 months. Estimated 1-year survival was 32%, but patients achieving CR had an estimated 1-year survival of 64%, whereas none in the non-CR group survived to 1 year. Two of the CR patients have survived beyond 2 years. OS was significantly shorter in the adverse cytogenetic risk group of patients compared with the favourable- and intermediate-risk groups, with the rates of death relative to the adverse group being 0.02 and 0.08 in the favourable- and intermediate-risk groups, respectively. There was no significant association between CR rate and pre-existing myelodysplasia or the presence of multilineage dysplasia. The median durations of significant neutropenia (<0.5 x 10(9)/L) and thrombocytopenia (<20 x10(9)/L) with the first course of treatment in the 19 evaluable patients were 19 days (range 12-26) and 11 days (range 1-25), respectively. The median duration of stay in the hospital was 27 days (range 14-42). These values were much shorter for the second course of treatment: 6 days, 5 days and 15 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of this multicentre, phase II study validate the previously reported single-institution experience with the FLICC protocol in elderly patients with AML. The clinical outcome with this protocol is comparable to those reported with more aggressive anti-leukaemia protocols.","['Manoharan, Arumugam', 'Reynolds, John', 'Matthews, Jane', 'Baxter, Heather', 'Di Iulio, Juliana', 'Leahy, Michael', 'Juneja, Surender']","['Manoharan A', 'Reynolds J', 'Matthews J', 'Baxter H', 'Di Iulio J', 'Leahy M', 'Juneja S']","['St. George Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. a.manoharan@bigpond.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/06/19 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs Aging. 2007;24(6):481-8. doi: 10.2165/00002512-200724060-00004.,,['Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group'],,"['2464 [pii]', '10.2165/00002512-200724060-00004 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib mesylate (formerly STI-571), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is highly effective at the hematological, cytogenetic and molecular level in CML. AIMS: To evaluate hematological and molecular response in CML patients on Imatinib and also the side effects of the therapy if any. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen patients were diagnosed as having chronic phase CML at Kasturba Medical College Hospital, Attavar, Mangalore during the period of two years from January 2004 to January 2006 and were given Imatinib at 400 mg/day orally. They were followed closely over a period of 1 year using the following parameters: (1) monthly clinical examination, (2) monthly peripheral blood smear examination, (3) real time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT Q-PCR) for BCR-ABL at the end of every 6 months. The findings were evaluated after one year for hematological and molecular response achieved. RESULTS: Fifteen (93.75%) patients achieved complete hematological response within three months of therapy. Six (37.5%) patients achieved complete molecular response(CMR) within six months of therapy as measured by real time RT Q-PCR. None of the patients who did not achieve CMR within first six months of therapy achieved it after one year of therapy. No patient lost the initial response. The median BCR--ABL/ABL value at the end of the six months was 11% and at the end of the one year was 3.38%. CONCLUSION: Imatinib mesylate is highly effective in the treatment of chronic phase CML and so should be considered as the drug of first choice in CML. Molecular response evaluation after six months can predict the subsequent molecular response and can also be usedas a surrogate monitor of the marrow cytogenetic response to imatinib therapy in CML.","['Gupta, A', 'Prasad, K']","['Gupta A', 'Prasad K']","['Department of Medicine, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",India,J Assoc Physicians India,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,7505585,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Targeting', 'Hematology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/trends', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', '*Treatment Outcome']",2007/06/19 09:00,2007/07/11 09:00,['2007/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Assoc Physicians India. 2007 Feb;55:109-13.,,,,,,,,,,,['J Assoc Physicians India. 2007 Feb;55:99-100.

METHODS: This was a descriptive, prospective study conducted from May 2001 to September 2006. One hundred and thirty six patients with diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase were analyzed. Hematologic and cytogenetic responses were assessed according to defined criteria. RESULTS: The median age at time of diagnosis was 33 years (range, 12-65 years). Among them 86 were males, 50 were females. At the end of study response was analyzed overall and according to Sokal score. At median follow-up of 18 months, 122 patients were evaluable for cytogenetic response. Complete hematologic response was seen 86% while complete and major cytogenetic response was observed in 34.4% and 49.2% cases respectively. Analysis of variables like younger age, disease duration at time of starting imatinib failed to show any significant influence on response to imatinib mesylate, however, response was found to be higher in patients who had low Sokal score at the time of presentation. CONCLUSION: Imatinib mesylate has substantial activity in chronic phase of CML.

Case study.,727-30,"UNLABELLED: A 43-year-old patient admitted with acute myelogenous leukemia, developed bronchopneumonia and sepsis during profound neutropenia. Fever and pulmonary infiltrates did not improve by using empiric antibacterial therapy (Cefoperazona-Sulbactam, Trimethoprim-Sulphametoxazol). Blood and sputum culture were performed and patient received Voriconazol. Both cultures, from blood and sputum, yielded Candida guilliermondii after 48 hours of incubations. The isolates have the same biochemical and antimicrobial spectrum and were susceptible to Amphotericin B and Fluconazole. After a few days of therapy with Voriconazol, fever disappeared and the clinical state of patient was improved. A culture from pharyngeal swab, performed after 11 days, yielded the same microorganism. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The emergence of less common, but medically important fungal pathogens, including Candida guilliermondii, contributes to the rate of morbidity and mortality, especially in the increasingly expanding population of immunocompromised patients. (2) We consider that the oropharyngeal colonization with Candida guilliermondii and profound neutropenia predispose our patient to develop bronchopneumonia and candidemia.","['Panzaru, Carmen', 'Dan, Maria', 'Burcoveanu, Cristina', 'Mereuta, Ana', 'Buiuc, D']","['Panzaru C', 'Dan M', 'Burcoveanu C', 'Mereuta A', 'Buiuc D']","['Gr.

METHODS: MTT assay was used to determine the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50). Flow cytometry and DAPI staining were employed to determine the apoptosis; JC-1 staining was used to determine mitochondria membrane potential (DeltaPsim); Western-blotting was used to determine protein expression of procaspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, PARP, Bax, Bcl-2 and HIF-1alpha. RESULTS: In hypoxic environment, Q39 exerted higher antiproliferative activity in K562 cells, and the IC50 value was (0.21+/- 0.05) micromol/L. The apoptotic phenomenon was observed at 6 h after cells exposed to Q39, and apoptotic body emerged as exposure time increased. After K562 cells were incubated with Q39 for 0, 6, 12 and 24 h, the ratio of apoptotic cells was 2.8%, 3.2%, 5.9% and 19.2%, respectively. By fluorescence stain assay, an significant Delta Psim loss in K562 cells induced by Q39 was shown in a time-dependent manner. Western blot assay demonstrated that Q39 decreased the protein expression of Bcl-2, procaspase-3, and HIF-1alpha, meanwhile increased protein expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3, and induced the cleavage of PARP. CONCLUSIONS: The novel compound Q39 exhibits great anticancer activity against K562 cells in hypoxic environment. Q39 can downregulate the protein expression of HIF-1alpha, and regulate the apoptosis-related protein expression to cause a drop of DeltaPsim, suggesting that mitochondria and HIF-1alpha pathway might be involved in the antiproliferative effect of Q39.","['Zhang, Bo', 'Weng, Qin-jie', 'Chen, Zhong-ting']","['Zhang B', 'Weng QJ', 'Chen ZT']","['College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

In the heart, among EGF family members, neuregulin-1beta (NRG-1beta, a paracrine factor produced from endothelium) induced remarkable tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and Gab2 via erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene (ErbB) receptors. We examined the role of Gab family proteins in NRG-1beta/ErbB-mediated signal in the heart by creating cardiomyocyte-specific Gab1/Gab2 double knockout mice (DKO mice). Although DKO mice were viable, they exhibited marked ventricular dilatation and reduced contractility with aging. DKO mice showed high mortality after birth because of heart failure. In addition, we noticed remarkable endocardial fibroelastosis and increase of abnormally dilated vessels in the ventricles of DKO mice. NRG-1beta induced activation of both ERK and AKT in the hearts of control mice but not in those of DKO mice. Using DNA microarray analysis, we found that stimulation with NRG-1beta upregulated expression of an endothelium-stabilizing factor, angiopoietin 1, in the hearts of control mice but not in those of DKO mice, which accounted for the pathological abnormalities in the DKO hearts. Taken together, our observations indicated that in the NRG-1beta/ErbB signaling, Gab1 and Gab2 of the myocardium are essential for both maintenance of myocardial function and stabilization of cardiac capillary and endocardial endothelium in the postnatal heart.","['Nakaoka, Yoshikazu', 'Nishida, Keigo', 'Narimatsu, Masahiro', 'Kamiya, Atsunori', 'Minami, Takashi', 'Sawa, Hirofumi', 'Okawa, Katsuya', 'Fujio, Yasushi', 'Koyama, Tatsuya', 'Maeda, Makiko', 'Sone, Manami', 'Yamasaki, Satoru', 'Arai, Yuji', 'Koh, Gou Young', 'Kodama, Tatsuhiko', 'Hirota, Hisao', 'Otsu, Kinya', 'Hirano, Toshio', 'Mochizuki, Naoki']","['Nakaoka Y', 'Nishida K', 'Narimatsu M', 'Kamiya A', 'Minami T', 'Sawa H', 'Okawa K', 'Fujio Y', 'Koyama T', 'Maeda M', 'Sone M', 'Yamasaki S', 'Arai Y', 'Koh GY', 'Kodama T', 'Hirota H', 'Otsu K', 'Hirano T', 'Mochizuki N']","['Department of Structural Analysis, National Cardiovascular Center Research Institute, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (Gab1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gab2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neuregulin-1)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-erbB)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Angiopoietin-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cardiovascular Abnormalities/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heart/*physiology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Neuregulin-1/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-erbB/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/06/16 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/06/16 09:00'],"['2006/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2007 Jul;117(7):1771-81. doi: 10.1172/JCI30651.,,,,['10.1172/JCI30651 [doi]'],,,,,PMC1888569,,,,,,,,,

The inv(16)(p13q22) or, less commonly, the t(16;16)(p13;q22) causes fusion of the CBFbeta gene at 16q22 and the MYH11 gene at 16p13, creating the novel chimeric protein CBFbeta-MYH11. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms unique to M4Eo biology, we determined the gene expression profile of M4Eo cases by using cDNA and long oligonucleotide microarrays. Cases of acute myelomonocytic leukemia without CBFbeta-MYH11 (M4) acted as our control. We found that in the gene expression profile of M4Eo, NF-kappaB activators and inhibitors were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, suggesting that the NF-kappaB signaling pathway is activated at a higher level in M4Eo than in acute myelomonocytic leukemia M4. In addition, the gene expression profile of M4Eo indicates high cell proliferation and low apoptosis. We used real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry immunophenotyping to confirm some of our microarray data. These findings most likely represent the functional consequences of the abnormal chimeric protein CBFbeta-MYH11, which is unique to this disease, and suggest that NF-kappaB is a potential therapeutic target for treating M4Eo patients.","['Sun, Xiaoping', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Ramdas, Latha', 'Stivers, David N', 'Jones, Daniel M', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Vadhan-Raj, Saroj', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Sun X', 'Zhang W', 'Ramdas L', 'Stivers DN', 'Jones DM', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Estey EH', 'Vadhan-Raj S', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosome Inversion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factor RelA/analysis']",2007/06/16 09:00,2007/09/22 09:00,['2007/06/16 09:00'],"['2007/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2007 Aug;20(8):811-20. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3800829.

However, the mechanisms remain obscure. The present study focused on various caspase pathways that may be involved in TCS-induced apoptosis in leukemia HL-60 cells. Key caspases in both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways including caspase-8, -9 and -3 were activated upon TCS treatment. Additionally, TCS treatment induced upregulation of BiP and CHOP and also activated caspase-4, which for the first time strongly supported the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway in TCS-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, although caspase-8 was activated, Fas/Fas ligand pathway was not involved as evidenced by a lack of induction of Fas or Fas ligand and a lack of inhibitory effect of anti-Fas blocking antibody on TCS-induced apoptosis. Instead, caspase-8 was activated in a caspase-9 and -4 dependent manner. The involvement of mitochondria was demonstrated by the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c and Smac besides the activation of caspase-9. Further investigation confirmed that caspase-3 was the major executioner caspase downstream to caspase-9, -4 and -8.

However, the process by which LfcinB triggers mitochondria-dependent apoptosis is not well understood. Here, we show that LfcinB-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T-leukemia cells was preceded by LfcinB binding to, and progressive permeabilization of the cell membrane. Colloidal gold electron microscopy revealed that LfcinB entered the cytoplasm of Jurkat T-leukemia cells prior to the onset of mitochondrial depolarization. LfcinB was not internalized by endocytosis because endocytosis inhibitors did not prevent LfcinB-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, intracellular delivery of LfcinB via fusogenic liposomes caused the death of Jurkat T-leukemia cells, as well as normal human fibroblasts. Collectively, these findings suggest that LfcinB caused damage to the cell membrane that allowed LfcinB to enter the cytoplasm of Jurkat T-leukemia cells and mediate cytotoxicity. In addition, confocal microscopy showed that intracellular LfcinB co-localized with mitochondria in Jurkat T-leukemia cells, while flow cytometry and colloidal gold electron microscopy showed that LfcinB rapidly associated with purified mitochondria. Furthermore, purified mitochondria treated with LfcinB rapidly lost transmembrane potential and released cytochrome c. We conclude that LfcinB-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T-leukemia cells resulted from cell membrane damage and the subsequent disruption of mitochondrial membranes by internalized LfcinB.","['Mader, Jamie S', 'Richardson, Angela', 'Salsman, Jayme', 'Top, Deniz', 'de Antueno, Roberto', 'Duncan, Roy', 'Hoskin, David W']","['Mader JS', 'Richardson A', 'Salsman J', 'Top D', 'de Antueno R', 'Duncan R', 'Hoskin DW']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '146897-68-9 (lactoferricin B)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biotinylation', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/*drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactoferrin/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/ultrastructure']",2007/06/16 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2007/06/16 09:00'],"['2006/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2007 Jul 15;313(12):2634-50. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.05.015.

In normal cells telomeres lose up to 300 bp of DNA per cell division that ultimately leads to senescence; however, most cancer cells bypass this lifespan restriction through the expression of telomerase. hTERT, the catalytic subunit essential for the proper function of telomerase, has been shown to be expressed in approximately 90% of all cancers. In this study we investigated the hTERT inhibiting effects of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol found in green tea catechins, in MCF-7 breast cancers cells and HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Exposure to EGCG reduced cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in both MCF-7 and HL60 cells in vitro, although hTERT mRNA expression was decreased only in MCF-7 cells when treated with EGCG. Furthermore, down-regulation of hTERT gene expression in MCF-7 cells appeared to be largely due to epigenetic alterations. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with EGCG resulted in a time-dependent decrease in hTERT promoter methylation and ablated histone H3 Lys9 acetylation. In conjunction with demethylation, further analysis showed an increase in hTERT repressor E2F-1 binding at the promoter. From these findings, we propose that EGCG is effective in causing cell death in both MCF-7 and HL60 cancer cell lines and may work through different pathways involving both anti-oxidant effects and epigenetic modulation.","['Berletch, Joel B', 'Liu, Canhui', 'Love, William K', 'Andrews, Lucy G', 'Katiyar, Santosh K', 'Tollefsbol, Trygve O']","['Berletch JB', 'Liu C', 'Love WK', 'Andrews LG', 'Katiyar SK', 'Tollefsbol TO']","['Department of Biology, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/pathology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/enzymology', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2007/06/16 09:00,2008/05/02 09:00,['2007/06/16 09:00'],"['2007/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 Feb 1;103(2):509-19. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21417.,,,"['U54 CA118948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA114019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA118948-010001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129415/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129415-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA114019-OIA1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA100949/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA100949-010007/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1002/jcb.21417 [doi]'],,,,,PMC2435482,['NIHMS49802'],,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

In this study, to find new targets for imatinib-resistant CML displaying loss of Bcr-Abl kinase target dependence, we isolated imatinib-resistant variants, K562/R1, K562/R2, and K562/R3, which showed profound declines of Bcr-Abl levels and its tyrosine kinase activity, from K562 cells. Importantly, the imatinib resistance mechanism in these variants also included aberrant acetylation of nonhistone proteins such as p53, Ku70, and Hsp90 that was due to upregulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and down-regulation of histone acetyltransferase (HAT). In comparison with K562 cells, the imatinib-resistant variants showed up-regulation of HDAC1, -2, and -3 (class I HDACs) and class III SIRT1 and down-regulation of CBP/p300 and PCAF with HAT activity, and thereby p53 and cytoplasmic Ku70 were aberrantly acetylated. In addition, these were associated with down-regulation of Bax and up-regulation of Bcl-2. In contrast, the class II HDAC6 level was significantly decreased, and this was accompanied by an increase of Hsp90 acetylation in the imatinib-resistant variants, which was closely associated with loss of Bcr-Abl. These results indicate that alteration of the normal balance of HATs and HDACs leads to deregulated acetylation of Hsp90, p53, and Ku70 and thereby leads to imatinib resistance, suggesting the importance of the acetylation status of apoptosis-related nonhistone proteins in Bcr-Abl-independent imatinib resistance. We also revealed that imatinib-resistant K562 cells were more sensitive to suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, an HDAC inhibitor, than K562 cells. These findings may have implications for HDAC as a molecular target in imatinib-resistant leukemia cells.","['Lee, Sang Min', 'Bae, Jae Ho', 'Kim, Mi Ju', 'Lee, Hyun Sun', 'Lee, Min Ki', 'Chung, Byung Seon', 'Kim, Dong Wan', 'Kang, Chi Dug', 'Kim, Sun Hee']","['Lee SM', 'Bae JH', 'Kim MJ', 'Lee HS', 'Lee MK', 'Chung BS', 'Kim DW', 'Kang CD', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Research Center for Ischemic Tissue Regeneration, College of Medicine, Pusan National University, Pusan 602-739, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acylation', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2007/06/16 09:00,2007/10/20 09:00,['2007/06/16 09:00'],"['2007/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2007 Sep;322(3):1084-92. doi: 10.1124/jpet.107.124461.

DEK-CAN and CAN-ABL1 are associated with acute myeloid leukemia and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively, whereas SET-CAN was identified in a patient with acute undifferentiated leukemia. In addition, SET is overexpressed in solid tumors of the breast, uterus, stomach, and rectum. Ectopic expression of SET-CAN inhibits vitamin-D(3)-induced differentiation of the human promonocytic U937cells, whereas ectopic SET expression induces differentiation. Here, we assessed the leukemogenic potential of SET-CAN in the hematopoietic system of transgenic mice. Although SET-CAN mice showed expansion of an early progenitor cell pool and partial depletion of lymphocytes, the animals were not leukemia-prone and did not show shortening of disease latency after retroviral tagging. This suggests that SET-CAN expression in acute undifferentiated leukemia might determine the primitive phenotype of the disease, whereas secondary genetic lesions are necessary for disease development. Surprisingly, SET-CAN mice developed spontaneous hyperplasia of the stomach mucosa, which coincided with overexpression of beta-catenin and vastly increased numbers of proliferating gastric mucosa cells, suggesting a role of SET-CAN in proliferation of certain epithelial cells.","['Ozbek, Ugur', 'Kandilci, Ayten', 'van Baal, Sjozef', 'Bonten, Jacqueline', 'Boyd, Kelli', 'Franken, Patrick', 'Fodde, Riccardo', 'Grosveld, Gerard C']","['Ozbek U', 'Kandilci A', 'van Baal S', 'Bonten J', 'Boyd K', 'Franken P', 'Fodde R', 'Grosveld GC']","[""Department of Genetics and Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup214 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian/genetics', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gastric Mucosa/chemistry/metabolism/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis', 'Leukemia/blood/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2007/06/16 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/06/16 09:00'],"['2007/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2007 Aug;171(2):654-66. doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2007.060934.

No significant differences were found for number or severity of adverse side effects as a function of active medication. CONCLUSIONS: MPH shows some neurocognitive benefit and is well tolerated by the majority of children surviving ALL and BT.","['Conklin, Heather M', 'Khan, Raja B', 'Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Helton, Susan', 'Brown, Ronald', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Bonner, Melanie', 'Christensen, Robbin', 'Wu, Shengjie', 'Xiong, Xiaoping', 'Mulhern, Raymond K']","['Conklin HM', 'Khan RB', 'Reddick WE', 'Helton S', 'Brown R', 'Howard SC', 'Bonner M', 'Christensen R', 'Wu S', 'Xiong X', 'Mulhern RK']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. heather.conklin@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Psychol,Journal of pediatric psychology,7801773,['207ZZ9QZ49 (Methylphenidate)'],IM,"['Brain/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition/*drug effects', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylphenidate/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/*psychology', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Wechsler Scales']",2007/06/16 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/06/16 09:00'],"['2007/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Psychol. 2007 Oct;32(9):1127-39. doi: 10.1093/jpepsy/jsm045.

As new treatments are developed, a critical review of data from past treatment eras is needed to identify clinically relevant risk groups. METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of 220 patients with ESFT who were treated on protocols at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital from 1979 to 2004. Two treatment eras were defined. Factors predictive of outcome were analyzed to identify distinct risk groups. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 13.7 years (range, 1.1-25.2 years). Metastatic disease was associated with tumors measuring >8 cm (P = .002) and axial location (P = .014). The 5-year overall survival (OS) estimate (63.5% +/- 3.5%) did not appear to differ by protocol. Tumor stage and size were found to be the only independent predictors of outcome. Treatment era and type of local control therapy were found to influence the outcome of patients with localized disease. Four risk groups were defined: favorable risk (age <14 years with localized, nonpelvic tumors), intermediate risk (localized, age >/=14 years, or pelvic tumors), unfavorable-pulmonary (isolated lung metastases), and unfavorable-extrapulmonary (extrapulmonary metastases). The 5-year OS estimates for these groups were 88.1% +/- 4.4%, 64.9% +/- 5.2%, 53.8% +/- 9.4%, and 27.2% +/- 7.3%, respectively (P < .001). The incidence of therapy-related leukemia was significantly higher during the second treatment era, when more intensified regimens were used (6.1% +/- 2.7% vs 0% +/- 0%; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: Risk stratification schemes such as this should be used to prospectively evaluate novel risk-based therapies. Studies of biologic pathways may help to refine this model.","['Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos', 'Liu, Tiebin', 'Krasin, Matthew J', 'Wu, Jianrong', 'Billups, Catherine A', 'Daw, Najat C', 'Spunt, Sheri L', 'Rao, Bhaskar N', 'Santana, Victor M', 'Navid, Fariba']","['Rodriguez-Galindo C', 'Liu T', 'Krasin MJ', 'Wu J', 'Billups CA', 'Daw NC', 'Spunt SL', 'Rao BN', 'Santana VM', 'Navid F']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA. rodriquez-galindo@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Medical Audit', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/complications', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/complications/*pathology/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/06 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Jul 15;110(2):375-84. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22821.,,,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1002/cncr.22821 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HSC/P localization and migration between niches depend on cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which result from the cooperation of cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. The CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway, in particular, is essential for myelopoiesis and B lymphopoiesis but the molecular mechanisms of CXCL12 action remain unclear. We previously noted a strong correlation between prolonged CXCL12-mediated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and sustained pro-adhesive responses in progenitor B cells, but not in mature B cells. Although FAK has been well studied in adherent fibroblasts, its function in hematopoietic cells is not defined. We used two independent approaches to reduce FAK expression in (human and mouse) progenitor cells. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated FAK silencing abolished CXCL12-induced responses in human pro-B leukemia, REH cells. FAK-deficient REH cells also demonstrated reduced CXCL12-induced activation of the GTPase Rap1, suggesting the importance of FAK in CXCL12-mediated integrin activation. Moreover, in FAK(flox/flox) hematopoietic precursor cells, Cre-mediated FAK deletion resulted in impaired CXCL12-induced chemotaxis. These studies suggest that FAK may function as a key intermediary in signaling pathways controlling hematopoietic cell lodgment and lineage development.","['Glodek, A M', 'Le, Y', 'Dykxhoorn, D M', 'Park, S-Y', 'Mostoslavsky, G', 'Mulligan, R', 'Lieberman, J', 'Beggs, H E', 'Honczarenko, M', 'Silberstein, L E']","['Glodek AM', 'Le Y', 'Dykxhoorn DM', 'Park SY', 'Mostoslavsky G', 'Mulligan R', 'Lieberman J', 'Beggs HE', 'Honczarenko M', 'Silberstein LE']","[""Department of Pathology, Joint Program in Transfusion Medicine, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*pharmacology', '*Chemotaxis', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Humans', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Lentivirus', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, CXCR4', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Aug;21(8):1723-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404769.

How to harness the graft-versus-myeloma effect and target molecular remission after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.,1851-8,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma after standard myeloablative conditioning induces a high rate of complete remissions, but long-term freedom from disease is achieved in 30-40% of the cases only. The therapeutic effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation is due to cytotoxicity of high-dose chemotherapy and immune-mediated graft-versus-myeloma effect by donor T cells. Retrospective studies clearly suggest that both (a) reducing the intensity of high-dose chemotherapy by using reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative conditioning regimen or (b) reducing the immunotherapy of donor T cells by using T-cell depletion result in lower treatment-related morbidity and mortality, but also in higher rate of relapse. Therefore, this review will focus on potential strategies of how treatment-related morbidity and mortality might be kept low without an increased risk of relapse and how remission status after transplantation can be enhanced by using the newly established donor immunosystems after allografting as a platform for post-transplant treatment strategies with new drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, bortezomib) or immunotherapy (donor lymphocyte infusion, vaccination, tumor-specific T cells) in order to achieve remission on a molecular level, which seems to be a 'conditio sine qua non' to cure myeloma patients.","['Kroger, N']",['Kroger N'],"['Department for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. nkroeger@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['*Graft vs Tumor Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Sep;21(9):1851-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404775.

Deguelin-induced cell death in the majority of B-CLL cells and was found to be more toxic toward B-CLL cells than to the normal mononuclear or B-cells, suggesting selectivity towards the malignant cells. Deguelin was found to reduce IkappaBalpha protein expression, and thus interacts with the NFkappaB pathway. The induced apoptosis was characterized by processing of caspase-9 and -3 and poly-(ADP)-ribose-polymerase cleavage. Exposure of B-CLL cells to deguelin resulted in Bcl2-associated protein (Bax) conformational changes and downregulation of the key survival protein myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), which is associated with response to treatment in B-CLL patients. Deguelin retained its ability to induce apoptosis in B-CLL cells in the presence of interleukin-4, a pro-survival cytokine in B-CLL, and when cultured with 50% human serum.

Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive proliferation of B cells. Conventional chemotherapy has limited benefits in PEL patients, and the prognosis is very poor. We previously reported that treatment of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells either with arsenic trioxide (As) combined to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) or with the bortezomib (PS-341) proteasome inhibitor induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, partly due to the reversal of the constitutive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. PEL cells also display an activated NF-kappaB pathway that is necessary for their survival. This prompted us to investigate the effects of PS-341, or of the As/IFN-alpha combination on PEL cells. A dramatic inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis was observed in PS-341 and in As/IFN-alpha treated cells. This was associated with the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytosolic release of cytochrome c, caspase activation and was reversed by the z-VAD caspase inhibitor. PS-341 and As/IFN-alpha treatment abrogated NF-kappaB translocation to the nucleus and decreased the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X(L).

However, the course of disease is highly variable and a substantial proportion of patients with early-stage CLL develop rapidly progressive disease requiring therapy. In recent decades, numerous clinical and biological prognostic markers that are predictive of decreased survival outcomes, disease progression and/or resistance to therapy, and that may play a role in defining the subgroups of patients with 'high-risk' CLL have been identified. At the same time, highly effective treatment modalities have become available with the advent of chemoimmunotherapy combinations and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Thus, we are approaching an era when patients with CLL may potentially benefit from individualized risk assessments based on prognostic markers and when specific therapies may be offered to the subgroup of patients with high-risk disease. This review provides a brief overview of newer biological prognostic markers, discusses the challenges associated with identifying the subgroup of patients with high-risk CLL and further aims to provide recommendations on how prognostic markers may be used to assess high-risk subgroups in different clinical situations in CLL.","['Kay, N E', ""O'Brien, S M"", 'Pettitt, A R', 'Stilgenbauer, S']","['Kay NE', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Pettitt AR', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. kay.neil@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Sep;21(9):1885-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404802.

The MDR1 gene polymorphisms, -2352 G>A, -934A>G, -692T>C (5' regulatory region) and 3435C>T (exon 26), were examined in 157 ALL patients and 96 healthy children. The amounts of MDR1 mRNA were quantified in 54 healthy individuals using normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells to evaluate the effect of each polymorphism on the gene expression. The frequency of the G/G genotype of the -2352 G>A was significantly higher in ALL than in controls (74/109 versus 52/96, p=0.04). The frequency of the T/T genotype of the 3435C>T was also significantly higher in ALL (29/118 versus 10/96, p=0.006). In a haplotype analysis using the 5' regulatory sites, the frequency of a certain haplotype was higher in ALL than in controls (59/90 versus 42/88, p=0.048). When the -2352G>A was examined in different age groups, patients aged six or older were found to have the G/G genotype more frequently than the controls (42/51 versus 52/96, p=0.0014), while no difference was observed in the younger age group. The amounts of MDR1 mRNA were significantly higher in either G/G or G/A genotype of the -2352 G>A than in A/A genotype (p=0.04). The present study suggests that the genetic background of MDR1 may be associated with the development of childhood ALL, possibly due to a quantitative change in the MDR1 gene resulting from genetic polymorphisms.","['Hattori, Hiroyoshi', 'Suminoe, Aiko', 'Wada, Morimasa', 'Koga, Yuhki', 'Kohno, Kimitoshi', 'Okamura, Jun', 'Hara, Toshiro', 'Matsuzaki, Akinobu']","['Hattori H', 'Suminoe A', 'Wada M', 'Koga Y', 'Kohno K', 'Okamura J', 'Hara T', 'Matsuzaki A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. hhattori@pediatr.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2007/06/15 09:00,2008/02/27 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2006/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Dec;31(12):1633-40. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.04.009.

OTA-induced HPRT mutations were characterized at the molecular level. In V79 cells, OTA produced a dose- and time-related decrease in cell number as a consequence of the transitory cytostatic effect mediated by G2/M cell cycle arrest. In both mutation assays, OTA was weakly mutagenic and this effect was independent of biotransformation. OTA-induced mutations were characterized by point mutations (48%) and a lack of a detectable reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction product (52%). The pattern of OTA-induced point mutations was similar to that of spontaneous mutants, suggesting that OTA induced an increase of the endogenous oxidative metabolism but not covalent DNA adducts.

It is important to find appropriate feeder cells to support the growth of hEG. The clinical application of human embryonic germ cells cultured on mouse-derived feeder cells is restricted, since human embryonic germ cells cultured on mouse-derived feeder cells are at risk of contamination by heterogeneous proteins or pathogens. In order to avoid this limitation, we have isolated and cultured three human embryonic fibroblast-like cell lines derived from the gonadal ridges and dorsal mesenteries of 5- to 10-week old embryos. These cells expressed basic fibroblast growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor, both essential for the growth of human embryonic germ cells. We then used the mitomycin-inactivited human embryonic fibroblast-like cells as feeder cells to culture human embryonic germ cells derived from the gonadal ridges and dorsal mesenteries of 5- to 10-week old embryos. Of 21 human primordial germ cell cultures initiated, seven were continuously grown and split for 10 passages with normal and stable human karyotypes. These cells expressed markers characteristic of pluripotent stem cells, including alkaline phosphatase, stage-specific embryonic antigens (SSEA)-1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, tumor related antigens (TRA)-1-60, TRA-1-81, and the POU transcription factor Octamer-4 (Oct-4). Moreover, the cells possessed the capacity to differentiate into all three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). Therefore, we have successfully used the human embryonic fibroblast-like cells derived from gonadal ridges and dorsal mesenteries as feeder cells to culture proliferative, undifferentiated and pluripotent human embryonic germ cells.","['He, Jin', 'Wang, Ying', 'Li, Yu Lin']","['He J', 'Wang Y', 'Li YL']","['Key Laboratory of Pathobiology, Ministry of Education, Jilin University, 2 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 130021, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cytokines/analysis', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/chemistry/*cytology', 'Fibroblasts/chemistry/*cytology', 'Germ Cells/chemistry/*cytology', 'Gonads/cytology/embryology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Mesentery/cytology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology']",2007/06/15 09:00,2008/01/15 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biomed Sci. 2007 Sep;14(5):617-28. doi: 10.1007/s11373-007-9185-z.

The success of the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia with all trans retinoic acid and chronic myeloid leukemia with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) has led to increased efforts to look for agents for AML targeted therapy. But, most of presented targeted therapy agents do only direct some oncogenic molecules involved in the leukemogenesis of AML, their anti-leukemic efficacy is unsatisfied. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches are required. In recent years, a leukemia stem cells (LSCs) origin for AML has been demonstrated, and some unique immunophenotype and specific molecular features of LSCs have also been identified. With the technique development of Immunoliposomes (antibody-coupled liposomes) and the recombination of the variable regions of heavy and light chains and their integration into a single polypeptide that offer the possibility of using single-chain antibody variable region fragments (scFv) for targeting purposes, here we put the hypothesis that treatment of AML by targeting both LSCs and oncogenic molecule participated in AML pathogenesis, with LSCs-specific scFv-immunolipoplexes as a deliverer, might be possible.

During the accelerated phase and blast crisis, the population of CML cells and the fraction of immature cells rises sharply. The mechanisms that drive the transition from the chronic phase to blast crisis are not understood, and the requirement of genetic instability and further mutations has been suggested. Using mathematical models, I describe a theory that can account for the transition from the chronic phase to blast crisis without the need to invoke further mutations. The transition to blast crisis can be explained solely by feedback mechanisms that regulate the patterns of stem cell division, in particular the occurrence of symmetric versus asymmetric cell division. The model also has implications for the outcome of Imatinib treatment. According to the model, treatment can lead to the low level persistence of CML stem cells without assuming that these cells are less susceptible to drug-mediated activity, and this might explain why disease tends to relapse after treatment discontinuation even in the absence of acquired drug resistance. Further, the model defines conditions when Imatinib treatment might lead to the eradication of CML, which is relevant in the context of recent data that show absence of relapse as long as two years after treatment cessation.","['Wodarz, Dominik']",['Wodarz D'],"['Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, 321 Steinhaus Hall, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA. dwodarz@uci.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Stem Cells/pathology']",2007/06/15 09:00,2008/04/02 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2008;70(1):128-36. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2007.03.040.

Successful treatment is a major challenge for clinical oncologists. METHODS: The records of all episodes of invasive fungal infection occurring in children with cancer undergoing chemotherapy at Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei between January 1987 and October 2005 were reviewed. The following were documented: general characteristics, clinical presentation, predisposing factors, pathogens, antifungal treatment, association with anticancer therapy and outcome. We endeavoured to preserve renal function by administration of new antifungal agents. Anticancer therapy was given as soon as possible after diagnosis and the dose of chemotherapeutic agents was adjusted as required to prevent unduly prolonged interruption of chemotherapy and minimise the risk of leukaemia relapse. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with 29 episodes of invasive fungal infection were reviewed. Candida species were the leading pathogens (14/29) followed by Aspergillus species (11/29). In six episodes there was both visceral dissemination and fungaemia. In 23/29 patients, antibiotic therapy preceded fungal infection with a median of 11 days. Three children died from extensive fungal infection and four from progression of malignancy; the remainder survived with a median follow-up of 40 months (range 12-233).

CONCLUSIONS: In children with cancer, most invasive fungal infections can be treated successfully.

METHODS: The performance of three different types of microbeads was compared, i.e. Quantum molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (Q-MESF), Quantum simply cellular (QSC), and QuantiBRITE (QB). As all PE-conjugates had a F/P ratio of 1:1, the MESF units represented also the antibody binding capacity (ABC). RESULTS: The ABCs of CD4 and CD20 antigens estimated with QSC (ABC(QSC)) were higher than those assigned with QB (ABC(QB)) with an average difference 49%. Higher numbers of antigenic sites were obtained with Q-MESF than with QSC for CD20 antigen. On the contrary, CD4 antigenic sites numbers estimated with QSC were higher than those estimated with Q-MESF. ABC values estimated with Quantum MESF PE (ABC(Q-MESF)) were approximately 15% higher than ABC(QSC), whereas ABC(Q-MESF) was approximately 49% higher than ABC(QB). Statistically significant correlations were found between the values obtained using various standards. The present study is the first to report down-regulation of CD3 antigen on T cells from patients with CLL. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the relevance of quantitative measurement of fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry as a standardized approach to measure and interpret the expression of some CLL markers and reduce variability of results obtained at different sites in multi-center clinical studies.","['Rossmann, Eva D', 'Lenkei, Rodica', 'Lundin, Jeanette', 'Mellstedt, Hakan', 'Osterborg, Anders']","['Rossmann ED', 'Lenkei R', 'Lundin J', 'Mellstedt H', 'Osterborg A']","['Department of Oncology (Radiumhemmet), Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. eva.rossmann@karolinska.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

One of the main problems of present chemotherapy in treatment of tumor patients is the toxicity of drugs. Most of the existent anticancer drugs, unfortunately, attack also proliferating normal cells. In recent years, traditional Chinese herbal remedies have gradually gained considerable attention as a new source of anticancer drugs. Although their healing mechanisms are still largely unknown, some of the drugs have been used to help cancer patients fight their disease at reduced side effects compared to other treatments. In our study, we show that Rocaglamide (Roc), derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal plants Aglaia, induces apoptosis through the intrinsic death pathway in various human leukemia cell lines and in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia cells freshly isolated from patients. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms by which Roc kills tumors revealed that it induces a consistent activation of the stress-response mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 accompanied with a long-term suppression of the survival MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase. These events affect proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins leading to depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and trigger caspase-mediated apoptosis involving caspase-9, -8, -3 and -2. Importantly, Roc shows no effects on MAPKs in normal lymphocytes and therefore has no or very low toxicity on healthy cells. Up to now, more than 50 different Roc derivatives have been isolated from Aglaia. Our study suggests that Roc derivatives may be promising candidates for the development of new drugs against hematologic malignancies.","['Zhu, Jia Y', 'Lavrik, Inna N', 'Mahlknecht, Ulrich', 'Giaisi, Marco', 'Proksch, Peter', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Li-Weber, Min']","['Zhu JY', 'Lavrik IN', 'Mahlknecht U', 'Giaisi M', 'Proksch P', 'Krammer PH', 'Li-Weber M']","['Tumor Immunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Tubulin)', '84573-16-0 (rocaglamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzofurans/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/10/30 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 Oct 15;121(8):1839-46. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22883.,,,,['10.1002/ijc.22883 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

METHOD OF STUDY: Two phase study. Phase I: assessment of LIF in uterine flushing. Phase II: 1,5 years after examining the last patient, a questionnaire was sent to all participants of the phase I. Phase I: Uterine flushing and endometrial samples were collected during implantation window from infertile patients with stage I/II endometriosis (n = 14), patients with idiopathic infertility (n = 27), luteal phase deficiency (n = 13), and fertile control (n = 21). LIF was assessed in uterine flushings in all patients by ELISA. In endometrium, semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed for LIF mRNA expression. Phase II: questionnaire has been sent to all infertile women taking part in the first phase of the experiment, regarding their reproductive outcome. RESULTS: 65.4% patients who had returned the questionnaire did get pregnant. LIF concentration at a cut-off point of 2.31 pg/ml had a 95.7% sensitivity and 81.8% specificity in predicting the reproductive outcome.

In this work we studied the molecular mechanisms regulating DNA repair and cell death in human T-lymphocyte leukemic cells, MOLT-4. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow-cytometric detection of annexin V. Early apoptotic cells were determined as sub-G1 cells and late apoptotic cells were determined as APO2.7-positive ones. Proteins involved in ATM signalling pathway were analysed by Western-blotting. We observed a rapid (0.5 h) phosphorylation of ATM declining after 6 h after irradiation by all the doses studied (1.5, 3.0, and 7.5 Gy). Checkpoint kinase-2 (Chk-2) was also phosphorylated after 0.5 h but its phosphorylated form persisted 4, 2, and 1 h after the doses of 1.5, 3.0, and 7.5 Gy, respectively. The amount of p53 protein and its form phosphorylated on Ser-392 increased 1 h after irradiation (1-10 Gy). The lethal dose of 7.5 Gy caused an immediate induction and phosphorylation of p53 after 0.5 h post-irradiation. At the time of phosphorylation of p53, we found simultaneous phosphorylation of the oncoprotein Mdm2 on Ser-166. Neither ATM nor its downstream targets showed a dose-dependent response after 1 h when irradiated by the doses of 1-10 Gy. MOLT-4 cells were very sensitive to the effect of IR. Even low doses, such as 1.5 Gy, induced apoptosis 16 h after irradiation (evaluated according to the cleavage of nuclear lamin B to a 48-kDa fragment). IR-induced molecular signalling after exposure to all the tested doses was triggered by rapid phosphorylation of ATM and Chk-2. Subsequent induction of p53 protein and its phosphorylation was accompanied by concomitant phosphorylation of its negative regulator, oncoprotein Mdm2, and followed by induction of apoptosis.","['Tichy, Ales', 'Zaskodova, Darina', 'Rezacova, Martina', 'Vavrova, Jirina', 'Vokurkova, Doris', 'Pejchal, Jaroslav', 'Vilasova, Zdena', 'Cerman, Jaroslav', 'Osterreicher, Jan']","['Tichy A', 'Zaskodova D', 'Rezacova M', 'Vavrova J', 'Vokurkova D', 'Pejchal J', 'Vilasova Z', 'Cerman J', 'Osterreicher J']","['Department of Radiobiology, Faculty of Military Health Sciences in Hradec Kralove, University of Defence in Brno, Czech Republic. tichy@pmfhk.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Signal Transduction/*radiation effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2007;54(2):281-7.

Barriers to providing infertility-related information included short consultation time before the treatment, and lack of resources and information on fertility preservation.

However, detection of LOH is frequently hampered by the presence of normal cell components within tumor specimens and the limitation in availability of constitutive DNA. Here, we describe a simple but highly sensitive method for genomewide detection of allelic composition, based on the Affymetrix single-nucleotide-polymorphism genotyping microarray platform, without dependence on the availability of constitutive DNA. By sensing subtle distortions in allele-specific signals caused by allelic imbalance with the use of anonymous controls, sensitive detection of LOH is enabled with accurate determination of allele-specific copy numbers, even in the presence of up to 70%-80% normal cell contamination. The performance of the new algorithm, called ""AsCNAR"" (allele-specific copy-number analysis using anonymous references), was demonstrated by detecting the copy-number neutral LOH, or uniparental disomy (UPD), in a large number of acute leukemia samples. We next applied this technique to detection of UPD involving the 9p arm in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), which is tightly associated with a homozygous JAK2 mutation. It revealed an unexpectedly high frequency of 9p UPD that otherwise would have been undetected and also disclosed the existence of multiple subpopulations having distinct 9p UPD within the same MPD specimen.

METHODS: The PK of this dosing regimen was evaluated in sixteen patients with MDS or AML. Plasma samples were obtained pre-dose and during the first 8-h dosing interval on each dosing day during Cycle 1, and at pre-dose and just prior to the end of infusion during Cycle 2. PK samples were assayed for decitabine by a sensitive and specific validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. RESULTS: The mean maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), 64.8-77.0 ng/ml, and the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity), 152-163 ng h/ml, were unchanged during dosing of decitabine for 3 days. The time to the maximum concentration (Tmax) generally occurred at the end of infusion. The mean values for terminal phase elimination half-life (0.62-0.78 h), total body clearance (125-132 l/h per m2), and volume of distribution at steady state (62.7-89.2 l/m2), remained unchanged during the every 8 h dosing (P>0.05). Cycles 1 and 2 Cmax values for days 1, 2, and 3 were not significantly different as determined by paired two-tailed t test (P>0.05). The primary toxicity of decitabine was myelosuppression, which was observed in all patients. Two deaths, from sepsis, were considered possibly related to decitabine. CONCLUSIONS: Decitabine dosed at 15 mg/m2 iv every 8 h for 3 days resulted in a predictable and manageable toxicity profile in patients with MDS/AML. The repeated dosing did not result in systemic accumulation of the drug, and decitabine PK remained unchanged from cycle to cycle.","['Cashen, Amanda F', 'Shah, Ajit K', 'Todt, Laura', 'Fisher, Nicholas', 'DiPersio, John']","['Cashen AF', 'Shah AK', 'Todt L', 'Fisher N', 'DiPersio J']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Stem Cell Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 S.

Based on the fact that an increasing number of adenosine analogues show their antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity via induction of apoptosis, we assessed the effect of cordycepin, a polyadenylation specific inhibitor, an adenosine analogue and a well-known chemotherapeutic drug, on two human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. METHODS: Cells were treated with the anticancer drug cordycepin and assessed for poly(A) polymerase (PAP) activity and isoforms by the highly sensitive PAP activity assay and western blotting, respectively. Induction of apoptosis was determined by endonucleosomal DNA cleavage, DAPI staining and Deltapsi(m) reduction, whereas cytotoxicity and cell cycle status were assessed by Trypan blue staining, MTT assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the differentiated modulations of PAP in the two cell lines may be a result of the additive effect of the changes in cell cycle and apoptotic pathway induced.","['Thomadaki, Hellinida', 'Tsiapalis, Chris Milto', 'Scorilas, Andreas']","['Thomadaki H', 'Tsiapalis CM', 'Scorilas A']","['Institute of Biology, NCSR ""Demokritos"", Aghia Paraskevi Attikis, 15310, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', 'EC 2.7.7.19 (Polynucleotide Adenylyltransferase)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'GZ8VF4M2J8 (cordycepin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Necrosis', 'Polynucleotide Adenylyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles']",2007/06/15 09:00,2008/04/10 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2008 Apr;61(4):703-11. doi: 10.1007/s00280-007-0533-5.

ATRA is usually well tolerated, but a few major side effects can be observed, ATRA syndrome (RAS) being the most important of them, potentially fatal. The manifestations of this Syndrome are fever, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, hypotension, liver dysfunction and renal failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied to the 29 patients diagnosed in (January of 2002 - December of 2004) of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which were treated with ATRA, all received the 45 dose of mg/m(2)/d . The diagnosis of the leukemia was made by citomorphologist analysis. The criterion of renal insufficiency, it was an increase of the creatinina superior to 20% of the basal level. The definition of the transretinoico acid Syndrome was based on the clinical criteria of Frankel. RESULTS: Fourteen patients presented the Transretinoico Syndrome (48.3%), 11 of which (37.9%) died. The fundamental differences between the patients with or without ATRA were: fever (14 vs. 9, p=0,017), gain of weight (14 vs 0, p=0,000), pleural effusion (14 vs 2, p=0.000), pulmonary infiltrates (13 vs 1, p=0,000), cardiac failure (12 versus 2, p=0,000), respiratory distress (12 versus 4, p=0,003), presence of renal failure (10 vs 4, p=0,02), necessity of substitute renal treatment (6 vs 0, p=0,006) and arterial hypotension (12 vs. 3, p=0,001). The acute renal failure appeared in 10 of the 14 patients with SAR (71.4%), to 12+/-5 (1-25) days of the beginning of the treatment and their duration it was of 14+/-5 (1-46) days. Six (60%) needed substitute renal treatment and 5 (50%) died. Of the patients who survived, only a patient continues in dialysis. In both patient in that renal biopsy was made, the study showed signs of cortical necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of acute renal failure in the course of the SAR is frequent, being observed deterioration of the renal function that needs substitute renal treatment in more than half the cases. The association of RAS with renal failure entails the high mortality (50%). The diagnosis and the precocious restoration of suitable the preventive measures and therapeutic are very important to avoid in possible the this serious complication of the treatment with ATRA.","['Sastre, A', 'Gago, E', 'Banos, M', 'Gomez, E']","['Sastre A', 'Gago E', 'Banos M', 'Gomez E']","['Servicio de Nefrologia, Hospital Central de Asturias, Oviedo. aranchasastre@hotmail.com']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Nefrologia,Nefrologia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola Nefrologia,8301215,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/*chemically induced', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Syndrome', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/08 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nefrologia. 2007;27(2):184-90.,,,,,Insuficiencia renal aguda en el sindrome de acido-transretinoico.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A molecular response was analyzed in 53 CML CP patients with incomplete and complete cptogenetic response (ICR and CCR) during imatinib therapy (median follow-up 36 months). BCR-ABL gene type p210 expression was quantitatively determined by real-time PCR under the TaqMan technology (an ICycler IQ device). The beta2 microglobulin (beta2M) gene was used as a reference gene. The results were expressed as the ratio: the number of BCR-ABL copies to that of beta2M x 10(5), as well as the difference of the common logarithm (lg) of the baseline expression level (BEL) and the result obtained: CEL lg-result lg. RESULTS: The study revealed a correlation of the results of real-time PCR with those of cytogenetic analysis and showed it possible to study not only bone marrow, but also peripheral blood. Some negative real-time PCR results were checked using more sensitive PCR techniques. MRD was identified in most CML patients showing ICR and CCR during imatinib therapy. The reduction in BCR-ABL transcript levels by less than 2 lg (as compared to BEL) was associated with a cytogenetic recurrence and that by less than 3 lg was associated with a permanent high cytogenetic response. In patients with a cytogenetic recurrence, the median of BCR-ABL transcript levels was higher than that in patients with a permanent stable or unstable cytogenetic response.

It is frequently misdiagnosed as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, (CLL) Prolymphocytic leukaemia or Hairy Cell leukaemia. Few cases have been reported worldwide. METHOD: The case records of a sixty year old Nigerian male with a splenic lymphoma and a review of the literature on the subject using MEDLINE, other internet sources and manual library search was utilized. RESULT A sixty-year-old male with splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, seen at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital Zaria is presented. However review of the blood film, bone marrow and Splenic aspirates showed absolute lymphocytosis, consisting of ""villous"" lymphocytes.

Toxicities identified included bone pain and rare instances of splenic rupture, allergic reactions, flares of underlying autoimmune disorders, lung injury and vascular events. Among healthy individuals, four patients developed splenic rupture shortly after G-CSF administration and three patients developed acute myeloid leukemia 1 to 5 years after G-CSF administration. Registry studies identified no increased risks of malignancy among healthy individuals who received G-CSF before PBSC harvesting. However, more than 2000 donors would have to be followed for 10 years to detect a 10-fold increase in leukemia risk. Our review identifies bone pain as the most common toxicity of G-CSF administration. There are questions about a causal relationship between G-CSF administration and acute leukemia, but more long-term safety data from database registries are needed to adequately evaluate such a relationship.","['Tigue, C C', 'McKoy, J M', 'Evens, A M', 'Trifilio, S M', 'Tallman, M S', 'Bennett, C L']","['Tigue CC', 'McKoy JM', 'Evens AM', 'Trifilio SM', 'Tallman MS', 'Bennett CL']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Bone and Bones', 'Chronic Disease', 'Databases, Factual', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Lung Diseases/chemically induced', 'Lung Injury', 'Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Pain/chemically induced', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Splenic Rupture/chemically induced', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vascular Diseases/chemically induced']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/12/28 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007 Aug;40(3):185-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705722.

In vitro investigations with clofarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide in primary cells have demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity and inhibition of DNA repair. Based on these clinical and laboratory observations, we designed a mechanism-based combination protocol with clofarabine and cyclophosphamide for patients with relapsed acute leukemias. Eighteen patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/m(2)) alone on day 0 and with clofarabine plus cyclophosphamide on day 1. Clinical responses, toxicity, DNA damage measured as H2AX phosphorylation, and accumulation of clofarabine triphosphate (TP) were analyzed. At dose level 1 (20 mg/m(2) clofarabine + cyclophosphamide, 6 patients) and dose level 0 (10 mg/m(2) clofarabine + cyclophosphamide, 12 patients) overall response rates were 50% and 30%, respectively, with responses in 4 (67%) of 6 patients with refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred at dose level 1 with prolonged marrow aplasia. Four (22%) patients died from prolonged aplasia (1), fungal pneumonia (1), or multiorgan failure (2). In 12 of 13 patient samples, increased DNA damage (gammaH2AX) was observed with clofarabine and cyclophosphamide compared with cyclophosphamide alone.

PML-deficient mice have an impaired capacity for terminal maturation of their myeloid precursor cells. This finding has been explained, at least in part, by the lack of PML action to modulate retinoic acid-differentiating activities. In this study, we found that C/EBPepsilon expression is reduced in PML-deficient mice. We showed that PU.1 directly activates the transcription of the C/EBPepsilon gene that is essential for granulocytic differentiation. The type IV isoform of PML interacted with PU.1, promoted its association with p300, and then enhanced PU.1-induced transcription and granulocytic differentiation.

Conventional cytogenetic analysis underestimates the frequency of specific chromosome aberrations in B-CLL because of the low rate of spontaneous mitoses and the poor response to mitogen stimulation. We used interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) to explore the incidence of chromosomal changes in the peripheral blood cells of B-CLL patients. Probes for 13q14 (D13S319), 17p13 (p53), the centromere of chromosome 12 (CEP12), and 14q32 (IGHC/IGHV) were applied to detect chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood samples from 83 B-CLL patients (60 men, 23 women). Molecular cytogenetic aberrations were found in 61 cases (73.5%), and 8 patients (9.6%) showed 2 kinds of abnormalities. The most frequent abnormality was deletion of 13q14 (41.0%), followed by +12 (19.3%), deletion of 17p13 (12%), and 14q32 rearrangement (9.6%). FISH results were analyzed for correlation with Binet stages. The percentages of patients who showed abnormalities by FISH were 73.0%, 73.3%, and 80% for Binet stages A, B, and C, respectively, and the percentages of patients with abnormalities who showed 2 anomalies were 7.9%, 27.3%, and 0% for Binet stages A, B, and C, respectively. We noted no consistent pattern among the various Binet stages in the distribution of either the types of FISH-detected anomalies or the numbers of FISH anomalies. I-FISH was found to be a rapid, exact, and sensitive technique for analysis of chromosome aberrations in CLL.

In a phase I clinical trial of biweekly vaccination with HLA-A*2402-restricted WT1 peptide for these malignancies, 2 patients with MDS developed severe leukocytopenia in association with a reduction in leukemic blast cells and levels of WT1 messenger RNA (mRNA) after only a single vaccination with 0.3 mg of WT1 peptide. These results indicated that the WT1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) elicited by WT1 vaccination eradicated the WT1-expressing transformed stem or progenitor cells and that MDS patients with little normal hematopoiesis required a new strategy of WT1 vaccination to avoid severe leukocytopenia. We describe the first trial for a 57-year-old male patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who was vaccinated biweekly with a small quantity (5 microg/body) of WT1 peptide. After the start of vaccination, the leukocyte and monocyte counts (13,780/microL and 1930/microL, respectively) gradually decreased to within the normal range in association with a reduction in the WT1 mRNA level. Simultaneously, the percentage of WT1-specific CTLs as measured by the HLA-WT1 tetramer assay increased.

In this study, we addressed the possibility that c-kit is a marker of undifferentiated murine ESC and, moreover, that it plays a role in maintaining the undifferentiated state of these cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: c-kit expression was analyzed under various differentiation conditions by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. ESC were then sorted on the basis of c-kit expression and functionality was investigated using embryoid body and colony-forming cell assays. Imatinib (Gleevec) and ACK2 were used to block, and stem cell factor was used to stimulate, c-kit activity. RESULTS: c-kit expression decreased in two murine ESC lines under various differentiation conditions. Sorting of ESC populations on the basis of c-kit expression revealed significant differences in the functional capacities and gene expression profiles of the sorted populations. The inhibition studies revealed an important role for tyrosine kinase activity in maintaining ESC viability and differentiation capacity, at least in part by preventing apoptosis and enhancing cell cycle progression. However, activation of c-kit alone is not sufficient for maintaining undifferentiated ESC. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that c-kit may represent a useful marker for monitoring ESC functionality. Moreover, tyrosine kinase signaling plays an important role in maintaining undifferentiated ESC. This work provides valuable insights into the complex signaling pathways that synergize to maintain the undifferentiated state of murine ESC.","['Lu, Min', 'Glover, Clive H', 'Tien, Amy H', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Piret, James M', 'Helgason, Cheryl D']","['Lu M', 'Glover CH', 'Tien AH', 'Humphries RK', 'Piret JM', 'Helgason CD']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Primers', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Mice', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Aug;35(8):1293-302. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.04.010.

In the present study we have investigated the relationship between cell cycle progression and the activation of caspases (caspase-3 and caspase-8) in Fas (CD95)-mediated apoptosis in asynchronously growing leukemia cells. We found that cells expressing the active form of caspase-3 were cyclin A/B1 and Ki-67 negative but cyclin E positive, whereas expression of the active form of caspase-8 was detected in cyclin A/B1/E-negative and Ki-67-negative cells. In addition, both the activation of caspases and Fas-mediated apoptosis were completely abolished when leukemia cells were arrested in early G1 phase. Using post-sorting western blot analysis, we demonstrated that caspase-3 and caspase-8 were activated in p27-negative cells. These results suggest that caspase-3 would be activated in cells entering into late G1 or early S phase, and caspase-8 would be activated in middle or late G1 phase. The speed of cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase might be influential in the speed of caspase activation and induction of Fas-mediated apoptosis.","['Li, Yufeng', 'Dida, Francis', 'Iwao, Atsushi', 'Deguchi, Takao', 'Azuma, Eiichi', 'Komada, Yoshihiro']","['Li Y', 'Dida F', 'Iwao A', 'Deguchi T', 'Azuma E', 'Komada Y']","['Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Science, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis', 'Caspase 8/biosynthesis', 'Caspases/*biosynthesis', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*pharmacology']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/10/02 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2007 Aug;98(8):1174-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00523.x.

A post-translational modification identified here, truncation at the N terminus, was found to act along with previously described ERK- and GSK3-induced phosphorylation events to regulate the turnover of the MCL1 protein and thus its availability for antiapoptotic effects. Although both N-terminally truncated and full-length MCL1 contain sequences enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine and were susceptible to proteasomal degradation, the truncated form decayed less rapidly and was maintained for an extended period in the presence of ERK activation. This was associated with extended cell survival because the truncated form of MCL1 (unlike those of BCL2 and BCLX) retained antiapoptotic activity. N-terminal truncation slightly increased the electrophoretic mobility of MCL1 and differed from the phosphorylation/band shift to decreased mobility, which occurs in the G2/M phase and was not found to affect MCL1 turnover. The N-terminally truncated form of MCL1 was expressed to varying extents in normal lymphoid tissues and was the predominant form present in lymphomas from transgenic mice and human tumor lines of B-lymphoid origin. The degradation versus stabilized expression of antiapoptotic MCL1 is thus controlled by N-terminal truncation as well as by ERK- and GSK3 (but not G2/M)-induced phosphorylation. These modifications may contribute to dysregulated MCL1 expression in cancer and represent targets for promoting its degradation to enhance tumor cell death.","['De Biasio, Alfredo', 'Vrana, Julie A', 'Zhou, Ping', 'Qian, Liping', 'Bieszczad, Christine K', 'Braley, Karen E', 'Domina, Aaron M', 'Weintraub, Steven J', 'Neveu, John M', 'Lane, William S', 'Craig, Ruth W']","['De Biasio A', 'Vrana JA', 'Zhou P', 'Qian L', 'Bieszczad CK', 'Braley KE', 'Domina AM', 'Weintraub SJ', 'Neveu JM', 'Lane WS', 'Craig RW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', '*G2 Phase', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/10/20 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Aug 17;282(33):23919-36. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M700938200.

We then sought to determine whether the application can be expanded if in vitro cell growths are stimulated by recombinant human cytokines including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF), interleukin-3 (rhIL-3), stem cell factor (rhSCF) and thrombopoietin (rhTPO). METHODS: Eight neonates with features indistinguishable from AML were studied. Seven patients had Down syndrome and the eighth a normal phenotype. Bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) were cultured in the presence of rhGM-CSF+rhIL-3+rhSCF or of rhTPO alone. After incubation, granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM)-derived colonies and clusters were scored on an inverted microscope. Colony-forming units-megakaryocyte (CFU-MK)-derived colonies were counted with an in situ CD61 immunostained dish. Liquid suspension cultures of MNC were stimulated by rhGM-CSF and/or rhTPO. RESULTS: CFU-GM-derived colonies and clusters from bone marrow and peripheral blood MNC revealed normal patterns in seven patients. RhTPO-stimulated megakaryocyte colony formation was normal in one patient. Cytospin smears of liquid suspension cultures all showed good myeloid or megakaryocytic maturation consistent with TL rather than AML. One neonate died on the 2nd day of life, but in the seven remaining patients, blasts disappeared from the peripheral blood within 10 months. Among four patients followed long-term, one developed myelodysplastic syndrome at 21 months. This child was given tailored chemotherapy and had a disease-free survival>20 months. CONCLUSION: In vitro cell growth stimulated by recombinant human cytokines can help to diagnose TL in neonates.","['Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Chen, Shu-Huey', 'Wang, Lin-Yen', 'Yeh, Ting-Chi', 'Chai, I-Jen', 'Liang, Der-Cherng']","['Liu HC', 'Chen SH', 'Wang LY', 'Yeh TC', 'Chai IJ', 'Liang DC']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital, and Mackay Medicine, Nursing and Management College, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Down Syndrome/complications', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukin-3/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*congenital/*diagnosis', 'Leukemoid Reaction/*congenital/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Thrombopoietin/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/08/01 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 2007 May;106(5):365-71. doi: 10.1016/S0929-6646(09)60321-1.,,,,"['S0929-6646(09)60321-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S0929-6646(09)60321-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the possible relationship between the chromosome translocation t(15;17) found in APL and ATRA treatment, the human myeloid leukaemia cell lines HL60 and NB4, that are PML-RARalpha negative and positive, respectively, were treated with ATRA and immunophenotyped using a CD antibody microarray. For HL60 cells, ATRA induced major increases in descending order of CD38, CD11b, CD45RO, CD11c, CD54 and CD36 with repression of CD117 and CD44. For NB4 cells, ATRA induced major increases in descending order of CD11c, CD54, CD11a, CD11b, CD53, CD65, CD138, CD66c and T-cell receptor alpha/beta (TCRalpha/beta), with repression of CD38 and CD9. The induction of a number of these CD antigens is consistent with the known differentiation of these leukaemias to abnormal neutrophils. Approximately half of the antigens up-regulated by ATRA on NB4 cells were adhesion molecules, including CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD54, CD66c and CD138, consistent with the increased adhesiveness of leukaemia cells observed for APL patients treated with ATRA. On HL60 cells, ATRA induced expression of CD38, CD43 and CD45RO and repressed CD117, while the converse was true on NB4 cells that contain chimeric PML-RARalpha. For NB4 cells, ATRA induced some remarkable increases in CD antigens not seen for HL60: CD14 (16.6-fold), CD32 (27.8), CD53 (20.5), CD65 (139), CD66c (79.7), CD126 (15.1), and CD138 (57.6). The expression of these antigens may be regulated by PML-RARalpha in the presence of ATRA. Such CD antigens could be targets for synergistic treatment of APL with therapeutic antibodies following ATRA treatment.","['Barber, Nicole', 'Belov, Larissa', 'Christopherson, Richard I']","['Barber N', 'Belov L', 'Christopherson RI']","['School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences, University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2007/06/15 09:00,2008/05/21 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Feb;32(2):315-22. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.04.013.

This leads to aberrantly high Notch signaling, but how this translates into deregulated cell cycle control and the transformed cell type is poorly understood. In this report, we analyze downstream responses resulting from the high level of NOTCH 1 signaling in T-ALL. Notch activity, measured immediately downstream of the NOTCH 1 receptor, is high, but expression of the canonical downstream Notch response genes HES 1 and HEY 2 is low both in primary cells from T-ALL patients and in T-ALL cell lines. This suggests that other immediate Notch downstream genes are activated, and we found that Notch signaling controls the levels of expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SKP2 and its target protein p27Kip1. We show that in T-ALL cell lines, recruitment of NOTCH 1 intracellular domain (ICD) to the SKP2 promoter was accompanied by high SKP2 and low p27Kip1 protein levels. In contrast, pharmacologically blocking Notch signaling reversed this situation and led to loss of NOTCH 1 ICD occupancy of the SKP2 promoter, decreased SKP2 and increased p27Kip1 expression. T-ALL cells show a rapid G1-S cell cycle transition, while blocked Notch signaling resulted in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, also observed by transfection of p27Kip1 or, to a smaller extent, a dominant negative SKP2 allele. Collectively, our data suggest that the aberrantly high Notch signaling in T-ALL maintains SKP2 at a high level and reduces p27Kip1, leading to more rapid cell cycle progression.","['Dohda, Takeaki', 'Maljukova, Aljona', 'Liu, Lining', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Grander, Dan', 'Brodin, David', 'Sangfelt, Olle', 'Lendahl, Urban']","['Dohda T', 'Maljukova A', 'Liu L', 'Heyman M', 'Grander D', 'Brodin D', 'Sangfelt O', 'Lendahl U']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Medical Nobel Institute, Karolinska, Institute, von Eulers vag 3, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (HEY1 protein, human)', '0 (HEY2 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2007 Aug 15;313(14):3141-52. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.04.027.

Here, we assess the role of apoptotic mediators in eliciting an anti-proliferative response to paclitaxel (PTX) in a T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line CEM and its epothilone-paclitaxel resistant sub-line CEM/dEpoB300. Furthermore, the cellular response to PTX was compared to those elicited by cells in response to treatment with albendazole (ABZ; a microtubule depolymerizing agent). In cell proliferation studies, CEM cells were sensitive to both PTX and ABZ, while the CEM/dEpoB300 cells were highly resistant to PTX (IC(50) 2.86 nM versus 30.26 nM, respectively). In contrast, the resistant cells showed a 2-fold increase in sensitivity to ABZ (0.32 microM in CEM compared to 0.16 microM in CEM/dEpoB300). Analysis of caspase-3 activity and cytochrome c release in response to PTX or ABZ treatment (24, 48 and 72 h) revealed that, compared to the parent cells, the resistant cells have diminished response to PTX and enhanced response to ABZ. A similar pattern was observed for the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was highly elevated in CEM/dEpoB300 cells and in these cells, ABZ was more effective in lowering the Bcl-2 levels than PTX. Similarly, ABZ treatment led to profound down regulation of the Mcl-1 protein. These results reveal for the first time, the changes in apoptotic mediators following development of resistance to PTX in an ALL cell and the significantly increased sensitivity of these PTX resistant cells to ABZ.","['Khalilzadeh, Azita', 'Wangoo, Kiran T', 'Morris, David L', 'Pourgholami, Mohammad H']","['Khalilzadeh A', 'Wangoo KT', 'Morris DL', 'Pourgholami MH']","['Cancer Research Laboratories, University of New South Wales, Department of Surgery, St. George Hospital, Sydney, NSW 2217, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Epothilones)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'F4216019LN (Albendazole)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Albendazole/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Epothilones/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/22 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2007 Aug 1;74(3):407-14. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2007.05.006.

Here, we present a compendium DNA microarray analysis of multiple mouse ESCs and EGCs from different genetic backgrounds (strains 129 and C57BL/6) cultured under standard conditions and in differentiation-promoting conditions by the withdrawal of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) or treatment with retinoic acid (RA). All pluripotent cell lines showed similar gene expression patterns, which separated them clearly from other tissue stem cells with lower developmental potency. Differences between pluripotent lines derived from different sources (ESC vs. EGC) were smaller than differences between lines derived from different mouse strains (129 vs. C57BL/6). Even in the differentiation-promoting conditions, these pluripotent cells showed the same general trends of gene expression changes regardless of their origin and genetic background. These data indicate that ESCs and EGCs are indistinguishable based on global gene expression patterns alone. On the other hand, a detailed comparison between a group of ESC lines and a group of EGC lines identified 20 signature genes whose average expression levels were consistently higher in ESC lines, and 84 signature genes whose average expression levels were consistently higher in EGC lines, irrespective of mouse strains. Similar analysis identified 250 signature genes whose average expression levels were consistently higher in a group of 129 cell lines, and 337 signature genes whose average expression levels were consistently higher in a group of C57BL/6 cell lines. Although none of the genes was exclusively expressed in either ESCs versus EGCs or 129 versus C57BL/6, in combination these signature genes provide a reliable separation and identification of each cell type. Differentiation-promoting conditions also revealed some minor differences between the cell lines. For example, in the presence of RA, EGCs showed a lower expression of muscle- and cardiac-related genes and a higher expression of gonad-related genes than ESCs. Taken together, the results provide a rich source of information about the similarities and differences between ESCs and EGCs as well as 129 lines and C57BL/6 lines. Such information will be crucial to our understanding of pluripotent stem cells. The results also underscore the importance of studying multiple cell lines from different strains when making comparisons based on gene expression analysis.","['Sharova, Lioudmila V', 'Sharov, Alexei A', 'Piao, Yulan', 'Shaik, Nabeebi', 'Sullivan, Terry', 'Stewart, Colin L', 'Hogan, Brigid L M', 'Ko, Minoru S H']","['Sharova LV', 'Sharov AA', 'Piao Y', 'Shaik N', 'Sullivan T', 'Stewart CL', 'Hogan BL', 'Ko MS']","['Laboratory of Genetics, National Institute on Aging, NIH, 333 Cassell Drive, Suite 3000, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/06 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2007 Jul 15;307(2):446-59. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.05.004.

All transplantation took place in the USA. Recipients of umbilical cord blood were transplanted with grafts that were HLA-matched (n=35) or HLA-mismatched for one (n=201) or two antigens (n=267) (typing at antigen level for HLA-A and HLA-B, and allele level for HLA-DRB1). Bone-marrow recipients were transplanted with grafts that were matched at the allele level for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB (n=116), or mismatched (n=166). The primary endpoint was 5-year leukaemia-free survival. FINDINGS: In comparison with allele-matched bone-marrow transplants, 5-year leukaemia-free survival was similar to that after transplants of umbilical cord blood mismatched for either one or two antigens and possibly higher after transplants of HLA-matched umbilical cord blood. Transplant-related mortality rates were higher after transplants of two-antigen HLA-mismatched umbilical cord blood (relative risk 2.31, p=0.0003) and possibly after one-antigen HLA-mismatched low-cell-dose umbilical-cord-blood transplants (1.88, p=0.0455). Relapse rates were lower after two-antigen HLA-mismatched umbilical-cord-blood transplants (0.54, p=0.0045). INTERPRETATION: These data support the use of HLA-matched and one- or two-antigen HLA-mismatched umbilical cord blood in children with acute leukaemia who need transplantation. Because better HLA matching and higher cell doses significantly decrease the risk of transplant-related mortality after umbilical-cord-blood transplantation, greater investment in large-scale banking is needed to increase HLA diversity.","['Eapen, Mary', 'Rubinstein, Pablo', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Stevens, Cladd', 'Kurtzberg, Joanne', 'Scaradavou, Andromachi', 'Loberiza, Fausto R', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Klein, John P', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Wagner, John E']","['Eapen M', 'Rubinstein P', 'Zhang MJ', 'Stevens C', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Scaradavou A', 'Loberiza FR', 'Champlin RE', 'Klein JP', 'Horowitz MM', 'Wagner JE']","['Statistical Center, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fetal Blood', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Treatment Failure']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/06/22 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2007 Jun 9;369(9577):1947-54. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60915-5.,,,"['U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['S0140-6736(07)60915-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60915-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,['Lancet. 2007 Jun 9;369(9577):1906-8.

Recent advances have demonstrated that AID and a group of closely related cytidine deaminases, the APOBEC3 proteins, also act in the innate host response to viral infection. Antiviral activity was first attributed to APOBEC3G as a potent inhibitor of HIV. It is now apparent that the targets of the APOBEC3 proteins extend beyond HIV, with family members acting against a wide variety of viruses as well as host-encoded retrotransposable genetic elements. Although it appears to function through a different mechanism, AID also possesses antiviral properties. Independent of its antibody diversification functions, AID protects against transformation by Abelson murine leukemia virus (Ab-MLV), an oncogenic retrovirus. Additionally, AID has been implicated in the host response to other pathogenic viruses. These emerging roles for the AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases in viral infection suggest an intriguing evolutionary connection of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms.","['Rosenberg, Brad R', 'Papavasiliou, F Nina']","['Rosenberg BR', 'Papavasiliou FN']","['Laboratory of Lymphocyte Biology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Adv Immunol,Advances in immunology,0370425,"['EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*immunology', 'HIV Infections/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Virus Diseases/*immunology']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/13 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Immunol. 2007;94:215-44. doi: 10.1016/S0065-2776(06)94007-3.,130,,"['R01 AI071029/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007739/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI071029/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07739/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['S0065-2776(06)94007-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S0065-2776(06)94007-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated whether AML1-ETO expression impinged on action of chemical carcinogens-DNA adduct formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML1-ETO fusion protein was conditionally induced in engineered U937-A/E 9/14/18 cells. The formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-DNA adducts and the expression of PAH-metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) were detected by Western blot and/or quantitative RT-PCR. Luciferase reporter system was used to detect the regulation of AML1-ETO on CYP1A1 transcription. RESULTS: Our results showed that AML1-ETO induction significantly increased the formation of carcinogen benzopyrene-DNA adducts in leukemic cells. In line with the effect, we also found that AML1-ETO induction upregulated CYP1A1 expression, which was dependent on AML1-binding motif in the promotor of CYP1A1 gene. Additionally, AML1-ETO protein also increased AhR expression, a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates PAHs-induced CYP1A1 gene expression. CONCLUSION: These data, combined with its inhibitory effect on DNA repair as reported previously, propose that the presence of AML1-ETO increases the susceptibility of cells to chemical carcinogens, which favors the development of additional genetic alterations.","['Xu, Min', 'Li, Dao', 'Lu, Ying', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Xu M', 'Li D', 'Lu Y', 'Chen GQ']","['Institute of Health Science, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine/Shanghai Institutes of Biological Sciences and School of Graduate, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)']",IM,"['Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Adducts', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/toxicity', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/toxicity', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism/toxicity', 'U937 Cells']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Aug;35(8):1249-55. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.04.018.

To investigate which hematopoietic cells express TRE-driven transgenes when combined with Vav-tTA, we assayed hematopoietic cells, including bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) and CD34-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) as well as myeloid and lymphoid lineages. To determine if suppression of NRAS(V12) expression early in life would delay mastocytosis we treated developing and juvenile mice with doxycycline (Dox). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vav-tTA-driven luciferase expression was assayed by live mouse imaging and relative light unit measurement before or after treating Vav-tTA and TRE-luciferase (TRE-Luc) cotransgenic mice with Dox. Magnetic cell sorting and fluorescence-activating cell sorting methods were used to sort hematopoietic cells. To suppress TRE-mediated luciferase or NRAS(V12) expression in Vav-tTA cotransgenic mice, we added Dox to the drinking water. RESULTS: B cells in the bone marrow and T cells in the thymus expressed Vav-tTA-driven luciferase at much higher levels than in myeloid cells, BMMC, and CD34-positive HPC, which showed relatively low levels. Dox treatment completely eliminated the luciferase expression from all hematopoietic cells. Repression of TRE-NRAS(V12) expression early in life was sufficient to increase the latency of mastocytosis development. CONCLUSION: The Vav-tTA transgenic line will be very useful for conditional transgene expression in developing B and T cells. Vav-tTA-driven NRAS(V12) expression is sufficient for mastocytosis development, but not for myeloid leukemia. Lymphoid cells are resistant to NRAS(V12) transformation despite high level of expression.","['Kim, Won-Il', 'Wiesner, Stephen M', 'Largaespada, David A']","['Kim WI', 'Wiesner SM', 'Largaespada DA']","['Graduate Program in Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology and Genetics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Doxycycline/therapeutic use', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Tetracycline']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Aug;35(8):1231-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.04.012.

The number of apoptotic cells and bodies with characteristic chromatin condensation and fragmentation was greater after TSA treatment. However, in contrast to TSA, myeloblasts treated with VPA recovered and started to proliferate again. TSA-treated myeloblasts with a fine chromatin structure exhibited an intense phagocytosis of cell fragments. The decreased number and translocation of silver-stained proteins of nucleolus organiser regions (AgNORs) in large nucleoli of myeloblasts treated with HDACi's indicated that these cells entered apoptosis and/or ageing without preceding terminal maturation. The nucleolar asynchrony observed in an increased number of treated cells with both HDACi's studied here possibly represented myeloblasts resistant to such treatment. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the chromatin structure and nucleoli visualised by simple cytochemical procedures provides useful information on the effects of HDACi's on myeloblasts and facilitated detection of these effects at the single cell level.","['Smetana, K', 'Zapotocky, M', 'Starkova, J', 'Trka, J']","['Smetana K', 'Zapotocky M', 'Starkova J', 'Trka J']","['Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic. karel.smetana@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Acta Histochem,Acta histochemica,0370320,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*drug effects/*enzymology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2007/06/15 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2006/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Histochem. 2007;109(5):413-9. doi: 10.1016/j.acthis.2007.04.003.

We modified a PAC containing the whole zebrafish scl locus, inserting GFP into the first coding exon of scl. In germline-transgenic zebrafish generated using this construct, GFP expression completely recapitulates the endogenous expression of scl in blood, endothelium and CNS. We performed in vivo timelapse imaging of blood and endothelial precursor migration at the single-cell level and show that these cells migrate from the posterior lateral plate mesoderm to their site of differentiation in the intermediate cell mass. The anterior lateral plate domain of GFP expression gives rise to primitive macrophages and the blood vessels of the head. In later embryos, GFP expression identifies clusters of hematopoietic cells that develop between the dorsal aorta and posterior cardinal veins after primitive erythrocytes have entered circulation. Two treatments that block definitive hematopoiesis (treatment with dioxin (TCDD), and injection of an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide targeted to runx1) ablate these hematopoietic clusters. This indicates that these clusters represent the first site of definitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish. This site is anatomically homologous to the proposed source of hematopoietic stem cells in amniotes, the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. A second transgenic line, containing the promoter of scl driving GFP, lacks expression in the definitive clusters.","['Zhang, Xiang Yi', 'Rodaway, Adam R F']","['Zhang XY', 'Rodaway AR']","[""King's College London, The Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, School of Biomedical Sciences, New Hunt's House, Guy's Campus, London SE1 1UL, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Movement', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Zebrafish/blood/genetics/*growth & development', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/06 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2006/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2007 Jul 15;307(2):179-94. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.04.002.

A role for neurohumoral agonists?,536-45,"OBJECTIVES: Cardiomyocyte loss is involved in the transition from compensatory left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) to heart failure (HF). Our aim was to investigate the status of the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR)/gp130 survival pathway and its cytoprotective activity in intact cardiac tissue and in cardiomyocytes obtained from adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with LVH (non-failing SHR) and from aged SHR with overt HF (failing SHR). METHODS: Cardiac morphometry was assayed by planimetry in an image analysis system. mRNA and protein expression were quantified by real time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Receptors were localized by immunocytochemistry. Trypan blue staining, TUNEL, and MTT cell viability assays were employed to study the cytoprotective activity of cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) in isolated caridomyocytes. RESULTS: Compared to non-failing SHR, failing SHR exhibited enhanced myocardial cell death (p<0.01) demonstrated by the increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, caspase-3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) fragmentation. Failing SHR had a 7-fold diminished expression (p<0.01) of LIFR, no changes in gp130, and 1.6-fold increased myocardial expression (p<0.01) of CT-1. In cardiomyocytes isolated from non-failing SHR, recombinant CT-1 inhibited apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death induced by angiotensin II or hydrogen peroxide. LIFR protein was entirely absent in cardiomyocytes isolated from failing SHR, which were resistant to the cytoprotective effects of CT-1. Finally, stimulation of non-failing SHR cardiomyocytes with angiotensin II, aldosterone, norepinephrine or endothelin-1 significantly decreased (p<0.01) LIFR expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that loss of CT-1-dependent survival mechanisms may contribute to the increase of cell death associated with HF in SHR. Neurohumoral activation may contribute to this alteration via suppression of LIFR.","['Lopez, Natalia', 'Varo, Nerea', 'Diez, Javier', 'Fortuno, Maria Antonia']","['Lopez N', 'Varo N', 'Diez J', 'Fortuno MA']","['Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, Centre for Applied Medical Research, University of Navarra, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cardiovasc Res,Cardiovascular research,0077427,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)', '4964P6T9RB (Aldosterone)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",IM,"['Aldosterone/pharmacology', 'Angiotensin II/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Cytoprotection', 'Endothelin-1/pharmacology', 'Heart Failure/*metabolism', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/metabolism', 'Norepinephrine/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred SHR', 'Rats, Inbred WKY', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Res. 2007 Aug 1;75(3):536-45. doi: 10.1016/j.cardiores.2007.04.025.

The characterization of genes commonly relevant to stem/progenitor cell expansion and tumor development should facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets in cancer. METHODS: CD34+/CD133+ progenitor cells were purified from human umbilical cord blood and expanded in vitro. Correlated molecular changes were analyzed by gene expression profiling using microarrays covering up to 55,000 transcripts. Genes regulated during progenitor cell expansion were identified and functionally classified. Aberrant expression of such genes in cancer was indicated by in silico SAGE. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by real-time PCR in hematopoietic cells from chronic myeloid leukemia patients and healthy individuals. RESULTS: Several genes and signaling pathways not previously associated with ex vivo expansion of CD133+/CD34+ cells were identified, most of which associated with cancer. Regulation of MEK/ERK and Hedgehog signaling genes in addition to numerous proto-oncogenes was detected during conditions of enhanced progenitor cell expansion. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed down-regulation of several newly described cancer-associated genes in CD133+/CD34+ cells, including DOCK4 and SPARCL1 tumor suppressors, and parallel results were verified when comparing their expression in cells from chronic myeloid leukemia patients CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal potential molecular targets for oncogenic transformation in CD133+/CD34+ cells and strengthen the link between deregulation of stem/progenitor cell expansion and the malignant process.","['Okamoto, Oswaldo Keith', 'Carvalho, Ana Carolina S R', 'Marti, Luciana C', 'Vencio, Ricardo Z', 'Moreira-Filho, Carlos A']","['Okamoto OK', 'Carvalho AC', 'Marti LC', 'Vencio RZ', 'Moreira-Filho CA']","['Departamento de Neurologia e Neurocirurgia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo - Escola Paulista de Medicina, Sao Paulo, Brazil. keith.nexp@epm.br']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,2007/06/15 09:00,2007/06/15 09:01,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2007/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:01 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2007 Jun 8;7:11. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-7-11.,,,,"['1475-2867-7-11 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-7-11 [doi]']",,,20070608,,PMC1904434,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors studied 160 patients with a median age of 67 years who received intensive chemotherapy for MDS or AML with cytosine arabinoside and an anthracycline. RESULTS: At diagnosis, cytogenetic analysis was available in 146 patients. Karyotype was normal in 78 patients and abnormal in 68 patients. Of the abnormal karyotypes, 32 belonged to the high-risk category, ie, they involved either >/=3 chromosomes or chromosome 7. Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 94 patients (56%). CR rates were 70% among the patients who had a normal karyotype, 69% among the patients who had an abnormal (noncomplex) karyotype, but only 46% among the patients ho had a high-risk karyotype. The median survival was 9.5 months in the entire group, 18 months in patients with normal karyotype, 6 months in patients with abnormal, and 4 months in patients with a high-risk karyotype.

It is unknown whether the use of these NTKIs before HSCT increases transplant-related toxicity. METHODS: The outcome of 12 patients with CML (1 in chronic phase, 6 in the accelerated phase, and 5 in the blastic phase) who received dasatinib (n = 2), nilotinib (n = 7), or both (n = 3) before HSCT were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median time on treatment was 134 days, and the median time from the end of NTKI therapy to HSCT was 34 days. The preparative regimen was ablative in 8 patients and nonablative in 4. All patients engrafted within 13 days. There was no significant early transplant-related toxicity. One patient developed secondary graft failure after 6 months from the first HSCT that required a second HSCT. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was observed in 7 and 6 patients, respectively. Nine patients achieved a molecular response: 4 complete and 5 major (quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction <0.05%). Three patients had disease progression by Day 30 after HSCT. Two patients developed disease recurrence after a median of 12 months. After a median follow-up of 10 months, 7 patients were alive in molecular response and 5 patients had died, 4 of disease progression and 1 of extensive chronic GVHD. CONCLUSIONS: Previous treatment with NTKI did not increase transplant-related toxicity in this preliminary experience.

Interestingly, ATRA significantly inhibited reverse transcriptase (RT) activity similar to azidothimidine (AZT) in HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines. To clarify whether ATRA has an inhibitory effect on the replication of HIV, we examined HIV proviral DNA in a HIV-1-positive cell line (8E5) using real time PCR. ATRA as well as AZT reduced the proviral DNA load of 8E5 in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that there is a common element of ATRA signaling in both HTLV-1 and HIV. Furthermore, we examined the effects of ATRA on viral replication in primary lymphocytes of three individuals infected with HIV. ATRA reduced viral replication significantly similar to AZT. These findings suggested that ATRA acts as a RT inhibitor, reducing the HIV-1 proviral DNA load. Finally, we conclude that ATRA may be a potential therapeutic agent for HIV infection.","['Maeda, Yasuhiro', 'Yamaguchi, Terufumi', 'Hijikata, Yasuki', 'Morita, Yasuyoshi', 'Tanaka, Miyako', 'Hirase, Chikara', 'Takai, Shunsuke', 'Tatsumi, Yoichi', 'Kanamaru, Akihisa']","['Maeda Y', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Hijikata Y', 'Morita Y', 'Tanaka M', 'Hirase C', 'Takai S', 'Tatsumi Y', 'Kanamaru A']","['Department of Hematology, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. ymaeda@med.kindai.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/virology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects', 'Zidovudine/pharmacology']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2007 Jun;12(3):263-6. doi: 10.1080/10245330701255130.,,,,"['779390604 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330701255130 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was performed on 34 children with ALL and 39 healthy children as a control group. Apoptosis was assessed by cell morphology; DNA fragmentation; ELISA and RT-PCR for CD95, CD95L, BcL-2 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB); and flow cytometry for CD95, CD40, CD49d and CD11a. Apoptosis was significantly lower in patients than controls. Apoptosis detected by CD95 ligand was significantly lower in cases with no remission after treatment than those who achieved remission. Anti-apoptotic factors: CD40, BcL-2, and NF-kappaB were all found to be higher in cases than controls and in cases with no remission than those achieved remission. CD49d was significantly lower in cases than controls, and significantly lower in cases with who did not achieve remission. CD11a levels were similar in the various groups. Delayed apoptosis of ALL cells is genetically controlled either directly or indirectly by a network of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. CD40 appeared to stimulate both T and B lineage and is considered the most potent influencer and predictor of resistance to therapy. Inhibitors for the activity of CD40, Bcl-2 and NF-kappaB as well as stimulants to CD95 could have a potential therapeutic benefit.","['Hafez, Mohammad', 'Al-Tonbary, Youssef', 'El-Bayoumi, Mohammed A', 'Hatem, Nadia', 'Hawas, Samia', 'Mansour, Ahmed', 'Marzouk, Iman', 'Hafez, Mona M', 'Yahia, Sohier', 'Farahat, Nahla']","['Hafez M', 'Al-Tonbary Y', 'El-Bayoumi MA', 'Hatem N', 'Hawas S', 'Mansour A', 'Marzouk I', 'Hafez MM', 'Yahia S', 'Farahat N']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Mansoura, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'CD40 Antigens', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oncogenes', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2007 Jun;12(3):209-18. doi: 10.1080/10245330701214384.,,,,"['779392172 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330701214384 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore characterized the T cell system for untreated AML patients. T lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry for 45 AML patients. The in vitro interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) release in response to stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 in the presence of autologous AML cells was examined for 31 patients. The majority of circulating lymphocytes were CD3(+)T cells, and CD19(+)B cells usually constituted < 10% of the lymphocytes. Most T cells expressed the alphabeta T cell receptor (TCRalphabeta(+)), and only a minority of the cells was TCRgammadelta(+). Both CD4(+) and CD8(+)T cells were detected, the CD4:CD8 ratio showed a wide variation but was generally >1.0. The majority of CD4(+) and CD8(+)T cells were CD45RA(+) cells. The T cells could be stimulated to release IFNgamma in response to anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 ligation even in the presence of excess autologous AML blasts, and for a subset of patients (6 of 27) these IFNgamma levels could be further increased by the novel protein kinase C (PKC) agonist PEP005. In conclusion, circulating T cells in patients with untreated AML are mainly CD4(+) or CD8(+) TCRalphabeta(+); both CD45RA(+) and CD45R0(+) can be detected, and these cells can be activated through the CD3/TCR complex even in the presence of excess AML cells. For a subset of patients T cell responsiveness can be further increased by targeting PKC and these data therefore suggest that T cell function is not inhibited in AML patients.","['Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Hampson, Peter', 'Wendelbo, Oystein', 'Lord, Janet M', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Ersvaer E', 'Hampson P', 'Wendelbo O', 'Lord JM', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O']","['University of Bergen and Haukeland University Hospital, Institute of Medicine, Bergen, Norway. elisabeth.ersvar@med.uib.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cells', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2007 Jun;12(3):199-207. doi: 10.1080/10245330701255163.,,,,"['779390709 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330701255163 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These markers included various first- and second-hit genetic alterations (TCRD-LMO2 breakpoint regions, n = 2; TAL1 deletions, n = 3; Notch1 mutations, n = 1) and nononcogenic T-cell receptor rearrangements (n = 13) that were derived from leukemias of 16 children who were 1.5 to 11.2 years old at diagnosis of leukemia.

Murine Sall4 also has been shown to play an essential role in maintaining the properties of ES cells and governing the fate of the primitive inner cell mass. Here, we demonstrate that transcription from the Bmi-1 promoter is strikingly activated by SALL4 in a dose-dependent manner by using a luciferase reporter gene assay. Both promoter deletion construct studies and ChIP from a myeloid stem cell line, 32D, demonstrate that SALL4 binds to a specific region of the Bmi-1 promoter. Deletion of one copy of Sall4 by gene targeting in mouse bone marrow significantly reduced Bmi-1 expression. Reducing SALL4 expression by siRNA in the HL-60 leukemia cell line also results in significant down-regulation of Bmi-1. Furthermore, Bmi-1 expression is up-regulated in transgenic mice that constitutively overexpress human SALL4, and the levels of Bmi-1 in these mice increase as they progress from normal to preleukemic (myelodysplastic syndrome) and leukemic (acute myeloid leukemia) stages. High levels of H3-K4 trimethylation and H3-K79 dimethylation were observed in the SALL4 binding region of the Bmi-1 promoter. These findings suggest a novel link between SALL4 and Bmi-1 in regulating self-renewal of normal and leukemic stem cells. An increase in histone H3-K4 and H3-K79 methylation within the Bmi-1 promoter provides an epigenetic mechanism for histone modifications in SALL4-mediated Bmi-1 gene deregulation.","['Yang, Jianchang', 'Chai, Li', 'Liu, Fang', 'Fink, Louis M', 'Lin, Pei', 'Silberstein, Leslie E', 'Amin, Hesham M', 'Ward, David C', 'Ma, Yupo']","['Yang J', 'Chai L', 'Liu F', 'Fink LM', 'Lin P', 'Silberstein LE', 'Amin HM', 'Ward DC', 'Ma Y']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, Nevada Cancer Institute, Las Vegas, NV 89135, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Sall4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2007/06/15 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/06/15 09:00'],"['2007/06/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jun 19;104(25):10494-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0704001104.

PROCEDURE: Fifteen children with SCD (n = 4), TM (n = 6), or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML, n = 5) underwent HLA-identical sibling BMT between 2000 and 2003. Prospective evaluations of iron biomarkers were performed and the three groups were compared. RESULTS: The pre-BMT duration and volume of RBC transfusions varied among the three groups, but baseline ferritin and liver iron concentration (LIC) were similar. In contrast, liver histology differed. Liver inflammation was present in four TM patients and portal fibrosis was observed in five TM and one SCD patient. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) developed in 5 of 15 patients. VOD was not associated with age, ferritin, ALT, or transfusions, but an association with liver inflammation and elevated LIC was suggested. Phlebotomy was performed in five patients after BMT. Changes in LIC were minimal in non-phlebotomized patients (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Iron biomarkers demonstrated significant iron overload before BMT in patients with malignant and non-malignant disorders. However, iron overload was associated with liver inflammation and VOD primarily in TM patients. The clinical significance of iron overload in patients after BMT remains uncertain, but this is the first study to suggest that VOD may be associated with transfusional iron burden.","['Jastaniah, Wasil', 'Harmatz, Paul', 'Pakbaz, Zahra', 'Fischer, Roland', 'Vichinsky, Elliott', 'Walters, Mark C']","['Jastaniah W', 'Harmatz P', 'Pakbaz Z', 'Fischer R', 'Vichinsky E', 'Walters MC']","[""University of British Columbia and British Columbia's Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. wasilj@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood/metabolism/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iron/blood/metabolism', 'Iron Overload/blood/*etiology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/metabolism/*therapy', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Liver Diseases/blood/etiology/*metabolism', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'beta-Thalassemia/blood/metabolism/*therapy']",2007/06/09 09:00,2008/01/11 09:00,['2007/06/09 09:00'],"['2007/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Feb;50(2):319-24. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21260.,,,['M01RR01271-16/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1002/pbc.21260 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

A cohort of 25,965 2-month survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed in the U.S. during 1973-2002 was identified and followed through SEER cancer registries. Observed-to-expected ratios (O/E) were calculated, and Poisson regression was used to compare risks among treatment groups. Childhood cancer survivors were at nearly 6-fold risk of developing a new cancer relative to the general population (O/E = 5.9, 95% CI: 5.4-6.5). Most common were subsequent primary cancers of the female breast, central nervous system, bone, thyroid gland and soft tissue, as well as cutaneous melanoma and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). The greatest risks of subsequent cancers occurred among patients diagnosed previously with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), Ewing sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, or retinoblastoma. Risk of subsequent solid cancers was higher among persons whose initial treatment for childhood cancer included radiotherapy, whereas the excess of subsequent ANLL was strongly related to chemotherapy. The O/E for subsequent ANLL increased with increasing calendar year of initial cancer diagnosis among survivors of cancers other than HL, most likely due to increasing use of leukemogenic drugs for solid cancers and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Childhood cancer survivors are at markedly increased risk of developing a variety of new cancers relative to the general population, but the magnitude of excess risk and specific types of second cancer vary widely by type of first cancer.","['Inskip, Peter D', 'Curtis, Rochelle E']","['Inskip PD', 'Curtis RE']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS, Bethesda, MD, USA. inskippe@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2007/06/09 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/06/09 09:00'],"['2007/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 Nov 15;121(10):2233-40. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22827.,,,,['10.1002/ijc.22827 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

We evaluate the detection of an abnormal reactive serological pattern to EBV (ab_EBV) infection and the risk of lymphoma in a multicentric case-control study. Serum samples were collected at study entry from 1,085 incident lymphoma cases from Spain, France, Germany, Czech Republic, Italy and 1,153 age, sex and country matched controls. EBV immunoglobulin G (IgG) serostatus was evaluated through a peptide-based ELISA combining immunodominant epitopes of EBNA1 (BKRF1) and VCA-p18 (BFRF3). Further, immunoblot analysis was performed to evaluate distinct antibody diversity patterns to EBV early antigens (EA), besides EBNA1, VCA-p18, VCA-p40 (BdRF1) and Zebra (BZLF1). Patients with chronic active EBV infection and aberrant EBV activity were characterized as having an abnormal reactive pattern (ab_EBV). Ab_EBV was observed in 20.9% of 2,238 included subjects with an increased proportion of cases presenting ab_EBV as compared to the control population (23.9% vs. 18.0% p = 0.001). Ab_EBV positivity was a risk factor for all lymphomas combined (odds ratio [OR] = 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.15-1.74), and specifically for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (OR = 2.96, 95%CI = 2.22-3.95). Lower levels of ab_EBV were observed for follicular lymphoma (OR = 0.38, 95%CI = 0.15-0.98). EBV may be involved in a larger subset of lymphomas among clinically immunocompetent subjects than previously thought, probably explained by an underlying loss of immune control of EBV latent infection.

The present study compared two quantitative methods used for diagnosing cytomegalovirus infection in a 21-year-old woman with chronic myeloid leukemia after an unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were tested for the presence of HHV-5 DNA using the LightCycler PCR, the quantitative Eclipse CMV DNA Detection Kit, and a qualitative in-house PCR assay using primers that amplify part of the HHV-5 MIE gene. RESULTS: Results from samples containing a low cytomegalovirus load were more accurate with the LightCycler test than those obtained with the Eclipse test, which underestimated the viral load of samples containing low DNA copy numbers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underline the value of novel PCR methods used in current therapeutic procedures and in monitoring antiviral therapy with nucleoside analogs. The high level of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and rapidity provided by the LightCycler instrument are favorable for the use of this system in the detection of HHV-5 DNA in clinical specimens.","['Dzieciatkowski, Tomasz', 'Przybylski, Maciej', 'Tomaszewska, Agnieszka', 'Rokicka, Malgorzata', 'Luczak, Miroslaw']","['Dzieciatkowski T', 'Przybylski M', 'Tomaszewska A', 'Rokicka M', 'Luczak M']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Chalubinskiego 5, 02-004, Warsaw, Poland. dzieciatkowski@wp.pl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Cytomegalovirus/*isolation & purification', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/blood/*complications/drug therapy/*virology', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/complications/*therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2007/06/09 09:00,2007/08/10 09:00,['2007/06/09 09:00'],"['2006/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2007 May-Jun;55(3):199-203. doi: 10.1007/s00005-007-0019-5.

Methyl isobutyl ketone was nominated for study by the National Cancer Institute and the United States Environmental Protection Agency because of its widespread use, the high potential for worker exposure due to its many industrial applications, and its high production volume. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to methyl isobutyl ketone (greater than 99% pure) by inhalation for 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 males and 50 females were exposed to methyl isobutyl ketone at concentrations of 0, 450, 900, or 1,800 ppm by inhalation, 6 hours plus T(90) (12 minutes) per day, 5 days per week for 104 weeks. Survival of males exposed to 1,800 ppm was significantly less than that of the chamber controls. The mean body weights of the 900 and 1,800 ppm males were less than those of the chamber controls after weeks 97 and 89, respectively. In the standard evaluation of the kidney, there were slightly increased incidences of renal tubule adenoma and renal tubule adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in males exposed to 900 or 1,800 ppm, and renal tubule carcinoma in males exposed to 1,800 ppm. The incidences of renal tubule hyperplasia were also significantly increased in the 450 and 1,800 ppm males, and the severities were greater than in the chamber controls. Chronic nephropathy occurred in all males exposed to 1,800 ppm and in 70% to 88% of exposed females, and the severity was increased in 1,800 ppm males. The incidences of transitional epithelial hyperplasia of the renal pelvis in males exposed to 900 or 1,800 ppm and mineralization of the renal papilla in all groups of exposed males were significantly increased. In addition, two female rats exposed to 1,800 ppm had renal mesenchymal tumors. In the extended evaluation of the kidney, renal tubule adenomas and renal tubule hyperplasia occurred in all groups of exposed male rats. In the combined single and step section analysis, the incidences of renal tubule adenoma and renal tubule adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly increased in males exposed to 1,800 ppm. The incidences of renal tubule hyperplasia were also significantly increased in all exposed groups of males. There was a positive trend in the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in males, and the incidence in the 1,800 ppm group was significantly increased. The incidence of adrenal medulla hyperplasia in the 1,800 ppm males was significantly increased. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 males and 50 females were exposed to methyl isobutyl ketone at concentrations of 0, 450, 900, or 1,800 ppm by inhalation, 6 hours plus T(90) (12 minutes) per day, 5 days per week for 105 weeks. Survival of males and females was similar to that of the chamber controls. The mean body weights of females exposed to 1,800 ppm were less than those of the chamber controls after week 17. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly increased in males and females exposed to 1,800 ppm. The incidences of eosinophilic foci were significantly increased in 450 and 1,800 ppm females. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Methyl isobutyl ketone was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535 when tested with and without hamster or rat liver metabolic activation enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of methyl isobutyl ketone in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule neoplasms. Increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in 1,800 ppm male F344/N rats may have been related to methyl isobutyl ketone exposure. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of methyl isobutyl ketone in female F344/N rats based on the occurrence of renal mesenchymal tumors in the 1,800 ppm group. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of methyl isobutyl ketone in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of liver neoplasms.

IL-17 has been demonstrated to link activated T-lymphocyte with the recruitment of neutrophils at sites of inflammation, however whether IL-17 can mediate neutrophil survival and subsequently affect inflammatory responses has not fully been elucidated. In our study, we demonstrate that human peripheral blood and HL-60 differentiated neutrophils express mRNA and cell surface IL-17A receptor. IL-17A does not affect the rate of spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis, however significantly decreased granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-mediated survival by antagonizing the signal transduction pathways of p38, Erk1/2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5B. These events were associated with reduced myeloid cell lymphoma-1 (Mcl-1) protein levels, increased translocation and aggregation of Bax to mitochondria, decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential and in an increase in caspase-3/7 activity. These events were independent of increased Fas or soluble Fas ligand expression levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that IL-17 may regulate neutrophil homeostasis and favor the resolution of inflamed tissues by attenuating the delay in neutrophil apoptosis induced by inflammatory cytokines.","['Dragon, Stephane', 'Saffar, Arash Shoja', 'Shan, Lianyu', 'Gounni, Abdelilah Soussi']","['Dragon S', 'Saffar AS', 'Shan L', 'Gounni AS']","['Department of Immunology and the CIHR National Training Program in Allergy and Asthma, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-17)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-17/genetics/metabolism', 'Solubility/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2007/06/09 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/06/09 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2008 Jan;45(1):160-8. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2007.04.027.

TLX1 possesses immortalising activity in a wide variety of blood cell lineages, however, the effect of this oncogene on haemopoietic cell differentiation has not been fully investigated. We therefore constitutively expressed TLX1 in murine bone marrow or fetal liver cells using retroviral transfer followed by transplantation and/or in vitro culture. TLX1 was found to dramatically alter haemopoiesis, promoting the emergence of a non-haemopoietic CD45(-) CD31(+) cell population while markedly inhibiting erythroid and granulocytic cell differentiation. To identify genetic programs perturbed by TLX1, a comparison of transcript profiles from J2E erythroid cells with and without enforced TLX1 expression was undertaken. This revealed a pattern of gene expression indicative of enhanced proliferation coupled to differentiation arrest. Of the genes identified, two, KIT and VEGFC, were found to be potential TLX1 targets based on transcriptional assays. These results demonstrate that TLX1 can act broadly to impair haemopoiesis and divert differentiation to an alternative fate.

Here, we report the activity of cisplatin against the PPTP panels of childhood cancer xenografts. PROCEDURES: Cisplatin was evaluated against 23 cell lines, and 40 xenografts representing brain tumors, neuroblastoma, rhabdoid tumors, sarcoma, Wilms tumor, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The IC(50) concentration in vitro was determined for 96 hr exposure. Solid tumors were grown subcutaneously in immune-deficient mice, and tumor dimensions measured weekly. ALL xenografts were inoculated intravenously and the percent human CD45(+) cells in the peripheral blood determined weekly. The antitumor activity of cisplatin (7 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally on Days 0 and 21) was evaluated using time to event (EFS T/C), tumor growth delay (tumor volume T/C), and objective response measures. RESULTS: The median IC(50) concentration in vitro was 0.87 microM (0.24-4.29 microM), and cisplatin exhibited broad range activity. Cisplatin induced significant differences in EFS distributions compared to controls in 20/28 solid tumors and 4/8 ALL models. Objective responses were observed in 7/28 solid tumor models (25%): partial responses in three rhabdomyosarcomas and one Ewing's sarcoma; complete responses in one rhabdoid tumor and the medulloblastoma; and a maintained complete response in one Wilms tumor. No objective responses were observed in the ALL panel. CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin exhibits significant antitumor activity against a broad range of solid tumor xenograft models and limited activity against ALL xenografts. This preclinical pattern of activity is generally consistent with cisplatin's clinical activity.","['Tajbakhsh, Mimi', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Morton, Christopher L', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Maris, John M', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Wu, Jianrong', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Smith, Malcolm A', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Tajbakhsh M', 'Houghton PJ', 'Morton CL', 'Kolb EA', 'Gorlick R', 'Maris JM', 'Keir ST', 'Wu J', 'Reynolds CP', 'Smith MA', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cisplatin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Glioma/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/drug therapy', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy', 'Wilms Tumor/drug therapy', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/06/08 09:00,2008/05/16 09:00,['2007/06/08 09:00'],"['2007/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 May;50(5):992-1000. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21263.,,,['N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1002/pbc.21263 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

Dibromoacetic acid was nominated to the National Toxicology Program by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice because of widespread human exposure and because a related dihaloacetate, dichloroacetate, was found to be carcinogenic to the liver of rats and mice. Drinking water was selected as the route of exposure to mimic human exposure to this chemical. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to dibromoacetic acid (greater than 99% pure) in drinking water for 2 weeks, 3 months, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and peripheral blood erythrocytes of exposed mice. 2-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats were exposed to 0, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg/L dibromoacetic acid in drinking water for 2 weeks, equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 17, 32, 67, 134, 270 (males), or 257 (females) mg dibromoacetic acid/kg body weight. All rats survived to the end of the study. Mean body weight gains of 1,000 mg/L males and of 500 mg/L females were significantly greater than those of the controls. Water consumption by exposed and control groups was similar. Liver weights of exposed males and females were significantly increased. Right testis weights of males exposed to 500 mg/L or greater were significantly decreased. The incidences of hepatocytic cytoplasmic alteration were significantly increased in males exposed to 500 mg/L or greater and in 2,000 mg/L females. Testicular lesions, characterized by a delay in spermiation and retained spermatids, were noted in males exposed to 500 mg/L or higher concentrations. 2-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice were exposed to 0, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg/L dibromoacetic acid (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 24, 47, 95, 178, or 370 mg/kg to males and 22, 53, 88, 166, or 309 mg/kg to females) in drinking water for 2 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. Mean body weight gains of 250 and 500 mg/L males were significantly greater than those of the controls. Water consumption by exposed and control groups was similar. Liver weights of males and females in the 1,000 and 2,000 mg/L groups were significantly increased. Thymus weights of males and females in the 1,000 and 2,000 mg/L groups were significantly less than those of controls. The incidences of thymus atrophy were significantly increased in 1,000 and 2,000 mg/L males and 2,000 mg/L females. The incidences of morphological changes to the germinal epithelium of the testes were increased in males exposed to 1,000 or 2,000 mg/L. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to 0, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg/L dibromoacetic acid (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 10, 20, 40, 90, and 166 mg/kg to males and 12, 23, 48, 93, and 181 mg/kg to females) in drinking water for 3 months. All rats survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of male and female rats in the 2,000 mg/L group were significantly less than those of controls. Water consumption by the 2,000 mg/L males at weeks 1 and 13 and by females at week 13 was less than that by controls. Small decreases in the erythron and platelet counts occurred in rats exposed to 2,000 mg/L; minimally impaired erythropoiesis was also seen in 1,000 mg/L rats. Liver weights of all exposed groups of males and females were significantly increased. Male rats in the 2,000 mg/L group had significantly decreased testis weights. Testicular atrophy was noted in the 2,000 mg/L group, and retained spermatids were observed in the 500 and 1,000 mg/L groups. In the pituitary gland of male rats exposed to 2,000 mg/L, the incidence of cellular hypertrophy was significantly increased. The incidences of hepatocellular vacuolization were significantly increased in males exposed to 500 mg/L or greater and in females exposed to 2,000 mg/L. Hematopoietic cell proliferation was noted in females in the 2,000 mg/L group. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed to 0, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg/L dibromoacetic acid (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 16, 30, 56, 115, and 230 mg/kg to males and 17, 34, 67, 132, and 260 mg/kg to females) in drinking water for 3 months. All mice survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights and body weight gains of female mice in the 2,000 mg/L group and the mean body weight gain of 2,000 mg/L males were significantly less than those of controls. Water consumption by males in the 2,000 mg/L group was decreased at weeks 1 and 13 relative to controls. Small decreases in mean cell hemoglobin and platelet counts occurred in 2,000 mg/L male mice. Liver weights of males and females exposed to 500 mg/L or greater were significantly increased. Hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolization was present in most mice and the severity was increased in 1,000 and 2,000 mg/L males and females. The incidences of abnormal testicular morphology were significantly increased in 1,000 and 2,000 mg/L males. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were exposed to drinking water containing 0, 50, 500, and 1,000 mg/L dibromoacetic acid for 2 years (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 2, 20, and 40 mg/kg to males and 2, 25, and 45 mg/kg to females). Survival of exposed rats was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of 1,000 mg/L males and females were less than those of the controls after weeks 29 and 53, respectively, and those of 500 mg/L males and females were less after weeks 57 and 85, respectively. Water consumption by males and females exposed to 1,000 mg/L was less than that by controls during year 2 of the study. The incidence of malignant mesothelioma was significantly increased in 1,000 mg/L male rats. A positive trend in the incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia occurred in female rats, and the incidence in 1,000 mg/L females was significantly increased. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia were increased in 50 and 500 mg/L males. The incidences of cystic degeneration of the liver were significantly increased in all exposed groups of male rats. The incidences of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia were significantly increased in 500 and 1,000 mg/L females, and the incidences of nephropathy were significantly increased in all exposed groups of females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were exposed to drinking water containing 0, 50, 500, and 1,000 mg/L dibromoacetic acid for 2 years (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 4, 45, and 87 mg/kg to males and 4, 35, and 65 mg/kg to females). Survival of exposed mice was similar to that of the controls. Mean body weights of 50 and 500 mg/L male mice were greater than those of the controls after week 85. Water consumption by exposed mice was generally similar to that by controls throughout the study. The incidences of liver neoplasms occurred with positive trends in male and female mice. The incidences of multiple hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and in 500 and 1,000 mg/L females. The incidences of hepatoblastoma were significantly increased in 500 and 1,000 mg/L males, and the incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma were significantly increased in 1,000 mg/L males and 500 mg/L females. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma occurred with positive trends in males and females, and the incidence in 500 mg/L male mice was significantly greater than that in controls. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Dibromoacetic acid was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 with and without rat or hamster liver metabolic activation enzymes (S9); no activity was detected in strain TA98, with or without S9. Increased frequencies of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes were observed in peripheral blood samples from male, but not female, mice administered dibromoacetic acid in drinking water for 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of dibromoacetic acid in male rats based on an increased incidence of malignant mesothelioma. The increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in male rats may have been related to dibromoacetic acid exposure. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of dibromoacetic acid in female rats based on an increased incidence and positive trend of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of dibromoacetic acid in male and female mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms and hepatoblastoma (males only). Increased incidences of lung neoplasms in male mice were also considered to be exposure related. The slight increased incidence of lung neoplasms in female mice may have been related to dibromoacetic acid exposure. Exposure to dibromoacetic acid for 2 years caused increased incidences of cystic degeneration of the liver in male rats, increased incidences of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and nephropathy in female rats, and increased incidences of splenic hematopoiesis in male mice.",,,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Technical Report']",United States,Natl Toxicol Program Tech Rep Ser,National Toxicology Program technical report series,8500747,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Mutagens)', '7FUW62YY5L (dibromoacetic acid)']",IM,"['Acetates/*toxicity', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'CHO Cells', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology/pathology', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Kidney Diseases/chemically induced/pathology', 'Liver/drug effects/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/chemically induced/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/chemically induced/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/chemically induced', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects/genetics', 'Testis/drug effects/pathology', '*Toxicity Tests', 'Water Supply']",2007/06/08 09:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2007/06/08 09:00'],"['2007/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Natl Toxicol Program Tech Rep Ser. 2007 Apr;(537):1-320.,,['National Toxicology Program'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling and its downstream targets are intimately linked with several types of cancer with colon cancer being the best-studied example. However, recent results also suggest an important role of Wnt signaling in normal as well as leukemic hematopoietic stem cells. Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling and downstream effectors has been demonstrated in acute myeloid leukemia. Here, mutant receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Flt3 and chimeric transcription factors such as promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor-alpha and acute myeloid leukemia1-ETO, induce downstream Wnt signaling events. These findings suggest that the Wnt signaling pathway is an important target in several leukemogenic pathways and may provide a novel opportunity for targeting leukemic stem cells.","['Mikesch, J-H', 'Steffen, B', 'Berdel, W E', 'Serve, H', 'Muller-Tidow, C']","['Mikesch JH', 'Steffen B', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Wnt Proteins)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Wnt Proteins/*physiology']",2007/06/08 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/06/08 09:00'],"['2007/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Aug;21(8):1638-47. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404732.

Alternatively, oligoclonality may be a result of recruitment of a preexisting defective clone, such as in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In PNH, exogenous permissive factors may be required for dominance of the abnormal clone, while in MDS, stem cells undergo transformation steps leading to a growth advantage. Stem or multipotent progenitor cell involvement in PNH is evidenced by long-term persistence of a clonal defect and its presence in all blood cells. In MDS, some clonal aberrations may have a 'founder-effect' and additional defects are secondary. Metaphase cytogenetics measures the proportion of clonal cells within dividing progenitor but not mature cells. Owing to low resolution, lesions can be found in only approximately 50% of MDS patients. This shortcoming may be overcome by application of newer technologies such as comparative genomic hybridization and SNP array-based karyotyping (SNP-A). SNP-A facilitates identification of cryptic lesions in bone marrow failure patients with normal or abnormal cytogenetics and allows for detection of loss of heterozygosity as a result of uniparental disomy, a lesion frequently found in MDS.","['Tiu, R', 'Gondek, L', ""O'Keefe, C"", 'Maciejewski, J P']","['Tiu R', 'Gondek L', ""O'Keefe C"", 'Maciejewski JP']","['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Biological Evolution', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/etiology/*pathology', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*pathology', 'Syndrome']",2007/06/08 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/06/08 09:00'],"['2007/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Aug;21(8):1648-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404757.

We therefore employed two separate inhibitors, Y-27632 and fasudil, to inhibit the activity of rho-kinase against ex vivo CD34(+) cells collected from patients with CML. We compared the effects of rho-kinase inhibition in those cells with the effects of direct inhibition of BCR/ABL using the specific inhibitor imatinib. We found that inhibition of rho-kinase inhibited the effective proliferation, and reduced survival of CML progenitor cells. When combined with imatinib, rho-kinase inhibition added to the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of the BCR/ABL inhibitor.

In contrast to their efficacy in cell lines, FLT3-specific inhibitors as single agents have only modest clinical activity in patients with AML. As demonstrated here, overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins of the BCL2 family leads to resistance against FLT3 inhibitors in a hematopoietic cell line model with activating FLT3 mutations. The susceptibility to FLT3 inhibition could be restored by treatment with the novel BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Primary AML samples tested in our study showed a high expression of BCL2 protein, but not of BCL-xL or MCL1. BCL2 protein levels were not reduced after dephosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream target STAT5 in patient samples with FLT3 internal tandem duplications. Interestingly, treatment with ABT-737 caused apoptotic cell death in all primary AML samples at submicromolar level and synergized efficiently with FLT3 inhibition in AML samples with activating FLT3 mutations. In contrast to AML cell lines, BCR-ABL transformed human cells showed resistance to ABT-737, which might be due to the induction of MCL1 by BCR-ABL. Inhibition of BCL2 family members might define a novel highly efficient and specific strategy in the combined or monotreatment of AML.","['Kohl, T M', 'Hellinger, C', 'Ahmed, F', 'Buske, C', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Bohlander, S K', 'Spiekermann, K']","['Kohl TM', 'Hellinger C', 'Ahmed F', 'Buske C', 'Hiddemann W', 'Bohlander SK', 'Spiekermann K']","['Clinical Cooperative Group Leukemia, Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Munich, Germany. tobias.kohl@gsf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2007/06/08 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/06/08 09:00'],"['2007/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Aug;21(8):1763-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404776.

In total, 158 patients were available for analysis, and 61 out of 158 patients (39%) were diagnosed with an underlying AD. Patients with AD were predominantly women and significantly younger at lymphoma diagnosis (56 versus 67 years, P=0.004), with a significantly higher rate of extragastric lymphomas (P=0.012). Furthermore, lymphomas in these patients showed a lower frequency of trisomy 3 (P=0.04) and a significantly lower response rate to Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy in the case of gastric lymphomas (P=0.03). All other parameters including estimated median time to relapse were comparable between both groups. Our data suggest that patients with AD develop MALT lymphoma significantly earlier in life.

Recently, Na(+),K(+)-ATPase has emerged as a potential target for cancer therapy. However, its exact signaling pathway in human T-cell leukemia cell death has not been well defined. In the current study, we found CD95(APO-1) was able to trigger the internalization of plasma membrane Na(+),K(+)-ATPase in Jurkat cells or primary T cells as a mechanism to suppress its activity. This internalization was closely relevant to intracellular glutathione (GSH) depletion in Jurkat cells downstream of Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspase 8. GSH depletion in Fas L-treated Jurkat cells induced the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), which subsequently increased the serine phosphorylation of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit. Exogenous H(2)O(2) even mimicked the effect of Fas L to upregulate the serine phosphorylation of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit and suppress Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. Overall, our results indicate that CD95(APO-1) induces the FADD- and caspase 8-dependent internalization of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase through intracellular GSH loss, and the subsequent generation of H(2)O(2)-mediated serine phosphorylation of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit. Taken together, this study presents a novel regulatory mechanism of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase in CD95(APO-1)-mediated human T-leukemia cell apoptosis.","['Yin, W', 'Cheng, W', 'Shen, W', 'Shu, L', 'Zhao, J', 'Zhang, J', 'Hua, Z-C']","['Yin W', 'Cheng W', 'Shen W', 'Shu L', 'Zhao J', 'Zhang J', 'Hua ZC']","[""The State Key Lab of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, College of Life Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (RIPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Ouabain/metabolism', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/*pharmacology']",2007/06/08 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/06/08 09:00'],"['2007/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Aug;21(8):1669-78. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404791.

We previously showed that ATLL cells constitutively express high levels of PTHrP via activation of promoters P2 and P3, resulting in HHM. In this study, we characterized a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding site in the P2 promoter of human PTHrP. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we detected a specific complex in Tax-expressing human T cells composed of p50/c-Rel, and two distinct complexes in ATLL cells consisting of p50/p50 homodimers and a second unidentified protein(s). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed in vivo binding of p50 and c-Rel on the PTHrP P2 promoter. Using transient co-transfection with NF-kappaB expression plasmids and PTHrP P2 luciferase reporter-plasmid, we showed that NF-kappaB p50/p50 alone and p50/c-Rel or p50/Bcl-3 cooperatively upregulated the PTHrP P2 promoter. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by Bay 11-7082 reduced PTHrP P2 promoter-initiated transcripts in HTLV-1-infected T cells. In summary, the data demonstrated that transcriptional regulation of PTHrP in ATLL cells can be controlled by NF-kappaB activation and also suggest a Tax-independent mechanism of activation of PTHrP in ATLL.","['Nadella, M V P', 'Dirksen, W P', 'Nadella, K S', 'Shu, S', 'Cheng, A S', 'Morgenstern, J A', 'Richard, V', 'Fernandez, S A', 'Huang, T H', 'Guttridge, D', 'Rosol, T J']","['Nadella MV', 'Dirksen WP', 'Nadella KS', 'Shu S', 'Cheng AS', 'Morgenstern JA', 'Richard V', 'Fernandez SA', 'Huang TH', 'Guttridge D', 'Rosol TJ']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HTLV-I Infections/metabolism/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2007/06/08 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/06/08 09:00'],"['2007/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Aug;21(8):1752-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404798.

To gain insight into the general activation and signaling mechanisms of RTKs, we investigated the activation-dependent dynamic membrane distributions of wild-type and oncogenic forms of Kit in hematopoietic cells. Ligand-induced recruitment of wild-type Kit to lipid rafts after stimulation by Kit ligand (KL) and the constitutive localization of oncogenic Kit in lipid rafts are necessary for Kit-mediated proliferation and survival signals. KL-dependent and oncogenic Kit kinase activity resulted in recruitment of the regulatory phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) subunit p85 to rafts where the catalytical PI3-K subunit p110 constitutively resides. Cholesterol depletion by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin prevented Kit-mediated activation of the PI3-K downstream target Akt and inhibited cellular proliferation by KL-activated or oncogenic Kit, including mutants resistant to the Kit inhibitor imatinib-mesylate.

This report demonstrates that age-related defects in lymphopoiesis underlie the myeloid dominance of adult leukemia. Using a murine model of chronic myeloid leukemia, an adult-onset malignancy that arises from transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by the BCR-ABL(P210) oncogene, we demonstrate that young bone marrow (BM) cells that were transformed with BCR-ABL(P210) initiated both a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) and B-lymphoid leukemia, whereas BCR-ABL(P210)-transformed old BM cells recapitulated the human disease by inducing an MPD with rare lymphoid involvement. In addition, the lesser severity of MPDs initiated from old BCR-ABL(P210)-transduced BM cells revealed unappreciated defects in aged myeloid progenitors. These data demonstrate that aging affects patterns of leukemogenesis and indicate that the effects of senescence on hematopoiesis are more extensive than previously appreciated.","['Signer, Robert A J', 'Montecino-Rodriguez, Encarnacion', 'Witte, Owen N', 'McLaughlin, Jami', 'Dorshkind, Kenneth']","['Signer RA', 'Montecino-Rodriguez E', 'Witte ON', 'McLaughlin J', 'Dorshkind K']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Hematopoietic Malignancies Program, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angels, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', '*Aging', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology', '*Lymphopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cells/*pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/pathology', 'Retroviridae']",2007/06/08 09:00,2007/10/31 09:00,['2007/06/08 09:00'],"['2007/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Sep 15;110(6):1831-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-01-069401.

Nevertheless, the specificity and inhibitor sensitivity of the BLV protease (PR) have not been characterized in detail. To facilitate such studies, a molecular model for the enzyme was built. The specificity of the BLV PR was studied with a set of oligopeptides representing naturally occurring cleavage sites in various retroviruses. Unlike HTLV-1 PR, but similar to the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) enzyme, BLV PR was able to hydrolyse the majority of the peptides, mostly at the same position as did their respective host PRs, indicating a broad specificity. When amino acid residues of the BLV PR substrate-binding sites were replaced by equivalent ones of the HIV-1 PR, many substitutions resulted in inactive protein, indicating a great sensitivity to mutations, as observed previously for the HTLV-1 PR. The specificity of the enzyme was studied further by using a series of peptides containing amino acid substitutions in a sequence representing a naturally occurring HTLV-1 PR cleavage site. Also, inhibitors of HIV-1 PR, HTLV-1 PR and other retroviral proteases were tested on the BLV PR. Interestingly, the BLV PR was more susceptible than the HTLV-1 PR to the inhibitors tested. Therefore, despite the specificity differences, in terms of mutation intolerance and inhibitor susceptibility of the PR, BLV and the corresponding animal-model systems may provide good models for testing of PR inhibitors that target HTLV-1.","['Sperka, Tamas', 'Miklossy, Gabriella', 'Tie, Yunfeng', 'Bagossi, Peter', 'Zahuczky, Gabor', 'Boross, Peter', 'Matuz, Krisztina', 'Harrison, Robert W', 'Weber, Irene T', 'Tozser, Jozsef']","['Sperka T', 'Miklossy G', 'Tie Y', 'Bagossi P', 'Zahuczky G', 'Boross P', 'Matuz K', 'Harrison RW', 'Weber IT', 'Tozser J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Biology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cattle', 'HIV-1/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2007/06/08 09:00,2007/07/26 09:00,['2007/06/08 09:00'],"['2007/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2007 Jul;88(Pt 7):2052-2063. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.82704-0.,,,"['R01 GM062920/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM062920/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'TW01001/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1099/vir.0.82704-0 [doi]'],,10.1099/vir.0.82704-0 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,

Although intense or prolonged activation of this pathway is known to induce apoptosis, the molecular mechanisms coupling stress-induced eIF2 alpha phosphorylation to the cell death machinery have remained incompletely understood. In this study, we characterized apoptosis initiation in response to classical activators of the ISR (tunicamycin, UVC, elevated osmotic pressure, arsenite). We found that all applied stress stimuli activated a mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis initiation. Rapid and selective down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein MCL-1 preceded the activation of BAX, BAK, and caspases. Stabilization of MCL-1 blocked apoptosis initiation, while cells with reduced MCL-1 protein content were strongly sensitized to stress-induced apoptosis. Stress-induced elimination of MCL-1 occurred with unchanged protein turnover and independently of MCL-1 mRNA levels. In contrast, stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha at Ser(51) was both essential and sufficient for the down-regulation of MCL-1 protein in stressed cells. These findings indicate that stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha is directly coupled to mitochondrial apoptosis regulation via translational repression of MCL-1. Down-regulation of MCL-1 enables but not enforces apoptosis initiation in stressed cells.","['Fritsch, Ralph M', 'Schneider, Gunter', 'Saur, Dieter', 'Scheibel, Melanie', 'Schmid, Roland M']","['Fritsch RM', 'Schneider G', 'Saur D', 'Scheibel M', 'Schmid RM']","['Department of Medicine 2, Technical University of Munich, 81675 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Arsenites/pharmacology', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Osmosis', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Serine/chemistry', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2007/06/08 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/06/08 09:00'],"['2007/06/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Aug 3;282(31):22551-62. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M702673200.

Out of the 8 cell lines used in the study as representatives of different types of cancer, MDPTQ was found to be effective only against leukemia cell lines (HL-60 and K-562) whereas it had no effect on normal human bone marrow cells (BMC) which were used as controls. Fall mitochondrial membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) were mainly responsible for inducing apoptosis in the two cell lines. Cell death was demonstrated by increase in caspase 3 activity as well as phosphatidyl serine exposure. Pre-incubation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced the increased ROS and caspase 3 activity as well as phosphatidyl serine exposure. MDPTQ also caused cell cycle arrest in these cell lines.

However, no direct target of Cer leading to apoptosis has been identified. Understanding the movement and trafficking of Cer is important for fully understanding Cer signaling. In this study, we identified, for the first time, the transbilayer movement of Cer in the plasma membrane (PM) of living cells. We developed a new method to monitor transbilayer Cer movement using ceramide kinase activity. To produce Cer on the extracellular leaflet of the PM, bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) was added to rat basophilic leukemia cells. Interestingly, the dramatic elevation of ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), the product of CerK, was observed following the increase of Cer induced by SMase treatment. Since we determined that both the protein and catalytic activity of CerK exists in the intracellular compartment, the all conversion of Cer to C1P by CerK should be occur intracellularly. This result indicates the rapid transbilayer movement of Cer from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet of the PM of living cells. Furthermore, protease digestion of membrane proteins, inhibition of ABC transporters (by glibencramide) and of cation channels (by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrozone), and modification of cholesterol content did not affect the transbilayer movement of Cer. Thus, this movement might occur spontaneously. Our findings indicate not only Cer movement in the PM, but also identify an intrinsic property of Cer enabling Cer signaling.","['Mitsutake, Susumu', 'Igarashi, Yasuyuki']","['Mitsutake S', 'Igarashi Y']","['Laboratory of Biomembrane and Biofunctional Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Advanced Life Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita 12.

Control groups were set up for all tests. RESULTS: The cell viability rates of the HL-60 cell treated with 1 micromol/L MG132 for 24 h and 48 h were 92.95% and 85.87% respectively. The apoptotic rats of the HL-60 cells treated with MG132 were increased dose- and time-dependently. Before MG132 treatment K562 cells did not express CD86, and the CD86 expression of the HL-60 cells was up-regulated time-dependently (all P < 0.01). The mRNA expression of CD86 in the HL-60 treated with MG132 was up-regulated time-dependently (P < 0.01). CKK8 test showed that the proliferation level of PBMNC gradually increased along with the concentration of HL-60 cells treated with MG132 and reached its peak when the concentration of the HL-60 cells was 1 x 10(5) (P < 0.01).

In these reactions, dendritic cells from both untreated and treated patients were comparable to dendritic cells from healthy volunteers.

In 3 out of 5 untreated patients, pulsing of DCs with tetanus toxoid promoted a better CD4 response than was achieved with unpulsed DCs, while none of 5 treated patients had an additional response after pulsing with tetanus toxoid. None of patients studied, either treated or untreated, had a better CD8 response to pulsed DCs than to unpulsed ones.

Overexpression of PLAGL2 induces cell transformation and proliferation, but little is known about how its activities are regulated. We previously showed that transcriptional activity of PLAGL2 is negatively regulated by sumoylation. Here we report that Tip60 modulates PLAGL2 functions through acetylation. Tip60 associates with PLAGL2 through its zinc finger domain and acetylates PLAGL2. Wild-type but not the histone acetyltransferase (HAT)-minus mutant form of Tip60 enhances PLAGL2-mediated transactivation. In addition, coexpression of Tip60 and PLAGL2 completely abolishes the sumoylation of PLAGL2. Both Tip60 and DN-Ubc9 increase transactivation activity of wild-type but not the sumoylation deficient form of PLAGL2 (K250, 269, 356R), indicating that Tip60 acetylates PLAGL2 and abolishes the sumoylation of PLAGL2 possibly through modification of the same lysine residues (K250, 269, 356) within PLAGL2. Tip60 effects vary between different PLAGL2 target gene promoters, suggesting that Tip60 is a novel promoter-specific coactivator of PLAGL2. This is the first demonstration that Tip60 can function as a sumoylation inhibitor in part through its intrinsic acetyltransferase activity to regulate specific gene expression.","['Ning, Jinying', 'Zheng, Gang', 'Yang, Yu-Chung']","['Ning J', 'Zheng G', 'Yang YC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PLAGL2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Lysine Acetyltransferase 5)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*genetics', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Lysine/chemistry', 'Lysine Acetyltransferase 5', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2007/06/07 09:00,2008/06/24 09:00,['2007/06/07 09:00'],"['2007/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 Feb 15;103(3):730-9. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21444.,,,,['10.1002/jcb.21444 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,

The NH2-terminal part of MAML2, a basic domain including a binding site of the intracellular domain of NOTCH, was deleted in MLL-MAML2. MLL-MAML2 in secondary AML/MDS and MECT1-MAML2 in mucoepithelioid carcinoma, benign Wartin's tumor, and clear cell hidradenoma consist of the same COOH-terminal part of MAML2.

Applying Sperm protein 17 (Sp17) as the bait in a yeast 2-hybrid system of a testicular cDNA library, 17 interacting clones were isolated and all encoded Ropporin, a spermatogenic cell-specific protein that serves as an anchoring protein for the A-kinase anchoring protein, AKAP110. Ropporin showed a very restricted normal tissue gene expression, detected only in testis and fetal liver. Ropporin mRNA could also be detected in tumor cells from patients with multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Interestingly, expression of Sp17 did not necessarily predict for the expression of Ropporin suggesting that their coexpression in these tumor cells was random rather than coordinated. Ropporin gene expression in tumor cells is associated with the presence of high titer IgG antibodies against Ropporin, suggesting the in vivo translation of the mRNA into protein and the immunogenicity of the protein to the autologous hosts. Using a CT antigen as the bait in a yeast 2-hybrid system may, therefore, identify novel tumor antigen.

Major predictors of vascular events are increasing age and previous thrombosis. Myelosuppressive drugs can reduce the rate of thrombosis, but there is concern that their use raises the risk of transformation into acute leukaemia. To tackle this dilemma, a risk-oriented management strategy is recommended. Low-risk patients should be treated with phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin. Cytotoxic therapy is indicated in high-risk patients, with the drug of choice being hydroxyurea because its leukaemogenicity is low. The recent discovery of JAK2 V617F mutation in the vast majority of polycythaemia vera patients opens new avenues for the treatment of this disease. Novel therapeutic options theoretically devoid of leukaemic risk, such as alpha-interferon and imatinib, affect JAK2 expression in some patients.

RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: The diagnosis was made in 301 children, 33 new cases per year (range 24 to 40) on average. The peak incidence was between 2 and 5 years. Four of 6 infants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and all 4 with mature B-cell leukemia are alive. Two of the remaining 291 children died before treatment was started. 289 were all treated according to the common Nordic NOPHO-ALL 1992 protocol. All children achieved remission (99.7%), except for one who died before remission was achieved. 55 children (19%) relapsed.

Ninety-two percent of methotrexate/cytosine arabinoside cycles were associated with grades 3 to 4 myelosuppression, and 24% resulted in delays in therapy of more than 7 days. Fifteen PEG-L-asparaginase related toxicities occurred in 13 patients (8 allergy, 4 pancreas, 2 central nervous system, and 1 hemorrhage).

Although there is substantial evidence that cytotoxic drugs can augment sensitivity to TRAIL, it has become important to know what kinds of nontoxic drugs can be used together with TRAIL. We thus screened several natural compounds that can overcome resistance to TRAIL and found that a cycloanthranilylproline derivative, Fuligocandin B (FCB), an extract of myxomycete Fuligo candida, exhibited significant synergism with TRAIL. Treatment of the TRAIL-resistant cell line KOB with FCB and TRAIL resulted in apparent apoptosis, which was not induced by either agent alone. FCB increased the production of 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), an endogenous PPAR gamma ligand, through activation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). This unique mechanism highlighted the fact that 15d-PGJ(2) directly enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL by inhibiting multiple antiapoptotic factors. More importantly, similar effects were observed in other leukemia cell lines irrespective of their origin. The enhancement was observed regardless of PPAR gamma expression and was not blocked even by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma) siRNA. These results indicate that 15d-PGJ(2) sensitizes TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL in a PPAR gamma-independent manner and that the use of 15d-PGJ(2) or its inducers, such as FCB, is a new strategy for cancer therapy.","['Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Komiyama, Kanki', 'Hayashi, Masahiko', 'Ishibashi, Masami', 'Sunazuka, Toshiaki', 'Izuhara, Takeshi', 'Sugahara, Kazuyuki', 'Tsuruda, Kazuto', 'Masuda, Masato', 'Takasu, Nobuyuki', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Hasegawa H', 'Yamada Y', 'Komiyama K', 'Hayashi M', 'Ishibashi M', 'Sunazuka T', 'Izuhara T', 'Sugahara K', 'Tsuruda K', 'Masuda M', 'Takasu N', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Tomonaga M', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (cycloanthranilylproline)', '0 (fuligocandin B)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'PPAR gamma/biosynthesis', 'Proline/agonists/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/agonists/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2007/06/07 09:00,2007/10/20 09:00,['2007/06/07 09:00'],"['2007/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Sep 1;110(5):1664-74. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-01-068981.

However, the prognostic significance of this aberration and the best consolidation strategy for patients with it are still not resolved. Additional prognostic indicators are needed to further classify these patients and determine their appropriate management. DESIGN AND METHODS: Individual patient data-based meta-analysis was performed on 131 patients (median age 50 (18-60) years) with +8 as a sole aberration or +8 with one additional aberration treated between 1993 and 2002 in eight prospective German AML treatment trials. All patients received state-of-the-art treatment including high-dose cytarabine with the option for autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). RESULTS: In total, the 131 patients had a 3-year overall survival (OS) of 29% and a 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) of 32%. Independent prognostic factors contributing to shorter OS were age > or = 45 years, extramedullary disease, and a percentage of +8 positive metaphases >/=80%. Combining these three prognostic variables established a hierarchical model for OS. The 3-year OS was 13% for the high-risk group, 36% for the intermediate-risk group, and 55% for the low-risk group (p<0.0001). Age <45 years and allogeneic HSCT (as treated) were independent prognostic factors for longer RFS. Additional cytogenetic aberrations other than t(8;21), inv(16), t(16;16), t(15;17) or 11q23 had no influence on treatment outcome. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We provide a new prognostic model for risk stratification of AML patients with +8. The data indicate that allogeneic HSCT may prolong RFS compared to that achieved with other strategies of post-remission therapy.","['Schaich, Markus', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Al-Ali, Haifa K', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Heil, Gerhard', 'Illmer, Thomas', 'Krahl, Rainer', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Sauerland, Cristina', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Ehninger, Gerhard']","['Schaich M', 'Schlenk RF', 'Al-Ali HK', 'Dohner H', 'Ganser A', 'Heil G', 'Illmer T', 'Krahl R', 'Krauter J', 'Sauerland C', 'Buchner T', 'Ehninger G']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Dresden, Germany. markus.schaich@uniklinikum-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', '*Trisomy']",2007/06/07 09:00,2007/07/04 09:00,['2007/06/07 09:00'],"['2007/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Jun;92(6):763-70. doi: 10.3324/haematol.11100.,,,,['10.3324/haematol.11100 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many cytotoxic drugs induce apoptosis through the generation and accumulation of the sphingolipid breakdown product, ceramide, a coordinator of the cellular response to stress. We, therefore, investigated the contribution of ceramide to the mechanism of action of ATO in APL and ATL. DESIGN AND METHODS: A human APL-derived cell line (NB4), various ATL-derived lines and an HTLV-I-negative malignant T-cell line were cultured and treated with ATO. Growth and apoptosis assays were conducted. Measurements were made of ceramide, diacylglycerol, sphingomyelinase activity, sphingomyelin mass, glucosylceramide synthase activity and the de novo ceramide synthesis. RESULTS: Treatment of APL and ATL-derived cells with a clinically achievable concentration of ATO induced accumulation of cytotoxic levels of ceramide. The effects of ATO on ceramide levels in APL cells were more potent than those of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). ATO downregulated neutral sphingomyelinase activity. In contrast to the effect of ATRA, ATO-induced ceramide accumulation was not due to induction of acidic sphingomyelinase, but rather resulted from both de novo ceramide synthesis and inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase activity. Interestingly, the effects of ATO on de novo ceramide synthesis were similar in APL and ATL-derived cells despite the defective pathway in ATL cells. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ATO-induced ceramide accumulation may represent a general mediator of the effects of ATO, which paves the way for new therapeutic interventions that target the metabolic pathway of this important sphingolipid secondary messenger.","['Dbaibo, Ghassan S', 'Kfoury, Youmna', 'Darwiche, Nadine', 'Panjarian, Shoghag', 'Kozhaya, Lina', 'Nasr, Rihab', 'Abdallah, Mazen', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'El-Sabban, Marwan', 'de The, Hugues', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Dbaibo GS', 'Kfoury Y', 'Darwiche N', 'Panjarian S', 'Kozhaya L', 'Nasr R', 'Abdallah M', 'Hermine O', 'El-Sabban M', 'de The H', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Pediatrics, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Ceramides/*biosynthesis', 'Glucosyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology']",2007/06/07 09:00,2007/07/04 09:00,['2007/06/07 09:00'],"['2007/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Jun;92(6):753-62. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10968.,,,,['10.3324/haematol.10968 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between AML and MDS by comparing the frequency of molecular mutations in the two conditions. DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the frequency of FLT3-length mutations (FLT3-LM), FLT3-TKD, MLL-partial tandem duplications (MLL-PTD), NRAS, and KITD816 in 381 patients with MDS refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB] n=49; with ringed sideroblasts [RARS] n=310; chronic monomyelocytic leukemia [CMML] n=22) and in 4130 patients with AML (de novo: n=3139; secondary AML [s-AML] following MDS: n=397; therapy-related [t-AML]: n=233; relapsed: n=361). RESULTS: All mutations were more frequent in s-AML than in MDS and all but the FLT3-TKD were more frequent in RAEB than in RA/RARS. The higher incidences in s-AML were significant for FLT3-TKD (p=0.032), MLL-PTD (p=0.034), and FLT3-LM (RA/RARS: 0/45; RAEB: 8/293; 2.7%; s-AML: 45/389; 11.6%; p<0.0001). The incidence of NRAS-mutations increased from 17/272 (6.3%) in MDS to 41/343 in s-AML (12.0%) and that of KITD816-mutations from 2/290 (0.7%) to 5/341 (1.5%) (p=n.s.). FLT3-LM-acquisition occurred in 3/22 cases (13.6%) during MDS transformation; NRAS-acquisition occurred in 1/24 (4.2%). FLT3-LM and MLL-PTD were more frequent in AML relapse than in de novo AML or s-AML (p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The increase of molecular mutations from low- to high-risk MDS, to s-AML, and to relapsed AML emphasizes the value of these mutations as markers of progressing disease. Finally, we found a low rate of 5q- in the molecularly mutated cases in MDS which might explain the stability of this subtype.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Schnittger, Susanne']","['Bacher U', 'Haferlach T', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach C', 'Schnittger S']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Molecular Epidemiology', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics', 'ras Proteins/genetics']",2007/06/07 09:00,2007/07/04 09:00,['2007/06/07 09:00'],"['2007/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Jun;92(6):744-52. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10869.,,,,['10.3324/haematol.10869 [doi]'],,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2007 Jun;92(6):723-7.

Although flow cytometry is sometimes used for this purpose and can rapidly evaluate many cells, the accuracy of flow-based plasma cell quantitation compared with morphologic assessment (currently the gold standard) is uncertain as direct comparison studies have not been previously reported. OBJECTIVE: To determine how percentages of plasma cells in diagnostic aspirate smears quantitated by morphologic assessment relate to percentages of plasma cells quantified by flow cytometry. DESIGN: Thirty bone marrow cases with 10% or more plasma cells and leukemia/lymphoma flow cytometry immunophenotyping studies were identified from our hematopathology database. The Wright-stained aspirate smears, marrow biopsy sections, and flow cytometry histograms were reviewed. RESULTS: Morphologically determined plasma cell percentages from the diagnostic aspirate smears were consistently higher than those determined by flow cytometry. Much of this difference appeared to be related to differences in sample quality. However, the cellular processing involved in performing flow cytometry also appeared to reduce plasma cell percentages in many cases.

Novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors as mainstream therapeutic options for the CML patient warrant routine quantification of the BCR-ABL transcript. The Xpert BCR-ABL Monitor assay is a nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction that greatly reduces technical time by using a single cartridge to isolate RNA and run a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Xpert BCR-ABL Monitor assay for quantitative assessment of the BCR-ABL transcript in CML patients. DESIGN: A standard curve of K-562 cells diluted in normal peripheral blood was used to test the sensitivity, linearity, and percent coefficient of variation of the assay. Specimen stability was tested by running standard curves immediately and after 24 hours or 96 hours of storage at 4 degrees C. Specimens from normal controls, patients known to have CML, or patients suspected of having CML were also tested. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the assay was sufficient to detect 1 K-562 cell in 10(5) normal cells. The R2 of the standard curve was 0.98 and the percent coefficient of variation for each data point was 15% to 24%. Eleven of 14 patients with known CML on imatinib treatment tested positive for the BCR-ABL transcript, whereas 10 normal controls tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: The Xpert BCR-ABL Monitor assay is a rapid, sensitive method for monitoring the presence of the BCR-ABL transcript in CML patients. The single-use cartridge minimizes hands-on technical time, minimizes the potential for contamination, and allows quantitative BCR-ABL testing to be performed in a random access fashion.","['Dufresne, Scott D', 'Belloni, Dorothy R', 'Levy, Norman B', 'Tsongalis, Gregory J']","['Dufresne SD', 'Belloni DR', 'Levy NB', 'Tsongalis GJ']","['Department of Pathology, Dartmouth Medical School, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, One Medical Center Dr, Lebanon, NH 03759, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*instrumentation/methods/standards', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA, Neoplasm', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2007/06/07 09:00,2007/06/22 09:00,['2007/06/07 09:00'],"['2007/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2007 Jun;131(6):947-50. doi: 10.5858/2007-131-947-QAOTBT.,,,,"['2006-0896-OAR [pii]', '10.5858/2007-131-947-QAOTBT [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regents and default rules for human tissue donations.",1-27,"The much studied case of Moore v. Regents of the University of California is often considered important in property law for denying property rights in human tissue. This widespread misunderstanding of Moore has not only misplaced the legal emphasis of human tissue donations on property law instead of contract law, but has also hindered the creation of a much-needed default rule governing the issue of compensation for donated tissue. While it is possible that the majority of donors rarely consider compensation as an incentive to donate, without a legally recognized default rule the law remains blurred as to what contractual provisions apply to the exchange between donor and researcher. This Article argues that the solution is a weak default rule of no compensation that may be overridden by evidence that the parties intended otherwise.","['Korobkin, Russell']",['Korobkin R'],"['UCLA School of Law, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Legal Case', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Health Law,Journal of health law,100883816,,,"['Adult', 'Biotechnology/*economics', 'Blood Cells', 'California', 'Compensation and Redress/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Contracts/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Male', 'Motivation', 'Ownership/economics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Patents as Topic/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Research Support as Topic/*economics', 'Tissue Donors/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/economics/*legislation & jurisprudence']",2007/06/07 09:00,2007/07/11 09:00,['2007/06/07 09:00'],"['2007/06/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Health Law. 2007 Winter;40(1):1-27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to having a wide range of biological activities, they are also attractive for their fluorescent properties. We observed interesting fluorescent characteristics in the QBAs-macarpine (MA), sanguirubine (SR), chelirubine (CHR), sanguilutine (SL), chelilutine (CHL), sanguinarine (SA) and chelerythrine (CHE) after interaction with living cells. METHODS: Water stock solutions of the alkaloids (10-100 microg/ml) were added to intact cells, and after a brief incubation the cells were observed. Human cell lines HL60 (human promyelocytic leukemia), HeLa (human cervix adenocarcinoma), and LEP (human lung fibroblasts), and piglet blood were used in the experiments. Blood cells were stained with MA in combination with FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 surface marker antibody. Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and by flow cytometry. RESULTS: All tested alkaloids immediately entered living cells with MA, CHR, and SA binding to DNA. MA showed the best DNA staining properties. Fluorescence microscopy of MA, CHR, and SA stained cells described the nuclear architecture and clearly described chromosomes and apoptotic fragments in living cells. Moreover MA can rapidly represent the cellular DNA content of living cells at a resolution adequate for cell cycle analysis. QBAs were excitable using common argon lasers (488 nm) emitting at a range of 575-755 nm (i.e. fluorescence detectors FL2-5). Spectral characteristics of MA allow simultaneous surface immunophenotyping. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown that MA, CHR, and SA stain nucleic acids in living cells. They can be used as supravital fluorescent DNA probes, both in fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, including multiparameter analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow. MA binds DNA stochiometrically and can provide information on DNA content.","['Slaninova, Iva', 'Slanina, Jiri', 'Taborska, Eva']","['Slaninova I', 'Slanina J', 'Taborska E']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Biology, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5, 62500 Brno, Czech Republic. ipokorna@med.muni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Therefore, the intention in the current study was to clarify the differential elements of studies with 'positive' and 'negative' outcomes. METHODS: The authors performed a comprehensive search of RCT reports on treatments for hematologic malignancies published between 1995 and 2004, with 264 reports eventually identified. The expected rate and the observed rate for the primary endpoint were compared for 70 studies with all relevant information available. RESULTS: Of all the superiority trials (n = 256), positive studies accounted for 33%. Most of the major study characteristics were not found to be associated with the study outcome except for the primary endpoint. Studies evaluating event-free survival were more likely to report positive results than were those evaluating overall survival (P = .061). For the experimental treatment arm, the mean difference between the expected and observed rates was -10.1% (standard deviation [SD], 10.1%) in the negative studies, which indicates a rate lower than expected, and was 1.3% (SD, 9.2%) in the positive studies (P < .0001). In contrast, no statistical significance was observed for the standard treatment arm because the mean difference was 6.3% (SD, 10.7%) for the negative studies and 3.0% (SD, 9.0%) for the positive studies (P = .1885). The journal impact factor was statistically significantly higher for the positive than for the negative reports (P < .0001).

Dexamethasone (Dex) treatment induces a neuron-like differentiation, which is associated with neuritogenesis and nuclear expression of the glucocorticoid receptor and c-Jun. In differentiated UR61 cells, small ubiquitin-like modifiers 1 (SUMO-1) is concentrated in a new category of SUMO-1 nuclear bodies (SNBs) distinct from promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies by their large size and absence of PML protein. SNBs are 1 to 3 mum in diameter and exhibit a fine granular texture by electron microscopy. They are free of splicing factors and transcription foci and show spatial associations with Cajal bodies. In addition to SUMO-1 and the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, which is essential for sumoylation, SNBs concentrate the transcriptional regulators CBP, CREB, and c-Jun. Moreover, transfection experiments demonstrate that SNBs accumulate the active conjugating form of SUMO-1 but not the conjugation defective variant of SUMO-1, supporting that SNBs are sites of sumoylation. Our results suggest that SNBs play a role in the control of the nucleoplasmic concentration of transcription regulators involved in neuroprotection and survival of the UR61 cells.","['Navascues, Joaquin', 'Bengoechea, Rocio', 'Tapia, Olga', 'Vaque, Jose P', 'Lafarga, Miguel', 'Berciano, Maria T']","['Navascues J', 'Bengoechea R', 'Tapia O', 'Vaque JP', 'Lafarga M', 'Berciano MT']","['Division of Gene Regulation and Expression, Wellcome Trust Biocentre, University of Dundee, DD1 5EH, Dundee, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Chromosoma,Chromosoma,2985138R,"['0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CREB-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dexamethasone', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Neurons/chemistry/*metabolism', 'PC12 Cells', 'Rats', 'SUMO-1 Protein/chemistry/*isolation & purification/metabolism']",2007/06/06 09:00,2008/03/06 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chromosoma. 2007 Oct;116(5):441-51. doi: 10.1007/s00412-007-0107-7.

We herein report a case of F/P-positive CEL with retro-orbital localization, who was successfully treated with imatinib. CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old male presented an absolute eosinophil count of 25,000/mm(3), anemia (Hb 10.2 g/dl) and a moderate increase in the platelet count (571,000/mm(3)). A clinical examination revealed left exophthalm, associated with diffuse hypoesthesia and diplopia. A CT scan of orbits showed a lesion located in the lachrymal fossa of the left orbit with intra- and extra-conical extension. Molecular analysis excluded the presence of bcr/abl transcript while a F/P fusion tyrosine kinase signal was documented. Imatinib mesylate (IM) was started and, after 7 days of treatment eosinophil count significantly declined along with a dramatic reduction of the left exophthalm. IM dosage was increased up to 300 mg/day. The drug was well tolerated with an initial modest haematological toxicity. The left exophthalm, as well as hypoesthesia and diplopia, disappeared after IM therapy. MRI showed a clear reduction of the intra- and extra-conical growth process. BM molecular signal of the F/P fusion gene resulted undetectable after 4 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSION: In our case, the diagnosis of FIPIL1-PDGFRA-positive CEL and IM therapy has allowed the patient to experience an excellent clinical therapeutic result, avoiding surgical treatment of the retro-orbital mass.","['Vigna, Ernesto', 'Lucia, Eugenio', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Mazzone, Carla', 'Bisconte, Maria Grazia', 'Gentile, Carlo', 'Armentano, Antonio', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Rondoni, Michela', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Morabito, Fortunato']","['Vigna E', 'Lucia E', 'Gentile M', 'Mazzone C', 'Bisconte MG', 'Gentile C', 'Armentano A', 'Ottaviani E', 'Rondoni M', 'Martinelli G', 'Morabito F']","['Unita Operativa di Ematologia Medicine, Cosenza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Orbital Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*metabolism']",2007/06/06 09:00,2008/04/10 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2008 Apr;61(4):713-6. doi: 10.1007/s00280-007-0507-7.

The majority of studies so far have been focusing on the expansion of tumor infiltrated lymphocytes (TIL) and some have shown very encouraging results. Recently, we have developed a unique tumor immune response activator, dendritomas, by fusion of dendritic cells and tumor cells. Animal studies and early clinical trials have shown that dendritomas are able to activate tumor specific immune responses. In this study, we hypothesized that naive T cells can be primed with dendritomas and expanded in vitro to develop an adoptive transfer therapy for patients who do not have solid tumors, such as leukemia. T cells were isolated and purified from lymph nodes of mice. The cells were then incubated with dendritomas made from syngeneic DCs and tumor cells and expanded in vitro using Dynabeads mouse CD3/CD28 T cell expander for approximately three weeks. The in vitro primed and expanded T cells showed tumor cell specific CTL activity and increased secretion of IFN-gamma. Tumor bearing mice receiving the in vitro expanded T cells survived significantly longer than control mice. Furthermore, the depletion of regulator T cells enhanced the survival of the mice that received the adoptive transfer therapy.","['Li, Jinhua', 'Theofanous, Leigh', 'Stickel, Sara', 'Bouton-Verville, Hilary', 'Burgin, Kelly E', 'Jakubchak, Susan', 'Wagner, Thomas E', 'Wei, Yanzhang']","['Li J', 'Theofanous L', 'Stickel S', 'Bouton-Verville H', 'Burgin KE', 'Jakubchak S', 'Wagner TE', 'Wei Y']","['Oncology Research Institute, Greenville Hospital System University Medical Center, Greenville, SC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD28 Antigens/analysis', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*transplantation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2007/06/06 09:00,2007/09/15 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Jul;31(1):193-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemic cells were isolated from bone marrow or blood from 94 patients. Topo IIalpha mRNA (n=58) and protein (n=60) expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. In both groups, chemosensitivity testing by a bioluminescence ATP assay was performed to a variable extent for both topo IIalpha poisons and non-topo IIalpha targeting drugs. Topo IIalpha mRNA expression varied with relative values ranging from 0.03 to 14.20 (median 1.10). The median value for topo IIalpha protein-positive cells was 23% (range 0-99%). Cell samples from patients with a high (>median value) percentage of topo IIalpha-positive cells were significantly more sensitive to the topo IIalpha active drugs etoposide and daunorubicin, and showed a borderline value for idarubicin (p=0.08), while there was no difference for non-topo IIalpha targeting drugs. However, we did not find any significant differences in mRNA expression or the percentage of topo IIalpha-positive cells in patients who achieved complete remission after at most two induction courses compared with those who did not, nor did we find any difference in survival when patients with high mRNA expression/percentage of topo IIalpha-positive cells were compared with patients with low values. We conclude that expression of topo IIalpha, determined as percentage of topo IIalpha-positive cells, in leukaemic cells correlates to chemosensitivity in vitro against topoisomerase poisons but that it does not predict clinical outcome in acute leukaemia.","['Uggla, Bertil', 'Tina, Elisabet', 'Nahi, Hareth', 'Paul, Christer', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Sirsjo, Allan', 'Tidefelt, Ulf']","['Uggla B', 'Tina E', 'Nahi H', 'Paul C', 'Hoglund M', 'Sirsjo A', 'Tidefelt U']","['Department of Medicine, Orebro University Hospital, 701 85 Orebro, Sweden. bertil.uggla@orebroll.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism']",2007/06/06 09:00,2007/09/15 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Jul;31(1):153-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A less efficient G2-M-checkpoint may allow the transition of damaged cells from G2- to M-phase and experimental data in the present work support this hypothesis. In fact HQ sensitizes lymphocytes obtained from healthy donors, as they exhibit increased G2-chromosomal radiosensitivity which interestingly is similar to that observed in cases of radiosensitive cancer-prone individuals. This finding is important since a deficiency in cell cycle checkpoints and an increase in G2-chromosomal radiosensitivity are linked to chromosomal instability, cancer proneness and the development of leukemia. The observed chromosome radiosensitization may be a consequence either of an effect of HQ on the initial induction of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations, or on the DNA repair capacity of the cells, or it may be linked to HQ-induced alterations in the cell cycle and feedback control mechanism during the G2- to M-phase transition. In order to elucidate which is the mechanism involved, conventional cytogenetics and premature chromosome condensation (PCC) methodologies were applied. The experimental data obtained support the hypothesis that HQ increases G2-chromosomal radiosensitivity in human peripheral blood lymphocytes by inducing a less efficient G2-M-checkpoint, facilitating thus the transition of damaged cells from G2- to M-phase.","['Hatzi, Vasiliki I', 'Terzoudi, Georgia I', 'Pantelias, Gabriel E', 'Spiliopoulou, Chara', 'Makropoulos, Vasilios']","['Hatzi VI', 'Terzoudi GI', 'Pantelias GE', 'Spiliopoulou C', 'Makropoulos V']","['Institute of Nuclear Technology and Radiation Protection, National Center for Scientific Research, NCSR Demokritos, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Marine Toxins)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '7D07U14TK3 (calyculin A)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Benzene/metabolism', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Marine Toxins', 'Oxazoles/toxicity', 'Radiation Tolerance/*drug effects']",2007/06/06 09:00,2007/09/15 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Jul;31(1):145-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite advances made over the past decades, the overall survival of patients with lung cancer remains dismal. Here we report novel G-quartet oligodeoxynucleotides (GQ-ODN) that were designed to selectively target signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), in the treatment of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of two novel GQ-ODN STAT3 inhibitors, T40214 and T40231, on NSCLC bearing nude mice. NSCLC bearing nude mice were assigned to 5 groups, which were treated by vehicle, control ODN, T40214, T40231, and Paclitaxel, respectively. Tumors were measured, isolated and analyzed using Western blotting, immuno-histochemistry, RPA and TUNEL. Results show that GQ-ODN T40214 and T40231 significantly suppress the growth of NSCLC tumors in nude mice by selectively inhibiting the activation of Stat3 and its downstream proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, survivin, VEGF, Cyclin D1 and c-myc; thereby, promoting apoptosis and reducing angiogenesis and cell proliferation. These findings validate Stat3 as an important molecular target for NSCLC therapy and demonstrate the efficacy of GQ-ODN in inhibiting Stat3 phosphorylation.","['Weerasinghe, Priya', 'Garcia, Gabriela E', 'Zhu, Qiqing', 'Yuan, Ping', 'Feng, Lili', 'Mao, Li', 'Jing, Naijie']","['Weerasinghe P', 'Garcia GE', 'Zhu Q', 'Yuan P', 'Feng L', 'Mao L', 'Jing N']","['Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (GQ-ODN T40214)', '0 (GQ-ODN T40231)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Survivin', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2007/06/06 09:00,2007/09/15 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Jul;31(1):129-36.,,,"['CA58204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97007/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The responsible anticancer mechanism, however, is not clear. Here we demonstrated an inhibitory mechanism due to a Scutellaria barbata extract (SBE) on a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) that has a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene p53. HL-60 cells were incubated with various concentrations of SBE. After a 24-h incubation, cytotoxicity and apoptosis were determined by MTT and DNA fragmentation assay, respectively. After treatment with SBE, cell cycle arrest was determined by measuring the cell number stained by 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD). Treatment of cells with SBE resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of growth and a G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle. This effect was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of cyclin A, D1, D2, D3, and E and their activating partners, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 2, 4, and 6 with concomitant upregulation of p21, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Downstream of the CDK inhibitory protein-CDK/cyclin cascade, SBE decreased phosphorylation level of retinoblastoma protein. SBE treatment also resulted in apoptosis evidenced by an increase of sub-G1 phase cells, DNA fragmentation and degradation of the inhibitory protein for the caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease. The molecular mechanism during SBE-mediated growth inhibition in HL-60 cells may be due to modulation of the cell-cycle machinery and the induction of apoptosis.","['Kim, Eun-Kyung', 'Kwon, Kang-Beom', 'Han, Mi-Jeong', 'Song, Mi-Young', 'Lee, Ji-Hyun', 'Ko, Youn-Suk', 'Shin, Byung-Cheal', 'Yu, Jiahua', 'Lee, Young-Rae', 'Ryu, Do-Gon', 'Park, Jin-Woo', 'Park, Byung-Hyun']","['Kim EK', 'Kwon KB', 'Han MJ', 'Song MY', 'Lee JH', 'Ko YS', 'Shin BC', 'Yu J', 'Lee YR', 'Ryu DG', 'Park JW', 'Park BH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical School and Institute for Medical Sciences, Chonbuk National University, Jeonbuk, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Formazans)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Formazans/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*metabolism/*therapeutic use', '*Scutellaria']",2007/06/06 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2007 Jul;20(1):123-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two major caspase pathways have been identified in the signal transduction leading to DNA fragmentation: the receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway. DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) has been identified as a major apoptotic endonuclease in the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation process. However, the potential roles of caspases and DFF in internucleosomal DNA fragmentation induced by specific stimuli still need to be investigated since caspase-independent pathways and nuclease(s) other than DFF also play important roles during this process. In the present study, we investigated the activity of GP7 (4-[4""-(2"",2"",6"",6""-tetramethyl-l""-piperidinyloxy) amino]-4'-demethyl epipodophyllotoxin), a new spin-labeled derivative of podophyllotoxin semi-synthesized by our university, to induce apoptosis of the human leukemia cell line NB4. GP7 induced the release of cytochrome-c from mitochondria, activations of caspase-3, -8, and -9, cleavage of DFF45/inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase, activation of DFF40/caspase-activated DNase, and apoptotic DNA fragmentation in NB4 cells. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk abrogated GP7-induced caspase-3, -8, and -9 activations but could not inhibit GP7-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation in NB4 cells. Our findings suggest that GP7-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation in NB4 cells is independent of caspase activation and DFF, although they are closely involved in this process.","['Qi, She-Ning', 'Jing, Yuan-Xue', 'Dong, Gen-Xi', 'Chen, Yan', 'Yoshida, Akira', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Qi SN', 'Jing YX', 'Dong GX', 'Chen Y', 'Yoshida A', 'Ueda T']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Basic Medicine, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, P.R.

Recently, clinical trials of GSI for refractory T-ALL have commenced. In the present study, we examined the effects of three types of GSI; GSI-I, GSI-IX, and GSI-XII on the growth of four B-cell malignant lymphoma (B-ML) and four acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines as well as four T-ALL cell lines. We found that GSI also suppressed the in vitro growth of some B-ML and AML cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Growth suppression occurred through induction of apoptosis. Expression of the HES1 gene, one of the targets of Notch signaling, was high in T-ALL cells with NOTCH1 mutations, but was low in GSI-sensitive B-ML and AML cells. GSI treatment decreased HES1 mRNA expression in T-ALL cells, while GSI increased HES1 mRNA in two GSI-sensitive B-ML and AML cell lines. In immunoblot analysis, the band for the intracellular fragment of Notch1, an active form of Notch1, was dense in T-ALL cells but was faint in GSI-sensitive B-ML and AML cells; attenuation of the band by GSI was not evident. These findings suggest that GSI may act on Notch 2, 3 or 4 protein, or some pathways other than Notch signaling in GSI-sensitive B-ML and AML cells. Namely, growth suppression by GSI may involve cell growth-related proteins, which are gamma-secretase substrates. Taken together, we have shown that GSI may be useful for the treatment of hematological malignancies other than T-ALL. The mechanism behind the effects remains to be clarified. Our investigations lead to a novel molecular target therapy for chemotherapy-resistant leukemia and lymphomas.","['Kogoshi, Hanae', 'Sato, Taku', 'Koyama, Takatoshi', 'Nara, Nobuo', 'Tohda, Shuji']","['Kogoshi H', 'Sato T', 'Koyama T', 'Nara N', 'Tohda S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2007/06/06 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2007 Jul;18(1):77-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis reveals that of the 6571 patients, 1200 (18.27%) underwent laboratory processes or tests. Of these 1200 processes or tests, 676 (56.34%) showed abnormal findings. Of the 676 patients with abnormal findings, 122 (18.05%) cases were serious enough to justify a referral to a medical doctor (general practitioner or specialist) for immediate follow-up. Among these serious conditions, one was a bone neoplastic pathology and one was a case of leukemia. This study emphasizes the significant contribution of laboratory tests in chiropractic practice. Its importance rests not only with teaching purposes, but also rests with the proper assessment of clinical conditions frequently observed in chiropractic practice. Laboratory tests used in a proper context serve not only as a valuable instrument to identify primary and underlying abnormal physiological factors, but also assist the chiropractor in identifying more precisely those cases that require a medical referral. This study also demonstrates that laboratory testing of chiropractic patients is a necessary and essential clinical procedure for complete public protection.

Here we have studied the effect of the phenylbenzo-gamma-pyrone-derivative quercetin 3-methyl ether tetracetate (QD), obtained by acetylation of the natural product quercetin 3-methyl ether, on cell viability of human leukemia HL-60 and U937 cell lines. The results show that QD was cytotoxic and induced G2-M phase cell cycle arrest on both cell lines and it was a potent apoptotic inducer on HL-60 cells. QD-induced apoptosis is (i) mediated by caspase activation, since it was prevented by the non-specific caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, (ii) associated with cytochrome c release and (iii) triggered in Bcl-2 over-expressing U937 cells. The treatment of HL-60 and U937 cells with QD also induces the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2. Inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase by SP600125 and of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase by SB203580 had no influence on QD-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of ERK1/2 with the pharmacologic inhibitors U0126 or PD98059, together with QD, resulted in an important enhancement of apoptosis. Cells are sensitized to QD-mediated apoptosis after blocking ERK1/2, which suggests that inhibition of this pathway is a valuable strategy to increase the sensitivity of human leukemia HL-60 cells toward QD.","['Rubio, Sara', 'Quintana, Jose', 'Eiroa, Jose L', 'Triana, Jorge', 'Estevez, Francisco']","['Rubio S', 'Quintana J', 'Eiroa JL', 'Triana J', 'Estevez F']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Plaza Dr. Pasteur s/n, 35016 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (quercetin 3-O-methyl ether)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Quercetin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'U937 Cells']",2007/06/06 09:00,2007/12/15 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2007 Oct;28(10):2105-13. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgm131.

A trend in Canada to establish legislated presumptions for compensation of firefighters created an opportunity to re-evaluate the literature applying medicolegal standards of certainty. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate causality in selected cancer categories for firefighters using the criteria applied in tort litigation and workers' compensation, which is based on the weight of evidence and which is required to take into account individual factors. METHODS: The epidemiological literature on cancer risk among firefighters was reviewed based on the weight of evidence rather than scientific certainty. Generalizable frameworks were formulated to define recurrent issues in assessing the evidence from epidemiological studies. The evidence for latency and for a threshold effect with duration of employment was also examined in order to provide practical guidelines. RESULTS: Presumption is justified for the following cancers: bladder, kidney, testicular and brain, and lung cancer among non-smokers. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukaemia and myeloma (each as a class) not only present particular problems in assessment but also merit an assumption of presumption. Four analytical frameworks describe the problems in analysis encountered. DISCUSSION: The preponderance of evidence supports the presumption of causation for certain cancer, mostly rare. These frameworks are applicable to other problems of adjudication that rest on interpretation of epidemiological data. The named cancers, taking into account the special assessment issues described by each framework, are supported by sufficient evidence to conclude that a presumption is warranted but not necessarily sufficient evidence to accept as proof by a scientific standard.","['Guidotti, Tee L']",['Guidotti TL'],"['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health and Health Services, The George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20052, USA. eohtlg@gwumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Med (Lond),"Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)",9205857,,IM,"['Canada', 'Causality', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Fires/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/classification/*etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', ""Workers' Compensation""]",2007/06/06 09:00,2008/07/31 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Occup Med (Lond). 2007 Oct;57(7):466-71. doi: 10.1093/occmed/kqm031.

Among children enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study, we examined the susceptibility conferred by MDR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and predicted haplotypes and whether they modify the association between indoor insecticide exposure and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Buccal cell DNA from ALL cases (n = 294) and controls (n = 369) individually matched on gender, date of birth, Hispanic status, and maternal race were whole genome amplified and genotyped for four MDR1 SNPs, T-129C (rs3213619), C1236T (rs1128503), G2677T/A (rs2032582), and C3435T (rs1045642). Detailed and time-specific information on household pesticide use was obtained using in-home interviews with the mother. RESULTS: Allele frequencies in non-Hispanic White and Hispanic controls were similar, and with the exception of T-129C, seemed to be in strong linkage disequilibrium. Overall, the SNPs considered individually or within haplotypes (C1236T-G2677T/A-C3435T) were not significantly associated with childhood ALL. However, we observed strong evidence of a differential effect of indoor insecticide exposure (interaction odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.64; P = 0.025) on risk of ALL between carriers and noncarriers of haplotype CGC. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that children carrying the haplotype CGC may be less susceptible to the leukemogenic effects of indoor insecticide exposures. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings.","['Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Wiencke, John K', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Chokkalingam, Anand P', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Wiemels, Joseph L']","['Urayama KY', 'Wiencke JK', 'Buffler PA', 'Chokkalingam AP', 'Metayer C', 'Wiemels JL']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0560, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Insecticides)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Air Pollution, Indoor/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genes, MDR', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insecticides/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",2007/06/06 09:00,2007/10/04 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2007 Jun;16(6):1172-7. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-0007.,,,"['P42 ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['16/6/1172 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-0007 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain studies, however, point to EPO-regulated proliferation. To investigate this problem in a primary system, Kit(pos)CD71(high) erythroblasts were prepared from murine bone marrow, and were first used in the array-based discovery of EPO-modulated cell-cycle regulators. Five cell-cycle progression factors were rapidly up-modulated: nuclear protein 1 (Nupr1), G1 to S phase transition 1 (Gspt1), early growth response 1 (Egr1), Ngfi-A binding protein 2 (Nab2), and cyclin D2. In contrast, inhibitory cyclin G2, p27/Cdkn1b, and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 (Bcl6) were sharply down-modulated. For CYCLIN G2, ectopic expression also proved to selectively attenuate EPO-dependent UT7epo cell-cycle progression at S-phase. As analyzed in primary erythroblasts expressing minimal EPO receptor alleles, EPO repression of cyclin G2 and Bcl6, and induction of cyclin D2, were determined to depend on PY343 (and Stat5) signals. Furthermore, erythroblasts expressing a on PY-null EPOR-HM allele were abnormally distributed in G0/G1. During differentiation divisions, EPOR-HM Ter119(pos) erythroblasts conversely accumulated in S-phase and faltered in an apparent EPO-directed transition to G0/G1. EPO/EPOR signals therefore control the expression of select cell-cycle regulatory genes that are proposed to modulate stage-specific decisions for erythroblast cell-cycle progression.","['Fang, Jing', 'Menon, Madhu', 'Kapelle, William', 'Bogacheva, Olga', 'Bogachev, Oleg', 'Houde, Estelle', 'Browne, Sarah', 'Sathyanarayana, Pradeep', 'Wojchowski, Don M']","['Fang J', 'Menon M', 'Kapelle W', 'Bogacheva O', 'Bogachev O', 'Houde E', 'Browne S', 'Sathyanarayana P', 'Wojchowski DM']","['Program in Stem and Progenitor Cell Biology, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, ME 04074, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroblasts/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/metabolism']",2007/06/06 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Oct 1;110(7):2361-70. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-12-063503.

Recently, we demonstrated that sorafenib diminishes Mcl-1 protein expression by inhibiting translation through a MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling-independent mechanism and that this phenomenon plays a key functional role in sorafenib-mediated lethality. Here, we report that inducible expression of constitutively active MEK1 fails to protect cells from sorafenib-mediated lethality, indicating that sorafenib-induced cell death is unrelated to MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway inactivation. Notably, treatment with sorafenib induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in human leukemia cells (U937) manifested by immediate cytosolic-calcium mobilization, GADD153 and GADD34 protein induction, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) phosphorylation, XBP1 splicing, and a general reduction in protein synthesis as assessed by [35S]methionine incorporation. These events were accompanied by pronounced generation of reactive oxygen species through a mechanism dependent upon cytosolic-calcium mobilization and a significant decline in GRP78/Bip protein levels. Interestingly, enforced expression of IRE1alpha markedly reduced sorafenib-mediated apoptosis, whereas knockdown of IRE1alpha or XBP1, disruption of PERK activity, or inhibition of eIF2alpha phosphorylation enhanced sorafenib-mediated lethality. Finally, downregulation of caspase-2 or caspase-4 by small interfering RNA significantly diminished apoptosis induced by sorafenib. Together, these findings demonstrate that ER stress represents a central component of a MEK1/2-ERK1/2-independent cell death program triggered by sorafenib.","['Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Davis, Eric Maynard', 'Crabtree, Timothy Ryan', 'Habibi, Joseph Reza', 'Nguyen, Tri K', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rahmani M', 'Davis EM', 'Crabtree TR', 'Habibi JR', 'Nguyen TK', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, MCV Station Box 230, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (XBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Xbp1 protein, mouse)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PERK kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases, Initiator)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Caspase 2/metabolism', 'Caspases, Initiator/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Splicing/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', 'Sorafenib', 'Transcription Factors', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1', 'eIF-2 Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2007/06/06 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2007/06/06 09:00'],"['2007/06/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Aug;27(15):5499-513. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01080-06.

The intrinsic cell localisation properties of either viral component or their capacity to mutually interact determines the assembly of infectious particles. Here, we address how Env determinants and cellular sorting proteins allow the Env derived from gamma retroviruses, murine leukemia virus (MLV) and RD114, to travel to or from late endosomes (LE), which may represent the Env assembly site of retroviruses in some cells. The individual expression of MLV Env resulted in its accumulation in LE in contrast to RD114 Env that required the presence of gamma retroviral Gag proteins. To discriminate between intrinsic intracellular Env localisation and gamma retroviral Gag/Env interactions in influencing Env viral incorporation, we studied Env assembly on heterologous lentiviral particles on which they are passively recruited. We found that an acidic cluster present at the C-terminus of the RD114 Env cytoplasmic tail determines its sub-cellular localisation and retrograde transport. Mutation of this motif induced late endosomal concentration of the RD114 Env, correlating with increased viral incorporation and infectivity. Reciprocally, the reinforcement of a poorly functional acidic motif in the MLV Env resulted in a marked decrease of its late endosomal localisation, leading to weakly infectious lentiviral particles with low Env densities.

Using flame-spray synthesis technology we have produced non-coated aluminum-, calcium-, cerium-, and zirconium-derived inorganic metal oxide nanoparticles which not only exhibit high affinity for nucleic acids, but can sequester such compounds from aqueous solution. This non-covalent DNA-binding capacity was successfully used to transiently transfect a variety of mammalian cells including human, reaching transfection efficiencies which compared favorably with classic calcium phosphate precipitation (CaP) procedures and lipofection. In this straightforward protocol, transfection was enabled by simply mixing nanoparticles with DNA in solution prior to addition to the target cell population. Transiently transfected cells showed higher production levels of the human secreted glycoprotein SEAP compared to isogenic populations transfected with established technologies. Inorganic metal oxide nanoparticles also showed a high binding capacity to human-pathogenic viruses including adenovirus, adeno-associated virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and were able to clear these pathogens from aqueous solutions. The DNA transfection and viral clearance capacities of inorganic metal oxide nanoparticles may provide cost-effective biopharmaceutical manufacturing and water treatment in developing countries.","['Link, Nils', 'Brunner, Tobias J', 'Dreesen, Imke A J', 'Stark, Wendelin J', 'Fussenegger, Martin']","['Link N', 'Brunner TJ', 'Dreesen IA', 'Stark WJ', 'Fussenegger M']","['Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering, ETH Zurich, HCI F115, Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 10, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Calcium Phosphates)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Metals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)', '30K4522N6T (Cerium)', '619G5K328Y (ceric oxide)', 'C6V6S92N3C (Zirconium)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'K4C08XP666 (tricalcium phosphate)', 'LMI26O6933 (Aluminum Oxide)', 'M4I0D6VV5M (Calcium Chloride)', 'S38N85C5G0 (zirconium oxide)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/genetics/metabolism', 'Aluminum Oxide/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Calcium Chloride/chemistry', 'Calcium Phosphates/chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cerium/chemistry', 'Dependovirus/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/*chemistry/genetics', 'HIV/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Metals/chemistry', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Oxides/chemistry', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Viruses/*chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Zirconium/chemistry']",2007/06/05 09:00,2008/01/25 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2007 Dec 1;98(5):1083-93. doi: 10.1002/bit.21525.,,,,['10.1002/bit.21525 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By performing classical transformation assays, we find that NPMc+, but not wild-type NPM, cooperates specifically with adenovirus E1A to transform primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts in soft agar. We demonstrate that NPMc+ blocks the p19(Arf) (Arf) induction elicited by E1A. Surprisingly, however, we find that NPMc+ induces cellular senescence and that E1A is able to overcome this response. We propose a model whereby the NPMc+ pro-senescence activity needs to be evaded for oncogenic transformation, even though NPMc+ can concomitantly blunt the Arf/p53 pathway.

An effective drug against CML is imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor acting on Abl kinases, c-KIT, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Recently, a study revealed that patients treated with imatinib showed impaired CTL responses compared with patients treated with IFN-alpha, which might be due to a treatment-induced reduction in immunogenicity of CML cells or immunosuppressive effects. In our study, we found that inhibition of BCR-ABL leads to a down-regulation of immunogenic antigens on the CML cells in response to imatinib treatment, which results in the inhibition of CML-directed immune responses. By treating CML cells with imatinib, we could show that the resulting inhibition of BCR-ABL leads to a decreased expression of tumor antigens, including survivin, adipophilin, hTERT, WT-1, Bcl-x(L), and Bcl-2 in correlation to a decreased development of CML-specific CTLs. In contrast, this reduction in immunogenicity was not observed when a CML cell line resistant to the inhibitory effects of imatinib was used, but could be confirmed by transfection with specific small interfering RNA against BCR-ABL or imatinib treatment of primary CML cells.","['Brauer, Katharina M', 'Werth, Daniela', 'von Schwarzenberg, Karin', 'Bringmann, Anita', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Grunebach, Frank', 'Brossart, Peter']","['Brauer KM', 'Werth D', 'von Schwarzenberg K', 'Bringmann A', 'Kanz L', 'Grunebach F', 'Brossart P']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Immunology, Rheumatology, and Pulmonology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology']",2007/06/05 09:00,2007/07/27 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jun 1;67(11):5489-97. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0302.,,,,"['67/11/5489 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0302 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bortezomib, a specific proteasome inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma cell survival is highly dependent on Mcl-1 antiapoptotic molecules. In a recent study, proteasome inhibitors induced Mcl-1 accumulation that slowed down their proapoptotic effects. Consequently, we investigated the role of Bcl-2 family members in bortezomib-induced apoptosis. We found that bortezomib induced apoptosis in five of seven human myeloma cell lines (HMCL). Bortezomib-induced apoptosis was associated with Mcl-1 cleavage regardless of Mcl-1L accumulation. Furthermore, RNA interference mediated Mcl-1 decrease and sensitized RPMI-8226 HMCL to bortezomib, highlighting the contribution of Mcl-1 in bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, an important induction of Noxa was found in all sensitive HMCL both at protein and mRNA level. Concomitant to Mcl-1 cleavage and Noxa induction, we also found caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activation. Under bortezomib treatment, Mcl-1L/Noxa complexes were highly increased, Mcl-1/Bak complexes were disrupted, and there was an accumulation of free Noxa. Finally, we observed a dissociation of Mcl-1/Bim complexes that may be due to a displacement of Bim induced by Noxa. Thus, in myeloma cells, the mechanistic basis for bortezomib sensitivity can be explained mainly by the model in which the sensitizer Noxa can displace Bim, a BH3-only activator, from Mcl-1, thus leading to Bax/Bak activation.","['Gomez-Bougie, Patricia', 'Wuilleme-Toumi, Soraya', 'Menoret, Emmanuelle', 'Trichet, Valerie', 'Robillard, Nelly', 'Philippe, Moreau', 'Bataille, Regis', 'Amiot, Martine']","['Gomez-Bougie P', 'Wuilleme-Toumi S', 'Menoret E', 'Trichet V', 'Robillard N', 'Philippe M', 'Bataille R', 'Amiot M']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, UMR601, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism']",2007/06/05 09:00,2007/07/27 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jun 1;67(11):5418-24. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4322.,,,,"['67/11/5418 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4322 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we tested whether PPI treatment in unbuffered culture conditions could affect survival and proliferation of human B-cell tumors. First, we showed that PPI treatment increased the sensitivity to vinblastine of a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line. PPI, per se, induced a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation of tumor B cells, which was associated with a dose- and time-dependent apoptotic-like cytotoxicity in B-cell lines and leukemic cells from patients with pre-B ALL. The effect of PPI was mediated by a very early production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), that preceded alkalinization of lysosomal pH, lysosomal membrane permeabilization, and cytosol acidification, suggesting an early destabilization of the acidic vesicular compartment. Lysosomal alterations were followed by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, release of cytochrome c, chromatin condensation, and caspase activation. However, inhibition of caspase activity did not affect PPI-induced cell death, whereas specific inhibition of ROS by an antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine) significantly delayed cell death and protected both lysosomal and mitochondrial membranes. The proapoptotic activity of PPI was consistent with a clear inhibition of tumor growth following PPI treatment of B-cell lymphoma in severe combined immunodeficient mice. This study further supports the importance of acidity and pH gradients in tumor cell homeostasis and suggests new therapeutic approaches for human B-cell tumors based on PPI.","['De Milito, Angelo', 'Iessi, Elisabetta', 'Logozzi, Mariantonia', 'Lozupone, Francesco', 'Spada, Massimo', 'Marino, Maria Lucia', 'Federici, Cristina', 'Perdicchio, Maurizio', 'Matarrese, Paola', 'Lugini, Luana', 'Nilsson, Anna', 'Fais, Stefano']","['De Milito A', 'Iessi E', 'Logozzi M', 'Lozupone F', 'Spada M', 'Marino ML', 'Federici C', 'Perdicchio M', 'Matarrese P', 'Lugini L', 'Nilsson A', 'Fais S']","['Department of Drug Research and Evaluation, Pharmacogenetic, Drug Resistance, and Experimental Therapeutic Section, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.

Down-regulation of PU.1 by disruption of its 14-kb 5' upstream regulatory element induced acute myeloid leukemia, T-cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like disease in murine models. In the present study, we found that PU.1 was down-regulated in the majority of human myeloma cell lines and a subset of freshly isolated myeloma cells, in contrast to relatively high expression of PU.1 in normal plasma cells. Patients in this low PU.1 expression subset may have a poor prognosis. In human myeloma cell lines, the 17-kb 5' upstream enhancer and the promoter region of the PU.1 gene were highly methylated, and this is consistent with disappearance of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in these regions. To elucidate the significance of down-regulation of PU.1, we generated stable myeloma cell lines with an inducible PU.1 expression system. Exogenous expression of PU.1 in PU.1 null myeloma cell lines, U266 and KMS12PE, induced complete growth arrest and cell death. Up-regulation of PU.1 by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine also induced growth arrest of KMS12PE and KHM11 myeloma cells. These data suggest that down-regulation of PU.1 is an essential step for the survival of a subset of myeloma cells and that up-regulation of PU.1 by demethylation agents or other types of agents may represent a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of multiple myeloma patients.","['Tatetsu, Hiro', 'Ueno, Shikiko', 'Hata, Hiroyuki', 'Yamada, Yasuhiro', 'Takeya, Motohiro', 'Mitsuya, Hiroaki', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Okuno, Yutaka']","['Tatetsu H', 'Ueno S', 'Hata H', 'Yamada Y', 'Takeya M', 'Mitsuya H', 'Tenen DG', 'Okuno Y']","['Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2007/06/05 09:00,2007/07/27 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jun 1;67(11):5328-36. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4265.,,,,"['67/11/5328 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4265 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, different vaccination strategies have been suggested, mainly based on the exploitment of the junctional peptides spanning the fusion region of the Bcr/Abl proteins. To identify new potential immunologic targets, 63 Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients and 6 BCR/ABL-positive cell lines were tested in nested reverse transcriptase PCR to detect the presence of BCR/ABL transcripts arising from the alternative splicing of the main BCR/ABL transcripts. We could detect BCR/ABL transcripts with junctions between BCR exon 1, 13, or 14 and ABL exon 4 in approximately 80% of patients and 84% of cell lines, beside the main fusion transcripts. Translation products of these transcripts were characterized at their COOH terminus by a large amino acid portion derived from the out of frame (OOF) reading of ABL gene. These proteins were detected in BCR/ABL-positive cell lines by immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry. Finally, we determined whether OOF-specific CD8+ T cells could be found in the peripheral blood of CML patients and whether they could acquire effector function following in vitro sensitization with OOF-derived peptides predicted to bind to human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 and HLA-A3 molecules. We detected the presence of OOF-specific CD8+ T cells in four of four patients studied, and in one case, these T cells exhibited specific cytotoxic activity against both peptide-pulsed targets and autologous primary CML cells.","['Volpe, Gisella', 'Cignetti, Alessandro', 'Panuzzo, Cristina', 'Kuka, Mirela', 'Vitaggio, Katiuscia', 'Brancaccio, Mara', 'Perrone, Giuseppe', 'Rinaldi, Monica', 'Prato, Giuseppina', 'Fava, Milena', 'Geuna, Massimo', 'Pautasso, Marisa', 'Casnici, Claudia', 'Signori, Emanuela', 'Tonon, Giancarlo', 'Tarone, Guido', 'Marelli, Ornella', 'Fazio, Vito M', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Volpe G', 'Cignetti A', 'Panuzzo C', 'Kuka M', 'Vitaggio K', 'Brancaccio M', 'Perrone G', 'Rinaldi M', 'Prato G', 'Fava M', 'Geuna M', 'Pautasso M', 'Casnici C', 'Signori E', 'Tonon G', 'Tarone G', 'Marelli O', 'Fazio VM', 'Saglio G']","['Department of Clinical, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. gisella.volpe@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Exons', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2007/06/05 09:00,2007/07/27 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jun 1;67(11):5300-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3737.,,,,"['67/11/5300 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3737 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that expression of the NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) fusion gene in transgenic mice results in an invariably fatal MDS; approximately one third of mice die due to complications of severe pancytopenia, and about two thirds progress to a fatal acute leukemia. In the present study, we used retroviral insertional mutagenesis to identify genes that might collaborate with NHD13 as the MDS transformed to an acute leukemia. Newborn NHD13 transgenic mice and littermate controls were infected with the MOL4070LTR retrovirus. The onset of leukemia was accelerated, suggesting a synergistic effect between the NHD13 transgene and the genes neighboring retroviral insertion events. We identified numerous common insertion sites located near protein-coding genes and confirmed dysregulation of a subset of these by expression analyses. Among these genes were Meis1, a known collaborator of HOX and NUP98-HOX fusion genes, and Mn1, a transcriptional coactivator involved in human leukemia through fusion with the TEL gene. Other putative collaborators included Gata2, Erg, and Epor. Of note, we identified a common insertion site that was >100 kb from the nearest coding gene, but within 20 kb of the miR29a/miR29b1 microRNA locus. Both of these miRNA were up-regulated, demonstrating that retroviral insertional mutagenesis can target miRNA loci as well as protein-coding loci.

Neonatal infection of these mice with Moloney murine leukemia virus resulted in accelerated tumor onset with associated increases in clonal complexity and lymphoid dissemination. Large-scale analysis of retroviral integration sites in these tumors revealed a profound bias towards a narrow range of target genes, including Jdp2 (Jundm2), D cyclin, and Pim family genes. Remarkably, direct PCR analysis of integration hotspots revealed that every progressing tumor consisted of multiple clones harboring hits at these loci, giving access to large numbers of independent insertion events and uncovering the contrasting mutagenic mechanisms operating at each target gene. Direct PCR analysis showed that high-frequency targeting occurs only in the tumor environment in vivo and is specific for the progression gene set. These results indicate that early lymphomas in MYC/Runx2 mice remain dependent on exogenous growth signals, and that progression can be achieved by constitutive activation of pathways converging on a cell cycle checkpoint that acts as the major rate-limiting step for lymphoma outgrowth.","['Stewart, Monica', 'Mackay, Nancy', 'Hanlon, Linda', 'Blyth, Karen', 'Scobie, Linda', 'Cameron, Ewan', 'Neil, James C']","['Stewart M', 'Mackay N', 'Hanlon L', 'Blyth K', 'Scobie L', 'Cameron E', 'Neil JC']","['Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Institute of Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow Veterinary School, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom. m.stewart@vet.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Jundp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Runx2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Targeting', '*Genes, myc', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2007/06/05 09:00,2007/07/27 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Jun 1;67(11):5126-33. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0433.,,,['A5605/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['67/11/5126 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0433 [doi]']",,,,,PMC2562448,['UKMS2482'],,,,,,,['NLM: UKMS2482'],

However, its expression is practically absent in T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas. Interestingly, there exist significant differences in the level of expression between two mice strains exhibiting extremely distinct susceptibilities that can be attributed to promoter functional polymorphisms. In addition, several functional nucleotide changes in the coding sequences of both Fas and FasL genes significantly affect their biological activity.

RESULTS: The generated CTL lines elicited an antigen-specific and HLA-restricted cytolytic activity against tumor cells endogenously expressing the RGS5 protein.

We hypothesized that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of docetaxel, an i.v. administered cytotoxic and substrate for CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1, would differ between African-American and Caucasian patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and the pharmacogenetics of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 in African-American and Caucasian cancer patients who received docetaxel 75 or 100 mg/m(2) as a 1-h i.v. infusion. Plasma docetaxel concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Clinical toxicity and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were monitored on days 8, 15, and 22 postadministration of docetaxel. Using a limited sampling strategy and nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, each patient's docetaxel clearance was estimated. Genotyping for known polymorphisms in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 was done. RESULTS: We enrolled 109 patients: 40 African-Americans (26 males; 14 females), with a median age of 61 years (range, 29-73), and 69 Caucasians (43 males; 26 females), with a median age of 63 years (range, 38-81).

Subsequently, we observed the methylation of PTPRO in primary human lung tumors and also showed its potential tumor suppressor characteristics. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether the truncated form of PTPRO (PTPROt), specifically expressed in naive B lymphocytes, was also methylated and suppressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease generally affecting B lymphocytes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS: Initial screening showed that 60% of the 52 CLL samples analyzed using methylation-specific PCR assay were methylated compared with B lymphocytes from normal individuals, which were not methylated. The expression of PTPROt, as measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR, inversely correlated with methylation in the few samples tested. Analysis of additional samples (n = 50) by combined bisulfite restriction analysis showed that the PTPRO CpG island was methylated in 82% of patients with CLL compared with B lymphocytes from normal individuals. Furthermore, overall expression of PTPRO was reduced in CLL relative to normal lymphocytes. The PTPRO gene was also suppressed by methylation in the CLL cell line WaC3CD5, where it could be reactivated upon treatment with the DNA hypomethylating agent 5-AzaC. Ectopic expression of PTPROt in a nonexpressing cell line increased growth inhibition with fludarabine treatment, a therapy commonly used for CLL. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the potential role of PTPRO methylation and silencing in CLL tumorigenesis and also provides a novel molecular target in the epigenetic therapy.","['Motiwala, Tasneem', 'Majumder, Sarmila', 'Kutay, Huban', 'Smith, David Spencer', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Lucas, David M', 'Byrd, John C', 'Grever, Michael', 'Jacob, Samson T']","['Motiwala T', 'Majumder S', 'Kutay H', 'Smith DS', 'Neuberg DS', 'Lucas DM', 'Byrd JC', 'Grever M', 'Jacob ST']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Sulfites)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRO protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'TZX5469Z6I (sodium bisulfite)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfites/pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2007/06/05 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Jun 1;13(11):3174-81. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1720.,,,"['R01 CA086978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086978-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 86978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA110496/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA110496/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['13/11/3174 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1720 [doi]']",,,,,PMC3074612,['NIHMS264699'],,,,,,,,

Although Tribbles are highly conserved throughout evolution, the physiological functions of mammalian Tribbles family remain largely unclear. Here we report that human TRB2 is a pro-apoptotic molecule that induces apoptosis of cells mainly of the hematopoietic origin. TRB2 mRNA is selectively induced by removal of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-2 from human erythroleukemia-derived TF-1 cell line or activated primary CD4(+) T cells, respectively. It is, however, not induced by many other treatments that trigger apoptosis of these two cell types. Overexpression of TRB2 activates many apoptotic events observed in GM-CSF-deprived TF-1 cells, including loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, Mcl-1 cleavage/degradation, and activation of Bax and a number of caspases. Specific knockdown of TRB2 significantly suppresses GM-CSF deprivation-induced apoptosis and all apoptotic events mentioned above. Finally, we demonstrate that TRB2-induced cleavage and degradation of Mcl-1 are mediated via a caspase-dependent but proteasome-independent mechanism, and overexpression of Mcl-1 or its upstream activator Akt can markedly overcome the apoptogenic effect of TRB2. Altogether, these results suggest that the TRB2-Mcl-1 axis plays an important role in survival factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis of TF-1 cells.","['Lin, Kou-Ray', 'Lee, Shern-Fwu', 'Hung, Chien-Min', 'Li, Chung-Leung', 'Yang-Yen, Hsin-Fang', 'Yen, Jeffrey J Y']","['Lin KR', 'Lee SF', 'Hung CM', 'Li CL', 'Yang-Yen HF', 'Yen JJ']","['Graduate Institute of Life Science, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (tribbles 2 protein, mouse)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (TRIB2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/deficiency', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/deficiency', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",2007/06/05 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Jul 27;282(30):21962-72. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M701663200.

It leads to the discovery or identification of temporal patterns and coexpressed genes. GEP analysis involves highly dimensional multivariate data which demand appropriate tools. A good alternative for grouping many multidimensional objects is self-organizing maps (SOM), an unsupervised neural network algorithm able to find relationships among data. SOM groups and maps them topologically. However, it may be difficult to identify clusters with the usual visualization tools for SOM. We propose a simple algorithm to identify and visualize clusters in SOM (the RP-Q method). The RP is a new node-adaptive attribute that moves in a two dimensional virtual space imitating the movement of the codebooks vectors of the SOM net into the input space. The Q statistic evaluates the SOM structure providing an estimation of the number of clusters underlying the data set. The SOM-RP-Q algorithm permits the visualization of clusters in the SOM and their node patterns. The algorithm was evaluated in several simulated and real GEP data sets. Results show that the proposed algorithm successfully displays the underlying cluster structure directly from the SOM and is robust to different net sizes.","['Fernandez, Elmer A', 'Balzarini, Monica']","['Fernandez EA', 'Balzarini M']","['Faculty of Engineering, Catholic University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Camino Alta Gracia Km 10, Cordoba, Argentina. elmer@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Comput Biol Med,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Animals', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Rats']",2007/06/05 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2006/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Comput Biol Med. 2007 Dec;37(12):1677-89. doi: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2007.04.003.

Some patients have an indolent leukemia, with long survival while others experience an aggressive disease, with early and frequent need of treatment. At present, no chemotherapeutic regimens can be considered curative and all patients will die with (or because of) their disease.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Time-sequential changes in p53 protein level were obtained for X-irradiated MOLT-4 cells using flow cytometry and analyzed. RESULTS: The changes in the cellular frequency distribution pattern of p53 content could be divided into two parts at a certain p53 level. The p53 vs. side-scatter in flow cytometry showed the sequential changes of p53 increase followed by an increase in cell death. On the basis of these results we determined a threshold level of p53 for the initiation of apoptosis. The level was estimated to be (1.08 +/- 0.05) x 10(5) molecules per cell, which was approximately threefold higher than the mean content of control cells. The minimum times for p53 level to reach this threshold level were independent of X-ray dose and 1.4-1.6 h. The times for the signal transduction from the p53 accumulation to disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activation, and cell death were 1.6, 2.1, and 2.8 h, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The threshold level of p53 for the initiation of apoptosis and the time sequence in the course of apoptotic events were determined in X-irradiated MOLT-4 cells.","['Nakano, Hisako', 'Yonekawa, Hiromichi', 'Shinohara, Kunio']","['Nakano H', 'Yonekawa H', 'Shinohara K']","['Department of Laboratory Animal Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan. nakano@rinshoken.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology/*radiation effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Differential Threshold/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2007/06/05 09:00,2007/08/02 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2006/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2007/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Jul 1;68(3):883-91. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.03.007.,,,,"['S0360-3016(07)00386-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.03.007 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In that respect, it was recently shown that guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) induced the differentiation of K562 cells, suggesting its possible efficiency in treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, further investigations are required to verify this possibility. Here, the effects of GTP on activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and caspases in K562 cells were examined. Exposure of K562 cells to 100muM GTP markedly inhibited growth (4-70%) and increased percent glycophorin A positive cells after 1-6 days. GTP-induced terminal erythroid differentiation of K562 cells was accompanied with activation of three key caspases, i.e., caspase-3, -6 and -9. More detailed studies revealed that mitochondrial pathway is activated along with down-regulation of Bcl-xL and releasing of cytochrome c into cytosol. Among MAPKs, ERK1/2and p38 were modulated after GTP treatment. Western blot analyses showed that sustained phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was accompanied by a decrease in ERK1/2 activation. These modulatory effects of GTP were observed at early exposure times before the onset of differentiation (3h), and followed for 24-96h. Interestingly, inhibition of p38 MAPK pathway by SB202190 impeded GTP-mediated caspases activation and differentiation in K562 cells, suggesting that p38 MAPK may act upstream of caspases in our system. These results point to a pivotal role for p38 MAPK pathway during GTP-mediated erythroid differentiation of K562 cells and will hopefully have important impact on pharmaceutical evaluation of GTP for CML treatment in differentiation therapy approaches.","['Moosavi, Mohammad Amin', 'Yazdanparast, Razieh', 'Lotfi, Abbas']","['Moosavi MA', 'Yazdanparast R', 'Lotfi A']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, P.O.

Both methods were capable of selectively detecting an acetylated peptide at the low femtomole level when spiked into a background of 500 fmol six-protein tryptic digest. The MRM approach was roughly tenfold more sensitive than precursor scanning with one acetylated peptide detected and sequenced at the level of 2 fmol on-column. The technique was subsequently applied to a gel-derived sample of cytokeratin-8 (CK8) shown to contain acetylated lysine residues by Western blot analysis.

In order to investigate the interplay between papillomaviruses and PODs, we analyzed the status of PODs in organotypic raft cultures of human keratinocytes harboring HPV genome that support the differentiation-dependent HPV life cycle. The number of PODs per nucleus was increased in the presence of HPV genomes selectively within the poorly differentiated layers but was absent in the terminally differentiated layers of the stratified epithelium. This increase in PODs was correlated with an increase in abundance of post-translationally modified PML protein. Neither the E2-dependent transcription nor viral DNA replication was reliant upon the presence of PML.

Evi12 is located near the promoter of the ER chaperone protein and Hsp90 family member Grp94. Here we show that viral insertion in Evi12 results in the expression of aberrant Grp94 transcripts in Cas-Br-MuLV as well as in AKXD induced hematopoietic tumors, demonstrating that Grp94 is a common viral target gene. While most transcripts encode for truncated forms of Grp94, transcripts containing viral gag sequences were detected in the leukemia cell line NFS107. Interestingly, these fusion transcripts encode for myristylated viral-Grp94 fusion proteins that localize to the plasma membrane. Combined with recent evidence that myristylated forms of Hsp90 transform cells, our data suggest that myristylation of target genes may be an important mechanism in retrovirally mediated oncogenesis. Since retroviral insertion in Evi12 also affects the expression of a recently identified novel gene Grp94 neighboring nucleotidase (Gnn), located at the other side of Evi12, it appears that proviral insertion can lead to deregulation of two genes present in the same locus.","['van den Akker, Eric', 'Aarts, Lambertus H J', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['van den Akker E', 'Aarts LH', 'Delwel R']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Dr. Molewaterplein 50, 3015 GE Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (glucose-regulated proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor/chemistry/virology', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2007/06/05 09:00,2007/10/31 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2007/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2007 Sep 30;366(2):227-33. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2007.04.026.

Here we show that some B-box 2 changes in TRIM5alpha, but not in TRIMCyp, resulted in decreased human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) capsid binding. The phenotypic effects of these B-box 2 changes on the restriction of retroviral infection depended on the potency of restriction and the affinity of the TRIM5alpha interaction with the viral capsid, two properties specified by the B30.2(SPRY) domain.

The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) or myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) associated with residence < or =300 m from high-voltage power lines. METHODS: Case-control study of 854 patients diagnosed with LPD or MPD (including leukaemia, lymphoma and related conditions) aged 0-94 years comprising all cases diagnosed in Tasmania between 1972 and 1980. Controls were individually matched for sex and approximate age at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared with those who had always lived >300 m from a power line, those who had ever lived within 50 m had an odds ratio (OR) of 2.06 (95% confidence interval 0.87-4.91) for developing LPD or MPD (based on 768 adult case-control pairs); those who had lived between 50 and 300 m had an OR of 1.30 (0.88-1.91). Adults who had lived within 300 m of a power line during the first 15 years of life had a threefold increase in risk (OR 3.23; 1.26-8.29); those who had lived within the same distance aged 0-5 years had a fivefold increase in risk (OR 4.74; 0.98-22.9). These associations were strengthened when analyses were repeated for 201 pairs with entirely Tasmanian residential histories. CONCLUSION: Although recognizing that this study has limitations, the results raise the possibility that prolonged residence close to high-voltage power lines, especially early in life, may increase the risk of the development of MPD and LPD later.","['Lowenthal, R M', 'Tuck, D M', 'Bray, I C']","['Lowenthal RM', 'Tuck DM', 'Bray IC']","['School of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electric Power Supplies/*adverse effects', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Tasmania/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",2007/06/05 09:00,2007/09/22 09:00,['2007/06/05 09:00'],"['2007/06/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Intern Med J. 2007 Sep;37(9):614-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2007.01389.x.

Consequently, there is increasing attention in recent year about cancer stem cells. The findings from recent studies support the concept that stem cells are integral to the development of several forms of human cancer. Changes in stem cell behavior can contribute to tumor formation.

This new water soluble fluoropolymer was prepared in high yield using a simple procedure. It was characterized by FT-IR and UV-vis spectrophotometry, (19)F-NMR and SEC measurements. O(2) solubility studies on PHEA-F aqueous solutions were carried out at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C at atmospheric pressure and showed that PHEA-F conjugate, despite its low degree of derivatization in fluorine containing groups (2.60 mol-%), is capable of dissolving 13-15% more O(2) than non-fluorinated PHEA. Moreover, O(2) release in simulated physiological conditions is faster for PHEA-F than for PHEA. The biocompatibility of this conjugate has been evaluated by performing an in vitro viability assay on human chronic myelogenous leukaemia cells (K-562) chosen as a model cell line and in vitro haemolysis experiments on human RBCs.

The purpose of this study was to better characterize satraplatin's preclinical antitumor efficacy in a variety of sensitive and resistant human tumor cell lines and in a prostate cancer xenograft model and to evaluate the effect of satraplatin on PSA expression and/or secretion in a prostate cancer cell line. METHODS: Satraplatin and its primary metabolite JM-118 were preclinically tested for their cytotoxic activity in a range of cancer cells including: human prostate, those forming the NCI drug screening panel, and those resistant to anti-cancer drugs. Also, the antiproliferative efficacy of satraplatin was tested in vivo in a human prostate cancer model. The effect of satraplatin and JM-118 on PSA transcription was measured by quantitative real time PCR. RESULTS: Satraplatin and JM-118 inhibited in vitro and in vivo the growth of prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The IC50 cytotoxicity values for satraplatin ranged from 1 to 3 microM for androgen-insensitive cells and was 11 microM for the androgen-sensitive cell line. Interestingly, JM-118 was up to 16-fold more potent than satraplatin. Oral administration of satraplatin to nude mouse PC-3 xenograft models inhibited the growth of these human tumors. Satraplatin had no direct effect on PSA transcription and the observed decrease in secreted PSA correlated with a decrease in cell number. When evaluated in the NCI drug-screening panel, satraplatin was most active in leukemia and small cell lung cancer cell lines. Both satraplatin and JM-118 were tested on cells resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. Satraplatin and JM-118 were equally active in the cisplatin-resistant A129cp80 ovarian carcinoma cell line, with activity comparable to that observed in the parent line. Neither expression of MDR1, BCRP, MRP1, nor altered tubulin or topoisomerase I were found to mediate resistance to satraplatin or JM-118. Although these resistance mechanisms contribute to drug resistance for a number of chemotherapeutics, they do not appear to play a role in satraplatin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that satraplatin and JM-118 have preclinical antitumor activity in human prostate cancer and other tumor types as well, including several cell lines displaying drug resistance to cisplatin, docetaxel and mitoxantrone. In addition, the results suggest that PSA should be further evaluated as a relevant marker of clinical response in patients with prostate cancer treated with satraplatin.","['Wosikowski, Katja', 'Lamphere, Lou', 'Unteregger, Gerhard', 'Jung, Volker', 'Kaplan, Faith', 'Xu, Jimmy P', 'Rattel, Benno', 'Caligiuri, Maureen']","['Wosikowski K', 'Lamphere L', 'Unteregger G', 'Jung V', 'Kaplan F', 'Xu JP', 'Rattel B', 'Caligiuri M']","['From GPC Biotech, Fraunhoferstrasse 20, 82152 Martinsried/Munich, Germany.

However, its cytotoxicity in erythrocytes was unclear. To examine the effect of cordycepin on the induction of eryptosis (an apoptosis-like process in enucleated erythrocytes), flow cytometric assays based on membrane integrity and asymmetry were employed. For comparison, analyses were performed in parallel with two other anti-leukemia agents, indirubin 3'-monoxime (IDM) and As2O3. We found that at the IC50 against leukemia HL-60, cordycepin elicited eryptosis while IDM and As2O3 showed no erythrotoxicity in mouse erythrocytes. Mechanistically, cordycepin increased the [Ca2+]i and activated mu-calpain protease in a dose-dependent manner. Yet, no caspase-3 activation was observed in the cordycepin-treated erythrocytes. When extracellular Ca2+ was depleted, both the cordycepin-induced eryptosis and mu-calpain cleavage were suppressed.

Evidence for cancer-initiating cells originally arose from studies in hematology and leukemia. Lessons learned from hematopoietic stem cells laid the bedrock for understanding how leukemic cells self-renew and remain in immature states. Decades later, leukemia-initiating cell techniques are now being applied to the field of solid tumors such as brain, breast, bone, colon, pancreas, lung and prostate cancer, with several cancer-initiating cell efforts led by hematologists. Different isolation techniques enriching for primitive cancer-initiating cells have been developed and are described in this review. Although the concept of cancer-initiating cells arose from studies in normal tissue stem cells, differences exist between neoplastic-initiating clones and their normal counterparts. Several efforts have uncovered aberrant molecular pathways and niche interactions unique to cancer-initiating cells. Efforts to exploit these pathways and interactions could ultimately lead to complete eradication of cancers.","['Buzzeo, M P', 'Scott, E W', 'Cogle, C R']","['Buzzeo MP', 'Scott EW', 'Cogle CR']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610-0277, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells']",2007/06/02 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/06/02 09:00'],"['2007/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Aug;21(8):1619-27. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404768.

Recently, we suggested that the induction of differentiation of EoL-1 cells into eosinophils by the HDAC inhibitors apicidin and n-butyrate is due to the continuous inhibition of HDACs. However, neither apicidin nor n-butyrate inhibited the expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA mRNA, although both these inhibitors suppressed cell proliferation. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed whether the levels of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha protein and phosphorylated-Stat5 involved in the signaling for the proliferation of EoL-1 cells are attenuated by HDAC inhibitors. METHODS: EoL-1 cells were incubated in the presence of apicidin, TSA or n-butyrate. FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and phosphorylated-Stat5 were detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: Treatment of EoL-1 cells with apicidin at 100 nM or n-butyrate at 500 microM decreased the levels of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha protein and phosphorylated-Stat5, while that with trichostatin A at 30 nM did not. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in the level of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha protein caused by apicidin and n-butyrate might be one of the mechanisms by which EoL-1 cells are induced to differentiate into eosinophils by these HDAC inhibitors.","['Kaneko, Motoko', 'Ishihara, Kenji', 'Takahashi, Aki', 'Hong, Jangja', 'Hirasawa, Noriyasu', 'Zee, Okpyo', 'Ohuchi, Kazuo']","['Kaneko M', 'Ishihara K', 'Takahashi A', 'Hong J', 'Hirasawa N', 'Zee O', 'Ohuchi K']","['Laboratory of Pathophysiological Biochemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (apicidin)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/cytology/drug effects', 'Eosinophils/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology']",2007/08/09 09:00,2007/09/19 09:00,['2007/08/09 09:00'],"['2007/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2007;143 Suppl 1:28-32. doi: 10.1159/000101401.

However, the mechanisms underlying regulation and repression of SHP-1 remain unclear. Herein, we cloned the putative full-length, hematopoietic cell-specific SHP-1 P2 promoter and identified the ""core"" promoter regions. HTLV-1 Tax profoundly represses P2 promoter activity and histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1) potentiates such inhibition. NF-kappaB was implicated as both a rate-limiting factor for basal P2 promoter activity and important for Tax-induced promoter silencing (TIPS). Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that NF-kappaB dissociates from the SHP-1 P2 promoter following the binding of Tax and HDAC1. This is in agreement with coimmunoprecipitation studies where NF-kappaB competed with HDAC1 for association with Tax protein. We propose that in TIPS, Tax recruits HDAC1 to the SHP-1 P2 promoter and forms an inhibitory complex that results in deacetylation and dissociation of NF-kappaB from the promoter and attenuation of SHP-1 expression. TIPS provides a possible first step toward HTLV-1 leukemogenesis through its down-modulation of this key immediate early negative regulator of IL-2 signaling.","['Cheng, Jihua', 'Kydd, Andre R', 'Nakase, Koichi', 'Noonan, Kristin M', 'Murakami, Akikazu', 'Tao, Hong', 'Dwyer, Markryan', 'Xu, Chen', 'Zhu, Quan', 'Marasco, Wayne A']","['Cheng J', 'Kydd AR', 'Nakase K', 'Noonan KM', 'Murakami A', 'Tao H', 'Dwyer M', 'Xu C', 'Zhu Q', 'Marasco WA']","['Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/06/02 09:00,2007/10/31 09:00,['2007/06/02 09:00'],"['2007/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Sep 15;110(6):2110-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-11-058388.

A feature (gene) selection step, however, must be added to penalized logistic modeling due to a large number of genes and a small number of subjects. Model selection for this two-step approach requires new statistical tools because prediction error estimation ignoring the feature selection step can be severely downward biased. Generic methods such as cross-validation and non-parametric bootstrap can be very ineffective due to the big variability in the prediction error estimate. RESULTS: We propose a parametric bootstrap model for more accurate estimation of the prediction error that is tailored to the microarray data by borrowing from the extensive research in identifying differentially expressed genes, especially the local false discovery rate. The proposed method provides guidance on the two critical issues in model selection: the number of genes to include in the model and the optimal shrinkage for the penalized logistic regression. We show that selecting more than 20 genes usually helps little in further reducing the prediction error. Application to Golub's leukemia data and our own cervical cancer data leads to highly accurate prediction models.

We show that loss or reduced expression of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) underlies cases of heritable predisposition to CLL and the majority of sporadic CLL. Epigenetic silencing of DAPK1 by promoter methylation occurs in almost all sporadic CLL cases. Furthermore, we defined a disease haplotype, which segregates with the CLL phenotype in a large family. DAPK1 expression of the CLL allele is downregulated by 75% in germline cells due to increased HOXB7 binding. In the blood cells from affected family members, promoter methylation results in additional loss of DAPK1 expression. Thus, reduced expression of DAPK1 can result from germline predisposition, as well as epigenetic or somatic events causing or contributing to the CLL phenotype.","['Raval, Aparna', 'Tanner, Stephan M', 'Byrd, John C', 'Angerman, Elizabeth B', 'Perko, James D', 'Chen, Shih-Shih', 'Hackanson, Bjorn', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Lucas, David M', 'Matkovic, Jennifer J', 'Lin, Thomas S', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Murray, Fiona', 'Weisenburger, Dennis', 'Sanger, Warren', 'Lynch, Jane', 'Watson, Patrice', 'Jansen, Mary', 'Yoshinaga, Yuko', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'de Jong, Pieter J', 'Coggill, Penny', 'Beck, Stephan', 'Lynch, Henry', 'de la Chapelle, Albert', 'Plass, Christoph']","['Raval A', 'Tanner SM', 'Byrd JC', 'Angerman EB', 'Perko JD', 'Chen SS', 'Hackanson B', 'Grever MR', 'Lucas DM', 'Matkovic JJ', 'Lin TS', 'Kipps TJ', 'Murray F', 'Weisenburger D', 'Sanger W', 'Lynch J', 'Watson P', 'Jansen M', 'Yoshinaga Y', 'Rosenquist R', 'de Jong PJ', 'Coggill P', 'Beck S', 'Lynch H', 'de la Chapelle A', 'Plass C']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, Human Cancer Genetics Program, The Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43214, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (HOXB7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Dapk1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Allelic Imbalance', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases', '*Down-Regulation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pedigree', 'Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2007/06/02 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/06/02 09:00'],"['2006/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2007/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell. 2007 Jun 1;129(5):879-90. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2007.03.043.,,,"['CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA086389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U01 CA86389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA106196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA110496/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA110496/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['S0092-8674(07)00512-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2007.03.043 [doi]']",,,,,PMC4647864,,['Cell. 2007 Jun 1;129(5):853-5.

METHODS: One hundred and sixty children who were treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Hematology Unit were included in the study. They were 71 (44.4%) girls and 89 (55.6%) boys with a mean age of 6.45 +/- 3.87 years. RESULTS: Of these 160 children, 22 (13.8%) were anti-HBs-positive and 138 (86.2%) were anti-HBs-negative at the diagnosis of ALL. Among the 138 anti-HBs-negative children, 67 (41.9%) were vaccinated for HBV during maintenance chemotherapy, and 71 (44.3%) could not be vaccinated. Two (2.9%) vaccinated and 22 (30.9%) unvaccinated children developed HBV infection during the follow-up period (P < 0.001). Among 160 children treated for ALL, 24 (15.0%) had HBV, three (1.9%) had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, and 29 (18.1%) had toxic hepatitis. The majority of patients with HBV or HCV infections had high risk (HR) protocol, whereas most of the patients with toxic hepatitis had low risk (LR) protocol, especially St Jude Total XIII LR protocol. CONCLUSION: Viral hepatitis and toxic hepatitis were observed more commonly in the HR and LR group, respectively, of ALL patients. This could be explained by intensive chemotherapy and more heavy blood product administration in the HR group and the chemotherapeutic agents of methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine, basic drugs used in the LR group. In respect to protection from these complications, periodical liver function tests, serological tests for HBV and HCV, and vaccination for HBV should be performed for all children with ALL.","['Tavil, Betul', 'Cetin, Mualla', 'Tuncer, Murat', 'Gumruk, Fatma', 'Yuce, Aysel', 'Demir, Hulya', 'Aytac, Selin', 'Kuskonmaz, Baris', 'Unal, Sule', 'Yetgin, Sevgi']","['Tavil B', 'Cetin M', 'Tuncer M', 'Gumruk F', 'Yuce A', 'Demir H', 'Aytac S', 'Kuskonmaz B', 'Unal S', 'Yetgin S']","['Pediatric Hematology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Hepatol Res,Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,9711801,,,,2007/06/02 09:00,2007/06/02 09:01,['2007/06/02 09:00'],"['2007/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/02 09:01 [medline]', '2007/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hepatol Res. 2007 Jul;37(7):498-502. doi: 10.1111/j.1872-034X.2007.00079.x.,,,,"['HEP079 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1872-034X.2007.00079.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of leukaemogenesis in SDS is unknown. In accordance to the multi-hit theory of carcinogenesis, it is likely that several molecular and cellular hits occur before MDS/leukaemia become apparent. This study used oligonucleotide microarray to identify gene expression patterns, which were shown to be associated with leukaemogenesis, in marrow mononuclear cells of nine SDS patients without overt transformation compared to healthy controls. Among 154 known leukaemia-related genes, several oncogenes were found to be upregulated, including LARG, TAL1 and MLL, and of several tumour suppressor genes were downregulated, including DLEU1, RUNX1, FANCD2 and DKC1. Real time polymerase chain reaction confirmed statistically higher expression of LARG and TAL1 in SDS marrows. We conclude that SDS marrow mononuclear cells exhibit abnormal gene expression patterns, which might result in continuous stimulation favouring evolution or progression of malignant clones.

Whilst the incidence of t-AML is rising, it still only occurs in a minority of patients who have received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment and hence it is important to identify factors that may confer susceptibility to the development of the condition. This paper reviews the literature and discusses the advances and limitations in our understanding of susceptibility factors to t-AML. In particular, it concentrates upon genetic polymorphisms in detoxification genes and in genes belonging to the major DNA repair pathways. This review also considers more novel susceptibility factors, such as those proposed to determine stem cell number. Increased understanding of t-AML susceptibility may enable steps to be taken to prevent its development and increase the effectiveness of treatment of the disease.","['Seedhouse, Claire', 'Russell, Nigel']","['Seedhouse C', 'Russell N']","['Department of Academic Haematology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, UK. claire.seedhouse@nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['DNA Repair', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",2007/06/02 09:00,2007/07/24 09:00,['2007/06/02 09:00'],"['2007/06/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Jun;137(6):513-29. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06613.x.,125,,,"['BJH6613 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06613.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We further provide background on basic biology of these three areas and examples of how early life exposure to known and potential environmental toxicants induce malformations, childhood and adult-onset diseases, through aberrant chromatin modification of critical gene expressions (acute lymphocyte leukemia, heavy-metal nickel and cadmium-associated defects, and reproductive tract malformations and carcinomas induced by the synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol).","['Cho, Elizabeth', 'Li, Wan-Ju']","['Cho E', 'Li WJ']","['Cartilage Biology and Orthopaedics Branch, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. chofertikh@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",United States,Birth Defects Res C Embryo Today,"Birth defects research.

It is believed that overexpression of some of membrane or intracellular proteins confers the MDR phenotype to cancer cells. (99m)Tc-sestamibi (MIBI) is a transport substrate for the Pgp pump. We assessed the bone marrow uptake of (99m)Tc-MIBI and its correlation with messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of MDR1, multidrug-resistance associated protein-1 (MRP1) and lung resistance protein (LRP) in acute leukaemia. METHODS: A total of 26 patients (age range 17-72 years; mean age 51.88+/-2.52 years) with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia were included in the study. The expression of MDR1, MRP1 and LRP on mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR in the blast cells. The MIBI uptake in the bone marrow was evaluated using a quantitative scoring system with determination of the tumour-to-background ratios for the bone marrow areas. The correlation between the quantitative RT-PCR results and MIBI uptake was analysed by using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients with two-tailed test of significance. RESULTS: There was an inverse relationship between (99m)Tc-MIBI uptake of bone marrow and both mRNA levels of MDR1 and MRP1 (P=0.000, r= -0.733 and P=0.001, r= -0.610, respectively). No correlation was found between MIBI uptake and mRNA levels of LRP. CONCLUSION: Increased expression of MDR1 and MRP1 correlates with a low accumulation of (99m)Tc-MIBI in bone marrow areas in patients with acute leukaemia. (99m)Tc-MIBI bone marrow scintigraphy can identify the MDR1 and MRP1 phenotype, but not LRP, in patients with acute leukaemia.","['Ak, Ylknur', 'Demirel, Gulcihan', 'Gulbas, Zafer']","['Ak Y', 'Demirel G', 'Gulbas Z']","['Departments of Nuclear Medicine, Osmangazi University Medical Faculty, 26480 Eskisehir, Turkey. ilknur_ak@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucl Med Commun,Nuclear medicine communications,8201017,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Organotechnetium Compounds)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)', '9M48M2SF02 (technetium Tc 99m depreotide)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', '*Organotechnetium Compounds', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Somatostatin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*metabolism']",2007/06/01 09:00,2007/08/09 09:00,['2007/06/01 09:00'],"['2007/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucl Med Commun. 2007 Jul;28(7):541-6. doi: 10.1097/MNM.0b013e328194f1cd.,,,,"['10.1097/MNM.0b013e328194f1cd [doi]', '00006231-200707000-00005 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we have investigated how this apoptosis can be modulated by extracellular factors. Apoptosis induced by imatinib and nilotinib was determined in BCR-ABL expressing cell lines and primary CML CD34+ cells. Both molecules induced apoptosis of BCR-ABL expressing cells. This apoptosis was inhibited by protein synthesis inhibition in both K562 and CML CD34+ cells. In K562, 80% inhibition of the BCR-ABL auto-phosphorylation by either imatinib or nilotinib induced a two fold increase in Bim-EL expression and induction of apoptosis in 48 h. Bim accumulation preceded apoptosis induction which was completely abolished by depletion in Bim using shRNA. However, the anti-proliferative effect of imatinib was preserved in Bim-depleted cells. When K562 cells were cultured in a cytokine containing medium, the pro-apoptotic effect of nilotinib was decreased by 68% and this was related to a decrease in Bim-EL dephosphorylation and accumulation. Similarly, the presence of a combination of cytokines inhibited 88% of NIL- and 39% of IMA-induced apoptosis in primary CML CD34+ cells. In conclusion, both nilotinib and imatinib induce apoptosis through Bim accumulation independently of cell cycle arrest. However, the pro-apoptotic effect of both molecules can be attenuated by the presence of cytokines and growth factors, particularly concerning nilotinib. Thus BCR-ABL inhibition restores the cytokine dependence but is not sufficient to induce apoptosis when other signaling pathways are activated.","['Belloc, Francis', 'Moreau-Gaudry, Francois', 'Uhalde, Maialen', 'Cazalis, Laurie', 'Jeanneteau, Marie', 'Lacombe, Francis', 'Praloran, Vincent', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier']","['Belloc F', 'Moreau-Gaudry F', 'Uhalde M', 'Cazalis L', 'Jeanneteau M', 'Lacombe F', 'Praloran V', 'Mahon FX']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital du Haut Leveque, Pessac, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2007/06/01 09:00,2008/05/06 09:00,['2007/06/01 09:00'],"['2007/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2007 Jun;6(6):912-9. doi: 10.4161/cbt.6.6.4101.

In this study, we show that the clathrin adaptor complex AP-1 is involved in retroviral release. The absence of AP-1mu obtained by genetic knock-out or by RNA interference reduces budding of murine leukemia virus (MLV) and HIV-1, leading to a delay of viral propagation in cell culture. In contrast, overexpression of AP-1mu enhances release of HIV-1 Gag. We show that the AP-1 complex facilitates retroviral budding through a direct interaction between the matrix and AP-1mu. Less MLV Gag is found associated with late endosomes in cells lacking AP-1, and our results suggest that AP-1 and AP-3 could function on the same pathway that leads to Gag release. In addition, we find that AP-1 interacts with Tsg101 and Nedd4.1, two cellular proteins known to be involved in HIV-1 and MLV budding. We propose that AP-1 promotes Gag release by transporting it to intracellular sites of active budding, and/or by facilitating its interactions with other cellular partners.","['Camus, Gregory', 'Segura-Morales, Carolina', 'Molle, Dorothee', 'Lopez-Verges, Sandra', 'Begon-Pescia, Christina', 'Cazevieille, Chantal', 'Schu, Peter', 'Bertrand, Edouard', 'Berlioz-Torrent, Clarisse', 'Basyuk, Eugenia']","['Camus G', 'Segura-Morales C', 'Molle D', 'Lopez-Verges S', 'Begon-Pescia C', 'Cazevieille C', 'Schu P', 'Bertrand E', 'Berlioz-Torrent C', 'Basyuk E']","['Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (UMR 8104), Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex 1)', '0 (Adaptor Protein Complex 3)', '0 (Adaptor Protein Complex mu Subunits)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tsg101 protein)']",IM,"['Adaptor Protein Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Adaptor Protein Complex 3/metabolism', 'Adaptor Protein Complex mu Subunits/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Rats', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Virus Replication']",2007/06/01 09:00,2007/10/18 09:00,['2007/06/01 09:00'],"['2007/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2007 Aug;18(8):3193-203. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e06-12-1147.

We tested the potential of arsenic trioxide (ATO) to restore the response to dexamethasone in glucocorticoid (GC)-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Low-dose ATO markedly increased in vitro GC sensitivity of ALL cells from T-cell and precursor B-cell ALL patients with poor in vivo response to prednisone. In GC-resistant cell lines, this effect was mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of Akt and affecting downstream Akt targets such as Bad, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Combination of ATO and dexamethasone resulted in increased Bad and rapid down-regulation of XIAP, while levels of the antiapoptotic regulator Mcl-1 remained unchanged. Expression of dominant-active Akt, reduction of Bad expression by RNA interference, or overexpression of XIAP abrogated the sensitizing effect of ATO. The inhibitory effect of XIAP overexpression was reduced when the Akt phosphorylation site was mutated (XIAP-S87A). These data suggest that the combination of ATO and glucocorticoids could be advantageous in GC-resistant ALL and reveal additional targets for the evaluation of new antileukemic agents.","['Bornhauser, Beat C', 'Bonapace, Laura', 'Lindholm, Dan', 'Martinez, Rodrigo', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Niggli, Felix K', 'Schafer, Beat W', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre']","['Bornhauser BC', 'Bonapace L', 'Lindholm D', 'Martinez R', 'Cario G', 'Schrappe M', 'Niggli FK', 'Schafer BW', 'Bourquin JP']","[""Department of Oncology, Children's Hospital, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Prednisone/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism']",2007/06/01 09:00,2007/10/31 09:00,['2007/06/01 09:00'],"['2007/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Sep 15;110(6):2084-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-12-060970.

PD0332991 caused an initial cell-cycle arrest in well-established Flt3 wild-type (wt) AML cell lines, but this was overcome by down-regulation of p27(Kip) and reactivation of CDK2. This acquired resistance was not observed in a Flt3 ITD and a Flt3 wt sample from a patient with primary AML. In summary, the mechanism of cell-cycle arrest after treatment of Flt3 ITD AML with a Flt3 inhibitor involves down-regulation of cyclin D2 and D3. As such, CDK4/6 can be a therapeutic target in Flt3 ITD AML but also in primary Flt3 wt AML. Finally, acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition can arise through activation CDK2.","['Wang, Lisheng', 'Wang, Jie', 'Blaser, Bradley W', 'Duchemin, Anne-Marie', 'Kusewitt, Donna F', 'Liu, Tom', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Briesewitz, Roger']","['Wang L', 'Wang J', 'Blaser BW', 'Duchemin AM', 'Kusewitt DF', 'Liu T', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Briesewitz R']","['Department of Pharmacology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0', '(5-((5-fluoro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene)methyl)-N-(2-hydroxy-3-morphol', 'in-4-ylpropyl)-2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxamide)', '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Ccnd3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (THRX 165724)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'G9ZF61LE7G (palbociclib)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2007/06/01 09:00,2007/10/31 09:00,['2007/06/01 09:00'],"['2007/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Sep 15;110(6):2075-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-02-071266.

Based on this mechanism, we have developed a system for the predictable decoration of enveloped viruses with functionally active cytokines that circumvents the need to modify viral proteins themselves. Human interleukin-2 (hIL-2), hIL-4, human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF), and murine IL-2 (mIL-2) were used as model cytokines and fused at their C terminus to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) acceptor sequence of human Fcgamma receptor III (CD16b). We show here that genetically modified cytokines are all well expressed on 293 producer cells. However, only molecules equipped with GPI anchors but not those linked to transmembrane/intracellular regions of type I membrane proteins are efficiently targeted to lipid rafts and consequently to virus-like particles (VLP) induced by Moloney murine leukemia virus Gag-Pol. hIL-4::GPI and hGM-CSF::GPI coexpressed on VLP were found to differentiate monocytes towards dendritic cells. Apart from myeloid-committed cell types, VLP-bound cytokines also act efficiently on lymphocytes. hIL-2::GPI strongly costimulated T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 dependent T-cell activation in vitro and mIL-2::GPI-coactivated antigen-specific T cells in vivo. On a molar basis, the functional activity of VLP-bound hIL-2::GPI was found to be comparable to that of soluble hIL-2. VLP decorated with hIL-2::GPI and coexpressing a TCR/CD3 ligand have an IL-2-specific activity of 5 x 10(4) units/mg protein. Virus particles decorated with lipid-modified cytokines might help to improve viral strains for vaccination purposes, the propagation of factor-dependent cell types, as well as gene transfer by viral systems in the future.","['Kueng, Hans J', 'Leb, Victoria M', 'Haiderer, Daniela', 'Raposo, Graca', 'Thery, Clotilde', 'Derdak, Sophia V', 'Schmetterer, Klaus G', 'Neunkirchner, Alina', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Seed, Brian', 'Pickl, Winfried F']","['Kueng HJ', 'Leb VM', 'Haiderer D', 'Raposo G', 'Thery C', 'Derdak SV', 'Schmetterer KG', 'Neunkirchner A', 'Sillaber C', 'Seed B', 'Pickl WF']","['Institute of Immunology, Center for Physiology, Pathophysiology, and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Borschkegasse 8A, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Codon, Terminator)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FCGR3B protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Codon, Terminator/genetics', 'Cytokines/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/immunology', '*Protein Engineering', 'Receptors, IgG/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Virion/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",2007/06/01 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/06/01 09:00'],"['2007/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Aug;81(16):8666-76. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00682-07.

PLZF was expressed with a nuclear speckled pattern distinctively in the full-length PLZF-expressing Jurkat clones, suggesting that the nuclear speckled localization is required for PLZF-induced apoptosis.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Pediatric patients diagnosed with B-type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma without a previous history of malignant diseases were eligible for this study. They were classified in 3 groups of risk: group A (resected stage I and abdominal stage II), group B (not eligible for groups A or C), and group C (with central nervous system involvement and L3 leukemia). All received treatment according to the SFOP's LMB89 protocol. RESULTS: A total of 153 patients were considered in this multicenter, prospective and non-randomized trial (1997-2005). The global and event-free survival (EFS) were found to be of 88% (0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-0.93) and 85% (0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.90), respectively. The EFS was 100% for the group A (n = 16), 86% (0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.92) for the group B (n = 113), and 68% (0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.86) for the group C (n = 24). CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the good efficiency of the LMB89 protocol for treating B-cell lymphoma and L3 leukemia, despite having diminished the treatment intensity in the less risk groups. The worst prognostic factor was found to be a central nervous system involvement, whereas being younger than 10 years was confirmed to be a favorable prognostic factor. In addition, no differences were evidenced between Burkitt and large B-cell lymphoma.","['Forns, Marga', 'Javier, German', 'Estella, Jesus', 'Fernandez-Delgado, Rafael', 'Gallego, Soledad', 'Garcia-Miguel, Purificacion', 'Indiano, Jose M', 'Navajas, Aurora', 'Pardo, Nuria']","['Forns M', 'Javier G', 'Estella J', 'Fernandez-Delgado R', 'Gallego S', 'Garcia-Miguel P', 'Indiano JM', 'Navajas A', 'Pardo N']","['Servicio de Cirugia General, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Barcelona, Espana. margaforns@terra.es']",['spa'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'LMB89 protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leucovorin/therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2007/06/01 09:00,2007/09/08 09:00,['2007/06/01 09:00'],"['2007/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2007 May 5;128(17):641-6. doi: 10.1157/13102049.,,"['en representacion del grupo SHOP de las Sociedades Espanolas de Hematologia', '(SEHP) y Oncologia Pediatricas (SEOP)']",,"['S0025-7753(07)72681-7 [pii]', '10.1157/13102049 [doi]']",Resultados del protocolo SHOP LNHB98 (LMB89) en pacientes de edad pediatrica afectados de linfoma no hodgkiniano de celulas B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone (5-OH-HxMF) induces growth inhibition of human cancer cells and induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells through modulation of mitochondrial functions regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS generation occurs in the early stages of 5-OH-HxMF-induced apoptosis, preceding cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and DNA fragmentation. The changes occurred after single breaks in DNA were detected, suggesting that 5-OH-HxMF induced irreparable DNA damage, which in turn triggered the process of apoptosis. Up-regulation of Bax was found in 5-OH-HxMF-treated HL-60 cells. In addition, a caspase-independent pathway indicated by endonuclease G also contributed to apoptosis caused by 5-OH-HxMF. Antioxidants suppress 5-OH-HxMF-induced apoptosis. 5-OH-HxMF markedly enhanced growth arrest DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) protein in a time-dependent manner. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and catalase prevented up-regulation of GADD153 expression caused by 5-OH-HxMF. These findings suggest that 5-OH-HxMF creates an oxidative cellular environment that induces DNA damage and GADD153 gene activation, which in turn helps trigger apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Meanwhile, ROS were proven an important inducer in this apoptotic process. The C-5 hydroxyl on the ring of 5-OH-HxMF was found to be essential for the antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activity. Our study identified the novel mechanisms of 5-OH-HxMF-induced apoptosis and indicated that these results have significant applications as potential chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents.","['Pan, Min-Hsiung', 'Lai, You-Syuan', 'Lai, Ching-Shu', 'Wang, Ying-Jan', 'Li, Shiming', 'Lo, Chih-Yu', 'Dushenkov, Slavik', 'Ho, Chi-Tang']","['Pan MH', 'Lai YS', 'Lai CS', 'Wang YJ', 'Li S', 'Lo CY', 'Dushenkov S', 'Ho CT']","['Department of Seafood Science, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan. mhpan@mail.nkmu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', ""07JTS22V9J (5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone)"", '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flavones/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/*genetics']",2007/06/01 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/06/01 09:00'],"['2007/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2007 Jun 27;55(13):5081-91. doi: 10.1021/jf070068z.

It remains unclear whether normal cellular protein targets of chemotherapeutics will evolve drug resistance via mutation to a similar extent. We conducted an in vitro screen for resistance to lonafarnib, a farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor that blocks prenylation of a number of proteins important in cell proliferation, and identified 9 mutations clustering around the lonafarnib binding site. In patients treated with a combination of imatinib and lonafarnib, we identified farnesyl protein transferase mutations in residues identified in our screen. Substitutions at Y361 were found in patients prior to treatment initiation, suggesting that these mutants might confer a proliferative advantage to leukemia cells, which we were able to confirm in cell culture. In vitro mutagenesis of normal cellular enzymes can be exploited to identify mutations that confer chemotherapy resistance to novel agents.","['Raz, Tal', 'Nardi, Valentina', 'Azam, Mohammad', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Daley, George Q']","['Raz T', 'Nardi V', 'Azam M', 'Cortes J', 'Daley GQ']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, and Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'IOW153004F (lonafarnib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Prenylation', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2007/05/31 09:00,2007/10/31 09:00,['2007/05/31 09:00'],"['2007/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Sep 15;110(6):2102-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-12-064907.

Thus, ABT-737 synergistically enhanced VXL cytotoxicity in ALL cell lines via a mitochondrial death pathway and enhanced EFS in VXL-treated mice bearing ALL xenografts.

This paper summarizes the epidemiological studies published to date on the risks of cancer following the Chernobyl accident. An increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer observed among those exposed in childhood and adolescence in the most contaminated territories of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine is at present the only scientifically demonstrated radiation-related increase in cancer incidence. This observation provided important information on the risk of thyroid cancer related to 131I and on factors, such as iodine deficiency and stable iodine supplementation, which can modify this risk. The reports on increases in the incidence of other types of cancer are difficult to interpret because of methodological limitations. As the majority of these studies cover a relatively short time period, it is not possible to fully evaluate the radiological impact of the accident, and it is premature to draw conclusions on the risk of cancers other than that of thyroid. Predictions, based on the experience of other populations exposed to ionizing radiation, suggest that a substantial number of cancers could occur in Europe, especially in the most contaminated areas. Well-focused studies could verify these predictions, in particular with regard to the risks of leukaemia among liquidators and breast cancer among young women in the most contaminated areas.","['Kesminiene, Ausrele', 'Cardis, Elisabeth']","['Kesminiene A', 'Cardis E']","['Centre international de recherche sur le cancer, 150 cours Albert-Thomas, 69372 Lyon Cedex. kesminiene@iarc.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,['0 (Radioactive Fallout)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Population Density', '*Radioactive Fallout', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Time Factors', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",2007/05/31 09:00,2007/06/21 09:00,['2007/05/31 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2007 May;94(5):423-30.,,,,,Epidemiologie de l'apres-Tchernobyl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unmutated IgV(H) genes, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression have emerged as the most useful tools in identifying aggressive CLL. The simultaneous expression of ZAP-70 and CD38 in 157 patients with CLL has been evaluated. Fifty-seven patients (36%) were positive for ZAP-70 and 46 patients (29%) were positive for CD38. Both molecules were highly correlated and predictive of the clinical course of the disease. According to the simultaneous evaluation of ZAP-70 and CD38, patients were divided into three groups. In 81 patients (52%), there was a negative concordance of both molecules (ZAP-70(-)/CD38(-)); in 27 patients (17%) there was a positive concordance (ZAP-70(+)/CD38(+)); in 49 patients (31%) there was a discordant expression (ZAP-70(+)/CD38(-) and ZAP-70(-)/CD38(+)). A comparison of the clinical and laboratory data showed in ZAP-70(+)/CD38(+) patients a significantly higher bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytosis, lower hemoglobin levels, more advanced clinical stage, and higher number of unmutated IgV(H) status with respect to the other two groups. Furthermore, ZAP-70(+)/CD38(+) patients displayed a much shorter treatment-free interval (median 12 months vs 42 months in discordant patients and not reached in ZAP-70(-)CD38(-) patients).

Previous studies have shown that patients with hyperglycemia during induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia develop more infections and have shorter disease-free survival. The authors hypothesized that hyperglycemia may be associated with adverse outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and sought to determine whether this association exists in this population. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective cohort study to examine the relation between hyperglycemia and hospital mortality in patients with the diagnosis of AML. Two hundred eighty-three adult patients were treated over a 3-year period. All hospitalizations were reviewed during the study period, and glucose exposure and outcomes were quantified. RESULTS: Hyperglycemia during a patient's hospitalization was associated with increased hospital mortality (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.23-1.55; P < .001) after adjusting for covariates, including disease state, treatment type, and response. The rise in mortality was evident at even mild levels (110-150 mg/dL) of glucose elevation. Although the odds of developing severe sepsis (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.13.-1.38; P < .001) or severe sepsis with respiratory failure (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.44-2.91; P < .001) were increased with hyperglycemia, sepsis did not appear to be the main factor responsible for the negative impact of hyperglycemia on hospital mortality.

Translocations into the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and aneuploidy are nearly universal in multiple myeloma, whereas Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia generally does not harbor translocations. Deletion of 6q is identified in 50% of patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, however. The genetic abnormalities in multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia have implications for disease progression, and the subsequent proteomic expression associated with each disease influences therapeutic decisions. RECENT FINDINGS: Gene expression profiling in these hematologic malignancies demonstrated distinct differences in mRNA expression patterns. Following profiling, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia samples clustered with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and normal B-cell samples. Profiling performed after separation of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia samples into populations with plasma cell or B-cell morphology revealed that plasma cell Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia samples most closely resembled multiple myeloma samples rather than chronic lymphocytic leukemia or normal control samples. SUMMARY: Diverse genetic abnormalities have been identified in these hematologic malignancies, although they have similar clinical features. Gene expression profiling has elucidated the impact of genetic abnormalities. Furthermore, it may be used to identify a specific pathway for therapeutic targeting, such as interleukin-6 in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.","['Henry, Travis', 'Fonseca, Rafael']","['Henry T', 'Fonseca R']","['Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Scottsdale, Arizona 85260, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Proteomics', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*genetics']",2007/05/31 09:00,2007/07/07 09:00,['2007/05/31 09:00'],"['2007/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2007 Jul;14(4):369-74. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3281ddb2b8.,63,,"['P01 CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100707-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA83724-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3281ddb2b8 [doi]', '00062752-200707000-00011 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insertional mutagenesis caused by gene vectors has thus led to major uncertainty among those developing advanced hematopoietic cell therapies. This review summarizes novel studies of underlying mechanisms; these studies have demonstrated the possibility of improved gene vector biosafety and generated new insights into stem cell biology. RECENT FINDINGS: The characteristic insertion pattern of various retroviral gene vector systems may be explained by properties of the viral integrase and associated cellular cofactors. Cell culture assays and animal models, including disease-specific and cancer-prone mouse models, are emerging that reveal the contributions of vector features and systemic factors to induction of clonal imbalance. Databases summarizing vector insertion sites in dominant hematopoietic clones are evolving as new tools to identify genes that regulate clonal homeostasis. SUMMARY: Mechanistic studies of insertional mutagenesis by random gene vector insertion will lead to improved tools for advanced hematopoietic cell therapy. Simultaneously, fascinating insights into gene networks that regulate cell fitness will be generated, with important consequences for the fields of hematology, oncology and regenerative medicine.","['Baum, Christopher']",['Baum C'],"['Department of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. baum.christopher@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*methods']",2007/05/31 09:00,2007/07/07 09:00,['2007/05/31 09:00'],"['2007/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2007 Jul;14(4):337-42. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3281900f01.,44,,['R01-CA107492-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3281900f01 [doi]', '00062752-200707000-00006 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, HuR was shown to increase the stability of a target mRNA encoding the pro-survival deacetylase SIRT1. The discovery that HuR likewise binds to and promotes the expression of mRNAs encoding Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, two major anti-apoptotic effectors, strongly supports HuR's role as a key upstream coordinator of a constitutive pro-survival program.","['Abdelmohsen, Kotb', 'Lal, Ashish', 'Kim, Hyeon Ho', 'Gorospe, Myriam']","['Abdelmohsen K', 'Lal A', 'Kim HH', 'Gorospe M']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Institute on Aging-IRP, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21224, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (ELAV Proteins)', '0 (ELAV-Like Protein 1)', '0 (ELAVL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (prothymosin alpha)', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Survival', 'ELAV Proteins', 'ELAV-Like Protein 1', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Precursors/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA Interference/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Sirtuin 1', 'Sirtuins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Thymosin/analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2007/05/31 09:00,2007/08/10 09:00,['2007/05/31 09:00'],"['2007/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Jun 1;6(11):1288-92. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.11.4299.

The aim of this article is to describe children's behaviour and coping over the 2- or 3-year-course of treatment. We interviewed 32 mothers of children newly diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) shortly following diagnosis, 1 and 2 years later. Thematic analysis was used to extract themes related to adjustment and behaviour. The results were organized separately for children in three age groups: 0-4 years, 5-9 years and 10-14 years. Mothers described children in the 0-4-year age group as adjusting well, and attributed this to their limited understanding and ability to integrate treatments into normal life. Children in the 5-9-year group were adjusting less well, experiencing social problems and worries about appearance. Older children (10-14 years) adjusted least well. Many withdrew socially and were concerned about the need to look and feel normal. These findings will be useful for parents and clinicians in identifying typical behaviours of children coping with ALL. They also have implications for the development of child-centred age-specific measures of quality of life in children treated for ALL.","['Earle, Emily Anne', 'Eiser, Christine']","['Earle EA', 'Eiser C']","['University of Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,Clinical child psychology and psychiatry,9604507,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Child', '*Child Behavior Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Time Factors']",2007/05/31 09:00,2007/07/11 09:00,['2007/05/31 09:00'],"['2007/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2007 Apr;12(2):281-93. doi: 10.1177/1359104507075935.,,,,['10.1177/1359104507075935 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) from CML patients and healthy volunteers were cultured initially using multiple cytokine combinations as follows: recombinant human granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating-factor (rhGM-CSF) plus recombinant human interleukin-4 (rhIL-4) as CML and normal control groups, rhGM-CSF plus rhIL-4 and ST1571 as CML experimental groups, and from day 8 recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( rhTNF-alpha) was added to stimulate DC maturation. The morphologic features of cells were observed by Wright's staining and phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry. Cytogenetic analysis was performed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), and the antigen-presenting function was assayed by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The concentration of VEGF was detected by ELISA. RESULTS: CML experimental groups treated with STI571 displayed morphological features similar to those of control groups with delicate membrane projections. However, in comparison with the CML control groups, the CML experimental groups showed an increased expression of CD80, CD86, CD83 and HLA-DR and showed more intense abilities of allogeneic antigen presentation, which were similar to those of normal control groups. FISH confirmed that DCs of both CML, groups were of leukemic origin. The concentration of VEGF was dramatically reduced in CML experimental groups. CONCLUSION: In vitro, STI571 promotes the activation/maturation of DCs derived from BMMNCs of patients with CMI, and decreases VEGF production by the leukemic cells. The promotion of DC maturation may be partially due to decreased inhibitory effect of VEGF.","['Zheng, Shui-Er', 'Jin, Jie', 'Tong, Xiang-Min', 'Qian, Wen-Bin', 'Xue, Yong-Quan']","['Zheng SE', 'Jin J', 'Tong XM', 'Qian WB', 'Xue YQ']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University Medical College, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2007/05/31 09:00,2008/03/18 09:00,['2007/05/31 09:00'],"['2007/05/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2006 Dec;28(12):920-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indirubin-3'-monoxime is mainly recognized as an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and glycogen synthase kinase-3. It inhibits proliferation of cultured cells, mainly through arresting the cells in the G1/S or G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Here, we report that indirubin-3'-monoxime is able to inhibit proliferation of NIH/3T3 cells by specifically inhibiting autophosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), blocking in this way the receptor-mediated cell signaling. Indirubin-3'-monoxime inhibits the activity of FGFR1 at a concentration lower than that required for inhibition of phosphorylation of CDK2 and retinoblastoma protein and cell proliferation stimulated by fetal calf serum. The ability of indirubin-3'-monoxime to inhibit FGFR1 signaling was similar to that of the FGFR1 inhibitor SU5402. In addition, we found that indirubin-3'-monoxime activates long-term p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, which stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in a way unrelated to the activity of FGFR1. Furthermore, we show that indirubin-3'-monoxime can inhibit proliferation of the myeloid leukemia cell line KG-1a through inhibition of the activity of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase.

Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a part of the AML1 complex and activates AML1-mediated transcription. However, chromosomal translocations and mutations of HIPK2 have not been reported. In the current study, we screened mutations of the HIPK2 gene in 50 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in 80 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Results indicated there were two missense mutations (R868W and N958I) in the speckle-retention signal (SRS) domain of HIPK2. Subcellular localization analyses indicated that the two mutants were largely localized to nuclear regions with conical or ring shapes, and were somewhat diffused in the nucleus, in contrast to the wild type, which were mainly localized in nuclear speckles. The mutations impaired the overlapping localization of AML1 and HIPK2. The mutants showed decreased activities and a dominant-negative function over wild-type protein in AML1- and p53-dependent transcription. These findings suggest that dysfunction of HIPK2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of leukemia.","['Li, X-L', 'Arai, Y', 'Harada, H', 'Shima, Y', 'Yoshida, H', 'Rokudai, S', 'Aikawa, Y', 'Kimura, A', 'Kitabayashi, I']","['Li XL', 'Arai Y', 'Harada H', 'Shima Y', 'Yoshida H', 'Rokudai S', 'Aikawa Y', 'Kimura A', 'Kitabayashi I']","['Molecular Oncology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (HIPK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2007/05/30 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/05/30 09:00'],"['2007/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Nov 8;26(51):7231-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210523.

The results of these analyses are then used as a major basis for current risk estimates suggested by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) for use in international safety guidelines. It is shown here that (i) a constant value of 10 is not consistent with weighting factors recommended by the ICRP for neutrons and (ii) it does not account for the hardening of the neutron spectra in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which takes place with increasing distance from the hypocentres. The purpose of this paper is to present new RBE values for the neutrons, calculated as a function of distance from the hypocentres for both cities that are consistent with the ICRP60 neutron weighting factor. If based on neutron spectra from the DS86 dosimetry system, these calculations suggest values of about 31 at 1000 m and 23 at 2000 m ground range in Hiroshima, while the corresponding values for Nagasaki are 24 and 22. If the neutron weighting factor that is consistent with ICRP92 is used, the corresponding values are about 23 and 21 for Hiroshima and 21 and 20 for Nagasaki, respectively. It is concluded that the current risk estimates will be subject to some changes in view of the changed RBE values.

However, the identification of human cell lines with stem cell characteristics, capable of differentiating into OCs, would provide a tool for the study of the molecular mechanisms regulating their commitment, differentiation, and function. Since the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line MUTZ-3 contains both CD34(+) stem cell and CD14(+) cell populations, we investigated the capacity of the stem/progenitor CD34(+) population to differentiate into functional OCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sorted MUTZ-3-CD34(+) and MUTZ-3-CD14(+) cells were cultured in presence of M-CSF, RANK-L, and TNF-alpha to generate OCs. Differentiation was evaluated by TRAP staining and RT-PCR, which assessed the expression of c-fms, RANK, MMP-9, CATK, TRAP, and CTR in -CD34(+)OC and -CD14(+)OC cells. Resorption pit formation was also evaluated. CD34, CD14, M-CSF-R, RANK, and CTR expression was assessed by FACS analysis. RESULTS: MUTZ-3-CD34(+) differentiated into OCs, displaying the full range of differentiation markers; MMP-9, CATK, TRAP, and RANK mRNA were detected from day 3 of culture, whereas CTR from day 12. Stimulated MUTZ-3-CD34(+) generated functional osteoclasts that formed extensive resorption lacunae on both mineralized surface and bone slices. Surprisingly, in both sorted populations we identified a population M-CSF-R(+)/RANK(+) that at the same time co-expressed CD14 and CD34. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that MUTZ-3 cells constitute an invaluable model to study the expression pattern in different developmental stages of commitment and differentiation. Importantly, the data indicate that the CD14(+)CD34(+)M-CSF-R(+)RANK(+) population represents an intermediate stage of differentiation from CD34 precursors and monocytes to osteoclast.","['Ciraci, Elisa', 'Barisani, Donatella', 'Parafioriti, Antonina', 'Formisano, Giuseppe', 'Arancia, Giuseppe', 'Bottazzo, GianFranco', 'Berardi, Anna C']","['Ciraci E', 'Barisani D', 'Parafioriti A', 'Formisano G', 'Arancia G', 'Bottazzo G', 'Berardi AC']","['Laboratory of Stem Cells, IRCCS-Pediatric Hospital of Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B)', '0 (TNFRSF11A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Monocytes/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Osteoclasts/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Time Factors']",2007/05/30 09:00,2007/07/17 09:00,['2007/05/30 09:00'],"['2006/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2007/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Jun;35(6):967-77. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.03.003.,,,,"['S0301-472X(07)00161-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.03.003 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated whether CD23-derived peptides might function as B-CLL-specific tumor-associated antigen (TAA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using IFN-gamma-ELISPOT assays and HLA-A2/dimer-peptide staining we identified autologous, CD23-specific HLA-A0201-restricted T cells after 4 weeks of in vitro culture. RESULTS: We were able to expand autologous T cells from 8/11 B-CLL patients by using native and CD40L-activated B-CLL cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in 5 cases whereas for 3 samples an autologous T cell response could only be evoked by use of CD40L-stimulated B-CLL cells as APCs. The number of CD8(+) T cells could be expanded during 4 weeks of in vitro culture with native or CD40L-activated B-CLL cells. We could demonstrate that the expanded T cells were also able to secrete IFN-gamma upon recognition of the antigen using IFN-gamma-ELISPOT assays. Furthermore, these T cells not only recognized HLA-A0201-binding CD23-derived peptides presented by T2 cells, but also CD23-overexpressing autologous B-CLL cells in an MHC-I-restricted manner.

Our previous studies have shown that expression of mutant N-ras (N-rasG13R, G to C transversion) in human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) promotes myeloid differentiation and proliferation both in vitro and in a NOD/SCID mouse model. In the present study, we performed expression profiling to identify the transcriptome induced by N-rasG13R in human HPC, and analyzed the effect of mutant N-ras in sorted specific subpopulations of HPC. METHODS: cDNA microarray analysis was performed on cord blood CD34(+) cells transduced with a retrovirus containing GFP alone or in combination with mutant N-ras. Transduced cells were also sorted into factorial subpopulations according to CD34 and transgene expression, and analyzed in suspension or semi-solid methylcellulose culture. RESULTS: Among a variety of changes, including upregulation of cytokine genes, we found that N-rasG13R induced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16(INK4a) and p21(CIP1/WAF1). Analysis by RT-PCR revealed that increased p16(INK4a) and p21(CIP1/WAF1) occurred in the most primitive, CD34(+)/Ras(+) population but not in the more mature CD34(-)/Ras(+) cells or in the CD34(+)/Ras(-) cells. Moreover, N-rasG13R inhibited the proliferation of the primitive CD34(+)/Ras(+) cells, both in liquid culture and in colony assays. This growth suppression correlated with an increased proportion of myelomonocytic colonies and a decrease of erythroid colonies. In contrast, the growth of CD34(-)/Ras(+) cells and CD34(+)/Ras(-) HPC was not inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated the mutant N-ras induced transcriptome, and that this is associated with HPC growth suppression/myelomonocytic differentiation, and identify upregulation of cyclin inhibitors as key events in this process. The results indicate that ras mutation alone is not sufficient to induce leukemogenesis; collaborative secondary event(s) are involved in the process.","['Shen, Sylvie', 'Passioura, Toby', 'Symonds, Geoff', 'Dolnikov, Alla']","['Shen S', 'Passioura T', 'Symonds G', 'Dolnikov A']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Randwick, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Up-Regulation/*genetics']",2007/05/30 09:00,2007/07/17 09:00,['2007/05/30 09:00'],"['2006/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Jun;35(6):908-19. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.02.011.,,,,"['S0301-472X(07)00117-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.02.011 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We presently perform hepatic TAE in patients with intractable symptomatic polycystic liver. STUDY DESIGN: Uncontrolled trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 30 patients with ADPKD referred for arteriography to an academic medical center. 22 patients had kidney failure treated by means of dialysis. INTERVENTION: We embolized arteries supplying hepatic segments replaced by cysts that were associated with well-developed hepatic arteries, but obstructed intrahepatic portal veins. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Various volumes before and after TAE were compared by using computed tomography and National Institutes of Health Image software in 30 patients with follow-up computed tomography 18 to 37 months after therapy. RESULTS: Total liver volume and total intrahepatic cyst volume decreased from 7,882 +/- 2,916 and 6,677 +/- 2,978 to 6,041 +/- 2,282 and 4,625 +/- 2,299 cm(3), respectively (P < 0.0001 for both). Fractions of remaining (FR) total liver volume and FR of intrahepatic cyst volume were 78.8% +/- 17.6% and 70.4% +/- 20.9%, respectively. Hepatic parenchyma increased from 1,205 +/- 250 to 1,406 +/- 277 cm(3) (P = 0.0004). In 29 of 30 patients, both total liver volume and intrahepatic cyst volume decreased; in 1 patient, total liver volume increased from 5,755 to 7,069 cm(3), whereas cysts enlarged from 4,500 to 5,531 cm(3).

In this study, we present the generation of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled human leukemic cell line, NB4, and validate the potential of a time-domain imager fitted with a 470 nm picosecond pulsed laser diode to decouple GFP fluorescence from autofluorescence on the basis of fluorescence lifetime and thus determine the depth and relative concentration of GFP inclusions in phantoms of homogeneous and heterogeneous optical properties. Subsequently, we developed an optical imageable human xenograft model of NB4-GFP AML and illustrate early disease detection, depth discrimination of leukemic infiltrates, and longitudinal monitoring of disease course employing time-domain optical imaging. We conclude that early disease detection through use of time-domain imaging in this initially slowly progressing AML xenograft model permits accurate disease staging and should aid in future preclinical development of therapeutics for AML.","['McCormack, Emmet', 'Micklem, David R', 'Pindard, Lars-Erik', 'Silden, Elisabeth', 'Gallant, Pascal', 'Belenkov, Alexandre', 'Lorens, James B', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['McCormack E', 'Micklem DR', 'Pindard LE', 'Silden E', 'Gallant P', 'Belenkov A', 'Lorens JB', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Institute of Medicine, Haematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Imaging,Molecular imaging,101120118,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*analysis', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/pathology', '*Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Optics and Photonics/instrumentation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Whole Body Imaging/instrumentation/*methods']",2007/05/30 09:00,2007/12/14 09:00,['2007/05/30 09:00'],"['2007/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Imaging. 2007 May-Jun;6(3):193-204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe here a previously unreported rearrangement, t(11;21)(q13;q22), that disrupts the RUNX1 gene in a patient with acute leukemia and the molecular analysis of the fusion gene. METHODS: We have established a monocytic leukemia cell line, ELAM-1, from a patient with acute leukemia evolving from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Translocation (11;21) (q13;q22) was observed in both patient leukemia cells and ELAM-1. RESULTS: The split signal of RUNX1 was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization and indicated the involvement of RUNX1 in ELAM-1. Using 3'- Rapid amplification of cDNA ends and reverse transcription-Polymerase chain reaction analysis, we detected both RUNX1 (exon 5)-LRP16 and RUNX1 (exon 6)-LRP16 transcripts, suggesting that the RUNX1 breakpoint lies in intron 6 and that alternative fusion splice variants are generated. Reciprocal LRP16-RUNX1 fusion was also detected. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel RUNX1 fusion partner, LRP16 on 11q13 involving t(11;21)(q13;q22). Although it was reported that overexpression of LRP16 promotes human breast cancer cell proliferation, the function of LRP16 in leukemia remains to be studied. This fusion gene and cell line may provide a new research tool to investigate the mechanism of leukemogenesis generated by the RUNX1 fusion gene.","['Imagama, Shizuka', 'Abe, Akihiro', 'Suzuki, Momoko', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko', 'Katsumi, Akira', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Imagama S', 'Abe A', 'Suzuki M', 'Hayakawa F', 'Katsumi A', 'Emi N', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (MACROD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2007/05/30 09:00,2007/07/24 09:00,['2007/05/30 09:00'],"['2007/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Jul;79(1):25-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00858.x.

METHODS: Fifty CLL patients were vaccinated with tetanus conjugated Hib vaccine and a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine with (n = 25) or without (n = 25) ranitidine treatment in a matched case--control setting. Anti tetanus toxoid (TT), anti-Hib and anti-pneumococcal antibody levels were determined before and after vaccination. Additionally, cytokine levels were assessed in patients treated with ranitidine. RESULTS: Vaccination-induced increases in anti-Hib and anti-TT antibody levels were higher in the ranitidine group compared with the control group. Anti-pneumococcal antibody responses were not improved by administration of ranitidine. Higher levels of IL-18 were found in patients treated with ranitidine compared with healthy controls. Levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, RANTES, IP-10, sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 were within normal ranges and did not change during ranitidine treatment. CONCLUSION: Ranitidine treatment improves vaccination-induced T-cell dependent antibody responses in patients with CLL but has no beneficial effect on the response to vaccination with unconjugated polysaccharide antigens.","['Van der Velden, Ankie M T', 'Van Velzen-Blad, Heleen', 'Claessen, Anke M E', 'Van der Griend, Rene', 'Oltmans, Ruud', 'Rijkers, Ger T', 'Biesma, Douwe H']","['Van der Velden AM', 'Van Velzen-Blad H', 'Claessen AM', 'Van der Griend R', 'Oltmans R', 'Rijkers GT', 'Biesma DH']","['Department of Haematology, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. am.vandervelden@vumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Pneumococcal Vaccines)', '884KT10YB7 (Ranitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibody Formation/*drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumococcal Vaccines/*immunology', 'Ranitidine/*pharmacology']",2007/05/30 09:00,2007/07/24 09:00,['2007/05/30 09:00'],"['2007/05/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 Jul;79(1):47-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00862.x.

Constitutional trisomy 21 of Down syndrome (DS) is associated with markedly increased risk for childhood leukemia. Thus the oncogenic role of trisomy 21 in the more common sporadic childhood leukemias may be revealed through the investigations of the relatively rare leukemias of DS. Recent studies of the megakaryoblastic leukemias of Down syndrome have uncovered a developmental leukemogenic mechanism characterized by a unique pre-natal collaboration between overexpressed genes from chromosome 21 and an acquired mutation in the transcription factor GATA1. The base of the markedly enhanced risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia conferred by trisomy 21 is still unclear. Studies of the leukemias of DS are likely to contribute to the general understanding of the oncogenic mechanisms of chromosomal aneuploidies, the most common abnormalities in cancer.","['Izraeli, Shai', 'Rainis, Liat', 'Hertzberg, Libi', 'Smooha, Gil', 'Birger, Yehudit']","['Izraeli S', 'Rainis L', 'Hertzberg L', 'Smooha G', 'Birger Y']","['Research Section of Childhood Malignancies, Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, and the Sheba Cancer Research Center, Sheba Medical Hospital, Tel-Hashomer, Ramat-Gan 52621, Israel. sizraeli@sheba.health.gov.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Down Syndrome/complications/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/genetics', '*Trisomy']",2007/05/29 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2007/05/29 09:00'],"['2007/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2007 Sep-Oct;39(2):156-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2007.04.004.

Structure-function studies indicate that the fingers subdomain in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase contacts the template strand downstream of the primer terminus and is involved in strand displacement synthesis. Based on structural comparisons to the HIV-1 enzyme, we made single amino acid substitutions at the Tyr-64 and Leu-99 positions in the fingers subdomain of the M-MuLV reverse transcriptase to ask whether this subdomain has a similar role in displacement synthesis. In vitro assays comparing non-displacement versus displacement synthesis revealed that substitution of alanine at Tyr-64 generated a reverse transcriptase that was impaired in its capacity to carry out DNA and RNA displacement synthesis without affecting polymerase processivity or RNase H activity. However, substitution of Tyr-64 with phenylalanine and a variety of substitutions at position Leu-99 had no specific effect on displacement synthesis. The Y64A substitution prevented viral replication in vivo, and Y64A virus generated reduced levels of reverse transcription intermediates at all steps beyond the synthesis of minus strong stop DNA. The role of the fingers subdomain and in particular the possible contributions of the Tyr-64 residue in displacement synthesis are discussed.","['Paulson, Benjamin A', 'Zhang, Miaohua', 'Schultz, Sharon J', 'Champoux, James J']","['Paulson BA', 'Zhang M', 'Schultz SJ', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Box 357242, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. cheesefreak@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/*genetics', 'Animals', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/genetics', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",2007/05/29 09:00,2007/10/31 09:00,['2007/05/29 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2007 Sep 30;366(2):361-76. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2007.04.028.

Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) recognize human leukocyte antigen C and B epitopes on target cells, thereby regulating NK cell activity. To examine the recovery of CD94:NKG2A and KIR (CD158a, CD158b, and CD158e) expression by NK cells, we used flow cytometry to evaluate samples from 24 patients and their donors before and in the year following unmanipulated HLA-haploidentical/mismatched blood and marrow transplantation. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that NKG2A recovery was inversely correlated with CD158b recovery in the year following transplant. The doses of T cell subgroups CD4+ and CD8+ were inversely associated with CD158a and CD158e expression during the 2 months following transplantation. Moreover, patients with grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) or who received ""high"" doses of T cells (>1.37 x 10(8)/kg) showed delayed recovery of KIRs during the 2 months following transplantation. Univariate analysis showed that patients with high CD94 expression by day 60 (>90%) or who received donors with high CD94 expression (>80%) were associated with higher transplantation-related mortality (P = .006 or .067, respectively) and poorer leukemia-free survival (P = .012 or .094, respectively). Thus, the occurrence of aGVHD or the receipt of high doses of T cells in the allograft altered KIR reconstitution. Furthermore, high levels of CD94 expression in donors or in recipients by day 60 might be a good predictor for poor prognosis.","['Zhao, Xiang-Yu', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Liu, Dai-Hong']","['Zhao XY', 'Huang XJ', 'Liu KY', 'Xu LP', 'Liu DH']","[""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL1)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL3)', '0 (Receptors, KIR3DL1)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D/analysis', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Receptors, KIR2DL1', 'Receptors, KIR2DL3', 'Receptors, KIR3DL1', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Regeneration', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/05/29 09:00,2007/07/26 09:00,['2007/05/29 09:00'],"['2006/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Jun;13(6):734-44. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.02.010.,,,,"['S1083-8791(07)00190-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.02.010 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients received graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with cyclosporine as well as 3 doses of posttransplant methotrexate. Forty-one patients were transplanted in complete remission (CR) (20 in CR1, 20 in CR2, and 1 in CR3), and 14 were not in remission at the time of transplantation as they were refractory to chemotherapy either at induction or at relapse. The group consisted of adult patients with a median age of 37 years. Thirty-five patients were fully matched at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1. All patients engrafted and there were no cases of graft rejection. Grade II-IV acute GVHD occurred in only 2 patients. Chronic GVHD developed in 30% of patients but was extensive in only 3 cases. The predicted TRM was 11% at day 100 and 26% at 1 year. In multivariate analysis the receipt of an HLA mismatched transplant was associated with a higher transplant-related mortality (TRM) (55% versus 15%). Twelve of the 14 transplant-related deaths were due to infection. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 36% for the whole group and 28% for patients in CR at transplantation. The 5-year cumulative survival for the whole group was 38% and was 49% for those in remission at transplantation. Seven of the 12 patients transplanted in CR1 with adverse risk cytogenetics remain alive and in remission, and the predicted 5-year overall survival (OS) for this group is 50%. These results support the use of Alemtuzumab for unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for poor risk AML in CR1 and for relapsed AML in CR2. The addition of Alemtuzumab is highly effective in preventing both rejection and severe acute and extensive chronic GVHD without an increased relapse risk.","['Das-Gupta, Emma P', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Shaw, Bronwen E', 'Pearce, Rachel M', 'Byrne, Jennifer L']","['Das-Gupta EP', 'Russell NH', 'Shaw BE', 'Pearce RM', 'Byrne JL']","['Centre for Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals (City Campus), Nottingham, United Kingdom. emma.das-gupta@nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*administration & dosage', 'Cause of Death', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2007/05/29 09:00,2007/07/26 09:00,['2007/05/29 09:00'],"['2006/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Jun;13(6):724-33. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.02.011.,,,,"['S1083-8791(07)00189-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.02.011 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear whether currently accepted cytogenetic risk groups, which were established for patients treated mostly with standard therapy, are optimally discriminating for patients undergoing HSCT. Also, the impact of cytogenetics in the growing population of patients with therapy-related disease has not been completely elucidated. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed data on 556 patients with AML or MDS transplanted at our institution. We examined, in multivariate analyses, the contribution of cytogenetics to survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality for the 476 patients with de novo disease. We used these results to establish an optimal cytogenetic grouping scheme. We then applied this grouping scheme to the 80 patients with therapy-related disease. Our proposed 3-group cytogenetic classification outperformed the established grouping schemes for both de novo and therapy-related disease. When classified by this new scheme, cytogenetics was the strongest prognostic factor for overall survival in our cohort, through its impact on the risk of relapse (and not on nonrelapse mortality). After accounting for cytogenetics, patients with therapy-related AML or MDS had an equivalent outcome to those with de novo disease. This study demonstrates the impact of cytogenetics on the risk of relapse and death for patients with both de novo and therapy-related disease undergoing transplantation; it also emphasizes the necessity of using cytogenetics to stratify patients entering clinical trials, and provides a system for doing so, which can be validated in a multi-institutional database.","['Armand, Philippe', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Ho, Vincent T', 'Cutler, Corey S', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Soiffer, Robert J']","['Armand P', 'Kim HT', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Ho VT', 'Cutler CS', 'Stone RM', 'Ritz J', 'Alyea EP', 'Antin JH', 'Soiffer RJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/05/29 09:00,2007/07/26 09:00,['2007/05/29 09:00'],"['2006/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Jun;13(6):655-64. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.01.079.

In this study, we evaluated the ability of methotrexate, a clinically approved antimetabolite drug, to deplete alloreactive T cells in HLA-mismatched mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR). We observed that methotrexate could inhibit the proliferation of alloreactive T cells in primary in vitro MLR. On reexposure of methotrexate-treated cells to the same allostimulus, a significant reduction in the alloreactive immune response was observed, whereas responses to third-party allostimuli and viral antigens were preserved.

As a neurotropic virus, JCV has been implicated in pediatric central nervous system tumors and has been suggested to be a pathogenic agent in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Recent studies have demonstrated JCV gene sequences in pediatric medulloblastomas and among patients with colorectal cancer. JCV early protein T-antigen (TAg) can form complexes with cellular regulatory proteins and thus may play a role in tumorigenesis. Since JCV is detected in B-lymphocytes, a retrospective analysis of pediatric B-cell and non-B-cell malignancies as well as other HIV-associated pediatric malignancies was conducted for the presence of JCV gene sequences. DNA was extracted from 49 pediatric malignancies, including Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, large cell lymphoma and sarcoma. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted using JCV specific nested primer sets for the transcriptional control region (TCR), TAg, and viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) genes. Southern blot analysis and DNA sequencing were used to confirm specificity of the amplicons. A 215-bp region of the JCV VP1 gene was amplified from 26 (53%) pediatric tumor tissues. The JCV TCR and two JCV gene regions were amplified from a leiomyosarcoma specimen from an HIV-infected patient. The leiomyosarcoma specimen from the cecum harbored the archetype strain of JCV. Including the leiomyosarcoma specimen, three of five specimens sequenced were typed as JCV genotype 2. The failure to amplify JCV TCR, and TAg gene sequences in the presence of JCV VP1 gene sequence is surprising. Even though JCV TAg gene, which is similar to the SV40 TAg gene, is oncogenic in animal models, the presence of JCV gene sequences in pediatric malignancies does not prove causality. In light of the available data on the presence of JCV in normal and cancerous colon epithelial tissue and our data on amplification of JCV from the cecum of an HIV-infected pediatric patient, further studies are warranted on the role of colon epithelium in the pathogenesis of JCV infection.","['Shiramizu, B', 'Hu, N', 'Frisque, R J', 'Nerurkar, V R']","['Shiramizu B', 'Hu N', 'Frisque RJ', 'Nerurkar VR']","['Department of Pediatrics, John A.

Thus, new agents that override the resistance are crucial to the development of curative therapies for APL. In this study, we investigated the effects of berbamine on the proliferation of APL cell line NB4 and its possible mechanisms. METHODS: NB4 cells were treated with berbamine at different concentrations (0-64 microg/ml) for 72 hours. MTT assay was used to determine proliferation inhibition of NB4 cells. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by both flow cytometry (FCM) and morphological examination. PML/RAR-alpha and survivin mRNAs were measured by nested-RT-PCR and RT-PCR, respectively. Activated-caspase 3 was determined by FCM. RESULTS: Berbamine greatly inhibited the proliferation of NB4 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners, and its IC50 value was 3.86 microg/ml at 48 hours. Both morphological observations and FCM results showed that berbamine induced apoptosis of NB4 cells with concomitant increase of activated caspase-3 and decrease of survivin mRNA. After treatment with berbamine at 8 microg/ml for 48 hours, the percentage of apoptotic cells increased from 2.83% to 58.44% (P<0.01), and the percentage of cells with activated-caspase 3 elevated from 2.06% to 70.89% (P<0.01), whereas, level of survivin mRNA was reduced to 38.24% of control (P<0.01). However, no significant change was observed in PML/RAR-alpha mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Berbamine induces caspase-3-dependent apoptosis of leukemia NB4 cells via survivin-mediated pathway, suggesting that berbamine may be a novel potential agent against APL with a mechanism distinct from that of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO).","['Zhao, Xiao-ying', 'He, Zhi-wen', 'Wu, Dong', 'Xu, Rong-zhen']","['Zhao XY', 'He ZW', 'Wu D', 'Xu RZ']","['Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou 310009, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'V5KM4XJ0WM (berbamine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Survivin', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2007/05/29 09:00,2007/07/21 09:00,['2007/05/29 09:00'],"['2007/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2007 May 5;120(9):802-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DMC was previously shown in our laboratory to exceed the cytotoxicity of MC in a human leukemia cell line that lacks a functional p53 pathway (K562). However, the molecular signal transduction pathway activated by DMCDNA adducts has not been investigated. In this study, we have compared molecular targets associated with signaling pathways activated by DMC and MC in several human cancer cell lines. In cell lines lacking wild-type p53, DMC was reproducibly more cytotoxic than MC, but it generated barely detectable signal transduction markers associated with apoptotic death. Strikingly, DMCs increased cytotoxicity was not associated with an increase in DNA double-strand breaks but was associated with early poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation and Chk1 kinase depletion. Alkylating agents can induce increased PARP activity associated with programmed necrosis, and the biological activity of DMC in p53-null cell lines fits this paradigm. In cell lines with a functional p53 pathway, both MC and DMC induced apoptosis. In the presence of p53, both MC and DMC activate procaspases; however, the spectrum of procaspases involved differs for the two drugs, as does induction of p73. These studies suggest that in the absence of p53, signaling to molecular targets in cell death can shift in response to different DNA adduct structures to induce non-apoptotic cell death.","['Boamah, Ernest K', 'White, David E', 'Talbott, Kathryn E', 'Arva, Nicoleta C', 'Berman, Daniel', 'Tomasz, Maria', 'Bargonetti, Jill']","['Boamah EK', 'White DE', 'Talbott KE', 'Arva NC', 'Berman D', 'Tomasz M', 'Bargonetti J']","['The Institute for Biomolecular Structure and Function and Department of Biological Sciences, Hunter College and Graduate School, City University of New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '26909-37-5 (10-decarbamoylmitomycin C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Adducts/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitomycins/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2007/05/29 09:00,2007/08/07 09:00,['2007/05/29 09:00'],"['2007/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2007 Jun 15;2(6):399-407. doi: 10.1021/cb700060t.

Minor and micro breakpoint cluster regions (m-bcr with e1a2 transcript and micro-bcr with e19a2 transcript) are rarely affected and have been suggested to be associated with peculiar CML phenotypes. Despite the different clinical characteristics, it is currently not established, whether different therapeutic options are preferably recommended for the treatment of e1a2 or e19a2 CML. Here we report two patients with e1a2 and one patient with e19a2 translocations, treated with different approaches including imatinib. First and second line imatinib treatments induced haematologic response in all of the three patients, and major cytogenetic response in one patient with e1a2, as well as in the patient with e19a2 CML. However, relapse occurred in the patient with e19a2 CML, possibly caused by the presence of additional chromosomal abnormalities such as an extra Ph chromosome, and loss of chromosome Y. Stem cell transplantation (SCT) therapy caused complete haematologic response with molecular remission; however, the patient died of infectious complication. We conclude that in patients with rare BCR-ABL variants, the effectiveness of imatininb treatment may be influenced by the CML stage besides the actual molecular type of the rare transcript. However, this conclusion cannot be generalized to larger patient groups with rare BCR-ABL variants for which further studies may be needed.","['Andrikovics, Hajnalka', 'Nahajevszky, Sarolta', 'Szilvasi, Aniko', 'Bors, Andras', 'Adam, Emma', 'Kozma, Andras', 'Kajtar, Bela', 'Barta, Aniko', 'Poros, Anna', 'Tordai, Attila']","['Andrikovics H', 'Nahajevszky S', 'Szilvasi A', 'Bors A', 'Adam E', 'Kozma A', 'Kajtar B', 'Barta A', 'Poros A', 'Tordai A']","['Department of Molecular Diagnostics, National Medical Centre, Budapest, Hungary. andrikovics@kkk.org.hu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2007/05/29 09:00,2007/10/31 09:00,['2007/05/29 09:00'],"['2007/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2007 Sep;25(3):143-7. doi: 10.1002/hon.822.,,,,['10.1002/hon.822 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"['2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,

Serum IL-6 concentrations are related to decreasing functional status of these patients and provide important prognostic information.Moreover, in the failing human heart, multiple components of the IL-6- glycoprotein (gp)130 receptor system are impaired, implicating an important role of this system in cardiac pathophysiology.Experimental studies have shown that the common receptor subunit of IL-6 cytokines is phosphorylated in response to pressure overload and myocardial infarction and that it subsequently activates at least three different downstream signaling pathways, the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3), the Src-homology tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2)-Ras-ERK, and the PI3K-Akt system. Gp130 receptor mediated signaling promotes cardiomyocyte survival, induces hypertrophy, modulates cardiac extracellular matrix and cardiac function.

This review summarizes the current knowledge of IL-6 cytokines, gp130 receptor and STAT3 signaling in the heart exposed to physiological (aging, pregnancy) and pathophysiological stress (ischemia, pressure overload, inflammation and cardiotoxic agents) with a special focus on the potential role of individual IL-6 cytokines.","['Fischer, P', 'Hilfiker-Kleiner, D']","['Fischer P', 'Hilfiker-Kleiner D']","['Dept. of Cardiology & Angiology, Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Basic Res Cardiol,Basic research in cardiology,0360342,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiomegaly/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cell Survival', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Heart Failure/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oncostatin M/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/metabolism']",2007/05/29 09:00,2007/10/19 09:00,['2007/05/29 09:00'],"['2007/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Basic Res Cardiol. 2007 Jul;102(4):279-97. doi: 10.1007/s00395-007-0658-z.

In 1997, daclizumab was approved by the FDA for use in the prevention of renal allograft rejection. In addition, anti-Tac provided effective therapy for select patients with T-cell malignancies and an array of inflammatory autoimmune disorders. Finally, therapy with this antibody armed with (90)Y has led to clinical responses in the majority of patients with adult T-cell leukemia.

CD52 is expressed by a variety of lymphoid neoplasms and most human mononuclear cell subsets. In 2001, alemtuzumab was approved for marketing in the United States and Europe for use in patients with fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In heavily pretreated patients with CLL, the overall response rate (ORR) is approximately 35%, and in previously untreated patients the ORR is greater than 80%, with a recent randomized study suggesting it is superior to alkylator-based therapy. Importantly, alemtuzumab is effective in patients with high-risk del(17p13.1) and del(11q22.3) CLL. Alemtuzumab combination studies with fludarabine and/or monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab have demonstrated promising results. Alemtuzumab is also being studied in CLL patients as consolidation therapy for treatment of minimal residual disease, in preparation for stem cell transplantation and to prevent acute and chronic graft versus host disease. Alemtuzumab is frequently associated with acute 'first-dose' reactions when administered intravenously, but is much better tolerated when administered subcutaneously without loss of therapeutic efficacy. Additional potential adverse events associated with alemtuzumab administration include myelosuppression as well as profound cellular immune dysfunction with the associated risk of viral reactivation and other opportunistic infections. Additional studies detailing the mechanism of action of alemtuzumab as well as new strategies for prevention of opportunistic infections will aid in the future therapeutic development of this agent.","['Alinari, L', 'Lapalombella, R', 'Andritsos, L', 'Baiocchi, R A', 'Lin, T S', 'Byrd, J C']","['Alinari L', 'Lapalombella R', 'Andritsos L', 'Baiocchi RA', 'Lin TS', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2007/05/29 09:00,2007/07/28 09:00,['2007/05/29 09:00'],"['2007/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 May 28;26(25):3644-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210380.,75,,,"['1210380 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210380 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IPAH cells had greater migration than control cells but less organized tube formation in in vitro angiogenesis assay. Persistent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a regulator of cell survival and angiogenesis, and increased expression of its downstream prosurvival target, Mcl-1, were identified in IPAH PAEC.

The cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) has been shown to interact with CRE-like sequences present in the middle of each of these TxREs and to play critical transcriptional roles in both basal and Tax(BLV)-transactivated BLV promoter activity. In this study, we have investigated the potential involvement of the cAMP-response element modulator (CREM) in BLV transcriptional regulation, and we have demonstrated that CREM proteins were expressed in BLV-infected cells and bound to the three BLV TxREs in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using BLV-infected cell lines demonstrated in the context of chromatin that CREM proteins were recruited to the BLV promoter TxRE region in vivo. Functional studies, in the absence of Tax(BLV), indicated that ectopic CREMtau protein had a CRE-dependent stimulatory effect on BLV promoter transcriptional activity. Cross-link of the B-cell receptor potentiated CREMtau transactivation of the viral promoter. Further experiments supported the notion that this potentiation involved CREMtau Ser-117 phosphorylation and recruitment of CBP/p300 to the BLV promoter. Although CREB and Tax(BLV) synergistically transactivated the BLV promoter, CREMtau repressed this Tax(BLV)/CREB synergism, suggesting that a modulation of the level of Tax(BLV) transactivation through opposite actions of CREB and CREMtau could facilitate immune escape and allow tumor development.","['Nguyen, Thi Lien-Anh', 'de Walque, Stephane', 'Veithen, Emmanuelle', 'Dekoninck, Ann', 'Martinelli, Valerie', 'de Launoit, Yvan', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Harrod, Robert', 'Van Lint, Carine']","['Nguyen TL', 'de Walque S', 'Veithen E', 'Dekoninck A', 'Martinelli V', 'de Launoit Y', 'Burny A', 'Harrod R', 'Van Lint C']","['Institut de Biologie et de Medecine Moleculaires, Laboratoire de Virologie Moleculaire, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Rue des Profs Jeener et Brachet 12, 6041 Gosselies, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '135844-64-3 (Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator/chemistry/*genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2007/05/29 09:00,2007/09/18 09:00,['2007/05/29 09:00'],"['2007/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Jul 20;282(29):20854-67. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M703060200.

IL-8 was significantly correlated with white blood cell (P=.000) count, and CD38 (P=.001) and CD5 (P=.006) levels. IL-10 was significantly correlated with B(2)M (P=.017), CD19 (P=.000), platelet (P=.002), and CD27 (P=.000). In survival distributions for CD27, IL-8 and IL-10 were found to have more significant relationships for all parameters (P=.0000). In conclusion, the authors suggest that sCD27, IL-8, and IL-10 are more significant prognostic factors for B-CLL when compared with others, and these values should correlate with new prognostic factors (eg, zeta-associated protein-70, mutated/unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy chain).","['Kara, Ismail Oguz', 'Sahin, Berksoy', 'Gunesacar, Ramazan']","['Kara IO', 'Sahin B', 'Gunesacar R']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine, Adana, Turkey. iokara@cu.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Ther,Advances in therapy,8611864,"['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*blood', 'Interleukin-8/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/*blood']",2007/05/29 09:00,2007/06/23 09:00,['2007/05/29 09:00'],"['2007/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Ther. 2007 Jan-Feb;24(1):29-40. doi: 10.1007/BF02849990.,,,,"['577 [pii]', '10.1007/BF02849990 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with early-stage LPHL who underwent successful surgical lymph node resection alone have been reported. To clarify the optimum treatment strategy in children, European study groups were asked to report their experience of surgery alone used in the treatment of pediatric LPHL. METHODS: Data from 58 patients were collected by the French Society for Pediatric Cancers, the German-Austrian Pediatric Study Group/German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology (Germany), and the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (United Kingdom). In total, there were 50 boys and 8 girls, and the median age was 11 years (age range, 4-17 years). Fifty-four patients had stage IA disease, 2 patients had stage IIA disease, and 2 patients had stage IIIA disease. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 43 months (range, 2-202 months), the overall survival rate was 100%, and the progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 57%. Fifty-one of 58 patients achieved complete remission (CR) after surgery. In the CR group, the overall PFS rate was 67% (95% confidence interval, 51-82%). All seven patients who had residual disease after initial surgery developed recurrences (P = .003). Among 18 patients with stage IA LPHL who developed recurrent disease, 11 patients had local recurrences, and 7 patients recurred in stage IIA. One patient with stage IIIA disease presented with high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma at 10 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: When complete resection was achieved, a substantial proportion of patients with surgically treated, early-stage LPHL experienced long-term remission and actually may have been cured.","['Mauz-Korholz, Christine', 'Gorde-Grosjean, Stephanie', 'Hasenclever, Dirk', 'Shankar, Ananth', 'Dorffel, Wolfgang', 'Wallace, W Hamish', 'Schellong, Gunther', 'Robert, Alain', 'Korholz, Dieter', 'Oberlin, Odile', 'Hall, Georgina W', 'Landman-Parker, Judith']","['Mauz-Korholz C', 'Gorde-Grosjean S', 'Hasenclever D', 'Shankar A', 'Dorffel W', 'Wallace WH', 'Schellong G', 'Robert A', 'Korholz D', 'Oberlin O', 'Hall GW', 'Landman-Parker J']","['University Clinical and Health Center for Child and Youth Medicine, Halle-Wittenberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/*pathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology/surgery', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2007/05/26 09:00,2007/08/31 09:00,['2007/05/26 09:00'],"['2007/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Jul 1;110(1):179-85. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22762.,,,,['10.1002/cncr.22762 [doi]'],,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2007 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,

At present there are approximately 20 active protocols, some specifying radio-oncological study questions, in which about 500 to 600 children annually are given radiotherapy. MATERIALS/METHODS: The Pediatric Radiation Oncology Working Group (APRO) of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) represents the organizational link between GPOH and DEGRO. Their activities range from phrasing guidelines of radio-oncological therapy, through writing a protocol for a prospective study on radiation-induced late effects (RISK--in co-operation with GPOH, 695 patients registered so far) and organizing meetings for information transfer, to implementing radio-oncology within the prospective studies of the GPOH by establishing study chairs for radio-oncology when radio-oncological questions are a primary focus and/or to function as a reference institution for quality assurance. These activities also include individual case consultations outside the study proper. Twice annually the members of the APRO meet for an update on current knowledge and future directions where a representative of the GPOH is invited to contribute special aspects of pediatric oncology. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, modern technology (intensity modulated radiotherapy, proton therapy, inclusion of imaging in treatment planning) will be part of disease management in pediatric oncology. A working group for modern radiotherapy technology was established to enhance this development. Prospective studies of the GPOH with primary or secondary radio-oncological questions require the implementation of corresponding tasks (documentation, monitoring, etc.) in order to meet future demands on clinical trials and to achieve the aims of the protocol. Consequently adequate financial support is indispensable.","['Kortmann, R-D', 'Bongartz, R', 'Dieckmann, K', 'Dunst, J', 'Flentje, M', 'Gademann, G', 'Christiansen, H', 'Kamprad, F H', 'Karstens, J H', 'Pape, H', 'Ruhl, U', 'Schmidt, B F', 'Willich, N', 'Schulz-Ertner, D', 'Schwarz, R', 'Timmermann, B', 'Pohl, F', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Jurgens, H', 'Rube, C']","['Kortmann RD', 'Bongartz R', 'Dieckmann K', 'Dunst J', 'Flentje M', 'Gademann G', 'Christiansen H', 'Kamprad FH', 'Karstens JH', 'Pape H', 'Ruhl U', 'Schmidt BF', 'Willich N', 'Schulz-Ertner D', 'Schwarz R', 'Timmermann B', 'Pohl F', 'Klingebiel T', 'Jurgens H', 'Rube C']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Strahlentherapie und Radioonkologie, Universitat Leipzig, Stephanstrasse 9A, 04103 Leipzig.

Thus, disease related as well as age related variables have to be taken into account. This paper evaluates the physical long term effects of childhood cancer survivors. In addition differences of QoL of the survivors in comparison to children and adolescents of the same age are estimated if present and correlated to somatic late effects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 36 survivors of childhood cancer who are followed at the University Children's Hospital Duesseldorf, with an age range of 8-18 years participate in the evaluation. Together with a clinical examination somatic long term effects and sociodemographic information are documented. QoL is evaluated with a standardized questionnaire (PEDQOL) including the domains physical function, emotion, cognition, autonomy, social function (family, friends and body image). Quality of Life data are compared with data of 319 unselected healthy controls of comparable age groups. RESULTS: 24 of 36 patients show various LF: skeletal deformities, scars, impairment of organ function, infectious complication, hormonal failures. Patients with solid tumors develop more and more frequently severe LF (11/14 pat.) compared to patients with leukaemia and lymphoma (11/22 pat.). Nevertheless health status can be objectively rated as satisfying in comparison to children of the same age. Most patients rate the QoL better than their controls. Patients with severe LF show impairment in the domains body image, emotional and physical functioning and cognition compared to patients without or with minor somatic LF. CONCLUSION: Our results underline the influence of objective long term effects and subjective QoL on the Quality of Survival. Prospective evaluation will lead to new and important information with respect to the onset of somatic and psychosocial LF and possible coping strategies. These information will establish additional possibilities for initiation of primary and secondary rehabilitation processes.","['Calaminus, G', 'Weinspach, S', 'Teske, C', 'Gobel, U']","['Calaminus G', 'Weinspach S', 'Teske C', 'Gobel U']","[""Clinic for Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Children's Hospital, Universitatsklinikum Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University, Moorenstrasse 5, 40225 Dusseldorf. calaminus@med.uni-duesseldorf.de""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living/psychology', 'Adolescent', 'Affective Symptoms/psychology', 'Body Image', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders/psychology', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Social Adjustment', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2007/05/26 09:00,2007/09/13 09:00,['2007/05/26 09:00'],"['2007/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2007 May-Jun;219(3):152-7. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-973846.,,,,['10.1055/s-2007-973846 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study is to characterise the spectrum of these lesions with focus on the feasibility and effectiveness of testis sparing surgery. Twenty-four boys treated between 1980 and 2004 at the University Leipzig Medical Centre were evaluated. At presentation patients were between 5 months and 18 years old (median 23 months). Generally a high rate of malignant or potentially malignant tumours was observed. The majority of these tumours occurred in the first three years of age. The spectrum of testicular tumours comprised 13 germ cell tumours (6 yolk sac tumours, 6 teratomas, 1 embryonal carcinoma) and 4 sex cord stromal tumours (2 Leydig's cell, Sertoli's cell, granulosa cell). Both Leydig's cell tumours were endocrine active. Further on, we observed 3 boys with paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and three with testicular and paratesticular metastases (Wilms' tumour, neuroblastoma, leukaemia). Serum alpha1-fetoprotein (AFP) was clearly elevated in 5 of 6 yolk sac tumours but remained within normal limits concerning the other entities. Human chorionic gonadotrophin was normal in all cases tested. During the observation period high inguinal orchidectomy was the surgical standard method. Dependent on tumour histology, stage and the recommended treatment schedule postoperative chemotherapy was added. Testis sparing surgery was performed in 3 boys with primary testicular tumours (2 Leydig's cell, mature cystic teratoma). Local relapses were not observed. Systemic relapses occurred in 3 cases (2 RMS, leukaemia). During a median follow up of 5 years all patients with primary testicular tumours survived event free. Meta-analysis of the recent literature revealed that testis sparing surgery is feasible and save in prepubertal boys after exclusion of a malignant tumour. If a testis sparing approach is planned, the following criteria are essential: 1. The presence of a well defined circumscribed nodule confirmed by imaging. 2. Normal levels of serum AFP and hCG. 3. The presence of sufficient healthy testicular parenchyma. However, the high rate of malignant or potentially malignant tumours suggests that high inguinal orchidectomy should remain the surgical standard of therapy.","['Trobs, R-B', 'Krauss, M', 'Geyer, C', 'Tannapfel, A', 'Korholz, D', 'Hirsch, W']","['Trobs RB', 'Krauss M', 'Geyer C', 'Tannapfel A', 'Korholz D', 'Hirsch W']","['Kinderchirurgische Klinik, Marienhospital Herne, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum, Widumer Strasse 8, 44627 Herne. ralf-bodo.troebs@marienhospital-herne.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta Subunit, Human)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta Subunit, Human/blood', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulosa Cell Tumor/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leydig Cell Tumor/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Orchiectomy/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sertoli Cell Tumor/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Testicular Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/metabolism']",2007/05/26 09:00,2007/09/13 09:00,['2007/05/26 09:00'],"['2007/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2007 May-Jun;219(3):146-51. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-973847.,,,,['10.1055/s-2007-973847 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore the German Group of Pediatric Radiation Oncology (APRO) established the ""RegIster for the evaluation of late Side effects after radiation in childhood and adolescence"" (RiSK). After a pilot phase starting in 2001 documentation has been performed all over Germany since 2004. This analysis shows the first results of ""RiSK"". PATIENTS AND METHODS: Radiation parameters including detailed organ doses as well as toxicity evaluations were collected prospectively from centers all over Germany in the study center. Standardized documentation forms were used. Documentation is planned for all children who receive radiotherapy in one of the German pediatric therapy trials. RESULTS: Until December 31st 2006, 696 documentations of radiotherapy and 526 acute as well as 836 late follow-up documentation forms have been collected. Altogether, 41 patients with late grade 3 and 16 patients with late grade 4-side effects were identified. Side effects mainly concerned joints with functional impairment (after combined radiotherapy and surgery), the bowel, skin and subcutis as well as blood parameters under continued chemotherapy. Patients with late side effects of a higher grade were mainly treated for Ewing's or soft tissue sarcomas (n=235 patients), representing 33.8% of all patients in this study. CONCLUSION: Fortunately, up to now only a few late grade 3 or 4 side effects of radiotherapy are shown for almost 700 documented patients.

Prolonged infusions of anthracyclines are less cardiotoxic but it has not been investigated whether the in vivo leukemic cell kill is equivalent to short-term infusions. PROCEDURE: In the cooperative treatment study COALL-92 for childhood ALL 178 patients were randomized to receive in a therapeutic window a single dose of 36 mg/m (2) DNR either as a 1-h (85 patients) or 24-h infusion (93 patients). Daily measurements of white blood cell count (WBC) and peripheral blood smears for seven days could be evaluated centrally in 101 patients (1-h: 43 patients, 24-h: 58 patients). RESULTS: The proportional decline of blasts at day 7 after DNR infusion showed no statistically significant difference between the two treatment arms. At day 3 the median percentage of blasts was less than 10%, at day 7 less than 2% for either the 1-h or 24-h infusion. Twelve patients (1-h: 5 patients, 24-h: 7 patients) had an absolute number of more than 1000 blasts per mul peripheral blood (PB) at day 7 after DNR infusion (DNR poor responders).

Alternative splicing results in four different mRNA variants survivin, survivin2B, survivin-DeltaExon3 and survivin-3B, with distinct cellular localization patterns and anti-apoptotic potential. Due to co-localization of survivin and survivin-2B in the cytoplasm survivin-2B may permit interactive fine-tuning of survivin actions and moreover play an attenuating role in its anti-apoptotic function. Lack of survivin-2B is associated with disease progression of malignomas suggesting a differential role of these isoforms in tumorigenesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We therefore determined the expression of the functional survivin splice variants performing RT- and real-time PCR in a purely pediatric cohort of 20 patients suffering from precursor B-ALL (BCP-ALL). RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate for the first time in pediatric patients with precursor B-ALL an association between lower survivin-2B expression and affiliation to the high risk group. CONCLUSION: The idea that survivin-2B may act as natural antagonist of survivin could potentially be used in novel approaches of anti-cancer treatment by influencing the proportional expression of the different splice variants.","['Troger, A', 'Siepermann, M', 'Mahotka, C', 'Wethkamp, N', 'Bulle, H', 'Laws, H-J', 'Escherich, G', 'Janka-Schaub, G', 'Gobel, U', 'Dilloo, D']","['Troger A', 'Siepermann M', 'Mahotka C', 'Wethkamp N', 'Bulle H', 'Laws HJ', 'Escherich G', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Gobel U', 'Dilloo D']","['Clinic for Pediatric-Oncology, -Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, 40225 Dusseldorf. troeger@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)', '41806-51-3 (W10294A)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Coumarins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivin']",2007/05/26 09:00,2007/09/13 09:00,['2007/05/26 09:00'],"['2007/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2007 May-Jun;219(3):127-33. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-973850.,,,,['10.1055/s-2007-973850 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The commonest thrombotic complication is venous thromboembolism (VTE). Other thrombotic conditions occur in association with specific disorders, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and disseminated intravascular coagulation in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Clinical trials show that unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are efficacious for VTE prophylaxis in cancer patients after major surgery or when hospitalized for acute medical illnesses. These findings in cancer patients are probably applicable to patients with hematologic malignancies, in whom there are very few studies. However, the effectiveness of anticoagulant VTE prophylaxis is not established in ambulatory patients with cancer except for multiple myeloma patients treated with thalidomide and chemotherapy. LMWH is widely used as initial treatment for VTE because it enables home therapy without laboratory monitoring, thereby improving the patient's quality of life. UFH is preferred in patients with high bleeding risks and renal impairment. In cancer patients, vitamin K antagonists for the long-term treatment of VTE are increasingly replaced by LMWH, which show superior efficacy.

However, so far there are very little data describing the epidemiology of TE in children with cancer. Most of the available information in this area originates mainly from retrospective and some prospective observational cohort studies conducted in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although ALL has been the most common cancer reported in association with thrombosis in children, available data from small studies indicate that TE is equally common in children with acute myeloid leukemia and lymphoma. TE in association with leukemia and lymphoma seems to be a multifactorial entity. Potential risk factors include increased thrombin generation related to leukemia, age of the patients, use of CVL, chemotherapy including asparaginase and corticosteroids, infections, and inherited prothrombotic state. Management of TE in a child with cancer presents a unique challenge in terms of balancing risk versus benefit. Conservative therapy could lead to clot extension and risks of additional morbidity or mortality; however, chemotherapy-related thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy increase the risk of bleeding complications. In summary, TE is a frequent and serious complication in children with hematologic malignancies.

Early mortality most often is due to a severe and often catastrophic bleeding, often intracerebral in location, and remains a major cause of treatment failure. Thrombosis, either at diagnosis or during the course of treatment, may be unrecognized and reflects the complexity of the coagulopathy. The dual phenomenon of bleeding and thrombosis is attributable to at least three processes: disseminated intravascular coagulation; fibrinolysis (generated in part by expression of annexin-II on the APL cell surface); and direct proteolysis of several proteins including fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor.

Here, we show that Bim-/- fibroblasts and epithelial cells exhibit reduced cell death following serum withdrawal in comparison with their wild-type counterparts. In viable cells, Bax associates with Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1. Upon serum withdrawal, newly expressed Bim(EL) associates with Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, coinciding with the dissociation of Bax from these proteins. Survival factors can prevent association of Bim with pro-survival proteins by preventing Bim expression. However, we now show that even preformed Bim(EL)/Mcl-1 and Bim(EL)/Bcl-x(L) complexes can be rapidly dissociated following activation of ERK1/2 by survival factors. The dissociation of Bim from Mcl-1 is specific for Bim(EL) and requires ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of Bim(EL) at Ser(65). Finally, ERK1/2-dependent dissociation of Bim(EL) from Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) may play a role in regulating Bim(EL) degradation, since mutations in the Bim(EL) BH3 domain that disrupt binding to Mcl-1 cause increased turnover of Bim(EL). These results provide new insights into the role of Bim in cell death and its regulation by the ERK1/2 survival pathway.","['Ewings, Katherine E', 'Hadfield-Moorhouse, Kathryn', 'Wiggins, Ceri M', 'Wickenden, Julie A', 'Balmanno, Kathryn', 'Gilley, Rebecca', 'Degenhardt, Kurt', 'White, Eileen', 'Cook, Simon J']","['Ewings KE', 'Hadfield-Moorhouse K', 'Wiggins CM', 'Wickenden JA', 'Balmanno K', 'Gilley R', 'Degenhardt K', 'White E', 'Cook SJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Signalling, The Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",2007/05/26 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2007/05/26 09:00'],"['2006/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2007 Jun 20;26(12):2856-67. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7601723.

One of the theoretical advantages of RIC-SCT is that it might lend to better immune reconstitution after transplantation due to less damage of the thymus, allowing regeneration of naive T cells derived from prethymic donor stem cells, and due to the proliferation of immunologically competent host T cells that survive the conditioning regimen. Although limited, studies comparing immune recovery following RIC and MAC-SCT have been insightful. One of the main difficulties of these studies is the current spectrum of RIC protocols, which vary considerably in myeloablative and immunosuppressive potential, resulting in apparently contradictory findings. In spite of this, most reports have shown significant quantitative and/or qualitative differences in T- and B-cell reconstitution after RIC-SCT in comparison with conventional SCT. This paper will review current knowledge of immune reconstitution following RIC-SCT.","['Jimenez, M', 'Ercilla, G', 'Martinez, C']","['Jimenez M', 'Ercilla G', 'Martinez C']","[""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer, IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. 33149mjh@comb.es""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2007/05/26 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/05/26 09:00'],"['2007/05/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Aug;21(8):1628-37. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404681.
