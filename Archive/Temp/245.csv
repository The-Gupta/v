Deaths among active Union members that were reported by locals in Texas between 1947 and 1977 were identified through membership records, and proportionate mortality was analyzed in several broad industrial categories. PMRs for cancers of the liver and biliary passages, pancreas, lung and skin were elevated among refinery and petrochemical plant workers; however, risks did not increase with length of membership. Increased relative frequencies of stomach cancer, cancer of the brain, leukemia and multiple myeloma were confined to white males in the same category who had been Union members for 10 or more years. Excess deaths from stomach cancer and brain cancer were found among white male members employed at one specific oil refinery and petrochemical plant. Observed numbers of deaths from cancer of the stomach were greater than expected among whites and nonwhites, and an elevated PMR for lung cancer among nonwhites was found at an additional plant. Findings suggest that workers in this industry may be at increased risk of certain cancers and indicate areas for further investigation.","['Thomas, T L', 'Decoufle, P', 'Moure-Eraso, R']","['Thomas TL', 'Decoufle P', 'Moure-Eraso R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Occup Med,Journal of occupational medicine. : official publication of the Industrial Medical Association,7502807,['0 (Petroleum)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Chemical Industry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mortality', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', '*Occupations', '*Petroleum', 'Texas']",1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043764-198002000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,J Occup Med. 1980 Feb;22(2):97-103. doi: 10.1097/00043764-198002000-00007.,,,,,,,,,

All known predispositions to invasive aspergillosis, e.g., presence of cancer or granulocytopenia, and therapy with corticosteroids, antibiotics, and cytotoxic drugs, were significantly associated with proven or probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Most notable were patients with acute leukemia and granulocytopenia. Prolonged duration of hospitalization between initial isolation (greater than 2 weeks) and multiple isolates (greater than three isolates) were also significantly associated with a high frequency of proven or probable disease. Isolation of A. niger was only rarely associated with proven or probable disease (one of eight patients). The isolation of A. fumigatus and A. flavus from respiratory secretions does not usually represent laboratory contamination and must be interpreted in the light of known predispositions to aspergillosis. In some situations, e.g., granulocytopenic patients with acute leukemia, even a single isolation carries a high likelihood of invasive aspergillosis.","['Nalesnik, M A', 'Myerowitz, R L', 'Jenkins, R', 'Lenkey, J', 'Herbert, D']","['Nalesnik MA', 'Myerowitz RL', 'Jenkins R', 'Lenkey J', 'Herbert D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/complications', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/complications/*diagnosis', 'Aspergillus/*isolation & purification', 'Bronchi/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Respiratory System/*microbiology', 'Sputum/*microbiology', 'Trachea/metabolism']",1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jcm.11.4.370-376.1980 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1980 Apr;11(4):370-6. doi: 10.1128/jcm.11.4.370-376.1980.,PMC273406,,,,,,,,

The rate of methotrexate transport was reduced 50% by pretreatment of cells with activated methotrexate at a concentration of 1 microM and by 98% upon exposure to an excess (40 microM) of this agent. Specificity was demonstrated by the fact that activated methotrexate had no effect on other transport systems (i.e. leucine and phosphate) and that complete protection against inactivation was afforded by either the unlabeled substrate (methotrexate) or a competitive inhibitor (phosphate). The carbodiimide-generated derivatives of aminopterin, folate, and p-aminobenzoylglutamate were also irreversible inhibitors of methotrexate transport, and their relative effectiveness paralleled the ability of the parent compounds (aminopterin greater than methotrexate greater than folate greater than p-aminobenzoylglutamate) to act as reversible transport inhibitors. Measurements at 4 degrees C showed that activated methotrexate (Ki = 0.8 microM) was a competitive inhibitor for binding of methotrexate (KD = 0.4 microM) to the transport protein. Treatment of the cells with sufficient activated methotrexate to inhibit transport increased the KD for methotrexate to 0.9 microM but had no effect on total methotrexate-binding activity. Methotrexate efflux was also reduced but was not blocked by an excess of this reagent.","['Henderson, G B', 'Zevely, E M', 'Huennekens, F M']","['Henderson GB', 'Zevely EM', 'Huennekens FM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['538-75-0 (Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide)', 'RJ5OZG6I4A (Ethyldimethylaminopropyl Carbodiimide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/*pharmacology', 'Ethyldimethylaminopropyl Carbodiimide/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice']",1980/05/25 00:00,1980/05/25 00:01,['1980/05/25 00:00'],"['1980/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)85572-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1980 May 25;255(10):4829-33.,,,,,,,,,

The cell cycle distribution of a population treated continuously with 10(-5) M TG was compared to that of control cells using flow cytometric analysis. The TG-treated cells had an increase in the fraction of the population in G2-M, a decrease in G1, and a constant level in S phase. However, the [methyl-3H]thymidine-labeling index decreased dramatically during TG treatment. Thus, it appeared that some cells were arrested in S phase and that G1 cells did not enter S phase, due to failure to synthesize DNA. To examine the importance of the G2 and S cell progression blocks, cells were exposed to a lethal treatment of 10(-5) M TG for 12 hr and returned to normal medium. Under these conditions, the fraction of the population in both S and G1 decreased, and nearly one-half of the cells accumulated in G2 by 60 hr after TG addition, compared to a G2 fraction of less than one-tenth for the control cells. These results showed that the delayed cytotoxic effect of TG was associated with a cell progression block in the second G2 phase after TG addition, whereas the retention of cells in S phase appeared to be due to readily reversible secondary effects of TG.","['Wotring, L L', 'Roti Roti, J L']","['Wotring LL', 'Roti Roti JL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Interphase/*drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology']",1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 May;40(5):1458-62.,,,,,,,,,

Rats immunized by 2 s.c. injections of soluble antigen or soluble antigen mixed with empty liposomes and emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) failed to produce significant levels of cytotoxic antibodies to GCSAa. On the other hand, rats similarly immunized by negatively charged liposomes containing NP40-solubilized GCSAa, and emulsified in CFA, developed high and persistent levels of cytotoxic antibodies, and their response could even mimic that induced by viable (C58NT)D cells. A similar response could also be obtained in rats immunized with liposome-associated NP40-solubilized GCSAa, but without CFA. Rats immunized by comparable amounts of liposome-assocated 3M KCl-extracted GCSAa developed only low levels of cytotoxic antibodies, and their response was of shorter duration. These results strongly suggest that inclusion into liposomes of a solubilized proteic tumour-associated cell-surface antigen can provide an immunogen as potent as viable tumour cells in inducing an antibody response, and that the solubilization method may be critical.","['Gerlier, D', 'Sakai, F', 'Dore, J F']","['Gerlier D', 'Sakai F', 'Dore JF']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Liposomes)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Animals', '*Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Liposomes/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Rats']",1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1980.35 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1980 Feb;41(2):236-42. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1980.35.,PMC2010207,,,,,,,,

Analysis of disrupted sensitized liposomes showed that the GCSAa-specific activity of the liposome-associated proteins was quite similar to that of the proteins of the sensitizing cellular extract. Ultracentrifugation of disrupted liposomes showed that about 75% of the liposome-associated GCSAa activity was firmly associated with lipids and that little GCSAa was trapped within aqueous compartments between lipidic lamellae. 1.8--8.0% of the liposome-associated GCSAa was expressed at the liposome surface.

Certain results obtained with canavanine have suggested that it may have other effects. Therefore, we examined the effects of canavanine on the cell-free synthesis of murine retrovirus proteins. It was found that the electrophoretic mobility of the major gag-related cell-free product of both Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) and Moloney murine sarcoma virus 124 (Mo-MuSV-124) RNA was dependent on the concentration of canavanine used during translation. As the canavanine concentration was increased up to 4 mM, the apparent size of the major gag-related polypeptide also increased from 65,000 (R-MuLV RNA) or 63,000 (Mo-MuSV-124 RNA) to approximately 80,000 daltons. Additional increases in the canavanine concentration up to 12 mM did not increase the size of the gag gene product beyond 80,000 daltons. This change in electrophoretic mobility appeared to be due to a substitution of canavanine for arginine residues in the polypeptides, not to a change in their actual size. If amber suppressor tRNA and canavanine were used together during translation of Mo-MuSV-124 RNA and Mo-MuLV RNA, the results were also in agreement with this proposal. Translation experiments done with ovalbumin mRNA and mengovirus 35S RNA indicated that canavanine incorporation caused a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of ovalbumin from 43,000 to 45,000 daltons and caused the appearance of two slightly larger polypeptides in the 155,000- and 115,000- dalton regions of the mengovirus RNA cell-free product.","['Murphy, E C Jr', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Murphy EC Jr', 'Arlinghaus RB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '3HZV514J4B (Canavanine)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Canavanine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Peptide Biosynthesis', 'Peptide Chain Termination, Translational/drug effects', 'RNA, Transfer/pharmacology', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Rauscher Virus/*metabolism', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis']",1980/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1980/03/01 00:00'],"['1980/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1980/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.33.3.954-961.1980 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1980 Mar;33(3):954-61. doi: 10.1128/JVI.33.3.954-961.1980.,PMC288628,,,,,,,,

In the patients who had normal cerebrospinal (CSF) flow, majority of the radioactivity injected moved to cisterna magna and basal cistern at 4 hours after injection and to subarachnoid space of the cortical surface at 24 hours. Two cases of ventricular catheter occlusion were diagnosed by this method. Two cases of catheter tip misplacement were suspected with computed tomography and confirmed with radioisotope ventriculography. One of the misplacement cases developed focal leukoencephalopathy possibly due to high concentration of methotrexate (MTX) in the brain adjacent to the ventricular cathter. Two cases showed delayed CSF circulation, and the doses of MTX were decreased to be half of the ordinary dose (12 mg/M2 once a week) during initial phase of the treatment. The dose was increased after successful treatment of meningeal dissemination and restoration of the normal CSF flow.

With EMS as mutagen the frequency of ara-C-resistant variants was much lower than that obtained using other selective agents, whereas it was higher with the mutagens acetylaminofluorene and ethidium bromide. Out of 42 resistant clones examined, 38 showed normal sensitivity to thymidine and were destignated as Class 1, the remaining four (Class 2) were usually resistant to thymidine. Cells in Class 1 did not accumulate detectable amounts of ara-C and had negligible deoxycytidine kinase activity. They were about 3000-fold more resistant to the toxic effects of ara-C than were wild-type cells. Cells in Class 2 had a reduced ability to accumulate are-C and had 50% of the deoxycytidine kinase activity of wild-type cells. They were only 20 times more resistant to ara-c than were wild-type cells.

Tissue culture is completely eliminated and replaced with a truly direct method of chromosome preparation in which a small amount of marrow is treated with a solution containing trypsin, hypotonic salts and colcemid (THC). The THC protocol, when compared with standard short term culture methods for marrow chromosome preparation, produces more extended and more readily banded chromosomes. Rapid banding is further facilitated by replacement of standard G-banding technique with Wright's staining. The technical developments allow karyotypic analysis within 2-4 h after receipt of the specimen. The high quality and rapidity of the THC protocol have important implications for the clinical usefulness of cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow in studying congenital defects as well as leukemias and lymphomas.","['Hozier, J C', 'Lindquist, L L']","['Hozier JC', 'Lindquist LL']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,"['0 (Hypotonic Solutions)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosome Aberrations/diagnosis', 'Chromosome Banding/*methods', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human/drug effects', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Culture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Hypotonic Solutions', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Trypsin/pharmacology']",1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00273497 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Genet. 1980 Feb;53(2):205-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00273497.,,,,,,,,,

Adult mice belonging to five inbred strains of genotype Fv-2rr, two inbred strains and three congenic strains of genotype Fv-2ss, two kinds of F1 hybrid of genotype Fv-2rs, and appropriate controls were given high specific activity 3H--thymidine intravenously for 1 hr and their bone marrow and spleen cells were assayed for surviving BFU-E at 7 days and CFU-E at 2 days in plasma culture. A high proportion of BFU-E in all Fv-2ss and Fv-2rs mice were killed, but all or nearly all of the BFU-E in Fv-2rr mice survived exposure to 3H--thymidine. The allelic difference of Fv-2 had no significant effect on the proportion of other progenitor or stem cells (CFU-E, CFU-C or CFU-S) normally undergoing DNA synthesis in the hemopoietic tissues, or on the hemoglobin concentration, red blood cells, hematocrit, total of differential white blood cell counts in the peripheral blood of these animals. While a few or no BFU-E were killed by 3H--thymidine in adult B6 (Fv-2rr) mice, a high proportion of BFU-E were killed by 3H--thymidine in these animals when they were less than 7 weeks old. Bleeding of adult B6 mice or lethal irradiation followed by repopulation by syngeneic bone marrow cells rendered a high proportion of their BFU-E vulnerable to 3H--thymidine. BFU-E of adult B6 mice which in vivo were unaffected by 3H--thymidine were rapidly killed when exposed to 3H--thymidine in vitro.

Using short-term tissue culture techniques, MTX concentrations of 0.2 microM, and MW exposure times of 20 min, we have found that continuous-wave low-power-density MW irradiation enhances the uptake of [3H]MTX as compared to nonirradiated controls. The enhancement is observed in only a small range of power densities (5 to 25 milliwatts/sq cm) and is in an inverted-U-shaped relationship. MW irradiation alone has an inhibitory effect on the [3H]deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA. Compared to cell suspensions treated with MTX alone, groups treated with MW irradiation followed by MTX exhibit an augmentation of inhibition of DNA synthesis as measured by [3H]deoxyuridine incorporation. Combined treatment of L1210-bearing mice with MW irradiation and MTX in vivo prolonged the duration of survival over that of animals treated with MTX alone, indicating a greater killing of leukemia cells. These results suggest that the therapeutic index of MTX may be improved by the use of MW irradiation at low power densities.","['Chang, B K', 'Huang, A T', 'Joines, W T']","['Chang BK', 'Huang AT', 'Joines WT']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active/radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Methotrexate/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Microwaves/*therapeutic use']",1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Apr;40(4):1002-5.,,,,,,,,,

L1210 cells injured by CM were separated from macrophages and studied in an isolated system. CM-injured L1210 cells had an absolute requirement for glucose or another glycolyzable hexose (mannose or fructose) for at least 40 h after removal from macrophages. If the culture medium lacked sufficient concentration of one of these sugars, CM-injured L1210 cells died within 4 h. Uninjured L1210 cells cultured alone or with peptone-stimulated macrophages had no such requirement and maintained complete viability in hexoseless medium. The hexose requirement of CM-injured L1210 cells could not be fulfilled by other naturally occurring monosaccharides, glucose or mannose derivatives, or substrates that can be oxidized by mitochondria. The concentration requirements for glucose, mannose, and fructose by CM-injured L1210 cells correlated with the concentrations required to support maximal glycolysis of these sugars by other murine ascites cells. A concentration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose which completely inhibited L1210 cell glycolysis also complete prevented the ability of glucose or mannose to maintain viability of CM-injured L1210 cells. Interaction with CM led to inhibition of L1210 cell mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This was supported by the findings that: (a) CM-injured L1210 cells had no Pasteur effect; their rate of aerobic glycolysis was the same as the rate of anaerobic glycolysis of uninjured L1210 cells, (b) Endogenous respiration of CM-injured L1210 cells was 15% of normal. Maximal inhibition of uninjured L1210 cell respiration by a specific mitochondrial poison (oligomycin) was nearly the same (13% of normal). It followed that CM-injured L1210 cells required hexose for chemical energy production via the glycolytic pathway.

The antiserum precipitates a single Mr = 60,000 polypeptide (TdT-60) from all cell lines and tissues that contain enzymologically demonstrable terminal transferase. This polypeptide is not precipitated from labeled extracts of cells that lack terminal transferase by enzymological criteria. TdT-60 fractionates with terminal transferase during phosphocellulose chromatography and sediments with it in a sucrose gradient. TdT-60 is not detectably processed to lower molecular weight polypeptides, and terminal transferase activity sediments as a Mr = 60,000 activity; thus, we believe it to be the active form of terminal transferase. Using this assay we have demonstrated that terminal transferase is synthesized in both the murine thymus and the bone marrow at a rate proportional to its biochemically measured steady state level. After cortisone treatment of mice, the Mr = 60,000 polypeptide disappears from the thymus and then reappears as the thymus begins to be repopulated.","['Silverstone, A', 'Sun, L', 'Witte, O N', 'Baltimore, D']","['Silverstone A', 'Sun L', 'Witte ON', 'Baltimore D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Immune Sera)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'V27W9254FZ (Cortisone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cortisone/pharmacology', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*biosynthesis', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoassay', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight', 'Thymus Gland/drug effects/*enzymology']",1980/01/25 00:00,1980/01/25 00:01,['1980/01/25 00:00'],"['1980/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)86249-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1980 Jan 25;255(2):791-6.,,,,,,,,,

To account for this phenomenon, we have proposed that the extent of aminoacylation of a given tRNA species in vivo controls the relative rate of synthesis or degradation of that species. Previously, we reported the Friend leukemia cells respond to deprivation of histidine, leucine, or tryptophan by specifically increasing the relative concentration of tRNAs cognate to the deprived amino acid (Weiser, K., and Litt, M. (1979) Eur. J. Biochem. 93, 295-300). In this paper, we show that this is also true for phenylalanine and we report studies of the relative rates of synthesis and degradation of tRNAPhe in phenylalanine-deprived and control cells. We find that deprivation of phenylalanine has no effect on the relative rate of synthesis of tRNAPhe, but does induce a decline in the relative rate of degradation of tRNAPhe which accounts quantitatively for the increase in its relative steady state concentration as measured by in vitro aminoacylation. We conclude that, in Friend leukemia cells, deacylated tRNA species are more stable than charged tRNA species.","['Litt, M', 'Howell-Litt, R']","['Litt M', 'Howell-Litt R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Histidine/metabolism', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer/*metabolism', 'Tryptophan/metabolism', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1980/01/25 00:00,1980/01/25 00:01,['1980/01/25 00:00'],"['1980/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)86182-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1980 Jan 25;255(2):375-8.,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the mechanism of the runting syndrome, rats were made doubly tolerant by neonatal injections of a mixture of FV and GV. The adoptive transfer of lymphoid cells from rats immunized with the FV-induced lymphomas into the doubly tolerant rats produced the runting syndrome. On the other hand, adoptive transfer of lymphoid cells from rats immunized with GV lymphomas into the doubly tolerant rats did not produce the runting syndrome and broke down the GV-induced tolerance but not the FV-induced tolerance. By the use of a complement-dependent cytotoxicity test, FV-infected cells were homogeneously detected in thymus, spleen, and bone marrow of the doubly tolerant rats, whereas GV-infected cells were detected only in the thymus. Studies with a rosette formation test as a rat thymus marker showed that none of the FV lymphomas formed rosettes with guinea pig erythrocytes, whereas GV lymphomas formed rosettes.

Cell surface changes therefore appear to be related to long-term effects of fluorouracil associated with impaired synthesis of membrane glycoprotein.","['Kessel, D']",['Kessel D'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis']",1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Feb;40(2):322-4.,,,,,,,,,

In this study, mesoporphyrin transport and the cellular environment of accumulated drug were examined. The latter was characterized by measurements of absorbance and fluorescence spectra and of effects of irradiation on subsequent capacity of cells for transport of the nonmetabolized amino acid cycloleucine. We observed a rapid accumulation of drug at a relatively hydrophilic cellular environment (dielectric constant, 20) from which light-catalyzed inhibition of cycloleucine transport was clearly demonstrable. Washing at 37 degrees rapidly depleted this cellular region of drug. Longer incubations resulted in accumulation of porphyrin at more hydrophobic locci (dielectric constant, approximately 10) from which the drug was not readily washed and from which the efficiency of light-catalyzed damage to membrane transport was relatively low.

Ultrastructure and distribution.,236-47,"Of 19 patients with hairy cell leukemia, an unusual lymphoproliferative disease, nine were found by transmission electrom microscopy to have a cytoplasmic inclusion known as the ribosome-lamellae complex (RLC). The RLC appears to be a cylinder 2.2 to 4.1 micron. in length. The internal diameter appears to be relatively constant at 0.42 micron. The outer diameter, which depends on the number of lamellae as well as on the contents of the intralamellar space, ranges from 0.52 micron to 1.27 micron. The RLC can be comprised of a single lamellae spiraled around the central core, but also RLCs with both two and three lamellae can be defined. The lamellae are composed of double tubule structures 125 A in width set in parallel arrays 125 A apart. A second array of parrallel tubules intersect at a 60 degree-angle creating a lattice. THe distance between the spiraled lamellae is dependent upon the presence or absence of ribosome-like particles. When these particles are present, the distance is usually 406 A, but when they are absent the distance is 172 A. Although experiments with certain fixatives suggest the lamellae may be primarily composed of protein rather than lipid, the exact nature of the RLC and its importance to the leukemic process remain to be determined.","['Rosner, M C', 'Golomb, H M']","['Rosner MC', 'Golomb HM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,,IM,"['Cytoplasmic Granules/pathology/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood', 'Ribosomes/pathology/*ultrastructure']",1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1980 Feb;42(2):236-47.,,,,,,,,,

Both PLL and B-CLL showed enlargement of the white pulp with nodule formation and diffuse infiltration of the red pulp. In both PLL and CLL larger cells were found in the white pulp nodules often concentrated on the periphery producing a bizonal appearance. The extent of involvement of the white pulp was greater in PLL than in uncomplicated CLL. However, this was not so in two cases of B-CLL in prolymphocytoid transformation in which the heavy replacement of the white pulp by large cells without a bizonal arrangement had effaced the red pulp. The cytological differences between PLL and CLL were best appreciated in splenic red pulp. The cells of CLL were small lymphocytes with clumped chromatin, those of PLL were larger with bigger nuclei, often indented in some cases, and distinct nucleoli. The pattern of infiltration in the bone marrow, liver and lymph nodes was similar in PLL and CLL. In conclusion, PLL can be distinguished from CLL by morphological and immunological features. The distinction is important clinically, because the survival of PLL is shorter than that of CLL.","['Lampert, I', 'Catovsky, D', 'Marsh, G W', 'Child, J A', 'Galton, D A']","['Lampert I', 'Catovsky D', 'Marsh GW', 'Child JA', 'Galton DA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precancerous Conditions/*pathology', 'Spleen/*pathology']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1980.tb02893.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1980 Jan;4(1):3-19. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1980.tb02893.x.,,,,,,,,,

The highest urinary ferritin values (mean 170 microgram/liter) were associated with chronic hemolytic anemia, and in these patients, urinary ferritin rose disproportionately in relation to the serum, averaging 82% of it. This higher urinary level apparently reflects increased ferritin in renal tubular cells due to glomerular filtration of unbound hemoglobin, a mechanism that is supported by a highly significant correlation between urinary ferritin and serum haptoglobin levels. In normal subjects and in patients with malignancy, the source of urinary ferritin appears different, since a highly significant correlation was observed between urinary ferritin and reticuloendothelial iron stores as measured by serum ferritin or total iron-binding capacity. In this setting, the most likely source of urinary ferritin is the iron contained in renal tubular cells, which is apparently in equilibrium with body iron stores.","['Lipschitz, D A', 'Allegre, A', 'Cook, J D']","['Lipschitz DA', 'Allegre A', 'Cook JD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Haptoglobins)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', '9011-92-1 (Hemosiderin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/urine', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood/*urine', 'Haptoglobins/metabolism', 'Heart Valve Prosthesis/adverse effects', 'Hemolysis', 'Hemosiderin/urine', 'Humans', 'Iron/blood', 'Leukemia/blood/urine', 'Male']",1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)72900-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1980 Feb;55(2):260-4.,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal proteins in virions of Rauscher MuLV produced in the presence of interferon.,97-110,"Interferon treatment of JLSV-6 cells chronically infected with Rauscher MuLV leads to the formation of non-infectious particles ('interferon' virions) containing the structural proteins coded by the env and gag genes as well as additional virus polypeptides. The major glycoprotein detected in the control virions is gp71, but 'interferon' virions contain in addition an 85K mol. wt. (gp85) glucosamine-containing, fucose-deficient glycoprotein. This is recognized by antiserum to MuLV and may be related to env pr85. Surface iodination of intact virions indicates that gp71 and gp85 are the two major components of the external envelope. However, whereas in control virions gp71 associates with p15E (gp90), this complex was not detected in 'interferon' virions. Analysis of radio-labelled (3H-amino acids or iodinated) proteins from disrupted 'interferon' virions revealed the presence of 65K, 55K, 40K, 20K and 12K mol. wt. polypeptides which could be precipitated with antiserum against MuLV. There was a distinct difference in the patterns of incorporation of pulse-labelled 3H-amino acid polypeptides into virions in the presence and absence of interferon. Those polypeptides labelled in the presence of interferon and recovered in the extracellular virions in a chase with interferon appeared to have substantially fewer copies of p30 and more of gag pr55 polypeptide than the controls. These results indicate that in the presence of interferon there are changes in the proteolytic cleavage associated with virion assembly.","['Pitha, P M', 'Fernie, B', 'Maldarelli, F', 'Hattman, T', 'Wivel, N A']","['Pitha PM', 'Fernie B', 'Maldarelli F', 'Hattman T', 'Wivel NA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Glycoproteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Rauscher Virus/analysis/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Virion/analysis/drug effects/metabolism']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-46-1-97 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1980 Jan;46(1):97-110. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-46-1-97.,,,,,,,,,

The response of these patients to antibiotic treatment is often poor, and the recent literature continues to document a substantial mortality rate in spite of the prompt treatment of these patients with multiple-agent antibiotic therapy. Because of limited available information regarding fever and neutropenia in pediatric cancer patients, we undertook an analysis of a group of such patients from a pediatric oncology center. The incidence of probable and documented infections was 39.2% in a group of these patients, representing 158 febrile episodes. The most frequent form of infection was bacterial sepsis; pulmonary infections were the next most frequent, followed by infections of skin and soft tissues. In leukemia patients with culture-proven infections, gram-negative organisms were isolated in 61.1% of episodes while gram-positive organisms were isolated in 41.7%. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the organisms most frequently isolated from these patients. In solid-tumor patients with bacterial infections, gram-positive organisms were isolated in 78% of cases.

The number of bursts that developed following infection of bone marrow cells with equilibrium density gradient purified FVP was increased by the addition of low concentrations of highly purified human urinary Ep (70,000 units/mg protein) to the infected cultures. The addition of as little as 0.001 unit per ml of Ep to infected cultures resulted in a 2-fold increase in burst formation. Increasing the concentration of Ep to 0.05 unit per ml caused a 4-fold increase in the number of bursts that developed. These concentrations of Ep were ineffective in inducing erythroid bursts when added to cultures of uninfected cells. The addition of Ep within 6 hr after FVP infection was necessary to observe increased burst formation. These experiments demonstrate that FVP-burst formation is enhanced by extremely low levels of Ep.

Characteristic modification of key elements of marrow architecture have been observed during preclinical and clinical phases of these hemopathological conditions. The more prominent of these changes include the following. (i) In developing aplastic anemia: severe vascular sinus and parenchymal cord compression, and focally degenerate endosteal surfaces. (ii) In developing myelofibrosis: hyperplasia of endosteal and reticular stomal elements. (iii) In developing leukemia: hypertrophy of reticular and endothelial elements in the initial restructuring of the stromal matrix and the subsequent aberrant hemopoietic repopulation of the initially depleted stromal matrix.

Ascertainment of vital status was accomplished for 98% of the cohort. Among 748 workers who had at least one day of exposure to benzene between 1940 and 1950, seven deaths from leukemia occurred; from United States death rates standardized for sex, age, and calendar time period, only 1.25 leukemia deaths would have been expected (standardized mortality ratio = 560; p less than 0.001). Mean duration of exposure to benzene was brief, and 437 (58%) of the cohort were exposed for less than 1 year. Evaluation of leukemia mortality for those workers exposed five or more years showed an SMR of 2100. All leukemia deaths were myelocytic or monocytic in cell type. Four additional cases of leukemia have been reorganized in workers at the study locations, but occurred in persons not encompassed by the strict definition of the cohort. Reconstruction of past exposures to benzene at the two locations indicates that in some areas of the plant airborne benzene concentrations rose occasionally to several hundred parts per million (ppm), but that for the most part, employee eight-hour time-weighted averages (TWA) fell within the limits considered permissible at the time of exposure. These data corroborate an initial analysis of the same cohort by Infante et al, and indicate that benzene is a human carcinogen at a range of exposures not greatly above the current legal standard.","['Rinsky, R A', 'Young, R J', 'Smith, A B']","['Rinsky RA', 'Young RJ', 'Smith AB']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Air Pollutants/*poisoning', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational/analysis/*poisoning', 'Benzene/analysis/*poisoning', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Ohio', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rubber']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.4700020305 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1981;2(3):217-45. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700020305.,,,,,,,,,

The initial versus adjusted mean aminoglycoside dosage was 14.1 and 17.0 mg/kg/day, respectively, in toddlers and older children with cystic fibrosis, and 7.1 and 11.5 mg/kg/day, respectively, in toddlers and older children with leukemia.

A statistically significant excess proportion of deaths due to colon cancer (PMR = 163) and to leukemia (PMR = 200) were observed among the members of the predominantly wood shop locals. Nonsignificant excess proportions of cancer deaths occurred at a number of other anatomical sites.

A fresh or a recanalized thrombus was observed in each eye. This study considers the temporal aspects of the cases, and it notes the different morphologic features of the occlusion. These observations explain most of the variability of the changes observed in previous reports. We believe that these different features represent the various stages in the natural evolution of such a thrombus. The interval between CRVO and histopathologic study in our series ranged from six hours to more than 10 years. Local and systemic factors were reviewed and were found to be important in the pathogenesis of thrombus formation. Local diseases with a predisposing effect on CRVO included: glaucoma, papilledema, subdural hemorrhage, optic nerve hemorrhage, and drusen of the optic nerve head. Associated systemic diseases included: hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and leukemia with thrombocytopenia. A fresh thrombus in the CRVO was observed in three (10.3%), and a recanalized thrombus in 26 eyes (89.7%). Endothelial-cell proliferation was a conspicuous feature in 14 (48.3%) of the eyes. Chronic inflammation in the area of the thrombus, and/or vein wall or perivenular area was observed in 14 (48.3%) of the eyes. Arterial occlusive disease was observed in seven eyes (24.6%).

Two hydroperoxidases have been elucidated in eosinophils and medusa cells by virtue of different substrate specificities, subcellular localizations and inhibitor sensitivities. One of these hydroperoxidases is shown by 3,3'-diaminobenzidine, is cyanide resistant, and is never observed in granules or rods in the medusa cell processes; it is frequently polarized to the sites of contact of medusa cells with other cellular elements of the blood. The other hydroperoxidase is revealed by p-phenylenediamine-pyrocatechol, is sensitive to cyanide and is frequently observed in granules and rods in medusa cell processes as well as in a population of larger granules in the cell bodies; the granules in the processes appear to be precursors to the rods, which may be related to Charcot-Leyden crystals. The extrusion of medusa cell processes is facilitated by the divalent cations calcium and magnesium and is inhibited by anions which sequester them such as phosphate, EDTA, citrate and oxalate. Medusa cells have been observed in samples from both rodents and humans and can be very prominent when eosinophilia accompanies allergy, parasitosis and malignancy.","['Hanker, J S', 'Chandross, R J', 'Solic, J J', 'Weatherly, N F', 'Laszlo, J', 'Moore, J O', 'Ottolenghi, A']","['Hanker JS', 'Chandross RJ', 'Solic JJ', 'Weatherly NF', 'Laszlo J', 'Moore JO', 'Ottolenghi A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Histochem J,The Histochemical journal,0163161,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)']",IM,"['Asthma/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cations, Divalent/pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/*cytology/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Parasitic Diseases/pathology']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01002631 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochem J. 1981 Nov;13(6):905-19. doi: 10.1007/BF01002631.,,,,"['CA 11265/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE 02668/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 05333/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

In the patients with normal renal function, a mean peak serum concentration of 15.9 micrograms/ml was reached at the termination of the intravenous drip infusion and, then, gradually declined to 0.97 microgram/ml at 6 hours after completion of the intravenous drip infusion. The half-lives were 1.64 and 1.41 hours, respectively. In the patients with impaired renal function, the elimination of AMK from blood flow was markedly delayed and the serum concentration was 5.52 micrograms/ml even at 6 hours after completion of the intravenous drip infusion. The half-life was prolonged, its value being 5.98 hours. 2) The mean urinary excretion rate for the patients with normal renal function was 67.7% within 7 hours, while the patient with impaired renal function had a lower rate of 14.0%. 3) Ten infectious patients with hematological malignant diseases were treated with AMK intravenous drip infusion. Clinical responses were excellent in 6, good in 2, fair in 1 and poor in 1. Thus, 80% of the patients responded to AMK. 4) In order to check the side effects of AMK, investigation was made on the results of various clinical laboratory tests and the subjective and objective findings. But, no side effects attributed to AMK were observed. Therefore, it is thought that the intravenous drip infusion of AMK will be very useful when attention is paid to infusion time, dose and interval.","['Hotta, T', 'Hirabayashi, N', 'Shimizu, K', 'Utsumi, M', 'Katoh, T', 'Maeda, H', 'Hirano, A', 'Ohnishi, K', 'Murate, T', 'Yamada, H']","['Hotta T', 'Hirabayashi N', 'Shimizu K', 'Utsumi M', 'Katoh T', 'Maeda H', 'Hirano A', 'Ohnishi K', 'Murate T', 'Yamada H']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Jpn J Antibiot,The Japanese journal of antibiotics,0154402,"['59-01-8 (Kanamycin)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amikacin/administration & dosage/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Kanamycin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Antibiot. 1981 Nov;34(11):1457-64.,,,,,,,,,

Studies with various tumor-host combinations.,391-9,"Previous studies showed that treatment of mice with 5(3,3'-dimethyl-1-triazeno)-amidazole-4-carboxamide (DTIC) plus cyclophosphamide (Cy) produce profound depression of classical allograft responses and impairment of endogenous cell proliferation similar to that detectable in lethally-irradiated mice. However efficient localized graft resistance was found in the spleen of drug-treated hybrid or allogeneic mice challenged with lymphoma cells. The present report describes the genetic patterns of this type of natural resistance [hereafter called drug-resistant inhibition of tumors (DRIT) in various tumor-host combinations DRIT was evaluated measuring the extent of 125I-5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (125IUdR) uptake in the spleen and liver of leukemic hosts. The results of the experiments performed with two H-2d (i.e. L1210 and LSTRA), one H-2b (i.e. L5MF-22) and one H-2a (i.e. LAF-17) lymphomas inoculated into drug-treated recipients pointed out that: (a) tumor cell proliferation was markedly inhibited in the spleen and weakly or not impaired in the liver of D end Hh-1-incompatible euthymic or nude mice responder for the hh system; (b) no resistance was found in the spleen and liver of Hh-1-compatible B10.A (2R) mice against L5MF-22 lymphoma or of SJL recipients genetically non-responder for the Hh system, against LSTRA cells; (c) splenic resistance against L1210 leukemia was detectable in Hh-compatible B10.A or B10.A (5R) mice; (d) splenic and liver resistance was found in Hh-incompatible but genetically Hh non-responder SJL or C3H mice against L5MF-22 or LSTRA lymphomas, respectively. These results showed that the genetic patterns of the DRIT system parallels the Hh-type immunity in certain tumor-host combinations [(a) and (b)] but not in others [(a) and (d)], as previously detected in lethally-irradiated mice. It is concluded that genetically-controlled lymphoma graft resistance can be retained by mice treated with high doses of antitumor drugs, capable of abrogating classical T-dependent transplantation immunity.","['Bonmassar, A', 'Rivosecchi-Merletti, P', 'Barzi, A', 'Goldin, A', 'Bonmassar, E']","['Bonmassar A', 'Rivosecchi-Merletti P', 'Barzi A', 'Goldin A', 'Bonmassar E']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Dacarbazine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/drug effects', 'H-2 Antigens', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', '*Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0192-0561(81)90035-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(81)90035-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1981;3(4):391-9. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(81)90035-7.,,,,,,,,,

Among 10 leukemic animals of this subline exhibiting chromosomal anomalies, 6 showed trisomy of the whole Robertsonian translocation chromosome with the expression of combined trisomy 6 and 15 as the most frequent abnormality. Besides this, rearrangements were observed in five animals, most of them resulting from centric fission of the Rb(6.15) translocation chromosome. Trisomy 15 with two Rb(6.15) and an extra acrocentric 15 was found in 44% of spleen cells in one animal, and a new Rb translocation of chromosomes 11 and 15 was seen in 50% of spleen and thymus cells of another animal. In both cases trisomy 15 without simultaneous trisomy 6 resulted. Thus, the triplication of a whole Rb(6.15) is frequent in leukemic AKR/Rb(6.15)1Ald, and ensuing double trisomy 6 + 15 is tolerated by the leukemic cell.

Contrasting behavior of the tumor vs. normal parent-derived chromosomes No. 15 in somatic hybrids of varying tumorigenicity.,785-98,"G-banding analysis was carried out on a series of hybrids derived from the fusion of a chromosome 15-trisomic murine T-cell leukemia of AKR origin and normal diploid fibroblasts or lymphocytes of the CBT6T6 strain. Due to the 14;15 translocation involved in the generation of the T6 marker, the chromosomes No. 15 and 14 derived from the normal and the tumor parent can be distinguished cytogenetically. Highly tumorigenic, in vitro maintained hybrids, and high-tumorigenic segregants of originally low-tumorigenic in vitro hybrids, selected by in vivo passage, showed a similar cytogenetic pattern. It was characterized by the amplification of the tumor-derived chromosomes No. 15 from the expected 3 to 5.5 +/- 0.2 copies and a concomitant decrease of the normal derived T(14;15)6 from 2 copies to 0.9 +/- 0.2. All other autosomes except No. 14 showed only minor random variations, around the expected number of 4 copies. The tumor-derived chromosome 14 was amplified from the expected 2 to 3 copies. The low-tumorigenic hybrids showed the opposite pattern with a decrease in the number of the tumor-derived 15 chromosome from 3 to 2.6 +/- 0.1 and the maintenance of the two normal parent derived T(14;15)6 chromosomes. These findings suggest the existence of a qualitative difference between the 15 chromosomes derived from the tumor vs. the normal parent, due to mutation or proviral DNA insertion in the tumor-derived homologue. Amplification of the change locus and a decrease in the dosage of its normal counterpart appear to favor tumorigenicity.","['Spira, J', 'Wiener, F', 'Babonits, M', 'Gamble, J', 'Miller, J', 'Klein, G']","['Spira J', 'Wiener F', 'Babonits M', 'Gamble J', 'Miller J', 'Klein G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosomes', 'Fibroblasts', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910280618 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1981 Dec;28(6):785-98. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910280618.,,,,['5 RO1 CA 14054-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

The H-2Kk-gene products were absent by several criteria: (1) monoclonal antibody and conventional alloantisera directed against eh H-2Kk antigenic specificities were nonreactive by direct testing and by absorptions. (2) H-2Kk products could not be precipitated from glycoprotein or protein extracts of the radiolabeled K-GV tumor. (3) Cytotoxic effectors against H-2Kk produced by sensitization in vitro and in vivo failed to kill K-GV target cells. (4) The tumor could neither stimulate BALB.B congenic mice to produce cytotoxic effectors nor specific cytotoxic antibody against H-2Kk-gene products. In contrast, the H-2Dk antigen was readily detectable by all these criteria. These findings therefore describe a tumor which has selectively lost the H-2K-gene products. The K-GV tumor was able to generate Gross-virus specific CTL, but had greatly reduced susceptibility to lysis by Gross-virus specific CTL generated by H-2K expressing AKR (H-2k) tumors.

A special problem arises when the patient involved is an infant or small child. Many adult members of our society are uncomfortable with the idea of children's rights. In fact, many analysts have argued that talk of such rights is nonsense. Within the context of the intimate, shared existence of the family, talk of children's rights may seem unnecessary or even inappropriate. The parent-child relationship has historically been defined ethically in terms of parental duties/obligations and children's needs.

Although more is known about dose-response relationships for ionizing radiation than for any other environmental carcinogen, estimates of cancer risk from low radiation doses have been extremely controversial; disagreements by factors of 100 or more are not uncommon. Direct estimation, based on data from populations exposed to low doses, is usually impracticable because of sample size requirements. Curve-fitting analyses, by which higher dose data determine lower dose risk estimates, require simple dose-response models if the estimates are to be statistically stable. The current level of knowledge about biological mechanisms of carcinogenesis dose not usually permit the confident assumption of a simple model, however; thus frequently the choice is between unstable risk estimates obtained using general models and statistically stable estimates whose stability depends on arbitrary model assumptions.","['Land, C E']",['Land CE'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/etiology', '*Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling Studies/methods', '*Statistics as Topic']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.814215 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1981 Dec;42:15-21. doi: 10.1289/ehp.814215.,PMC1568793,,,,,,,,

Thus the Fv2 locus (or a locus closely linked to it) appears to act not in the BFU-E itself, but elsewhere, to control the amount or activity of a macromolecular negative regulator to which the BFU-E population responds by a reduction in the proportion synthesizing DNA.

Eleven patients had acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) (seven patients) or a dysmyelopoietic syndrome (four patients). All of these patients were known to have an abnormal karyotype, and in each case, two samples of a bone marrow aspirate were available: one processed directly and another cultured for 24 hr. Five of the 11 patients had essentially the same proportion of abnormal cells in the direct and 24-hr samples; in five other patients, the percentage of aneuploid cells in the sample cultured for 24 hr was higher than that in the direct preparation. A higher percentage of aneuploid cells was observed in the direct preparation in only one case. In three other cases of ANLL, a marrow aspirate was cultured with methotrexate in addition to samples processed directly and after 24-hr culture; only two of these had an abnormal clone in any sample. The results of karyotype analysis differed in these two patients. The proportion of aneuploid cells was substantially higher in the methotrexate culture than in the 24-hr culture in one patient; in the other patient, the 24-hr culture contained aneuploid cells, whereas the methotrexate culture showed none. Three of the 13 aneuploid patients would have been incorrectly classified as being karyotypically normal on the basis of the initial analysis of the direct preparation, since only a single abnormal cell was detected in each case. The karyotypic pattern in untreated patients with ANLL has prognostic significance; therefore, the method of processing marrow aspirates may substantially influence the degree of correlation between the karyotype and survival reported by different laboratories.","['Waghray, M', 'Eques, C', 'Rowley, J D', 'Martin, P', 'Testa, J R']","['Waghray M', 'Eques C', 'Rowley JD', 'Martin P', 'Testa JR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Bone Marrow/*ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Specimen Handling/*methods', 'Time Factors']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830110410 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1981 Dec;11(4):409-15. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830110410.,,,,"['CA 16910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Quantitation of colonies of mutant TK-/- cells in the assay forms the basis for calculations of mutagenic potential of test compounds. We have evaluated the banded karyotypes of the parent TK+/- heterozygous cell line, as well as homozygous TK-/- mutants, in order to relate the genetic and morphological properties of mutant colonies. The parent cell line displays karyotype homogeneity, all cells containing normal mouse chromosomes, readily identifiable chromosome rearrangements, and cell line specific marker chromosomes. Mutant TK-/- colonies of the TK+/- 3.7.2C cell line form a bimodal frequency distribution of colony sizes for most mutagenic or carcinogenic test substances. Large-colony (lambda) TK-/- mutants with normal growth kinetics appear karyotypically identical within and among clones and with the TK+/- parental cell line. In contrast, most slow-growing small-colony (sigma) TK-/- mutants have readily recognizable chromosome rearrangements involving chromosome 11, which contains the thymidine kinase gene locus. It is possible that the heritable differences in growth kinetics and resultant colony morphology in lambda and sigma mutants are related to the type of chromosomal damage sustained. Large-colony mutants receive minimal damage, possibly in the form of point mutations at the TK locus, while small-colony mutants receive damage to other genetic functions coordinately with loss of TK activity, implying gross insult to chromosomal material. It seems likely that lambda and sigma mutants result from 2 different mutational mechanisms that may be distinguished on the basis of mutant colony morphology.","['Hozier, J', 'Sawyer, J', 'Moore, M', 'Howard, B', 'Clive, D']","['Hozier J', 'Sawyer J', 'Moore M', 'Howard B', 'Clive D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes/*ultrastructure', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutation', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0027-5107(81)90060-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(81)90060-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1981 Nov;84(1):169-81. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(81)90060-9.,,,,,,,,,

Monodispersed polystyrene (latex) beads were conjugated to specific antisera using glutaraldehyde, in an attempt to detect surface antigenic components on a variety of cells of known origin. Antisera, mostly immunoglobulin fractions, against human thymus (T) derived cells, common type acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells (C/ALL) and surface immunoglobulin (sIg) bearing cells were used to coat latex spheres, while rabbit anti-mouse Thy-1 antiserum or whole human-IgG (gamma-globulin) bound to latex were used as controls in some experiments. The use of SIEM techniques in the direct mode as a simple and sensitive method for labelling surface antigens is described. The disadvantages of the SIEM methodology are also summarized while the requirements for optimal cell preparation using this technique are stressed. The experiments were designed to ascertain whether prolonged fixation of cells could be used prior to incubation of the cells with the marker. In this respect, repeated neutralization of the glutaraldehyde with glycine is essential. SIEM labelling of cells is random and unreliable without adequate quenching with glycine. The heteroantisera used in this study proved to be adequate and insignificant non-specific attachment and cross reactivity were seen. SIEM adds a further dimension to ultrastructural aspects of immunology and is a potentially useful tool in the study and identification of leukaemia and lymphoma cells.","['Gamliel, H', 'Leizerowitz, R', 'Gurfel, D', 'Polliack, A']","['Gamliel H', 'Leizerowitz R', 'Gurfel D', 'Polliack A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Microsc,Journal of microscopy,0204522,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Polystyrenes)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Binding Sites', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning/*methods', 'Microspheres', 'Polystyrenes']",1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2818.1981.tb01294.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Microsc. 1981 Aug;123(Pt 2):189-99. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2818.1981.tb01294.x.,,,,,,,,,

This technique was used to assess the effects of inhibition of (ADP-ribose)n biosynthesis by 3-aminobenzamide on the capacity to repair DNA of mouse leukaemia L1210 cells following damage by gamma-irradiation and by the monofunctional alkylating agent, dimethyl sulphate. 3-Aminobenzamide partially inhibits restoration of supercoiling following gamma-irradiation and dimethyl sulphate treatment, but inhibits neither the enzymic incision events leading to breaks in the DNA nor the repair synthesis. This inhibition of repair can be observed at very low doses of damaging agents. These observations confirm and extend the evidence that (ADP-ribose)n biosynthesis is required for efficient cellular recovery from DNA damage. In particular, the nucleoid technique permits the demonstration that 3-aminobenzamide inhibits DNA repair after gamma-radiation; it is not possible to draw this unequivocal conclusion with the data from alkaline sucrose gradients because this technique is too insensitive. 1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine, which inhibits semiconservative DNA replication, also retards repair, and this effect can be reversed by the addition of deoxycytidine. The inhibitors of DNA excision repair, arabinosylcytosine, hydroxyurea or 3-aminobenzoamide increase the steady-state number of DNA breaks. Thus, they can be used to enhance even further the sensitivity of the nucleoid assay of repair.","['Durkacz, B W', 'Shall, S', 'Irwin, J']","['Durkacz BW', 'Shall S', 'Irwin J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars)', '0 (Sulfuric Acid Esters)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'JW5CW40Z50 (dimethyl sulfate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'DNA/radiation effects', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA, Superhelical/metabolism', 'Gamma Rays', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sulfuric Acid Esters/pharmacology']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1981.tb06430.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1981 Dec;121(1):65-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1981.tb06430.x.,,,,,,,,,

The higher sensitivity of the small intestine compared to bone marrow for folate analogs is related to greater retention of unbound drug and more prolonged inhibition of DNA synthesis in the former. Similar differences favoring greater retention of drug and more prolonged inhibition of DNA synthesis in responsive tumors compared to nonresponsive tumors and small intestine appear to account for the selective antitumor action of these agents in murine tumor models. The observed pharmacokinetic differences among tissues are largely attributable to differences in the structural specificity of carrier-mediated membrane transport of folate analogs.","['Sirotnak, F M']",['Sirotnak FM'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Intestine, Small/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Organ Specificity', 'Time Factors']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1981;65 Suppl 1:19-27.,,,,,,,,,

The growth of subline L1210-M was unaffected by pretreatment with CP or admixture with 10(5) peritoneal cells (PC) from CP-treated mice. In contrast, the growth of subline L1210-C was inhibited; CP pretreatment increased the proportion of long-term survivors (70% vs 20%) and admixture with CP-PC prolonged the survival time (59 days vs 49 days; P less than 0.05). In vitro experiments indicated that Sublines M and C were equally sensitive to cytostasis by CP-PC, as measured in a terminal labelling assay (greater than 90% inhibition of proliferation). However, subline C was much more sensitive to cytolysis (18h 125IUDR-release assay) by CP-PC; percentage specific release from L1210-C was at least 90%, whilst from L1210-M it was generally less than 25%. The differential susceptibility of the 2 sublines to cytolytic PC was maintained through 75 passages in culture. The effector cells were considered to be macrophages, because they were adherent, phagocytic, and sensitive to silica. Cytolysis was unrelated to endotoxin contamination, because it was not inhibited by polymyxin B, and was inhibited by pre-incubating PC in culture medium for 24 or 48 h before adding target cells. Thus the relevance of nonspecific macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro to tumour resistance in vivo may depend on the strength of the cytotoxic reaction.","['Berd, D', 'Mastrangelo, M J']","['Berd D', 'Mastrangelo MJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['0 (Endotoxins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/cytology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endotoxins/immunology', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology', '*Macrophage Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Propionibacterium acnes/*immunology']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1981.280 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1981 Dec;44(6):819-27. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1981.280.,PMC2010875,,,,,,,,

By means of a direct cytotoxicity test using guinea-pig complement and an absorption tests, NAA in inbred WKA/Hok rats were observed to be cytotoxically reactive to all investigated syngeneic and allogeneic fibrosarcoma lines and one glioma line, but not to hepatoma, lymphoma, leukemia, and neurinoma lines. Moreover, NAA reactivity to fibrosarcoma cells was significantly absorbed with brain, lung, kidney, skin homogenates, and cultured normal fibroblasts of syngeneic rats, but not with liver homogenates, thymus, spleen, lymph node and red blood cells. NAA were identified as being predominantly IgM and were stables at 56 degree C for 30 min. With the exception of one strain, there were no strain or sex differences in NAA levels among any of the investigated strains of rats. The level of NAA correlated with the in vivo anti-tumor response: when NAA-reactive fibrosarcoma or glioma cells were implanted into syngeneic WKA/Hok rats, groups of rats with high NAA levels suppressed tumor growth and survived longer than groups of rats with low NAA levels, while there was no difference in length of survival days in NAA non-reactive hepatoma or lymphoma cells. When 3-methylcholanthrene was inoculated into these two groups of rats, the tumor incidence in the groups of rats with high NAA level was significantly suppressed as compared to the group of rats with low NAA level.

It was found that the liposome preparation exhibited more potent inhibitory activity than the free drug on colony formation in the lung, when administered intravenously as well as intraperitoneally. Superior life-prolongation effect was also observed with liposome preparations as compared with the free drug in this system. However, the two forms of MeCCNU showed almost the same activity against not only Lewis lung carcinoma but also P388 leukemia inoculated subcutaneously and intraperitoneally, respectively.

No significant difference was found between the mean urinary neopterine levels of 33 patients with non-Hodgkin's or with Hodgkin's lymphoma in remission and the healthy group. Only 15% of these patients had elevated neopterine levels. The mean urinary neopterine levels correlated well with the tumor stage in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and with non-Hodgkin's disease.

Striking differences were found between the two groups: (1) Clonal chromosomal aberrations were present in 75% of exposed patients compared with only 32% in the nonexposed group. (2) Of the patients exposed to solvents and insecticides 92% had abnormal chromosomes, whereas only 29% of patients exposed to petrol products showed abnormalities; in the total material 10/13 exposed patients with normal chromosomes were exposed to petrol products. (3) The relationship between chromosomal abnormality and exposure was evident in both females and males. However, only 29% of women with an abnormal karyotype were exposed, whereas 70% of males with an abnormal karyotype were exposed. (4) The incidence of certain characteristic karyotypic abnormalities, i.e., -5/5q-, 7/7q-, +8, +21, t(8;21), and t(9;22), were decidedly more common in exposed than in nonexposed patients. At least one of these changes were present in 92% of exposed patients with aberrations, whereas in the nonexposed group the incidence was only 60%. (5) The monocytic varieties of ANLL (M4 + M5) were more common in the nonexposed patients, whereas erythroleukemia (M6) was more common in the exposed group. The predominance of abnormal karyotypes in the exposed compared to the nonexposed patients was similar in leukemia types M1 + M2 and in M4 + M5. (6) There was no difference in survival time between the two groups and the same correlation was obvious in both exposed and nonexposed patients: patients who had only abnormal metaphases had poorer prognosis than those with normal bone marrow metaphases only (6 vs 1.5 months).

Persistence of cells in the upper phase of the system could be promoted by addition of the palmitate ester of poly(ethylene glycol). Partitioning effects seen here may derive from affinity of membrane sialic acid residues for dextran-rich lower-phase droplets, and antagonism of these interactions by poly(ethylene glycol) palmitate. Several determinants of partitioning behavior were examined: 1. Membrane glycosylation. Partitioning behavior of P388 and P388/ADR lymphoblasts were compared. The latter has an inherently higher degree of membrane glycosylation, resulting in a lower partition coefficient in poly(ethylene glycol) palmitate-supplemented systems. 2. Degree of esterification. Singly-esterified poly(ethylene glycol) was substantially more effective at promoting cell partition into the upper phase than was doubly-esterified glycol. Use of the latter was associated with cell-cell aggregation. 3. Relative numbers of lower-phase droplets present. Decreasing the numbers of such droplets initially present markedly increased the partition coefficient. 4. Time-dependence. Even in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) palmitate, the partition coefficient fell with time, indicating an interaction between cells and lower-phase droplets not antagonized by the ester.","['Kessel, D']",['Kessel D'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Leukemia P388/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",1981/12/04 00:00,1981/12/04 00:01,['1981/12/04 00:00'],"['1981/12/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/04 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-4165(81)90213-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(81)90213-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1981 Dec 4;678(2):245-9. doi: 10.1016/0304-4165(81)90213-0.,,,,['CA23243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

Consistent with this altered pattern of ganglioside distribution was the finding of a higher activity of two of the sialyltransferase activities in homogenates of leukemic thymus as compared to normal thymus. About 2-fold higher activities of the enzymes CMP-AcNeu: lactosylceramide sialyltransferase and CMP-AcNeu: GM1 sialyltransferase were observed in leukemic thymus homogenate compared to homogenates of non-leukemic cells. The substrate affinity of sialyltransferase with GM1 as acceptor from the leukemic thymus was similar to that of the enzyme from normal thymus.

The shoulders of the survival curves differ, but this may be explained by differences in cell kinetics. By contrast, L1210 leukaemic marrow cells are considerably more susceptible to the lethal effects of hyperthermia (43 degrees C) than either normal marrow stem cells or L1210 leukaemic cells grown as ascites tumours. Moreover, the killing of L1210 ascites cells by hyperthermia can be enhanced by heating L1210 ascites cells with an equal number of normal marrow cells, or as upernatant removed from heated marrow cells. Most cells in lukaemic marrow are normal, and it is postulated that the increased thermal sensitivity of L1210 cells in leukaemic marrow is caused by diffusible factors (e.g. lysosomal enzymes) released by heating normal marrow cells.","['Symonds, R P', 'Wheldon, T E', 'Clarke, B', 'Bailey, G']","['Symonds RP', 'Wheldon TE', 'Clarke B', 'Bailey G']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1981.254 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1981 Nov;44(5):682-91. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1981.254.,PMC2010829,,,,,,,,

Rate of contact transmission was lower in chickens reared on wire-mesh floors than in chickens reared on solid floors. Short-term procedures in which chicks were reared in colony cages and brooder batteries effectively reduced the transmission of LLV by infected groups of hatching chicks to uninfected groups.

There was a poor correlation between the results from the biological and the immunological measurements, both on patients with high and those with low serum erythropoietin levels. The difficulty of the immunological erythropoietin test is that pure erythropoietin is not sufficiently available. The immunological test investigated here does not use pure erythropoietin. Aside from this, pathophysiological considerations would lead one to expect basic differences between the results from immunological and biological tests.","['Essers, U', 'Heilmann, E']","['Essers U', 'Heilmann E']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Wochenschr,Klinische Wochenschrift,2985205R,['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],IM,"['Adrenal Gland Neoplasms/blood', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood', 'Erythropoietin/*blood', 'Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/blood', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Pheochromocytoma/blood', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood']",1981/11/02 00:00,1981/11/02 00:01,['1981/11/02 00:00'],"['1981/11/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/02 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01721217 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Wochenschr. 1981 Nov 2;59(21):1217-22. doi: 10.1007/BF01721217.,,Nachweis von Erythropoietin.

This is followed by removal of the covering N-acetyl-glucosamine residue to expose a phosphomonoester. We have examined the kinetics of this phosphorylation pathway in the murine macrophage line P388D1. Cells were labeled with [2-3H]mannose for 15-20 min and then chased with unlabeled mannose for various times up to 5 h. The lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase was immunoprecipitated and its oligosaccharide units examined for extent of phosphorylation and uncovering. The first phosphorylated oligosaccharides were detected after 20 min of labeling. Most of the phosphorylation occurred during the first 40 min of the chase period, and a maximum of 30% of the oligosaccharide units were eventually phosphorylated. Oligosaccharides with one and two phosphodiesters were found. The earliest detectable phosphorylated species were devoid of the glucose residues known to be present on the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. Uncovering of the phosphodiesters began shortly after the oligosaccharides were phosphorylated and occurred concomitantly with the removal of outer mannose residues. Taken together, these data demonstrate that phosphorylation of lysosomal enzyme oligosaccharides is a post-translational event. Proteolytic fragmentation of [3H]mannose-labeled beta-glucuronidase and partial digestion of [3H]leucine-labeled beta-glucuronidase with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H suggest that there are 3 glycosylation sites per subunit. Each glycosylation site is partially phosphorylated. A portion of the high mannose oligosaccharides at one site are processed to complex-type units.","['Goldberg, D E', 'Kornfeld, S']","['Goldberg DE', 'Kornfeld S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chymotrypsin', 'Glucuronidase/*metabolism', 'Glycopeptides/isolation & purification', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Oligosaccharides/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Trypsin']",1981/12/25 00:00,1981/12/25 00:01,['1981/12/25 00:00'],"['1981/12/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/25 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)43006-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1981 Dec 25;256(24):13060-7.,,,,"['5T05GM02016/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 07200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 08759/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Treated cells accumulated substantial amounts of the xylofuranosyl analogs of ATP, S-adenosylmethionine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine, indicating that metabolites of xylosyladenine participate in S-adenosylmethionine-mediated transmethylation reactions. Measurements of in vivo nucleic acid methylation showed that xylosyladenine causes a marked inhibition of 2'-O-methyluridine, 2'-O-methylcytidine, 5-methyluridine, and 5-methylcytidine formation in the RNA of treated cells.

The variants, which had widely diverging sensitivities to NK cells, were obtained by a number of methods, including selection in the presence of NK cells, antibody to H-2, or antibody to the murine leukemia-virus-induced antigen, and by fusion of sensitive cells with an NK-resistant cell line, A9HT. The sensitivities of these cells to NK-cell-mediated lysis did not correlate with their sensitivities to anti-H-2a cytotoxic T cells. While no correlation could be made between the NK-sensitivity of these variants and their total cellular sialic acid, a statistically significant inverse correlation was observed between the levels of percentage neuraminidase releasable surface sialic acid of total labelled sialyl components and sensitivity to NK cells. This correlation with cell surface sialic acid was observed with either endogenous or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-induced activated NK cells as effectors. Neuraminidase treatment of insensitive target cells caused a moderate increase in sensitivity but failed to render the resistant targets as sensitive as YAC-1. Analysis of glycosphingolipids among the variants revealed a strong positive correlation between the total cell neutral glycolipid with chromatographic migration of asialo-GM2 and sensitivity to endogenous or activated NK-cell-mediated lysis. Significant correlations were not found with any other neutral glycolipids. However, ganglioside homologues with chromatographic mobility of GM1, GD1a, GD1b, And GT also showed a positive correlation with both endogenous and activated NK-cell-mediated lysis. The ratio of asialo-GM2 to GM2 had a highly significant positive correlation with sensitivity. These correlative results suggest that asialo-GM2 and certain gangliosides could be involved in binding or lytic events in NK cell:target cell interactions, and that high levels of sialic acid and sialylation on the surface may inhibit and/or modify such interactions. Further studies with these YAC variants should be useful for examining the biochemical bases of target cell-effector cell interactions in the NK-system.","['Yogeeswaran, G', 'Gronberg, A', 'Hansson, M', 'Dalianis, T', 'Kiessling, R', 'Welsh, R M']","['Yogeeswaran G', 'Gronberg A', 'Hansson M', 'Dalianis T', 'Kiessling R', 'Welsh RM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Sialic Acids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gangliosides/analysis', 'Glycosphingolipids/*analysis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/analysis/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/analysis/immunology', 'Sialic Acids/*analysis']",1981/10/15 00:00,1981/10/15 00:01,['1981/10/15 00:00'],"['1981/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910280419 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1981 Oct 15;28(4):517-26. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910280419.,,,,"['AI12438/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 19312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 12428/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,

Virus spread was faster and the level of viremia higher in A X C57L than in A X C57BL mice. Also, A X C57L mice had no or only low titers of virus neutralizing antibodies, whereas A X C57BL mice had high titers. Anti-MCSA antibodies, reacting with the surface of syngeneic M-MuLV-induced lymphoma cells, were present in a minority of the mice, but disappeared ultimately in all mice. The two groups of mice differed with regard to the length of the preleukemic latency period.

Scatchard analysis of the binding curve gave a straight line, indicating that S component binds to a single population of sites. The dissociation constant, K(D), derived from the Scatchard plot was 5.57 x 10(-9) M, and the number of binding sites per leukocyte was calculated to be approximately 5,300. Unlabeled S component (10(-8) M) or subunit B of cholera toxin (10(-7) M) readily competed with (125)I-labeled S component binding, and the labeled S component, preincubated with ganglioside G(M1) at equimolar proportions for 5 min, lost the binding capacity to the leukocyte membranes. The binding number of (125)I-labeled F component to leukocidin-sensitive cells, such as rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the established human myelocytic leukemia cells, in the absence and in the presence of the unlabeled S component (2.1 nM), was calculated to be 50 and 1,300 molecules per cell, respectively. This increased binding of the labeled F component was time and temperature dependent. The binding number of labeled F component to other cell types comparatively insensitive to leukocidin, such as erythrocytes, adipocytes, intestinal cells, and HeLa cells, was calculated to be less than 50 molecules per cell in spite of the sufficient amount of unlabeled S component bound to their cells. These observations are consistent with the view that in rabbit leukocyte the S component, preferentially bound to the cell surface at 5,300 molecules per cell, contributes to enhance the F component binding up to about 1,300 molecules per cell and may thus play a role of synergistic action of both leukocidin components on the cell membranes in the leukocytolysis.","['Noda, M', 'Kato, I', 'Matsuda, F', 'Hirayama, T']","['Noda M', 'Kato I', 'Matsuda F', 'Hirayama T']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Leukocidins)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Cholera Toxin/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Leukocidins/analysis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Staphylococcus aureus/*analysis']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/iai.34.2.362-367.1981 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 1981 Nov;34(2):362-7. doi: 10.1128/iai.34.2.362-367.1981.,PMC350874,,,,,,,,

In comparative studies with AH13, a sensitive strain of rat hepatoma, significantly lower levels of cellular retention as well as uptake of these drugs were observed with AH66 cells. However, in the presence of 2, 4-dinitrophenol in glucose-free medium, the uptake of vincristine by AH66 cells was remarkably increased, and addition of glucose induced a spontaneous efflux of drug that had been taken up. These results, in good accord with those for a subline of P388 mouse leukemia which acquired resistance to either adriamycin or vincristine, suggest that there exists an active efflux system common to these different kinds of antitumor agents in naturally resistant rat tumor cells. Further studies revealed that Tween 80 also enhanced the uptake of vincristine by AH66 cells by interfering with the efflux of this drug and thus partially restored the sensitivity in vitro of AH66 cells to vincristine.","['Inaba, M', 'Takayama, K', 'Sakurai, Y']","['Inaba M', 'Takayama K', 'Sakurai Y']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Gan,Gan,0151745,"['0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Polysorbates)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'Q13SKS21MN (2,4-Dinitrophenol)']",IM,"['2,4-Dinitrophenol', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dactinomycin/*pharmacology', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Glucose/metabolism', '*Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Polysorbates/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Surface-Active Agents/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gan. 1981 Aug;72(4):562-8.,,,,,,,,,

As the primary target for TPA action is membranes, studies were undertaken to determine whether phorbol ester exposure would influence fatty acid metabolism in these cells. In cells incubated with labeled fatty acids for 1 hr, the percentage of distribution of lipid radioactivity is highest in the phospholipid fraction of control cultures, whereas in TPA-supplemented cells, substantially more label is associated with triacylglycerols. The specific activity of phospholipids and triacylglycerols was lower in treated than in control cells; however, the amount of cellular triacylglycerols increased 3.2-fold (lipid per mg protein). The increase in the amount of cellular phospholipids in TPA-treated cells is not as pronounced (approximately 50% above control), and this only occurs at higher concentrations of TPA. At early times after TPA exposure, there is no stimulation of the cellular uptake of labeled fatty acids; however, differentiating cells (24 to 48 hr of TPA), when incubated with label, contained more radioactivity than did control cultures. Cells treated with TPA for 48 hr show a marked decrease in the conversion of [1-14C]stearic acid to monoenoic product (22% of control); this decrease is dose dependent and occurs within 24 to 48 hr of treatment. Although the phospholipid fatty acid composition of differentiating cells was similar to control cells, acyl groups of triacylglycerols isolated from treated cells showed a marked decrease in the percentage of unsaturates. These data provide evidence which demonstrates that TPA treatment of HL-60 cells has a profound effect on fatty acid metabolism. The lack of an effect of TPA on fatty acid metabolism after short-term exposure to the promoter suggests that the modifications observed may be the result of cellular differentiation rather than a direct effect exerted by the presence of TPA in the culture media.","['Cabot, M C', 'Welsh, C J']","['Cabot MC', 'Welsh CJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Dec;41(12 Pt 1):4910-5.,,,,,,,,,

Three populations of macrophages, resident, divinylether maleic anhydride copolymer, and thioglycollate-recruited, were used. In general, TPA reduced both the cocultivation time and the number of macrophages required to induce cytotoxicity in all three macrophage types. With divinylether maleic anhydride copolymer macrophages, TPA enhanced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner in the concentration range of 1.7 to 170 nM at macrophage: tumor cell ratios of 10:1 and 1:1. For reasons that were not apparent, inhibition of cytotoxicity was found at higher cell ratios. With both thioglycollate-elicited and resident macrophages, TPA (170 nM) enhanced cytotoxicity at all ratios tested. Even 1:1 ratios of macrophages:tumor cells, which were not cytotoxic alone, inhibited cell viability by 50% to 60% in the presence of TPA. A correlation was found between the biological activity of related macrocyclic diterpenes and their ability to enhance macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity.

A number of monoclonal methotrexate-resistant sublines of the L1210 leukemia were derived during methotrexate therapy of leukemic mice and biochemically characterized. Of the total number of 14 sublines derived, five exhibited altered [3H]methotrexate transport alone, five exhibited increased dihydrofolate reductase content alone (2- to 18-fold), and four showed alterations in both of these properties. Methotrexate binding and substrate turnover rate for dihydrofolate reductase appeared to be unchanged in any of the resistant sublines. The relative resistance of each subline was accounted for by the biochemical alterations observed. Among the transport-defective sublines, one subcategory showed a 3- to 4-fold reduction in apparent influx Vmax for [3H]methotrexate, a second category showed both a 5-fold reduction in influx Vmax and a 3-fold increase in the apparent influx Km, and one subline showed only a 2-fold increase in Km. Otherwise, Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics for influx was observed in each case and in the case of the parental line and the other resistant sublines. None of the resistant sublines exhibited altered efflux of [3H]methotrexate. Steady-state levels measured for intracellular exchangeable (osmotically active) fractions of drug accurately reflected the values for specific kinetic parameters determined for each sensitive and resistant cell line. These studies show that transport-defective phenotypes represent a major category of methotrexate-resistant cell types which emerge initially from leukemic cell populations under therapy in mice. Based on considerations discussed here, it is reasonable to assume that a similar relative occurrence of this phenotype would result during methotrexate therapy of leukemia patients.","['Sirotnak, F M', 'Moccio, D M', 'Kelleher, L E', 'Goutas, L J']","['Sirotnak FM', 'Moccio DM', 'Kelleher LE', 'Goutas LJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Nov;41(11 Pt 1):4447-52.,,,,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Kinetics of binding.,6335-40,"The kinetics of association and dissociation of affinity cross-linked IgG oligomers with Fc receptors on P388D1 cells have been studied at 0 degrees C. For dimers prepared with two different affinity cross-linking reagents (DIBADL and BDPE) and also trimers and a heavy oligomer fraction prepared with BDPE, monomeric IgG accelerates the rate of dissociation of bound oligomer from the cells. This observation is consistent with a binding mechanism in which monovalently, and multivalently bound species are in rapid equilibrium with one another on the cell surface and in which the rate of formation of the divalently bound species is faster than the dissociation of the monovalent species from the cells. As predicted, the rates of dissociation of BDPE cross-linked oligomers decrease with size, and dimers (cross-linked with DIBADL) which can self-aggregate on the cell surface dissociate more slowly than nonaggregating (BDPE) dimers. The association and dissociation of oligomers with P388D1 cells proceed by parallel fast and slow processes, even with cells that bind dimers with a single affinity. The origin of this heterogeneity is not known but could arise from a fraction of receptors in environments with limited accessibility to bulk solution. The fast component of the association reaction is second order, and the rate-limiting step of this process is the formation of the monovalently bound intermediate from solution-phase oligomer.","['Dower, S K', 'Titus, J A', 'DeLisi, C', 'Segal, D M']","['Dower SK', 'Titus JA', 'DeLisi C', 'Segal DM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/immunology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mathematics', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology']",1981/10/27 00:00,1981/10/27 00:01,['1981/10/27 00:00'],"['1981/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00525a008 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1981 Oct 27;20(22):6335-40. doi: 10.1021/bi00525a008.,,,,,,,,,

There was no reduction in neutrophil colony number on days 6-7 or 12-14 in cells exposed at 31 or 62 mW/cm2, but as the power density was increased to 1,000 mW/cm2, there was a reduction in colony number of MWI cells compared with SI cells. The microwave interaction with the human neutrophil colony-forming cells was apparently not related to temperature rise, or to the state of cells cycle, and was irreversible.","['Ottenbreit, M J', 'Lin, J C', 'Inoue, S', 'Peterson, W D Jr']","['Ottenbreit MJ', 'Lin JC', 'Inoue S', 'Peterson WD Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Macrophages/radiation effects', '*Microwaves', 'Neutrophils/*radiation effects', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",1981/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bem.2250020302 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 1981;2(3):203-15. doi: 10.1002/bem.2250020302.,,,,,,,,,

The purity of the mixture was established by the coincidence of the peaks of enzyme activity and protein at a molecular weight of 300 000 on Bio-Gel P-300, the presence of only two protein bands, both of them enzymically active, in polyacrylamide gels after electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, and the presence of a single subunit species, of mol.wt. 75 000, after electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels under a denaturing conditioning. The major isoenzyme co-migrated with the L form from rat liver during electrophoresis in alkaline polyacrylamide gels, whereas the minor isoenzyme migrated more rapidly than either the lysosomal form or the rat liver microsomal form and was designated the tumour (T) isoenzyme. A mixture of the purified isoenzymes from two preparations had an average specific activity of 1389 units/mg for phenolphthalein beta-D-glycopyranosiduronic acid. The L and T isoenzymes, which had pI5.9 and 5.7 respectively, could be obtained free of cross-contamination by isoelectric focusing and had similar specific activities. Although the T isoenzyme could be a catabolic product of the M or the L form, it could also be a unique tumour product, because it was not detected in extracts of normal rat tissues.","['Schwartz, L B', 'Austen, K F']","['Schwartz LB', 'Austen KF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glucuronidase/*isolation & purification', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Isoenzymes/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Rats']",1981/03/01 00:00,1981/03/01 00:01,['1981/03/01 00:00'],"['1981/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj1930663 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1981 Mar 1;193(3):663-70. doi: 10.1042/bj1930663.,PMC1162653,,,"['AI-07722/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-10356/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-17382/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

There were excess deaths from bladder cancer and leukemia among white male union members during both follow-up periods. During recent follow-up of white male union members employed for at least five years, there were excesses in deaths from three additional cancers: esophageal cancer (11 observed/4.8 expected), biliary and liver cancer (6 observed/3.3 expected) and lymphoma and multiple myeloma (14 observed/5.8 expected). Evidence from other studies of rubber workers suggests that observed excesses in deaths from bladder cancer and leukemia are related to work-place exposures. The present findings suggest that occupational exposures etiologically relevant to these diseases may not have been reduced in recent years or that sufficient time has not elapsed for such reductions to result in decreased mortality.

The present study was undertaken to determine whether there is an additional population of NK cells that is OKM1-, since treatment with OKM1 and C decreased, but did not eradicate, NK cell activity. Treatment of lymphocytes with monoclonal antibody OKT11A, which reacts with all sheep red blood cell rosetting lymphocytes, and C also decreased NK cell activity. Although approximately 90% of OKT11A+ cells are OKT3+, NK cell activity resides within the OKT11A+ cell population, which is OKT3- since OKT3-cell depletion fails to decrease NK cell activity. Double fluorescence analysis of OKT3-depleted lymphocytes revealed that 54% of the OKM1+ cells are OKT11A- and 45% of the OKT11A+ cells are OKM1-, thus demonstrating that within the OKT3-depleted population, approximately one-half the OKM1+ cells are OKT11A- and vice versa. Treatment of lymphocytes with OKM1 together with OKT11A and C decreased NK cell activity against 3 NK-sensitive leukemia lines--K562, MOLT-4, and HSB-2--more than did treatment with either antibody alone; virtually no lytic activity was retained after elimination of OKM1+ and OKT11A+ cells.

Sterol binding polyene antibiotics such as amphotericine B or filipin inhibit the expression of FcR gamma during the differentiation of M1- cells by the CM obtained from the culture of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting the possible involvement of cholesterol molecules in the induction mechanism of FcR gamma. Low-temperature incubation at either 20 degrees C or 4 degrees C results in the increment of their membrane microviscosity, when tested by the fluorescence depolarization method, in company with the appearance of FcR gamma on approximately 60% of M1 cells when assayed by the EA-rosetting method. FcR gamma is also induced on approximately 40% of M1- cells by incubating cells with cholesterol-phosphatidyl-choline liposomes with the concomitant increase of their membrane microviscosity. Nevertheless, no phagocytosis of EA is observed in these cells treated with such physicochemical procedures. These findings imply that FcR gamma is embedded in the membrane of M1- cells and that physicochemical modification of the membrane lipid bilayers can induce the FcR gamma independent on their functional differentiation marked by the expression of phagocytic activity.","['Kyoizumi, S', 'Kannagi, R', 'Masuda, T']","['Kyoizumi S', 'Kannagi R', 'Masuda T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Sterols)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cholesterol', 'Cold Temperature', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Phagocytosis', 'Polyenes/metabolism', 'Rabbits', '*Receptors, Fc', 'Rosette Formation', 'Sterols/metabolism', 'Viscosity']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1981 Dec;127(6):2252-6.,,,,,,,,,

After nonionic detergent solubilization and incubation with rat IgE, IgE-receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-rat IgE. The receptor for IgE was further purified by SDS-PAGE, the receptor peak, in the gel, was submitted to tryptic digestion, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by a 2-dimensional peptide mapping procedure. The peptides were then visualized by autoradiography. IgE receptors from different RBL cell lines exhibit slight differences in m.w., as judged by SDS-PAGE; however, no differences were seen in the tryptic peptide maps of receptors from the different RBL cell lines. In addition, receptors isolated from RMC also mapped identically, indicating that peptides responsible for the m.w. differences may not be labeled. The IgE-binding component of higher m.w., isolated by affinity chromatography on IgE-Sepharose, gave a distinct pattern of tryptic peptides that were different from the receptor. By using IgE-Sepharose and tryptic mapping, this 2nd and IgE-binding component was found on all RBL cell lines and on RMC. The membrane orientation of the receptor was analyzed by tryptic mapping. Tryptic maps obtained from IgE receptors labeled on intact cells (outside labeled only), membrane particles (inside and outside labeled), and in a detergent-solubilized form (all possible sites labeled) were similar, indicating that no other protein site was available to be labeled, in addition to those in the surface exposed binding site. Moreover, saturation of the receptor by IgE prevented its subsequent radioiodination, whether the receptor was labeled on intact cells, on membrane particles, or in a solubilized form, again indicating that no site other than the binding site could be labeled. Cumulatively, these data suggest that the IgE receptor on RBL cells is not a transmembrane protein.","['Pecoud, A R', 'Conrad, D H']","['Pecoud AR', 'Conrad DH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Chromatography, Affinity', '*Immunoglobulin E', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Mast Cells/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', '*Receptors, Fc', 'Trypsin/*pharmacology']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1981 Dec;127(6):2208-14.,,,,"['AI 15812/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 18697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

The normal line of L1210 is deficient in its capacity to take up cystine, and this limits the growth of the cells in normal culture media containing cystine. In the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, the cells obtain a high capacity to utilize cystine in the medium. The reaction of 2-mercaptoethanol with cystine produces a mixed disulfide of 2-mercaptoethanol and cysteine. The mixed disulfide is taken up by the cells mainly via the L system, a transport system for neutral alpha-amino acids such as leucine. The mixed disulfide within the cells is rapidly reduced to produce cystine and 2-mercaptoethanol which escapes rapidly into the medium and reacts with cystine again. With the aid of this cyclic action of 2-mercaptoethanol, the cells are able to utilize cystine constantly.","['Ishii, T', 'Bannai, S', 'Sugita, Y']","['Ishii T', 'Bannai S', 'Sugita Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Disulfides)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cysteine/*pharmacology', 'Disulfides/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*physiopathology', 'Mercaptoethanol/*pharmacology', 'Mice']",1981/12/10 00:00,1981/12/10 00:01,['1981/12/10 00:00'],"['1981/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)43284-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1981 Dec 10;256(23):12387-92.,,,,,,,,,

A possible contributory factor in chemotherapy resistance is the occurrence of decreased red blood cell deformability in mice with advanced tumors. Poorly deformable red blood cells may prevent adequate drug delivery to tumor cells. Two methods for improving red cell deformability were found in this study. The first involved treatment of L1210 leukemia-bearing mice with red cell metabolic substrates, including inosine, adenosine, glucose, sodium pyruvate, and ascorbic acid. The combination of inosine plus sodium pyruvate (3 mg of each drug in 0.5 cm3 phosphate-buffered saline) was most effective in restoring deformability to normal. Administration of an active chemotherapeutic agent (BCNU or cyclophosphamide) also improved red cell deformability, with maximal restoration occurring 4--5 days after drug treatment. Standard and 50% of standard drug doses were equally effective in restoring deformability. The optimal therapy program for day 7 L1210 leukemia utilized inosine plus sodium pyruvate given 10--15 min before BCNU 15 mg/kg on day 7 and before BCNU 30 mg/kg on day 12. This treatment yielded 44% cures, whereas BCNU alone, in identical dose and schedule, gave no cures. Median survival was 50 days for the inosine-pyruvate-treated mice, as against 30 days for BCNU alone. Therefore, treatment with non-toxic doses of red blood cell metabolic substrates plus optimal timing of chemotherapy, two maneuvers that significantly increased red blood cell deformability, resulted in significant therapeutic benefit.","['Cohen, M H']",['Cohen MH'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Erythrocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Inosine/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00258476 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1981;5(3):175-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00258476.,,,,,,,,,

Methotrexate (48 or 72 mg/kg ip) produced a 199% and a 222% increase in lifespan, respectively, as compared with untreated animals (6.9 +/- 0.5 days). When given as single agents, vincristine (0.5-1.0 mg/kg ip) or vindesine (0.5-1.5 mg/kg ip) produced between a 27% and an 88% increase in lifespan.

With the exception of vindesine plus 72 mg/kg of methotrexate, the increase in lifespan produced by the simultaneous administration of methotrexate and either vinca alkaloid was additive. When vindesine was administered with 72 mg/kg of methotrexate, the increase in lifespan was greater than expected from an additive effect of the two agents. However, none of the trials employing single-agent therapy or simultaneous combination therapy produced long-term survivors (greater than or equal to 90 days after therapy).

In the hopes of identifying those patients likely to derive therapeutic benefit from glucocorticoids, we have studied glucocorticoid receptors and in vitro responses to glucocorticoids in 36 previously untreated adults with ANLL. The leukemic blasts of all patients contained glucocorticoid receptors (range, 4,300 to 28,400 total receptor sites per cell; median, 8,800). These receptors were similar in all respects studied to those from a variety of other normal and malignant tissues. There was little difference between receptor levels among the various French-American-British categories. In vitro responses to glucocorticoid were observed in leukemic blasts of 26 of 28 cases studied. These responses varied from near complete cell killing to stimulation of proliferation. Since the cells of patients with ANLL have about the same number of receptors as do cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and these receptors are capable of mediating physiological responses in vitro, it is unlikely that qualitative or quantitative receptor defects underlie the relative resistance to glucocorticoid therapy of ALL compared to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the broad range of in vitro responses and receptor levels suggests that these studies might be useful in identifying those patients with ANLL likely to derive benefit from steroid therapy.","['Crabtree, G R', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Smith, K A', 'McKenna, R W', 'Peterson, B A', 'Hildebrandt, L', 'Munck, A']","['Crabtree GR', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Smith KA', 'McKenna RW', 'Peterson BA', 'Hildebrandt L', 'Munck A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*analysis/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*analysis', 'Receptors, Steroid/*analysis']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Nov;41(11 Pt 2):4853-6.,,,,"['AM-03535/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

We now report that an additional herbicide, propachlor (alpha-chloro-N-isopropyl-acetanilide), has a strong inhibitory effect on the proliferation of L1210 mouse leukemia cells. When tested in vitro against L1210 cells, propachlor displayed an ID50 on cell proliferation of less than 3 x 10(-7) M. Propachlor also inhibited significantly the uptake of leucine, thymidine and uridine. Kinetic experiments indicate that the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and precursor uptake are present after the first day of culture. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of propachlor is largely reversible in that cells grown in propachlor and then washed free of the compound return to a nearly normal rate of proliferation. Finally, these effects of propachlor were dependent on cell density, with greater activity occurring at higher propachlor to cell ratios.","['Zilkah, S', 'Osband, M E', 'McCaffrey, R P']","['Zilkah S', 'Osband ME', 'McCaffrey RP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Acetanilides)', '0 (Herbicides)', '015443A483 (propachlor)']",IM,"['Acetanilides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Herbicides', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice']",1981/08/01 00:00,1981/08/01 00:01,['1981/08/01 00:00'],"['1981/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-3835(81)90024-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(81)90024-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1981 Aug;13(3):241-8. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(81)90024-0.,,,,,,,,,

This clinical progression was associated with a change in cell morphology from small lymphocytes to an increasing number of large transformed lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. In the peripheral blood, the predominant large cell was a prolymphocyte. The small lymphocytes and the prolymphocytes had identical cell surface markers in each patient. However, the prolymphocytes had a greater density of surface immunoglobulin than did the same lymphocytes. No features were found that help predict in which patients CLL will convert to a more aggressive form. Once transformation has taken place, however, there appears to be a correlation between the number of prolymphocytes in the blood and patient survival. It is suggested that the entities of prolymphocytic transformation of CLL, prolymphocytic leukemia, and Richter's syndrome are less distinct than has been thought previously. These disorders probably represent several phases of transformation of the same cell type, and they may be examples of different stages in the natural history of CLL.","['Kjeldsberg, C R', 'Marty, J']","['Kjeldsberg CR', 'Marty J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19811201)48:11<2447::aid-cncr2820481118>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1981 Dec 1;48(11):2447-57. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19811201)48:11<2447::aid-cncr2820481118>3.0.co;2-b.,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the work was to determine if these cell surface glycoconjugates differ among different leukocyte populations and at different stages of development. In homogeneous form we purified large numbers of leukocytes from normal persons and persons with acute and chronic leukemias of myeloid and lymphoid types, using continuous flow centrifugation leukapheresis. We extracted the glycolipids from these cells and used thin-layer chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, direct probe mass spectrometry, and enzyme treatment to obtain complete structural information on these compounds. Twenty glycolipids were identified and sequenced, representing over 99% of the glycolipids of human leukocytes. The major findings are that human leukocytes possess glycolipid patterns that distinguish them from other blood cells. Additionally, leukocytes of ""myeloid' and ""lymphoid' types can be distinguished by their glycolipid type. Glycolipids in human leukemic cells show two main features: (1) even though the cells appear morphologically ""undifferentiated', all leukemias can be classified on the basis of their glycolipids as ""myeloid' or ""lymphoid'; (2) the complexity of their cell surface glycolipids is correlated with their degree of morphologic ""differentiation', the more differentiated leukemias having more complex structures. No glycolipids were found in leukemic leukocytes that were not found in the normal cells. Glycolipids would therefore appear to be useful as both cell- and possibly differentiation-specific markers in human blood cells. The antigenic differences seen in human leukemic cells may be due in part to an altered distribution of complex carbohydrates at the cell surface.","['Klock, J C', 'Macher, B A', 'Lee, W M']","['Klock JC', 'Macher BA', 'Lee WM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Carbohydrates/*analysis', 'Cell Membrane/analysis/immunology', 'Glycolipids/*analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*analysis/immunology', 'Membrane Lipids/*analysis']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1981;7(2):247-55.,,,,,,,,,

It has been argued that essential thrombocythemia should be classified together with those disorders as a myeloproliferative syndrome. However, without knowledge of the numbers and types of cells that are involved in essential thrombocythemia, this suggestion remains speculative. Three patients with thrombocytosis were studied. The diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia was considered to be firm in two patients and probable in the third one. The X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase locus was used as a cell marker.

TTM is the sum of: (1) the square root of the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes per nl, (2) the diameter of the largest palpable lymph node in centimetres, and (3) the enlargement of the spleen below left costal margin in centimetres. The validity of the proposed scoring system was evaluated in a prognostic study of 256 CLL patients. Patients with high TTM (greater than 9.0) at presentation had the expected median survival (EMS) of 39 months whereas patients with low TTM (less than 8.9) had EMS of 101 months (P less than 0.0005). TTM was a significant prognostic factor even when adjustment was performed for age, sex, lymphocyte count, response to therapy, TTM-distribution pattern and bone marrow failure. In contrast, the lymphocyte count was not prognostically significant when adjustment was performed for TTM. This suggests that TTM is a better indicator of tumour cell burden than the lymphocyte count. TTM measurement enables the analysis of the tumour mass size independently of other factors. TTM is a simple, objective parameter that can be measured as a continuous quantitative variable allowing derivation of new factors. TTM-doubling time and TTM-response to therapy were significant for prognosis (P less than 0.0005).

There is evidence that Indium 111 oxine is a reliable radioactive cell label for in vivo studies of lymphocyte traffic in man. In normal subjects, where 60-70% of the lymphocytes labelled are T cells, the results are different from those of previous workers. The lymphocytes leave the blood initially but later return to it. It is believed that this is due to the reappearance of cells which at first entered the spleen. It is suggested that the difference between these data and those of Hersey (1971) is due to the failure of lymphocytes in the latter studies to return to the blood after primary migration. In CLL no such reappearance in the blood is seen and the lymphocytes do not leave the spleen in significant numbers over 48 h. This suggests that CLL B cells either do not recirculate through spleen or that their transit time is greater than 48 h. Bone marrow localization in CLL patients is greater than in the normal subjects, suggesting that either a larger proportion of the neoplastic B lymphocytes enter this compartment or their transit time through it is longer than the transit time of a normal T cell predominant population. Localization in normal-sized lymph nodes in patients with CLL is less than that in the lymph nodes of normal subjects. This may possibly be explained by the greater propensity of T lymphocytes to enter lymph nodes than B lymphocytes, or by the altered migratory properties of CLL B lymphocytes as compared with normal B cells.","['Wagstaff, J', 'Gibson, C', 'Thatcher, N', 'Crowther, D']","['Wagstaff J', 'Gibson C', 'Thatcher N', 'Crowther D']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '045A6V3VFX (Indium)', '14514-42-2 (indium oxine)', '5UTX5635HP (Oxyquinoline)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/diagnostic imaging', 'Cell Movement', 'Humans', 'Indium', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/diagnostic imaging', 'Liver/diagnostic imaging', 'Lymph Nodes/diagnostic imaging', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', '*Organometallic Compounds', '*Oxyquinoline/*analogs & derivatives', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Spleen/diagnostic imaging']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb07225.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1981 Oct;49(2):283-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb07225.x.,,,,,,,,,

Cybrids were also prepared between enucleated rat hepatoma cells (FT-2) and mouse erythroleukemia cells (C19TK). The resultant cybrids selected in tyrosine-free medium expressed phenylalanine hydroxylase, an enzyme normally appeared to be the result of activation of the previously silent gene of the C19TK cells. These cybrids, however, did not express any other liver-specific functions present in the FT-2 cytoplast donor. These experiments suggest that the transfer of heritable properties by cell cybridization is selection specific and that activation or extinction observed in hybrids may not occur in cybrids of the same cells.","['Kahn, C R', 'Gopalakrishnan, T V', 'Weiss, M C']","['Kahn CR', 'Gopalakrishnan TV', 'Weiss MC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Somatic Cell Genet,Somatic cell genetics,7506054,"['66974FR9Q1 (Chloramphenicol)', 'EC 1.14.16.1 (Phenylalanine Hydroxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Chloramphenicol/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', '*Genes', 'Hybrid Cells/*physiology', 'Karyotyping', 'L Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Phenylalanine Hydroxylase/genetics', 'Selection, Genetic']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01549658 [doi]'],ppublish,Somatic Cell Genet. 1981 Sep;7(5):547-65. doi: 10.1007/BF01549658.,,,,,,,,,

These cells slightly differ in susceptibility to the drug, however, the effects of treatment are similar: 1. slowing down growth without affecting viability at low doses; 2. cell lethality at higher doses with rapid elimination of dead cells from the population and resuming normal growth; 3. decrease in 3H-thymidine incorporation. These effects of misonidazole were strikingly similar to those of antimycin A (1 microgram/ml) and KCN (1 mM). It seems that the common cause of the described manifestations of cellular damage inflicted by all three chemicals is energy depletion due to disturbances in the function of mitochondrial electron transport.","['Budzicka, E', 'Niepokojczycka, E', 'Szumiel, I']","['Budzicka E', 'Niepokojczycka E', 'Szumiel I']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Cyanides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nitroimidazoles)', '642-15-9 (Antimycin A)', '8FE7LTN8XE (Misonidazole)', 'MQD255M2ZO (Potassium Cyanide)']",IM,"['Aerobiosis', 'Animals', 'Antimycin A/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyanides/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Misonidazole/*pharmacology', 'Nitroimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Potassium Cyanide/*pharmacology']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1981;28(4):423-33.,,,,,,,,,

In man the Ph1-chromosome (9; 22) anomaly in CML or the 8; 14 translocation in the African malignant Burkitt Non-Hodgkin lymphoma are, among other cases, prominent examples. On the other hand, constitutive, inherited or novel chromosome anomalies conveyed from the zygote to all tissues of the organism may cause a higher risk for the origin of tumours. Rarely, inheritable minor structural chromosome mutations are known to determine the occurrence of dysontogenetic tumours, as e.g., nephroblastoma, but it is assumed that more such cases will become elucidated in the future. As a special phenomenon, true hydatiform mole is a tumour of the placental tissue due to a disorder of intragenome regulation. Constitutive or numerical structural chromosome anomalies of man are a frequent cause of early or late abortion or of abnormal development and malformation. Despite the predominating principle of selective fetal elimination, a few anomalies such as Down's syndrome, may escape to longer survival due to the relatively mild effects of chromosome 21 triplication. Trisomies which represent in man the most frequent type of chromosome disorders, can be induced, and systematically studied in an experimental model of the mouse. This allows the elaboration of the developmental profiles of all trisomies (and monosomies) of the mouse. Also, the above mentioned principle of selective elimination of abnormal implants can be analysed experimentally. Although the developmental span of a trisomic zygote is limited, there is evidence that cells and tissues isolated from the chromosomally abnormal organism can survive much longer. Thus, haemopoietic stem cells, at least in Ts 12 and 19 of the mouse, can be rescued from trisomic fetuses by transferring them to lethally irradiated adult mice, whose blood forming organs may eventually become permanently repopulated by the trisomic cell lineage. This type of experiments is suited for closer analyses of potential functions vs. defects of chromosomally abnormal cellular systems, e.g., with regard to growth and development.","['Gropp, A']",['Gropp A'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Wochenschr,Klinische Wochenschrift,2985205R,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Female', 'Genetic Code', 'Humans', 'Hydatidiform Mole/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy', 'Uterine Neoplasms/genetics']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02310971 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Wochenschr. 1981 Sep 1;59(17):965-75. doi: 10.1007/BF02310971.,,"Chromosomenaberrationen, Geschwulste und Entwicklungsstorungen.",,,,,,,

The inhibition of virus replication by the Fv-1 gene product has been determined to be at an early stage in virus replication. Mechanistically, its effect appears to be on the accumulation of unintegrated proviral DNA or its integration or both. We investigated the synthesis of unintegrated proviral DNA, using several clones of B-, N-, or NB-tropic Friend murine leukemia virus. Our results indicate that the accumulation of B-tropic proviral DNA in NIH cells may be inhibited at either the level of linear (form III) or covalently closed circular DNA (form I), depending upon the degree of restriction of the clone of virus used. We confirmed that there is an effect of the Fv-1 gene on the accumulation of form I DNA of either B- or N-tropic Friend murine leukemia virus. However, the decrease in infectious centers effected by the Fv-1 gene did not correlate quantitatively with the effect on form I proviral DNA produced by N-tropic Friend murine leukemia virus in nonpermissive cells. Lastly, we demonstrated in nonpermissively infected NIH cells that a rapidly migrating doublet of viral DNA is formed.","['Chinsky, J', 'Soeiro, R']","['Chinsky J', 'Soeiro R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA, Circular/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Virus Replication']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.40.1.45-55.1981 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Oct;40(1):45-55. doi: 10.1128/JVI.40.1.45-55.1981.,PMC256594,,,"['5T32GM7288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P3 OCA-13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Virus production, synthesis, and expression of viral proteins in Rauscher murine leukemia virus-infected mouse cells.",792-9,"Synchronized mouse cells (JLS-V9) chronically infected with Rauscher murine leukemia virus were used to study virus production, the synthesis of gag and env precursor proteins, and the expression of env protein on the cell surface during the cell cycle. The amount of virus released into the medium by synchronized cells during a 30-min interval was determined by using the XC plaque assay and by measuring reverse transcriptase activity. The results show that virus production occurs during mitosis. Labeling of the cell surface of synchronized cells with 125I or with fluorescein-conjugated antiserum shows that the amount of gp 70env on the cell surface parallels cellular growth. Therefore, the cell cycle-dependent release of virus is not accompanied by similar variations in the amount of viral envelope protein on the cell surface. Immunoprecipitation of cells labeled with [35S]methionine, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was used to measure viral protein synthesis during the cell cycle. The rate of synthesis of gag precursor proteins show three maximums corresponding to the G1, middle S, and late S to G2 phases of the cell cycle. The rate of synthesis of env precursor proteins does not change, suggesting that in these cells the synthesis of these two gene products is controlled separately.","['Balazs, I', 'Caldarella, J']","['Balazs I', 'Caldarella J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interphase', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitosis', 'Protein Precursors/*metabolism', 'Rauscher Virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.39.3.792-799.1981 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Sep;39(3):792-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.39.3.792-799.1981.,PMC171311,,,['CA-24008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

Pretreatment of CDF1 mice with a pharmacologic dose (2,000 mg/kg) of n-acetyl-l-cysteine 1 h before doxorubicin (20 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased lethality from 100% (n = 44) to 37.7% (n = 53), P less than 0.001. Variation in the timing and dose of n-acetylcysteine significantly diminished its protective activity. Pretreatment with n-acetylcysteine also significantly reduced long-term mortality in animals receiving multiple doses of doxorubicin; 10 wk after the third of three doxorubicin doses (5 mg/kg, i.p.) administered at 2-wk intervals, survival in the n-acetylcysteine pretreated group was 51.4% (n = 35) compared with 16.7% (n = 30) for animals receiving saline before doxorubicin, P less than 0.01. In this experiment, n-acetylcysteine pretreatment also diminished doxorubicin-related losses in total body weight and heart wet weight by 55.2% (P less than 0.05), and 60.9% (P less than 0.02), respectively, compared with animals pretreated with saline. N-acetylcysteine pretreatment also ablated electron microscopic evidence of doxorubicin cardiomyopathy without alleviating morphological features of its toxic effects on the liver or small intestinal mucosa. The cardioprotective action of n-acetylcysteine may be partially explained by the 429 +/- 60% increase in cardiac nonprotein sulfhydryl content (P less than 0.01) that was measured one hour after n-acetylcysteine administration; nonprotein sulfhydryl concentration in the liver at the same time was insignificantly different from control levels. Treatment with n-acetylcysteine also increased the nonprotein sulfhydryl content of P388 leukemia cells nearly threefold; however, it did not after the chemotherapeutic activity of doxorubicin against this murine tumor. Whereas n-acetylcysteine blocked doxorubicin cardiac toxicity, it did not affect the uptake or metabolism of doxorubicin in the heart or liver. These results suggest that the concentration of free sulfhydryl groups in the heart may play a role in the development of doxorubicin cardiac toxicity and that augmenting cardiac nonprotein sulfhydryl group content with n-acetylcysteine may provide a means to enhance the chemotherapeutic index of doxorubicin.","['Doroshow, J H', 'Locker, G Y', 'Ifrim, I', 'Myers, C E']","['Doroshow JH', 'Locker GY', 'Ifrim I', 'Myers CE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*antagonists & inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Drug Combinations', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/pathology']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/jci110328 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1981 Oct;68(4):1053-64. doi: 10.1172/jci110328.,PMC370893,,,['29463-01/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,

Rat basophil leukemia cells having IgE receptors were preincubated with monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl IgE. These cells were then exposed to liposomes containing dinitrophenyl conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine. The release of serotonin was measured. Using this system it was observed that liposomes containing dinitrophenyl conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine by aminoethylformamidomethoxy acetyl (but not by caproic acid) were able to trigger the release of serotonin. ""Solid"" liposomes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and 2 mol % hapten were more potent inducers of serotonin release than ""fluid"" liposomes composed of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and hapten, but the fluid liposomes definitely triggered the cells to release serotonin. The addition of cholesterol to both types of liposomes enhanced their potency as activators and diminished the difference between the two types of phospholipid. This occurred despite the fact that cholesterol renders the solid liposomes fluid. Since it is unlikely that these fluid membranes can provide lateral forces that produce IgE-Fc receptor molecular clustering, we conclude that either receptor clustering is not necessary for basophil triggering, or molecular clustering is driven by molecular forces derived from IgE and components of the basophil cell.","['Cooper, A D', 'Balakrishnan, K', 'McConnell, H M']","['Cooper AD', 'Balakrishnan K', 'McConnell HM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Liposomes)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Basophils/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', '*Haptens', '*Immunoglobulin E', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*metabolism', '*Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/*blood', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1981/09/25 00:00,1981/09/25 00:01,['1981/09/25 00:00'],"['1981/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)68768-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1981 Sep 25;256(18):9379-81.,,,,"['AI 13587/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 00503/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 18774/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

The transcription was entirely dependent on exogenous RNA polymerase, and was inhibited by actinomycin D, or a low dose of alpha-amanitin. Globin-specific sequences of the transcripts were determined by hybridization of 3H-labeled transcripts with plasmid DNA immobilized on filters. When chromatin from uninduced cells was used, less than 0.01% of the total radioactivity was retained on the globin DNA-filters, whereas about 0.05% was retained when chromatin was made from induced cells. This value was about one-ninth of the content of cytoplasmic globin mRNA which was pulse-labeled in induced cells. The transcription of whole chromatin or globin genes was inhibited almost completely by a rifampicin derivative, but in the case of chromatin, both sense and anti-sense strands of globin were transcribed. From these results, it is suggested that isolated chromatin retains some native conformation but is transcribed aberrantly.","['Nose, K', 'Tanaka, A', 'Okamoto, H']","['Nose K', 'Tanaka A', 'Okamoto H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Chromatin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/*enzymology', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/*metabolism', '*Genes', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Plasmids', 'RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a133438 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1981 Jul;90(1):103-11. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a133438.,,,,,,,,,

In most of the CLL patients studied, large percentages of CRL were impaired in their ability to undergo BAC-C3R cap formation compared to normal donors. The degree of impairment varied from one patient to the next. A consideration of clinical information suggested that the variation was related to the clinical response of patients to chemotherapy. Four categories of CLL patients could be identified on the basis of clinical data: (1) patients never received therapy for CLL; (2) those whose clinical history indicated a failure to respond to ongoing chemotherapy; (3) patients who had received successful prior chemotherapy and who were asymptomatic or stable and were receiving no therapy at the time of study; and (4) those who were undergoing therapy at the time of study and who subsequently became stable or asymptomatic and were removed from therapy. The first two categories of patients failed to show significant BAC-C3R capping, whereas the last two were able to form C3R caps on significant percentages of CRL. No direct relationship could be discerned between C3R capping and currently accepted classifications on stages (Rai) of CLL. These results suggest that monitoring the percentages of BAC-C3R cap-forming CRL may be useful in determining the success of chemotherapy of CLL patients. The microtubule-disrupting agent colchicine enhanced BAC-C3R capping in all CLL patients to normal levels, whereas the microfilament-disrupting agents cytochalasin B(CB) had no effect on CLL RBL C3R capping. CB totally abolished C3R capping of CRL from normal donors. These results suggest that abnormalities exist in both cytoskeletal and contractile systems of CR from CLL peripheral blood.","['Gormus, B J', 'Basara, M L', 'Oken, M M', 'Leech, S H', 'Kaplan, M E']","['Gormus BJ', 'Basara ML', 'Oken MM', 'Leech SH', 'Kaplan ME']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Complement C3/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Capping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Receptors, Complement/*immunology', 'Rosette Formation']",1981/02/15 00:00,1981/02/15 00:01,['1981/02/15 00:00'],"['1981/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910270205 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1981 Feb 15;27(2):151-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910270205.,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of anti-FMP1.1 serum and complement, only 15 +/- 2% (S.E.)

Direct typing of the FMP1.1 tumor demonstrated that it did not express the B-cell surface antigens such as Ia, surface immunoglobulin, Fc, and complement (C3) receptors. Although the Ly.6 alloantigen was present on FMP1.1 cells, this antigen was not found on marrow erythroid burst-forming units and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units. Absorption of anti-FMP1.1 serum with cross-reacting (WEHI-3 and W-279.1) and a nonreacting (P-815) cell line confirmed the specificity of the antiserum reaction with these cells and marrow progenitors. These experiments indicated that more than one antibody is contained in anti-FMP1.1 serum. Thus, the mast cell tumor (FMP1.1) carries an unusual array of antigens, which are found on bone marrow progenitors and are not expressed on the majority of differentiated cells.

Both assays revealed saturable binding of triamcinolone acetonide in all cases. The mean equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction of triamcinolone acetonide with the cytoplasmic receptor at 2 degrees was 9.45 +/- 6.33 (S.D.) nM while that for the whole-cell binding at 37 degrees was 6.13 +/- 3.25 nM, suggesting an increase in receptor affinity at physiological temperatures. Competition experiments with various unlabeled steroids revealed a higher degree of glucocorticoid specificity at 37 degrees in whole-cell suspensions than at 2 degrees in cytosol. In a comparative analysis of 41 leukemic cell specimens, it was found that determinations carried out by whole-cell assay, calculated as number of sites per cell correlated well with those performed by cytosol assay, calculated as fmol/mg protein, independent of the type of leukemia. However, for cells with low receptor content, the two assay methods were more difficult to compare. In agreement with previous reports, the cytosol assay consistently underestimated the number of receptors with respect to the whole-cell assay, particularly in cases of lymphatic leukemia. Furthermore, the underestimation decreased for increasing levels of total cellular receptor. These results suggest that, in addition to possible defects in the cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation process, the acceptor-binding capacity of the nucleus may also represent one of the factors which determines the levels of assayable cytoplasmic receptors. Moreover, they indicate that the two assay methods furnish nonequivalent information.","['Iacobelli, S', 'Natoli, V', 'Longo, P', 'Ranelletti, F O', 'De Rossi, G', 'Pasqualetti, D', 'Mandelli, F', 'Mastrangelo, R']","['Iacobelli S', 'Natoli V', 'Longo P', 'Ranelletti FO', 'De Rossi G', 'Pasqualetti D', 'Mandelli F', 'Mastrangelo R']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', 'F446C597KA (Triamcinolone Acetonide)']",IM,"['Cytosol/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*analysis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*analysis', 'Receptors, Steroid/*analysis', 'Temperature', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide/metabolism']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Oct;41(10):3979-84.,,,,,,,,,

The preleukemic states are clonal hematopoietic stem cell malignancies manifested by maturation and proliferation defects of the different cellular strains of the marrow.

On the other hand, controlled studies of therapy in preleukemic states are needed.","['Schneider, P']",['Schneider P'],['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Erythrocytes, Abnormal/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy']",1981/08/15 00:00,1981/08/15 00:01,['1981/08/15 00:00'],"['1981/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1981 Aug 15;111(33):1208-14.,,Les etats preleucemiques.,,,,,,,

Pathogenetically, neutropenia can be attributed one of the following mechanisms: insufficient (or inefficient) formation, enhanced destruction or utilization, or--rarely--shift to the marginal pool. Isolated neutropenia should be distinguished from neutropenia combined with anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. The latter is usually due to bone marrow failure, whereas the former depends on peripheral mechanisms. Drug induced neutropenia may appear either as unforeseen acute agranulocytosis (aminophenazone type), depending on preceding sensitization, or as a slowly developing, dose-dependent cytopenia. Gradually developing neutropenia is an early stage of a general disease (collagen diseases, leukemia and other neoplasias, infections).","['Bucher, U', 'Merlin, D']","['Bucher U', 'Merlin D']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,['VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)'],IM,"['Agranulocytosis/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Prednisone']",1981/08/15 00:00,1981/08/15 00:01,['1981/08/15 00:00'],"['1981/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1981/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1981 Aug 15;111(33):1186-93.,,Abklarung einer Neutropenie.,,,,,,,

In order to generate such force, the plane on which the cells were migrating, was inclined at different angles. The analysis of the L5222 cell migration pattern reveals that the modification of the cell movement direction relative to the surface appears when the plane is inclined at 1 degree. The increase of the slope to 2 degrees makes this effect more evident. When the slope is equal to 3 degrees the active motion of L5222 cells seems to disappear. The component of the gravitational force parallel to the plane on which the cells migrate ranges from 6.3 X 10(-15) N to 1.9 X 10(-14) N for the slopes from 1 degree to 3 degrees, respectively. The results of the study indicate that the force of interaction of migrating L5222 cells with the substrate is very small in comparison with the force of adhesion (not accompanied by locomotion) and seems to be comparable to that which operates in the near-substrate region of non-locomotive cells (e. g. L1210). Thus, the cell-substrate contact related to active movement and the non-locomotory adhesion of L5222 cells are probably different phenomena. As only L5222 cells were studied in this work, the above conclusions should be restricted to this cell type only.","['Doroszewski, J', 'Duszyk, M', 'Jakubas-Przewlocka, J']","['Doroszewski J', 'Duszyk M', 'Jakubas-Przewlocka J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gravitation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1981;28(1):67-77.,,,['NASA: 82013774'],,,,,,

When the dose rate was reduced from 50 rad/min to 0.8 rad/min, the shape of the dose--response curves changed from sigmoidal to exponential for cell killing, from upward concave to linear in 6-TGr mutations and remained linear in MTXr mutations. A linear quadratic model appears capable of explaining the cell killing and 6-TGr mutations but not the MTXr mutations. The declining patterns of induced mutation frequencies of 6-TGr and MTXr with decreasing dose rate seem to be similar. The addition of DMSO resulted in protection of cells from cell killing, 6-TGr and MTXr mutations with acute exposure, but had little effect with chronic exposure. The reduction of mutation frequency of the 6-TGr marker with chronic exposure was eliminated by holding cells in ice-cold condition during irradiation. These results suggest that there may be two components of induced mutation. One results primarily from repairable damage induced by the indirect action of radiation and shows a clear dose-rate dependency. The other is mainly from no-repairable damage by the direct action of radiation and is only slightly dose rate-dependent.

Schirrmacher (1) has suggested that the effect of the microenvironment on tumor cells influences the control of gene expression and that together with a selective process it may result in a newly arising phenotype. I suggest that in certain tumors the phenotypic change is the result of transfection of a mitotically active cell with certain DNA sequences arising from the tumor cells. Indirect evidence of support this suggested mechanism may be found in experimental results either interpreted differently or that happened to be by-products of experiments designed for other purposes. The appearance of tumors that acquire the allogeneic markers of their new allogeneic hosts suggests in vivo transfection with transforming DNA sequences (2, 4, 5, 6 7, 8). Experimental transfection of cells with DNA sequences resulting in transformation (19) strengthens this hypothesis. According to this hypothesis the immune system has a dual role in tumor alteration, it carries out the selection and it also induces the transformation of future new tumor phenotypes due to its potential to increase the availability of DNA breaks in the microenvironment.","['Klein, B Y']",['Klein BY'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L5178/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology', 'Phenotype', '*Transfection', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0306-9877(81)90010-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0306-9877(81)90010-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 1981 May;7(5):645-50. doi: 10.1016/0306-9877(81)90010-4.,,,,,,,,,

After de-O-isopropylidenation of 15, the crystalline product, benzyl 5-O-(methyl 2', 3', 4'-tri-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyluronate)-beta-D-ribofuranoside (16), was de-O-benzylated catalytically to 5-O-(methyl 2', 3', 4'-tri-O-acetyl-beta-glucopyranosyluronate)-D-ribofuranose (17).

Saponification of these compounds gave 5'-O-beta-D-glucuronides of 5-fluorouridine and 5-fluorocytidine (20 and 21) isolated as their crystalline N salts. These glucuronides were substrates of both bacterial and bovine beta-glucuronidase.

The results demonstrate that, in confirmation of earlier work from other laboratories, target cells are either sensitive or largely resistant to lysis, and such sensitivity correlates well with the neoplastic phenotype of the target cell. However, in target cell competition experiments all cultured cells as well as Con A-stimulated splenocytes and freshly isolated thymocytes exhibit the capacity to block cytolysis of sensitive indicator targets. In contrast, freshly prepared non-mitogen-stimulated splenic or lymph node lymphocytes are completely devoid of competitive activity.

Direct laboratory measurements of these parameters validated the model and made it possible to calibrate computer simulations by the technique of best-fit analysis. The computer modelling technique accurately simulated the growth of viable Ib cells in vivo and the retention times of 51Cr in the spleen, lung, liver and carcass when viable or heat-killed Ib cells were inoculated intravenously (i.v.) into normal and immune mice.

These ""preleukemia"" states include a variety of cytopenias, myeloproliferative disorders, and childhood syndromes. The cytogenetic alterations that occur nonrandomly in these dyscrasias are often similar to those observed in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and in the accelerated phase of chronic granulocytic leukemia: monosomy for chromosome 7; trisomy for 8,9,21, and the long arm of 1(1q); deletions of 5 and 20 (5q-, 20q-); and an isochromosome derived from 17 (iso 17q). These findings support the view that despite clinical differences, these various preleukemic disorders are all characterized by the presence in the hematopoietic tissues of a clone of cells derived from an altered hemic stem cell. Furthermore, the data suggest that preleukemia, chronic leukemia, and acute leukemia may be fundamentally similar diseases, differing primarily in the rate at which the aberrant clone is expanding. Chromosome studies may be of prognostic value in the cytopenic preleukemias. Patients with abnormalities show a decreased survival and are at increased risk for progression to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.

We have prepared the nonneurotoxic dihydroxybenzylamine (DHBA) analogs 2,3-DHBA, 3,4-DHBA, and 2,5-DHBA and the trihydroxy derivatives 2,3,4- and 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzylamine. These analogs demonstrated significant and reproducible antitumor activity in the ip P388 and L1210 lymphocytic leukemias. This activity was markedly increased when the drugs were given by multiple injections three times daily for 4 days. 3,4-DHBA and 2,3-DHBA resulted in 30% and 20% long-term survivors, respectively. There was a selective inhibition of thymidine incorporation and a relatively lesser effect on uridine and leucine incorporations. Inhibitory concentrations were between 0.1 and 1.0 mM. The trihydroxy derivatives were more potent, with inhibitory concentrations between 0.01 and 1.0 mM. Furthermore, the trihydroxy derivatives were also able to inhibit the incorporation of uridine and leucine as well as thymidine. The para derivative, 2,5-DHBA, although a potent inhibitor in vitro, was completely inactive in vivo. When L1210 and P388 tumor-bearing animals were given radioactive labeled thymidine in vivo following the administration of drugs. a selective inhibition of thymidine incorporation by tumor cells was observed, with essentially no effect on gut or bone marrow. Doses greater than 200 mg/kg completely suppressed the incorporation of radioactively labeled thymidine by tumor cells 1 hour after administration of drug. A similar dose response was observed in the more slowly growing P388 leukemia, suggesting that the antitumor effect did not strongly correlate with rate of the tumor. Since levodopa and dopamine are currently being evaluated in patients with metastatic melanoma, the availability of analogs with enhanced antitumor activity and broader antitumor spectrum are of interest.","['Wick, M M']",['Wick MM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '46627O600J (Levodopa)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dopamine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Levodopa/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1981 Sep-Oct;65(9-10):861-7.,,,,['CA-24988/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

L1210 cells in culture are sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of TdR, while TdR infusions in mice bearing L1210 ascites fail to prolong survival. Our results demonstrate that the TdR levels achieved in the serum and ascites fluid during sc and iv infusions range between 10(-4) and 10(-3) M. These levels are sufficient to inhibit the growth of bone marrow and intestinal mucosa cells, as evidenced by 32P incorporation studies. However, these TdR levels fail to exhibit the growth of L1210 ascites, despite the fact that these cells are sensitive to similar concentrations in vitro. The absence of growth inhibition in the L1210 ascites is shown to be due to increased endogenous CdR levels (approximately 2 X 10(-5) M) in the ascites fluid. The concomitant serum CdR levels were at least ten times lower than those achieved in the ascites. This factor probably accounts for the differential effect of TdR on normal cells as compared in vivo with agents such as TdR or even antimetabolites, such as cytarabine, may be modulated by increased CdR levels in the local tumor milieu. These studies are relevant in that TdR is currently being used in a variety of clinical protocols using the nucleoside alone at high doses or in combination with methotrexate, 5-FU, or cytarabine.","['Egan, E M', 'Sargent, L', 'Rosowsky, A', 'Kufe, D W']","['Egan EM', 'Sargent L', 'Rosowsky A', 'Kufe DW']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Deoxycytidine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Thymidine/blood/*pharmacology']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1981 Sep-Oct;65(9-10):853-60.,,,,['CA-19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

A great number of the cells disaggregated with the latter procedure were observed to attach to the bottom of culture flasks after 2 days in vitro; cells obtained with the former method were not attached. In general, the enzymatic procedure yielded a significantly larger number of viable cells that would undergo mitosis after short term culture and considerably improved the quality of banding as compared to the mechanical method. However, there were no significant differences among the basic karyotypes observed in the cells obtained by the mechanical approach versus those seen following the enzymatic method. This evidence, together with the high success rate of karyotyping in the enzyme-treated preparations, suggest that this should be the procedure of preference for cytogenetic examination of various tumors, particularly where in the past karyotypic examination has been very difficult, e.g., the early stages of tumor development.","['Wake, N', 'Slocum, H K', 'Rustum, Y M', 'Matsui, S', 'Sandberg, A A']","['Wake N', 'Slocum HK', 'Rustum YM', 'Matsui S', 'Sandberg AA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Metaphase', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(81)90050-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(81)90050-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1981 Jan;3(1):1-10. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(81)90050-9.,,,,"['CA-14555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Four of the patients had preleukemia, one had subacute myelomonocytic leukemia, and one polycythemia vera. In four patients, chemotaxis (migration towards a higher concentration of chemoattractant) and chemokinesis (stimulated migration without a gradient) were shown to be defective by both methods. In the remaining two patients, this defect could be demonstrated only by the Millipore filter assay or by the agarose assay. Under agarose, random locomotion (no chemoattractant present) of the patients' neutrophils was less than that of the control subjects in four patients, whereas no clear difference could be shown by the Millipore filter method. This study demonstrates that the previously described defect of neutrophil migration in monosomy-7 involves not only chemotaxis but all stimulated migration and, at least in some patients, random locomotion as well. Defective migration in two patients with an apparently terminal deletion of the long arm of one chromosome 7 indicates that the distal half of 7q carries genetic material important for neutrophil locomotion.","['Ruutu, P', 'Ruutu, T', 'Repo, H', 'Vuopio, P', 'Timonen, T', 'Kosunen, T U', 'de la Chapelle, A']","['Ruutu P', 'Ruutu T', 'Repo H', 'Vuopio P', 'Timonen T', 'Kosunen TU', 'de la Chapelle A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*blood', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Kinesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis', '*Neutrophils']",1981/10/01 00:00,1981/10/01 00:01,['1981/10/01 00:00'],"['1981/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63073-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1981 Oct;58(4):739-45.,,,,,,,,,

To characterize further the interaction between these drugs and intracellular DNA we have employed a modification of the alkaline elution technique which allows the detection of DNA double-stranded breaks. Ellipticine (1.25-5.0 microgram/ml) adriamycin (0.5-3.0 microgram/ml) and actinomycin D (1.5-3.0 microgram/ml) all caused double-stranded breaks in DNA from L1210 cells following a 1 h treatment. The number of double-stranded breaks found per single strand break was highest for ellipticine, despite the fact that this is least cytotoxic of the three drugs. By comparing the single and double strand break frequency caused by radiation to that caused by ellipticine, it appears that most if not all of the drug-induced single strand breaks observed actually represent double-strand breaks. We suggest that these double-strand breaks may result from the action of an intracellular enzyme, perhaps topoisomerase, which breaks both strans in concert to relieve the topological strain caused by drug intercalation.","['Ross, W E', 'Bradley, M O']","['Ross WE', 'Bradley MO']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Ellipticines/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice']",1981/06/26 00:00,1981/06/26 00:01,['1981/06/26 00:00'],"['1981/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2787(81)90145-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2787(81)90145-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1981 Jun 26;654(1):129-34. doi: 10.1016/0005-2787(81)90145-3.,,,,"['K04-CA-00537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-24586/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Therefore, the influence of 1-(2'-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-4-nitroimidazole vs. metronidazole on the semiconservative DNA synthesis prior to the following irradiation on leukemia cells L5178Y, on the reproductive capacity in V-70 cells on the Chinese hamster and on radiation-induced inhibition of tumour growth has been investigated in comparative experiments. The results showed a considerably lower inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis by 4-nitroimidazole compared with metronidazole. Neither substance has any influence on radiation-induced DNA synthesis under oxic conditions. Under hypoxia the 4-nitroimidazole derivative shows a little stronger radiosensitizing action than metronidazole. The radiation-induced decrease of the survival rate of V-79 cells is not influenced by either substance in well oxygenized cells, while being increased to approximately the same degree in hypoxic cultures.

The increased blood viscosity implies a great risk of disturbance of the microcirculation by leukostasis and bleeding. Removal of large amounts of leukemic cells by exchange transfusion with fresh blood diminished leukemic cell burden and reduced the initial elevated leukocyte counts by more than 50% in 3 patients. In addition, anemia and thrombocytopenia improved and the disturbed plasma coagulation returned to normal. One of the patients with additional risk factors treated by exchange transfusion died 8 months after diagnosis in hematologic release. The two other patients perform well without relapse six and nine months after diagnosis, respectively. Exchange transfusion with 150 ml/kg of fresh blood is considered to be of value to avoid severe early complications as e.g. massive intracerebral hemorrhage observed in 3 other patients and to correct hematological and rheological abnormalities in childhood leukemia with extreme leukocytosis.

It was injected intravenously over 5 s and clearance was characterized over the next 60 min. The low dose of C. parvum did not cause any symptoms. The blood or plasma clearance time (t 1/2) was in the range of 0.65 to 1.96 min, in eight patients. By whole body imaging, the distribution of C. parvum was found mainly in the liver, and to a much lesser extent in the spleen, lungs, and bone marrow. Nonparticulate 99mTc (which was not sedimented by centrifugation of blood samples at 3000 rpm for 30 min) appeared rapidly in the blood after i.v. injection accounting for more than half of the radioactivity in a few minutes. In vitro incubation of 99mTc labeled C. parvum with saline, whole blood, serum or leukocytes revealed that the release of free 99mTc resulted from the combined action of serum and leukocytes.

A comparative study of plasma lipoproteins of normal and neoplastic animals.,219-24,"The defect of regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by leukemic (L2C) guinea pig lymphocytes is not a consequence of serum lipoprotein modifications which would make them unable to participate in the regulatory process. Low density lipoprotein of leukemic animals, in parallel to normal low density lipoprotein, can inhibit the cholesterol biosynthesis by normal cells. Surprisingly, very low density lipoprotein of leukemic animals have the same inhibitory property. Analyses of serum of leukemic animals showed a larger amount of the different lipoprotein fractions (+323% very low density, +27% low density lipoproteins, the high density lipoprotein staying undetectable in control and leukemic sera) than in normal serum. L2C leukemia produces low density lipoprotein slightly richer in unesterified cholesterol and very low density lipoprotein markedly modified by an increased proportion of unesterified cholesterol, phospholipids and apoprotein B. The inhibitory power of leukemic very low density lipoprotein is discussed by analogy with corresponding power of normal low density lipoprotein which can operate either by the way of binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor or by exchange of unesterified cholesterol between the lipoprotein and the cell.","['Chuillon Sainte-Marie, J', 'Authier, M H', 'Cayzac, M', 'Philippot, J R']","['Chuillon Sainte-Marie J', 'Authier MH', 'Cayzac M', 'Philippot JR']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Lipoproteins, VLDL)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cholesterol/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Lipoproteins/blood/*pharmacology', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/blood/pharmacology', 'Lipoproteins, VLDL/blood', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phospholipids/analysis', 'Triglycerides/analysis']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1981.tb06325.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1981 Jun;117(1):219-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1981.tb06325.x.,,,,,,,,,

Whole cell and cytoplasmic binding properties of lymphoblastoid, leukaemia and lymphoma lines.",189-98,The glucocorticoid binding properties of 18 human lymphoid cell lines (HLCL) have been investigated. The specificity of steroid binding was confirmed with various glucocorticoid agonists and antagonists. A gradation in whole cell and cytoplasmic glucocorticoid binding capacity was observed in the different cell line types: lymphoblastoid greater than lymphoma greater than leukaemia. The cytoplasmic receptors of leukaemia and lymphoblastoid lines appeared to contain both proteinaceous and phospholipid components. Cytoplasmic steroid-receptor complexes exhibited a wide range of sedimentation coefficients (8.5-11.3S) in low ionic strength buffer but there was no correlation with cell line type or glucocorticoid sensitivity. Activation of these complexes by heat (37 degrees C) or exposure to high ionic strength buffer (0.3 M NaCl) induced nuclear binding of steroid but only complexes in high ionic strength buffer manifested changes in sedimentation coefficient. No correlation was observed between the level or nature of glucocorticoid binding and the cytolethal or cytostatic responsiveness of HLCL to glucocorticoid treatment in vitro. The resistance to cytolethal effects cannot be ascribed to a failure of cells to take up and bind steroid or to significant differences in the molecular species of cytoplasmic receptors present. The molecular mechanisms by which glucocorticoids achieve cytolethal responses in human lymphoid cells has still to be resolved.,"['Barrett, I D', 'Panesar, N S', 'Bird, C C', 'Abbott, A C', 'Burrow, H M', 'Steel, C M']","['Barrett ID', 'Panesar NS', 'Bird CC', 'Abbott AC', 'Burrow HM', 'Steel CM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Diagn Histopathol,Diagnostic histopathology,8103005,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/physiology']",1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Diagn Histopathol. 1981 Apr-Jun;4(2):189-98.,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of D administered as free drug or linked to DNA was studied in 15 adult patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia. The data obtained following infusion of free drug over either 45 or 240 min could be fitted to a two-compartment open-body model. With the D-DNA infusion considerably higher plasma concentrations were achieved, with a slower distribution and elimination from plasma than seen after the administration of free drug. this confirmed earlier animal data indicating a different pharmacokinetic behavior of D when it was administered linked to DNA. Furthermore, different pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained for D during infusion and in the post-infusion phase after administration of DNA-linked D (P less than 0.005). This finding strongly indicates that the D-DNA acts as a slow-release preparation in humans, which might modify tissue distribution and toxic side-effects of the drug.","['Nilsson, S O', 'Andersson, B', 'Eksborg, S', 'Beran, M', 'Ehrsson, H']","['Nilsson SO', 'Andersson B', 'Eksborg S', 'Beran M', 'Ehrsson H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (daunorubicin-DNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['DNA/*metabolism', '*DNA Adducts', 'Daunorubicin/blood/*metabolism', 'Drug Combinations/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Time Factors']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00434395 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1981;5(4):261-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00434395.,,,,,,,,,

Preincubation of the myocardial cells with varying concentrations of adenosine (10 microM to 1 mM) for 24 hr prior to the addition of anthracycline decreased or prevented drug-induced enzyme release. Other putative myocardial protectants, i.e., N-acetyl-L-cysteine, alpha-tocopherol, or carnitine, were ineffective in preventing anthracycline-induced enzyme release. Although adenosine was an effective myocardial protectant, it had no significant effect on cellular uptake of daunorubicin, nor did adenosine adversely affect the oncolytic activity of daunorubicin against L1210 leukemia cells in vitro. Anthramycin, another oncolytic agent having reported cardiotoxic effects, was also tested in the in vitro system. With this drug, however, no enzyme release was detected at less than lethal doses nor did adenosine have any protective potential against the toxicity of anthramycin. Finally, Adriamycin caused no significant lactic dehydrogenase release when incubated at 1.8 or 18 microM with H9c2 cells, a cell line having primarily skeletal muscle characteristics. This result suggests a specific toxicity of anthracyclines for myocardial but not skeletal muscle cells.","['Newman, R A', 'Hacker, M P', 'Krakoff, I H']","['Newman RA', 'Hacker MP', 'Krakoff IH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Creatine Kinase/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*adverse effects/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Doxorubicin/*adverse effects/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Male', 'Myocardium/enzymology', 'Rats', 'Time Factors']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Sep;41(9 Pt 1):3483-8.,,,,"['CA 22435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Cytidine triphosphate synthetase has been proposed as the primary target for this agent. Our results demonstrate that Acivicin is also an inhibitor of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. This inhibition results in the depletion of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools and explains the effect of this agent on DNA synthesis. Further, Acivicin is synergistic with N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartic acid, another inhibitor of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. The combination of these agents results in a more than additive depletion of deoxycytidine triphosphate pools which may account for their synergism in inhibiting cellular growth. Thus, the inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis by Acivicin may be useful in modulating the effects of certain antimetabolites or other inhibitors of this pathway.","['Loh, E', 'Kufe, D W']","['Loh E', 'Kufe DW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '61H4T033E5 (Orotic Acid)', '78QVZ7RG8L (sparfosic acid)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)', 'O0X60K76I6 (acivicin)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aspartic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glycine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Isoxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Orotic Acid/analogs & derivatives', 'Oxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleosides/biosynthesis']",1981/09/01 00:00,1981/09/01 00:01,['1981/09/01 00:00'],"['1981/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Sep;41(9 Pt 1):3419-23.,,,,['CA-28488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,

The use of these agents in remission consolidation therapy may offer the possibility of providing a reduction in residual resistant cells that are present after successful remission induction therapy with conventional agents.","['Early, A P', 'Preisler, H D', 'Gottlieb, A J', 'Lanchant, N A']","['Early AP', 'Preisler HD', 'Gottlieb AJ', 'Lanchant NA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb02728.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1981 Jul;48(3):369-75. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb02728.x.,,,,"['CA-2599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-5834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Four cases of these diseases had been diagnosed in the town's population in the previous 10 months. Residents were concerned about environmental hazards such as background radiation and contamination of their water supply. A total environmental study of the area was not feasible or warranted, but certain environmental studies of the area were conducted. No environmental health hazards were identified. Incidence rates for towns in the four-county area (population 281,000) surrounding the study town were analyzed, based on data from the New York State Cancer Registry. These four counties had been severely affected by the flood following the 1972 Hurricane Agnes. Examination of annual leukemia and lymphoma incidence rates for these counties for 1966--77 revealed that the rates for towns in the river valley (population 102,000), but not for nonriver-valley towns, were 20 to 50 percent above the statewide rates for 1972--77. All other cancer rates remained level throughout both periods. An analysis of spontaneous abortion rates for the four counties for 1968--77 showed a significant peak in 1973, but not for the rest of upstate New York. The peak was concentrated in the towns in the river valley. The apparent time-space cluster of leukemias and lymphomas in conjunction with a marked increase in the spontaneous abortion rate suggests an unidentified flood-related environmental exposure.","['Janerich, D T', 'Stark, A D', 'Greenwald, P', 'Burnett, W S', 'Jacobson, H I', 'McCusker, J']","['Janerich DT', 'Stark AD', 'Greenwald P', 'Burnett WS', 'Jacobson HI', 'McCusker J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Public Health Rep,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",9716844,,IM,"['Abortion, Spontaneous/*epidemiology', '*Disasters', 'Environmental Pollution/*analysis', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'New York', 'Pregnancy', 'Rural Population', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'Stress, Psychological/complications']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Public Health Rep. 1981 Jul-Aug;96(4):350-6.,PMC1424239,,,,,,,,

A companion study examined self-report of depressive symptoms; the present study relied on a semistructured interview technique. Eighty patients who were hospitalized on a research oncology ward for treatment of disseminated cancer, acute leukemia, Stage IV Hodgkin's disease, or myeloma were compared by means of the Current and Past Psychopathology Scales (CAPPS) to 80 patients hospitalized on a psychiatric unit for attempted suicide. Interviewer ratings yielded scores on eight scales characterizing each patient's psychologic adjustment during the past month and 18 scales characterizing adjustment prior to the present illness (cancer or suicide attempt). Results showed that by both self-report and observer report, cancer patients wee less depressed and anxious in the past month than the psychiatric group. Approximately one-third on the cancer patients were significantly depressed, depending on the measure used; one-seventh had experienced some suicidal ideation. Cancer patients were better adjusted in the past than the comparison group; however, the cancer patients who were presently most depressed were those who had a prior history of depression and had shown a tendency to brood. Among cancer patients who died during the study period, no correlation between severity of depression and nearness to death could be found. Findings supported use of denial of dysphoric emotions by the cancer patients, but little denial of the diagnosis or the need to accept treatment. Despite stress of advanced illness and threat to life, cancer patient's reality testing and social role performance were superior to that of the suicide attempters, and on the average they had less disturbance of affect and cognition.","['Plumb, M', 'Holland, J']","['Plumb M', 'Holland J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Psychosom Med,Psychosomatic medicine,0376505,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Depression/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Suicide, Attempted/psychology']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006842-198106000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychosom Med. 1981 Jun;43(3):243-54. doi: 10.1097/00006842-198106000-00006.,,,,,,,,,

These viruses apparently originate from ecotropic and xenotropic precursors in the late preleukaemic stage of the disease. Analyses of their structural proteins and genomic oligonucleotides indicate that they arise by recombination of env genes of the precursor viruses. This event leads to a viral envelope glycoprotein (gp70) with some peptides that have features of the gp70 glycoproteins of ecotropic and xenotropic viruses, and others that are unique for each recombinant virus. The former property explains the broad host range of recombinant viruses, and hence their designation as dual tropic or polytropic viruses. It has been postulated that the unique aspect of each recombinant's gp70 determines the phenotypes of leukaemic cells. Polytropic viruses may be highly thymotropic. Their systemic administration results in an infection that confines itself virtually to the thymus. Moreover, these viruses are leukaemogenic whereas their precursors are not, or only weakly so. The leukaemogenicity of polytropic viruses is, however, restricted to certain inbred strains of mice. The HRS/J isolate PTV-1 is leukaemogenic in HRS/J and CBA/J mice, but not in SWR/J or NIH/Swiss mice. The experiments described here demonstrate that a single dominant gene permits infection by thymocytes by a leukaemogenic polytrophic virus. CBA/J mice, which develop thymic leukaemia after infection by this virus, posesses this gene, whereas leukaemia-resistant NFS mice lack it.","['Schwartz, R S', 'Khiroya, R H']","['Schwartz RS', 'Khiroya RH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,IM,"['Animals', '*Genes, Dominant', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology']",1981/07/16 00:00,1981/07/16 00:01,['1981/07/16 00:00'],"['1981/07/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/16 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/292245a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1981 Jul 16;292(5820):245-6. doi: 10.1038/292245a0.,,,,"['CA10018/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24530/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Peak enzyme activity which occurred on day 3 was not present in adherent cells from BCG-treated tumor-bearing animals or the control animals. The beta-glucuronidase activity in peritoneal lavage fluid was elevated by the tumor cells, BCG, or C. parvum. Peak levels occurred on day 5 regardless of the treatment with an additive effect present on day 5 in animals receiving the combination of tumor with C. parvum. The evidence indicated the development of a different pattern of enhanced lysosomal enzyme activity if the immunopotentiator protected against the P388 tumor vs one that did not. Protection was associated with an increase in lysosomal enzyme activity in adherent cells with no increase in lavage fluid in the presence of tumor cells.

We found that feeder layer cells (human diploid fibroblast IMR-90) constantly produce thiol compounds; cysteine was the major thiol compound accumulating in the culture medium. In the culture medium of L1210 cells, added cysteine was rapidly oxidized and was toxic to the cells at high concentrations. However, cysteine promoted growth of L1210 cells when it was added repeatedly to the medium at low concentrations. These results show that the major role of feeder layer cells is to provide cysteine continuously. The glutathione content of L1210 cells depended largely on the cysteine concentration in the medium. In normal culture media containing cystine but not cysteine, the cellular glutathione content decreased notably within a few hours. Cysteine had to be supplied repeatedly to keep the content high. Cystine promoted the cellular glutathione content at unphysiologically high concentrations. These results were attributable to the extremely low uptake rate of cystine by the cells as compared with that of cysteine. In the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, the uptake of radioactive cystine by the cells was increased and a high cellular glutathione level was maintained. A thiol-independent variant of L1210 took up cystine far more rapidly than L1210. From these results we concluded that the deficiency of the cystine uptake limits the growth of L1210 cells in normal culture media.","['Ishii, T', 'Hishinuma, I', 'Bannai, S', 'Sugita, Y']","['Ishii T', 'Hishinuma I', 'Bannai S', 'Sugita Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Culture Media)', '48TCX9A1VT (Cystine)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Cysteine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cystine/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', '*Lymphoma', 'Mercaptoethanol/*pharmacology', 'Mice']",1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041070215 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1981 May;107(2):283-93. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041070215.,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, patients less than 50 years of age have a high likelihood of achieving a second complete remission; it is in this group that maintenance chemotherapy adds only to morbidity.","['Lewis, J P', 'Pajak, T F', 'Linman, J W', 'Bateman, J R']","['Lewis JP', 'Pajak TF', 'Linman JW', 'Bateman JR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Clin Trials,Cancer clinical trials,7905482,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Thioguanine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Clin Trials. 1981;4(2):115-24.,,,,,,,,,

To analyze the functions of these glycoproteins and to develop a model system for studying genetics of membrane synthesis, we used an immunoselection method to isolate variant cell clones defective in processing these glycoproteins into their plasma membranes. Several lines of evidence, including complementation of glycoprotein processing defects by fusion with uninfected wild-type cells, indicate that the immunoselected variants have stably inherited membrane synthesis abnormalities that are encoded by cellular rather than by viral genes. The H-4 cell line, which was selected by use of antiserum to gp70, has metabolic defects that interfere with processing of both gp70 and gp93gag into its plasma membranes. Nevertheless, this cell line releases noninfectious MuLV. Furthermore, two cell lines (2 and 5), which were selected by use of antiserum to the virion core protein p30, specifically lack detectable cell surface or intracellular gp93gag but contain cell surface gp70 and release infectious MuLV. These results suggest that MuLV particles can bud efficiently from cells that lack known virus-encoded plasma membrane constituents.","['Fitting, T', 'Ruta, M', 'Kabat, D']","['Fitting T', 'Ruta M', 'Kabat D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/growth & development/*metabolism', '*Genes', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Rats', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(81)90110-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(81)90110-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1981 Jun;24(3):847-58. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(81)90110-0.,,,,,,,,,

All reintegrated genomes carry long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences at both termini of their genome. In the preleukemic stage a large population of cells exhibiting a random distribution of reintegrated M-MuLV genomes are seen, but during outgrowth of the tumor, selection of cells occurs leaving one or a few clonal descendants in the outgrown tumor. In this latter stage recombinant genomes can be detected. Although these recombinants constitute a heterogeneous group of proviruses, characteristic molecular markers are conserved among many individual proviral recombinants, lending credence to the notion that a certain recombinant structure is a prerequisite for the onset of neoplasia. The structure of these recombinants shows close structural similarities to the previously described mink cell focus-inducing (MCF)-type viruses.","['van der Putten, H', 'Quint, W', 'van Raaij, J', 'Maandag, E R', 'Verma, I M', 'Berns, A']","['van der Putten H', 'Quint W', 'van Raaij J', 'Maandag ER', 'Verma IM', 'Berns A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(81)90099-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(81)90099-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1981 Jun;24(3):729-39. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(81)90099-4.,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of mice bearing i.p. implants of the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, leukemia L1210/TG8, and colon carcinoma 26 with potentially lethal dosages of tubercidin administered together with host-protecting dosages of NBMPR-P resulted in substantial kill of neoplastic cells and long-term survivors.

However, at supraoptimal dosages of NBMPR-P, the occurrence of therapeutic failures which were neoplastic deaths indicated that NBMPR-P also protected the neoplastic ascites cells against tubercidin cytotoxicity.

As determined with HeLa cells, the inhibition of cell growth was partially prevented by 2'-deoxycytidine (dCyd) and cytidine but not by uridine or thymidine. Cytarazid proved resistant to deamination by human cytidine/dCyd deaminases purified from acute myelocytic leukemia blast cells and from liver, a property reflected in the inability of tetrahydrouridine to enhance the cytotoxicity of the compound. Cytarazid served as a substrate for cytoplasmic dCyd kinase partially purified from human peripheral chronic lymphocytic leukemia blast cells. At a concentration of 0.4 mM, the nucleoside analog was phosphorylated 2.6 times more effectively by this enzyme than was dCyd, the Km for Cytarazid being 250 microM. In intact HeLa cells, the triphosphate derivative of Cytarazid was the major drug metabolite formed. In these cells, the analog interfered with the incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine into DNA at a concentration and a time interval at which the incorporation of uridine into RNA and amino acids into protein was not inhibited, suggesting that interference with DNA synthesis is a primary drug effect. Further analysis showed that Cytarazid triphosphate interferes with DNA synthesis in intact HeLa cell nuclei and that it inhibits both the alpha- and beta-DNA polymerases purified from HeLa cells in a manner competitive with deoxycytidine triphosphate, with Ki's of 0.6 and 0.7 microM, respectively.

The discovery that some but not all human tumor cells actively resist cellular immune attack, perhaps by repair mechanisms dependent upon protein synthesis, provides a new model for evaluation of tumor cells in their resistance to host defenses.","['Hudig, D', 'Djobadze, M', 'Redelman, D', 'Mendelsohn, J']","['Hudig D', 'Djobadze M', 'Redelman D', 'Mendelsohn J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'X8D5EPO80M (Emetine)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Emetine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Puromycin/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms']",1981/07/01 00:00,1981/07/01 00:01,['1981/07/01 00:00'],"['1981/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Jul;41(7):2803-8.,,,,"['CA 24450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA R23-26223/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,

Sonication methods were utilized to solubilize these lipophilic derivatives in aqueous solution in order to facilitate such biological evaluation; the ara-A derivative resisted solubilization by several techniques. The nucleoside:phospholipid conjugates of ara-C and tubercidin both were cytotoxic towards the two cell lines, and detailed experiments were cytotoxic towards the two cell lines, and detailed experiments were carried out to show that the new derivatives (a) were not degraded in the medium prior to cellular uptake and (b) acted as prodrugs or molecular depots of the parent nucleoside analog.

Although those cells transport thymidine with two kinetic components (Km values of 160 microM), they lacked the lowest Km system present in AKR splenocytes. Thymidine transport was also examined in lymphocytes from several AK x L recombinant inbred mouse strains derived from the cross AKR/J x C57L/J. Two strains which lacked MuLV did not show time-dependent thymidine translocation whereas two strains which possessed MuLV demonstrated time-dependent thymidine translocation.

The overall process has been clearly shown to proceed stepwise. In the absence of cytosol proteins DNA chain growth tends to stop after the addition of approximately 200 nucleotides to the ends of growing chains. In the presence of cytosol proteins these sections grow to approximately 250 nucleotides, and participate in the stepwise extension of the replication process through adjacent nucleosomal sections of the template. Immediately following pulse labeling, the newly replicated DNA resides in a chromatin form which appears to be relatively resistant to digestion by micrococcal nuclease. During a chase interval, the association of the pulse-labeled DNA with nuclear proteins matures to a form which yields lengths of DNA upon digestion with micrococcal nuclease that correspond to mono-, di-, tri- and polynucleosomal units of chromatin. In the absence of cytosol proteins the nuclease resistant state of the labeled DNA tends to predominate and persist. The data support the view that DNA replication in a chromosomal setting proceeds stepwise over successive nucleosomal sections of template made accessible by the interaction of the cytosol proteins at or near the replication fork.","['Muller, M T', 'Kajiwara, K', 'Mueller, G C']","['Muller MT', 'Kajiwara K', 'Mueller GC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', '*DNA Replication', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism']",1981/05/29 00:00,1981/05/29 00:01,['1981/05/29 00:00'],"['1981/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2787(81)90195-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2787(81)90195-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1981 May 29;653(3):391-407. doi: 10.1016/0005-2787(81)90195-7.,,,,"['CA-07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09230/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23076/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Using a method in which platelet IgG is extracted into the fluid phase after appropriate procedures, we were able to bind the 'solubilized' PAIgG to commercially obtained antihuman IgG (AHG) which had previously been coated onto polystyrene. The amount of PAIgG thus bound was subsequently measured by the addition of the enzyme reagent using p-nitro phenyl phosphate as substrate. With this technique platelets from normal donors were found to have 2.6-17.4 ng/10(6) platelets (mean +/-2 SD). These values are higher than those obtained when assay systems using intact platelets are employed. Platelets from patients with immune thrombocytopenia had PAIgG values of 8.2-98.0 ng/10(6) platelets. In a few patients with disorders other than autoimmune thrombocytopenia (AITP) increased levels of PAIgG were also demonstrated. The assumption that increased PAIgG always represents platelet autoantibody may not be valid. The relevance of PAIgG as a parameter in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with AITP is discussed.","['Hegde, U M', 'Powell, D K', 'Bowes, A', 'Gordon-Smith, E C']","['Hegde UM', 'Powell DK', 'Bowes A', 'Gordon-Smith EC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Polystyrenes)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology', 'Blood Platelets/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Polystyrenes', 'Thrombocytopenia/immunology']",1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.00039.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1981 May;48(1):39-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.00039.x.,,,,,,,,,

While GCSAa was specifically expressed on Gross-type virus (G-MuLV)-induced lymphoma cells, and while G-MuLV and G-related MuLV induced a high level of GCSAa expression on murine fibroblasts, the Friend-Moloney-Rauscher (FMR) group viruses (FMR MuLV) and xenotropic isolates were also able to induce a high or intermediate level of GCSAa. Since GCSAa has been shown to be borne by glycosylated precursors of the viral nucleocapside (gp95gag and gp85gag), the amount of GCSAa expressed on these cells was compared to the level of cytoplasmic p30. In G- and G-related MuLV-infected cell lines, a significant relationship was found between the amount of GCSAa and the level of p30, whereas in FMR-MuLV or xenotropic virus-infected cells the amount of GCSAa varied independently of the p30 level.

In evaluating radiation hazards, analytic studies have utilized the cohort type of investigation (where persons exposed and not exposed to radiation are followed forward in time for determination of disease experience) or case-control approaches (where persons with and without a specific disease are evaluated for previous exposure to radiation). Most radiation studies have evaluated cohorts (e.g., radiologists), although important case-control studies have been conducted (e.g., childhood leukemia as related to prenatal x ray). At its best, epidemiology is capable fo evaluating relative risks (RR) on the order of 1.4 (i.e., a 40% relative excess). However, the RRs of interest following low doses of radiation (1 rad) are on the order of 1.02-1.002. Thus, not much should be anticipated from direct observations at 1 rad, and indirect approaches must be taken to estimate low-dose effects. Such indirect approaches include evaluating 1) populations exposed to a range of doses, both low and high, where interpolation models can be reasonably applied to estimate low-dose effects; and 2) populations exposed to fractionated doses over a long period of time where the resulting dose-effect relationship theoretically should be linear and the estimation of low-level health effects facilitated.","['Boice, J D']",['Boice JD'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Forensic Med Pathol,The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology,8108948,,IM,"['Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation Injuries', 'Research Design', 'Risk']",1980/12/01 00:00,1980/12/01 00:01,['1980/12/01 00:00'],"['1980/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Forensic Med Pathol. 1980 Dec;1(4):318-23.,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-eight patients who received prophylactic granulocyte transfusions from related donors when their phagocyte counts decreased to less than 1000 microliter were compared to twenty-five controls who did not have qualified donors from which to obtain granulocyte transfusions. The frequency of complete remissions (CR) (28/38 versus 7/25) was significantly greater for the granulocyte transfusion group than for controls. Patients older than 45 responded more often in the transfused group (P less than 0.025) when compared to the similar age group in controls. Both duration of complete remission and survival were greater in the granulocyte transfused group. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Survival for all responders (complete plus partial remission) was longer for the granulocyte transfusion group (P = 0.01). No significant difference in frequency or severity of either infection or hemorrhage was noted in the two groups. The advantage noted in this study largely occurred in patients older than 45 and this suggests that this age group is more likely to respond if they have histocompatible donors from which to obtain granulocyte and platelet transfusions.

Virol. 38:125-135, 1981). Such proviruses lack the right end of the wild-type HSV DNA genome corresponding to the 3'-proximal portion of the viral RNA. As expected, the RNA transcripts of these deleted HSV (delHSV) proviruses lacked sequences normally found at the 3' end of wild-type HSV RNA. Since frequently these delHSV RNA transcripts were longer than wild-type HSV RNA, we suggest that transcription proceeded through the deleted provirus and continued into flanking nonviral sequences. When delHSV-transformed cells were infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV), delHSV RNA was pseudotyped into new virus particles, demonstrating that the 3'-proximal sequences of wild-type HSV RNA are not essential for virion RNA encapsidation. Cells which carried a delHSV genome and were infected with M-MLV helper released very low titers of highly transmissible sarcoma virus. The inability to rescue high titers of sarcoma virus from these cells reflected the necessary presence of the deleted 3'-terminal sequences for normal efficient transmission of the sarcoma virus genome (Goldfarb and Weinberg, J. Virol. 38:125-135, 1981). The small amount of highly transmissible sarcoma virus rescuable from delHSV-transformed cells originated via genetic recombination between del HSV and the M-MLV helper used for the sarcoma virus rescue. The recombinant sarcoma virus genomes reacquired a competent 3' genomic end from the parental M-MLV genome, which restored efficient transmissibility. The locations of sites for recombination between the delHSV and M-MLV genomes appeared to be nonrandom. These sites were in genomic regions where the parental genomes bore no detectable sequence homology. Structural mapping of these recombinant sarcoma virus genomes indicated that the HSV transformation gene lies within 2.0 kilobases of the RNA 5' end. Based upon our genetic recombination studies, we suggest a model to explain how leukemia viruses can recombine with cellular sequences to generate novel defective viruses.","['Goldfarb, M P', 'Weinberg, R A']","['Goldfarb MP', 'Weinberg RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Defective Viruses/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Virus Replication']",1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.38.1.136-150.1981 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1981 Apr;38(1):136-50. doi: 10.1128/JVI.38.1.136-150.1981.,PMC171133,,,"['CA-14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,

Infection of these transformed cells with Moloney murine leukemia helper virus was followed by release of infectious particles. The HSV provirus within these transfected cells was convalently joined to nonviral DNA sequences and was termed ""cell-linked"" HSV DNA. The association of this cell-virus DNA sequence with the chromosomal DNA of a transfected cell was unclear. NIH 3T3 cells could also become transformed by transfection with this cell-linked HSV DNA. In this case, the recipient cells generally acquired a donor DNA fragment containing both the HSV provirus and its flanking nonviral sequences. After cells acquired either unintegrated or cell-linked HSV DNA, the newly established provirus and flanking cellular sequences underwent amplifications to between 5 and 100 copies per diploid cell. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with HSV DNA may acquire deleted proviral DNA lacking at least 1.3 kilobase pairs from the right end of full-length HSV 6-kilobase-pair DNA (corresponding to the 3'-proximal portion of wild-type HSV RNA).

For the former complexes, trans isomers are more efficacious than the corresponding cis isomers. For the latter complexes, cis isomers seem to be somewhat more active than trans isomers. 2-(Aminomethyl)cyclohexylamine platinum complexes exhibited higher activity than 1,2-cyclohexanediamine complexes in this tumor system. These findings encouraged us to determine the structural differences between 1,2-cyclohexanediamine and 2-(aminomethyl)cyclohexylamine complexes. Their structures of platinum complexes were elucidated from circular dichroism and 13C NMR spectral analyses, and it has been concluded that the cyclohexane ring of cis-1,2-cyclohexanediamine is nearly perpendicular to the chelate ring, while both rings of trans-1,2-cyclohexanediamine and trans-2-(aminomethyl)cyclohexylamine complexes lie in a common plane. The structure of cis-2-(aminomethyl)cyclohexylamine complexes is flexible, and the cyclohexane ring is not perpendicular to the chelate ring. The coplanarity of trans isomers and the flexibility of cis-2-(aminomethyl)cyclohexylamine complexes allow them easy approach to the target DNA. However, the perpendicular ring of cis-1,2-cyclohexanediamine complexes would prevent their interactions with dna molecules due to the steric hindrance.","['Noji, M', 'Okamoto, K', 'Kidani, Y', 'Tashiro, T']","['Noji M', 'Okamoto K', 'Kidani Y', 'Tashiro T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclohexylamines)', '40015-92-7 (2-(aminomethyl)cyclohexylamine)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', 'C82TX76BHH (1,2-cyclohexanediamine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Cyclohexylamines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Platinum/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00137a007 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1981 May;24(5):508-15. doi: 10.1021/jm00137a007.,,,,,,,,,

Each molecule has at least one unique antigenic determinant, as well as determinants shared by both variants. Some Friend leukemia cell types contained H2a molecules which showed altered immunologic reactivity with the two antisera. The accessibility of the H2a variants in chromatin to anti-H2a antibody was different as measured by the use of whole chromatin as an immunoabsorbent and by binding of antibody to nucleosomes in a solid phase radioimmunoassay. While anti-H2a.1 IgG bound to chromatin, anti-H2a.2 IgG did not. Moreover, anti-H2a.1 IgG binding to chromatin from different Friend cell types reflected, in general, the relative amounts of H2a.1 in total chromatin. The different reactivity of the two antisera with chromatin was also observed with isolated nucleosomes: anti-H2a.1 IgG bound but anti-H2a.2 did not. Furthermore, the binding of anti-H2a.1 Ig with subfractions of nucleosomes varied; H1-depleted, high mobility group-enriched nucleosomes reacted better than H1-containing, high mobility group-depleted nucleosomes. These findings demonstrated a heterogeneity in the organization of H2a variants in chromatin within nucleosomal subfractions of chromatin and among chromatin of different Friend leukemia cell types.

Isolated nuclei from dexamethasone-treated cells also exhibited a depressed ability to synthesize beta-globin mRNA. These effects were achieved without altering the turnover rate of the mature messenger RNA. Electrophoretic analysis of pulse-labeled transcripts before and after a chase interval indicated that large Mr beta-globin precursor molecules were processed normally to mature nuclear beta-globin mRNA in cells treated with dexamethasone. S1 nuclease protection experiments showed further that dexamethasone treatment of induced cells uniquely depressed the amount of precursor-specific beta-globin sequences contained in unlabeled nuclear RNA preparations.

During the first 48 h postinfection a massive dose of FV overcame the inhibitory effect of the FV-2r gene as measured by the release of FV from the spleen. However, the concentration of IC recoverable from the spleens of these infected mice was still much lower in the D2.Fv-2r strain. When irradiated F1 hybrid hosts were used as recipients for the proliferation of infected donor cells, splenic IC were not generated as efficiently from infected bone-marrow cells of D2.Fv-2r origin as from those of DBA/2 origin.

The amounts of these hypo-modified tRNAs can be determined easily by measuring incorporation of labeled guanine into tRNA with Escherichia coli tRNA--guanine transglycosylase. The decrease was detected at on early stage of erythroid differentiation: namely, before any detectable increase in the percentage of cells containing hemoglobin. The amount of guanine-accepting tRNA species was nearly proportional to the percentage of undifferentiated cells in the population, regardless of the type of inducer used. Decrease in the amounts of hypo-modified tRNAs in the cells was effectively blocked by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, which inhibits differentiation of these cells. 8-Azaguanine, which is known to be substrate of tRNA--guanine transglycosylase, was incorporated almost exclusively into the first position of hypo-modified tRNA in murine erythroleukemic cells when they were pulse-labeled in culture with 8-azaguanine, suggesting strongly that tRNA-guanine transglycosylase in the cells is actually involved in incorporation of 8-azaguanine into tRNA in vivo. The amount of 8-azaguanine incorporated into tRNA in differentiated cells was one third of that in undifferentiated cells, the decrease being parallel with that in the amount of guanine-accepting tRNA in these cells. The results suggest that the appearance of hypo-modified tRNAs in the transformed cells was due to lack of substrate for queuosine biosynthesis in tRNA.","['Shindo-Okada, N', 'Terada, M', 'Nishimura, S']","['Shindo-Okada N', 'Terada M', 'Nishimura S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '72496-59-4 (queuine)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'Q150359I72 (Azaguanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azaguanine/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Transfer/biosynthesis/*isolation & purification']",1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1981.tb05254.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1981 Apr;115(2):423-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1981.tb05254.x.,,,,,,,,,

Mice derived from exposed embryos were mosaics with respect to integrated virus. Nine new substrains, designated Mov-5 to Mov-13, were derived, each of which carries a single M-MuLV genome at a different chromosomal position in its germ line. Four substrains, Mov-1 to Mov-4, were derived previously. Restriction enzyme analyses demonstrated that, with the exception of Mov-4 and Mov-6 mice, no major rearrangements or deletions have occurred in the integrated proviral genomes. Infectious virus is not activated in the majority of substrains (Mov-4 to Mov-8 and Mov-10 to Mov-12), whereas the other mice develop viremia. A detailed comparison between Mov-1 and Mov-13 mice demonstrated that the time of virus activation is different. Mov-13 mice activate infectious virus during embryogenesis, leading to a distinct pattern of virus expression in all tissues of the adult, but the viral genome in Mov-1 mice is activated only during the first two weeks after birth, leading to virus expression predominantly in lymphatic organs. Together with previous observations, at least four different phenotypes of virus expression-that is, early virus activation during embryogenesis, virus activation after birth, virus activation late in life and no expression of infectious virus at all-can be distinguished among the 13 substrains. Our results suggest that the chromosomal region at which a viral genome is integrated influences its expression during development and differentiation.","['Jaenisch, R', 'Jahner, D', 'Nobis, P', 'Simon, I', 'Lohler, J', 'Harbers, K', 'Grotkopp, D']","['Jaenisch R', 'Jahner D', 'Nobis P', 'Simon I', 'Lohler J', 'Harbers K', 'Grotkopp D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Col1a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Hair', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mosaicism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1981/05/01 00:00,1981/05/01 00:01,['1981/05/01 00:00'],"['1981/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(81)90343-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(81)90343-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1981 May;24(2):519-29. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(81)90343-3.,,,,,,,,,

After a 24-hr suspension in medium irradiated for 3 or 48 hr, the cloning efficiencies of cells subsequently plated in light-protected medium were 87 and 3%, respectively. The corresponding near-ultraviolet doses for these periods of exposure to CWF light were 0.22 x 10(4) for a 3-hr exposure and 3.47 x 10(4) J/sq m for a 48-hr exposure. Cells incubated in lightly irradiated medium resumed growth at nearly normal rates following a 24- to 48-hr period in which no increase in cell numbers occurred. Exposure of medium containing riboflavin, but not tryptophan or tyrosine, to CWF light also produces toxic medium. Tryptophan enhances riboflavin-induced phototoxicity, whereas tyrosine diminishes this effect. As photosusceptibility of this system is very high, Fischer's medium must be fully protected from all sources of light absorbable by riboflavin.","['Griffin, F M', 'Ashland, G', 'Capizzi, R L']","['Griffin FM', 'Ashland G', 'Capizzi RL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Culture Media)', 'TLM2976OFR (Riboflavin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media/*radiation effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Light', 'Mice', '*Photochemistry', 'Riboflavin/*radiation effects', 'Time Factors']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Jun;41(6):2241-8.,,,,,,,,,

The authors performed a Cox multivariate analysis of survival in order to isolate important prognostic factors at diagnosis and to use them to build a simple three-stage classification. Thrombopenia and anemia appeared as the most important risk factors. Among the nonanemic and nonthrombopenic patients, the number of involved areas was clearly related to prognosis in the authors' two series. This study allowed the authors to propose a new classification in three prognostic groups. Group C: anemia (Hb less than 10 g) and/or thrombopenia (platelets less than 100,000/mm3); about 15% of the patients; median of 2 years. Group B: no anemia, no thrombopenia, three or more involved areas (counting as one each of the following: axillary, cervical, inguinal, lymph nodes, whether unilateral or bilateral, spleen and liver); about 30% of patients; median of 7 years. Group A: no anemia, no thrombopenia, less than three involved areas; about 55% of patients; the survival of this group does not seem different from that of the French population of the same age and sex distribution.

We have previously shown that loss of infectivity could result from the incorporation of TMC in place of adenosine in the genomic 35S RNA (Larsen et al., 1979). This phenomenon is likely to impair the structure of the viral genome in such a way that reverse transcriptase cannot properly copy the template. Another consequence of the Toyocamycin action on the retrovirus particles released by analog-treated cells was their reduced content in envelope glycoprotein or gp70 (Mathieu - Mahul et al., 1979). In order to find the origin of this defect, which could also explain the loss of infectivity, viral polypeptides present in the cytoplasm of Toyocamycin-treated cells were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with specific antisera. The results indicated a diminution of the biosynthesis of the envelope glycoprotein and other GAG gene-related polypeptides. However, the gpr85env precursor was normally synthesized and processed into its final products (gp70 + p15E), which accumulated in the cells. These result make it likely that Toyocamycin has no specific effect on the virus replicative process in chronically infected cells but acts by deteriorating cellular functions, which are necessary to virus assembly.

The isolated FcR-like fraction was strongly suppressive in vivo. Additional support for the proposition that soluble FcR might be one of the mediators of suppression in vivo was gained by testing cell-free supernatants (CFS) of cell-line cells known to shed off FcR into the medium.
