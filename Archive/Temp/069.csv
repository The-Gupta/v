It was shown that c-MET overexpression predicts its efficacy. Therefore, a phase-3 trial of tivantinib has been initiated to recruit ""c-MET-high"" patients only. However, recent evidence indicates that the anticancer activity of tivantinib is not due to c-MET inhibition, suggesting that c-MET is a predictor of response to this compound rather than its actual target. By assessing the mechanisms underlying the anticancer properties of tivantinib we showed that this agent causes apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic molecules Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl, and by increasing Cyclin B1 expression regardless of c-MET status. However, we found that tivantinib might antagonize the antiapoptotic effects of c-MET activation since HGF enhanced the expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl. In summary, we show that the activity of tivantinib is independent of c-MET and describe Mcl-1, Bcl-xl and Cyclin B1 as effectors of its antineoplastic effects in HCC cells. We suggest that the predictive effect of c-MET expression in part reflects the c-MET-driven overexpression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl in c-MET-high patients and that these molecules are considered as possible response predictors.","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik 2, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik 2, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, University Hospital of Marburg, Philipps-University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik 2, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology, HELIOS Klinikum Berlin-Buch, Berlin, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik 2, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Torino, Candiolo, Torino, Italy.', 'Candiolo Cancer Institute-FPO, IRCCS, Candiolo, Italy.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik 2, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik 2, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik 2, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.']","['0 (ARQ 197)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",PMC4673154,['NOTNLM'],"['HCC', 'apoptosis', 'c-MET', 'targeted therapies']","['4240 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4240 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We segregated Alzheimer brain sections from people with end-stage disease into those with abundant hyperphosphorylated tau protein and those without and compared each to normal brains for global microRNA patterns. A significant reduced expression of several microRNAs, including miR-512, was evident in the Alzheimer brain sections with abundant hyperphosphorylated tau. Immunohistochemistry documented that 2 known targets of microRNA-512, cFLIP and MCL1, were significantly over expressed and each colocalized to neurons with the abnormal tau protein. Analysis for apoptosis including activated caspase-3, increased caspase-4 and caspase-8, apoptosis initiating factor, APAF-1 activity, and the TUNEL assay was negative in the areas where neurons showed hyperphosphorylated tau. MCM2 expression, a marker of neuroprogenitor cells, was significantly reduced in the Alzheimer sections that contained the hyperphosphorylated tau. These results suggest that a basic defect in Alzheimer disease may be the reduced microRNA-driven increased expression of proteins that may alter the apoptotic/antiapoptotic balance of neurons. This, in turn, could lead to the accumulation of key Alzheimer proteins such as hyperphosphorylated tau that ultimately prevent normal neuronal function and lead to disease symptomatology.","['*Phylogeny Inc. daggerOSU Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.']","['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (MAPT protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN512 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (tau Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases, Initiator)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (MCM2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2)']",,,,['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000147 [doi]'],10.1097/PAI.0000000000000147 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The homeodomain transcription factor, T-cell leukemia 3 (Tlx3), functions as the master neuronal fate regulator by instructively promoting the specification of glutamatergic excitatory neurons and suppressing the specification of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) neurons. However, how Tlx3 promotes glutamatergic neuronal subtype specification is poorly understood. In this study, we found that Tlx3 directly interacts with the epigenetic co-activator cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and that the Tlx3 homeodomain is essential for this interaction. The interaction between Tlx3 and CBP was enhanced by the three amino acid loop extension (TALE)-class homeodomain transcription factor, pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 3 (Pbx3). Using mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells stably expressing Tlx3, we found that the interaction between Tlx3 and CBP became detectable only after these Tlx3-expressing ES cells were committed to a neural lineage, which coincided with increased Pbx3 expression during neural differentiation from ES cells. Forced expression of mutated Tlx3 lacking the homeodomain in ES cells undergoing neural differentiation resulted in significantly reduced expression of glutamatergic neuronal subtype markers, but had little effect on the expression on pan neural markers. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that functional interplay between Tlx3 and CBP plays a critical role in neuronal subtype specification, providing novel insights into the epigenetic regulatory mechanism that modulates the transcriptional efficacy of a selective set of neuronal subtype-specific genes during differentiation.","['Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America; Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America; School of Psychological Science, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America; Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America; Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America; Department of Pharmacology, University of Arizona School of Medicine, Tucson, Arizona, United States of America.', 'Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America; Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tgif1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tlx3 protein, mouse)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, mouse)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",PMC4530954,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0135060 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-04627 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0135060 [doi],20150810,"['R01 DC013294/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DC013294/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 10.,"High-content screening (HCS) is a powerful technique for monitoring phenotypic responses to treatments on a cellular and subcellular level. Cellular phenotypes can be characterized by multivariate image readouts such as shape, intensity, or texture. The corresponding feature vectors can thus be defined as HCS fingerprints that serve as a powerful biological compound descriptor. Therefore, clustering or classification of HCS fingerprints across compound treatments allows for the identification of similarities in protein targets or pathways. We developed an HCS-based profiling panel that serves as basis for characterizing the mode of action of compounds. This panel measures phenotypic effects in six different compartments of U-2OS cells, namely the nucleus, the cytoplasm, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the cytoskeleton. We profiled a set of 2,725 well-annotated compounds and clustered their corresponding HCS fingerprints to establish links between predominant cellular phenotypes and cellular processes and protein targets.

The diarylacrylonitrile analogues 3b and 4a exhibited the most potent anticancer activity of all the analogues synthesized in this study, with GI50 values of < 10 nM against almost all the cell lines in the human cancer cell panel. Compounds 3b and 4a were also screened against the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line, MV4-11, and were found to have potent cytotoxic properties that are likely mediated through inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Results from molecular docking studies indicate a common binding site for 4a and 3b on the 3,3-tubulin heterodimer, with a slightly more favorable binding for 3b compared to 4a; this is consistent with the results from the microtubule assays, which demonstrate that 4a is more potent than 3b in inhibiting tubulin polymerization in MV4-11 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that diarylacrylonitriles 3b and 4a may have potential as antitubulin therapeutics for treatment of both solid and hematological tumors.","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.']",,PMC4527554,,,['10.1039/C4MD00478G [doi]'],,,"['DP2 OD007399/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140409/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA183895/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS662863'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also unknown if the wide variety of breakpoints have diverging implications in the patient's outcome. Despite -5/5q- abnormalities have usually been described as a poor prognostic feature, however, the low frequency of -5/5q- in pediatric AML patients limits a full knowledge about this cytogenetic and clinical category, which is an intriguing factor for further research and new findings. Here, we report an AML child showing an uncommon deletion in 5q associated with 2 new abnormalities involving chromosome 2 within a complex karyotype well-characterized by several molecular cytogenetic approaches. Our work stimulates upcoming studies with more detailed descriptions about 5q abnormalities to better define its role in the stratification risk of such cytogenetic subgroup in childhood AML.","['Bone Marrow Unit, Cytogenetics Department, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ; Post-Graduation Program in Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Unit, Cytogenetics Department, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ; Post-Graduation Program in Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, Jena University, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute for Human Genetics, Jena University, Jena, Germany.', 'Clinical Medicine Postgraduate Program, College of Medicine, Federal University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ; Martagao Gesteira Institute of Pediatrics and Child Development, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Clinical Medicine Postgraduate Program, College of Medicine, Federal University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ; Martagao Gesteira Institute of Pediatrics and Child Development, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN USA."", 'Post-Graduation Program in Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ; Bone Marrow Unit, Stem Cell Department, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Unit, Cytogenetics Department, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ; Post-Graduation Program in Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",,PMC4528810,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood AML', 'Complex karyotype', 'Uncommon deletion 5q22']","['10.1186/s13039-015-0167-y [doi]', '167 [pii]']",10.1186/s13039-015-0167-y [doi],20150807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Free solution capillary electrophoresis demonstrated interactions of PNaA with serum proteins. In a 72 h MTT assay most PNaAs exhibited a IC50 between 7 and 14 mmol L(-1), showing that precipitation may be a sufficient purification for PNaA dilute solutions. Dialyzed 3-arm star and hyperbranched PNaA caused an increase in L6 cell viability, challenging the suitability of MTT as cytotoxicity assay for PNaA. Fluorescent confocal microscopy revealed merging of cellular lipids after exposure to PNaA, likely caused by serum starvation.","['University of Western Sydney, Molecular Medicine Research Group, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia.', 'University of Western Sydney, Australian Centre for Research on Separation Science (ACROSS), Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia.', 'University of Western Sydney, School of Science and Health, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia.', 'University of Western Sydney, Molecular Medicine Research Group, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia.', 'University of Western Sydney, Australian Centre for Research on Separation Science (ACROSS), Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia.', 'University of Western Sydney, School of Science and Health, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia.', 'University of Western Sydney, Molecular Medicine Research Group, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia.', 'University of Western Sydney, Australian Centre for Research on Separation Science (ACROSS), Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia.', 'University of Western Sydney, School of Science and Health, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia.', 'CNRS, Institut de Chimie Radicalaire, Aix-Marseille Universite, UMR 7273, 13397, Marseille, France.', 'University of Western Sydney, School of Science and Health, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia.', 'University of Western Sydney, Molecular Medicine Research Group, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia. m.gaborieau@uws.edu.au.', 'University of Western Sydney, Australian Centre for Research on Separation Science (ACROSS), Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia. m.gaborieau@uws.edu.au.', 'University of Western Sydney, School of Science and Health, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia. m.gaborieau@uws.edu.au.', 'University of Western Sydney, Australian Centre for Research on Separation Science (ACROSS), Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia.', 'University of Western Sydney, School of Science and Health, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, New South Wales, 2751, Australia.']","['0 (Acrylic Resins)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '4Q93RCW27E (carbopol 940)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['MTT assay', 'capillary electrophoresis', 'cell', 'cytotoxicity', 'poly(acrylic acid)/poly(sodium acrylate)']",['10.1002/mabi.201500153 [doi]'],10.1002/mabi.201500153 [doi],20150810,,,"['(c) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Epub 2015 Aug 6.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm that has a low apoptotic index. We investigated a new class of small molecules that target the terminal apoptosis pathway, called procaspase activating compounds (PACs), in myeloma cells. PAC agents (PAC-1 and B-PAC-1) convert executioner procaspases (procaspase 3, 6, and 7) to active caspases 3, 6, and 7, which cleave target substrates to induce cellular apoptosis cascade. We hypothesized that targeting this terminal step could overcome survival and drug-resistance signals in myeloma cells and induce programmed cell death. Myeloma cells expressed executioner caspases. Additionally, our studies demonstrated that B-PAC-1 is cytotoxic to chemotherapy-resistant or sensitive myeloma cell lines (n = 7) and primary patient cells (n = 11). Exogenous zinc abrogated B-PAC-1-induced cell demise. Apoptosis induced by B-PAC-1 treatment was similar in the presence or absence of growth-promoting cytokines such as interleukin 6 and hepatocyte growth factor. Presence or absence of antiapoptotic proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-XL, or MCL-1 did not impact B-PAC-1-mediated programmed cell death. Collectively, our data demonstrate the proapoptotic effect of B-PAC-1 in MM and suggest that activating terminal executioner procaspases 3, 6, and 7 bypasses survival and drug-resistance signals in myeloma cells. This novel strategy has the potential to become an effective antimyeloma therapy.","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

Epub 2015 Aug 6.,"To find out prognostic factors and to investigate different therapeutic approaches, we report on 147 consecutive patients who relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Sixty-two patients underwent immunotherapy (IT group, second allo-HSCT or donor lymphocyte infusion), 39 received cytoreductive treatment alone (CRT group) and 46 were managed with palliative/supportive cares (PSC group). Two-year rates of overall survival (OS) were 32%, 6%, and 2% in the IT, CRT, and PSC groups, respectively (P < .001). In multivariate analysis, 4 factors adversely influenced 2-year rates of OS: history of acute graft-versus-host disease (hazard ratio [HR], 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 to 2.67; P = .002), relapse within 6 months (HR, 2.69; 95% CI, .82 to 3.98; P < .001), progression to acute myeloid leukemia (HR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.75 to 3.83; P < .001), and platelet count < 50 G/L at relapse (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.44; P = .007). A prognostic score based on those factors discriminated 2 risk groups with median OSs of 13.2 versus 2.4 months, respectively (P < .001). When propensity score, prognostic score, and treatment strategy were included in Cox model, immunotherapy was found to be an independent factor that favorably impacts OS (HR, .40; 95% CI, .26 to .63; P < .001). In conclusion, immunotherapy should be considered when possible for MDS patients relapsing after allo-HSCT.","[""CHU de Clermont-Ferrand, Hopital Estaing, Service d'Hematologie Clinique Adulte, and Universite Clermont 1, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", ""CHU et Universite Basse Normandie, Service d'Hematologie, Caen, France."", 'Biostatistics Unit, Direction de la Recherche Clinique, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Hematologie Greffe de moelle, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Universite Paris 7, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU, Nantes, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU, Lyon, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU, Bordeaux, France."", 'Hematology, CHU and University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Unite de Transplantation et de Therapie Cellulaire, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Unite de Transplantation et de Therapie Cellulaire, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematologie, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, AP-HP, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris 6, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU et UMR 5525 CNRS-UJF, Grenoble, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU, Nice, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Institut de Cancerologie de la Loire, Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, APHP, Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Universite Paris 5, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Universite Paris 6, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU, Poitiers, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU, Nancy, France."", 'Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU, Angers, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU, Brest, France."", 'Hematologie, CHRU de lille, Inserm U995, and Universite Lille 2, Lille, France.

It is noteworthy that neither parent of more than half of the carriers who visited the two clinics in the non-endemic area had been born outside of Kyushu, a highly endemic area, indicating that carriers will disperse from known endemic areas. Configuring an appropriate and efficient system to support carriers is necessary, especially in non-endemic areas.","['Division of Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Fukuoka University.']",,,,,['10.11406/rinketsu.56.666 [doi]'],10.11406/rinketsu.56.666 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most notably, TET2 mutations have frequently been identified in myeloid malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemias, as well as angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and a proportion of peripheral T-cell lymphomas. To date, various types of Tet2 knockout/knockdown mice have been generated. Tet2 mutations induce enhanced self-renewal ability and competitive repopulation capacity in hematopoietic stem cells, and various MPN/MDS-like diseases and T-cell lymphoma consequently develop in model mice. These findings appear to have a strong correlation with the recently identified TET2 mutations in a significant proportion of healthy elderly people, and suggest that TET2 mutations lead to a pre-cancer state in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. In conclusion, TET2 might play a major role as a gate keeper for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells preventing them from developing into various hematologic malignancies by acquiring additional disease-specific gene mutations.","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",,,,['10.11406/rinketsu.56.651 [doi]'],10.11406/rinketsu.56.651 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is associated with Epstein-Barr virus in more than 80% of patients. The median survival is not more than three months after diagnosis. In a recent survey of 34 cases with ANKL, the median patient age was 40 years and the age distribution followed a bimodal pattern. Morphologically, the ANKL cells varied from large granular lymphocytes to atypical cells with pleomorphic-like appearances. Clinical characteristics include fever, liver dysfunction, hemophagocytic syndrome, and a rapidly progressive course. In one third of patients, tumor cells in peripheral blood or the bone marrow are below 20% at initial presentation, which might lead to diagnostic delay.

As for extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type, HSCT could be anticipated to provide survival benefit or a chance of cure for patients in clinical stage II to IV with complete remission at transplantation.

Epub 2015 Aug 6.,"BACKGROUND: Follicular lymphoma is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease, but the prognostic value of somatic mutations has not been systematically assessed. We aimed to improve risk stratification of patients receiving first-line immunochemotherapy by integrating gene mutations into a prognostic model. METHODS: We did DNA deep sequencing to retrospectively analyse the mutation status of 74 genes in 151 follicular lymphoma biopsy specimens that were obtained from patients within 1 year before beginning immunochemotherapy consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). These patients were recruited between May 4, 2000, and Oct 20, 2010, as part of a phase 3 trial (GLSG2000). Eligible patients had symptomatic, advanced stage follicular lymphoma and were previously untreated. The primary endpoints were failure-free survival (defined as less than a partial remission at the end of induction, relapse, progression, or death) and overall survival calculated from date of treatment initiation. Median follow-up was 7.7 years (IQR 5.5-9.3). Mutations and clinical factors were incorporated into a risk model for failure-free survival using multivariable L1-penalised Cox regression. We validated the risk model in an independent population-based cohort of 107 patients with symptomatic follicular lymphoma considered ineligible for curative irradiation. Pretreatment biopsies were taken between Feb 24, 2004, and Nov 24, 2009, within 1 year before beginning first-line immunochemotherapy consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CVP). Median follow-up was 6.7 years (IQR 5.7-7.6). FINDINGS: We established a clinicogenetic risk model (termed m7-FLIPI) that included the mutation status of seven genes (EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOXO1, CREBBP, and CARD11), the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. In the training cohort, m7-FLIPI defined a high-risk group (28%, 43/151) with 5-year failure-free survival of 38.29% (95% CI 25.31-57.95) versus 77.21% (95% CI 69.21-86.14) for the low-risk group (hazard ratio [HR] 4.14, 95% CI 2.47-6.93; p<0.0001; bootstrap-corrected HR 2.02), and outperformed a prognostic model of only gene mutations (HR 3.76, 95% CI 2.10-6.74; p<0.0001; bootstrap-corrected HR 1.57). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value for 5-year failure-free survival were 64% and 78%, respectively, with a C-index of 0.80 (95% CI 0.71-0.89). In the validation cohort, m7-FLIPI again defined a high-risk group (22%, 24/107) with 5-year failure-free survival of 25.00% (95% CI 12.50-49.99) versus 68.24% (58.84-79.15) in the low-risk group (HR 3.58, 95% CI 2.00-6.42; p<0.0001). The positive predictive value for 5-year failure-free survival was 72% and 68% for negative predictive value, with a C-index of 0.79 (95% CI 0.69-0.89). In the validation cohort, risk stratification by m7-FLIPI outperformed FLIPI alone (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.21-3.92), and FLIPI combined with ECOG performance status (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.12-3.67). INTERPRETATION: Integration of the mutational status of seven genes with clinical risk factors improves prognostication for patients with follicular lymphoma receiving first-line immunochemotherapy and is a promising approach to identify the subset at highest risk of treatment failure.

Epub 2015 Oct 3.,"BACKGROUND: Although several studies have documented adverse outcomes for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization and infection in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients, data are inadequate for patients undergoing autologous (auto-)HSCT. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 300 consecutive patients receiving an auto-HSCT between 2006 and 2014. Patients had stool cultures for VRE on admission and weekly during hospitalization. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of patients had VRE gastrointestinal (GI) colonization and 3% developed a VRE bloodstream infection (BSI), all of whom were colonized. VRE strain typing of BSI isolates showed that some patients shared identical patterns. Rates of colonization and BSI in colonized patients were similar to simultaneous patients undergoing allo-HSCT, except that the latter had a higher rate of colonization at admission. A diagnosis of lymphoma was associated with an increased risk of colonization. VRE BSI was associated with longer lengths of stay and possibly higher costs, but no decrease in overall survival, and colonized patients had no VRE infections during the year following discharge. Repeat stool cultures in patients subsequently undergoing allo-HSCT suggested that most, if not all, VRE-positive auto-HSCT patients lose their detectable GI colonization within a few months of discharge. CONCLUSION: VRE colonization is frequent but carries a low risk for infection in patients undergoing auto-HSCT. However, these patients can serve as reservoirs for transmission to higher risk patients. Moreover, patients may remain colonized if proceeding to an allo-HSCT shortly after auto-HSCT, potentially increasing the risk of the allogeneic procedure.","['Intermountain Acute Leukemia and Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Statistical Data Center, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Intermountain Acute Leukemia and Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Intermountain Acute Leukemia and Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['bacteremia', 'bloodstream infection', 'colonization', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'immunosuppression', 'vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus']",['10.1111/tid.12433 [doi]'],10.1111/tid.12433 [doi],20151003,,,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

METHODS: The effect on cell viability was assessed by MTT and propidium iodide assays. The cytotoxic effect of C2 and C3 in K562 and HL-60 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Western blot and q-PCR procedures were also performed. KEY FINDINGS: C2 and C3 inhibited both K562 and HL-60 cells growth in a concentration-dependent manner. C2 presented the highest cytotoxic activity with an IC50 of approximately 14 mum and 41 mum for HL-60 and K562 cells, respectively, while being less toxic to normal peripheral blood monocyte cells. Both derivatives induced cellular changes in HL-60 cells, characteristic of apoptosis, such as mitochondrial membrane depolarization, phosphatidylserine externalization, increasing sub-G1 phase, DNA fragmentation, downregulating Bcl-2 protein and upregulating Bax protein. In K562 cells, C2 and C3 induced S-phase arrest of cell cycle, which was associated with upregulation of p21. The effect of these derivatives in HL-60 cells can be related to the ROS intracellular level. CONCLUSION: Taken together our results showed that C2 and C3 triazole derivatives presented the best potential for drug design.","['Departamento de Biotecnologia, Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biotecnologia, Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biotecnologia, Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biotecnologia, Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Sintese de Compostos Bioativos, Departamento de Ciencias Moleculares, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Sintese de Compostos Bioativos, Departamento de Ciencias Moleculares, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Sintese de Compostos Bioativos, Departamento de Ciencias Moleculares, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biotecnologia, Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biotecnologia, Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biotecnologia, Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biotecnologia, Centro de Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'RBF5ZU7R7K (1,4-naphthoquinone)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['1,4-naphthoquinone-1,2,3-triazoles', 'apoptosis', 'cytotoxicity', 'flow cytometry', 'leukaemic cells']",['10.1111/jphp.12474 [doi]'],10.1111/jphp.12474 [doi],20150810,,,['(c) 2015 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While no enzymatic activity have been found on these viral FGARAT-homology proteins (vFGARAT), they are important for disarming host intrinsic antiviral machinery. Most vFGARAT proteins disrupt the intrinsic antiviral response-associated cellular subnuclear structure: ProMyelocytic Leukemia (PML) associated nuclear body (PML-NB). vFGARATs from different viruses target different components of PML-NB to prevent cellular repression of viral infection. In addition, vFGARATs of rhadinoviruses were recently found to oligomerize with the cellular FGARAT to deamidate RIG-I and repress inflammatory cytokine production. In this review we discuss the diverse mechanisms of antiviral response disruption by gammaherpesvirus vFGARATs and the significance of the enzyme homology domain.","['The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States; Perelman School of Medicine, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States.

Epub 2015 Oct 28.,"AIMS: Oral therapies, including hormone-based or targeted therapies, have recently taken an increasing place in cancer treatment. In this context, a state of the art of the available studies dealing with the adherence of adult patients to oral anticancer treatment is warranted. The purpose of this review is to address (i) the association between assessment methods and measured adherence, (ii) the putative factors related to adherence and (iii) new ways of improving adherence to oral cancer therapies. METHODS: We conducted a literature-based narrative review of studies obtained from Pubmed using medical subject heading terms and free-text terms combining concepts related to oral anticancer medication and adherence. RESULTS: The analysis is based on 48 studies published since 1990, mostly assessing hormone-based therapy in breast cancer and targeted therapies in chronic myeloid leukaemia. Various methods of adherence were reported including self-report, medication measurement or combinations of methods. Adherence rates were found to vary from 14% to 100%. Beside patient related-factors, adherence rate discrepancies were found to be dependent on the method used. Furthermore, there was no consensual definition of adherence even regarding the same methods, some of them tolerating a period of interruption during the treatment period. Finally, several studies addressing persistence found a progressive decrease in adherence with time. CONCLUSION: Adherence to novel oral therapies is a major issue and further research is warranted to standardize adherence assessment in clinical studies better and to define better the most appropriate approaches to improve long term adherence in oncology practice.","['Centre Hospitalier J Monod, rue Eugene Garnier BP 219, 61104, Flers cedex.', 'Universite de Caen Basse-Normandie EA 3936, Esplanade de la Paix, BP 5186, 14032, Caen Cedex 05.', 'INSERM U1086, Cancers et Preventions, Avenue de la Cote de Nacre, F-14000, Caen.', 'Centre Regional de Lutte Contre le Cancer Francois Baclesse, 3 Avenue du General Harris, 14000, Caen, France.', 'Universite de Caen Basse-Normandie EA 3936, Esplanade de la Paix, BP 5186, 14032, Caen Cedex 05.', 'INSERM U1086, Cancers et Preventions, Avenue de la Cote de Nacre, F-14000, Caen.', 'Centre Regional de Lutte Contre le Cancer Francois Baclesse, 3 Avenue du General Harris, 14000, Caen, France.', 'Centre Regional de Lutte Contre le Cancer Francois Baclesse, 3 Avenue du General Harris, 14000, Caen, France.']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],PMC4693496,['NOTNLM'],"['antineoplastic agents', 'cancer chemotherapy agents', 'medication adherence', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'patient compliance']",['10.1111/bcp.12734 [doi]'],10.1111/bcp.12734 [doi],20151028,,,['(c) 2015 The British Pharmacological Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 5.,"Although disputed by some, increasing evidence suggests that TNF-alpha synergies with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs to exert a heightened antitumor effect. The present study investigated the antitumor efficacy of recombinant IL-15 in combination with the STAT3 inhibitor cucurbitacin-I in a doxorubicin-resistant murine lymphoma model. The significance of the work is to understand and design effective strategies in doxorubicin resistant lymphomas. TNF-alpha is downregulated in dendritic cells from mice with Dalton's lymphoma and shows an inverse relationship with disease progression. Doxorubicin-resistant DL cells have elevated levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and increased phosphorylation of STAT3. These cells are refractory to dendritic cell derived TNF-alpha. Doxorubicin resistant Dalton's lymphoma is susceptible to dendritic cell derived TNF-alpha upon stimulation with the STAT3 inhibitor cucurbitacin-I, which downregulates STAT3 and other survival molecules. The combined treatment of low dose of cucurbitacin-I and rIL-15 is ineffective in mice with doxorubicin resistant Dalton's lymphoma, but a similar therapy prolongs the survival of mice transplanted with parental Dalton's lymphoma. Doxorubicin resistant Dalton's lymphoma responds to therapy with high doses of cucurbitacin-I and rIL-15. Dendritic cell derived from mice responded positively to the therapy and regained their tumoricidal properties with respect to growth inhibition and killing of DL tumor cells.

Epub 2015 Aug 6.,"Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells, with over 54,000 new cases per year diagnosed worldwide and a 5-year survival rate below 60%. This highlights a need for research into the mechanisms behind its etiology and causes of therapy failure. The bone marrow microenvironment, in which adult stem cells are maintained in healthy individuals, has been implicated as a source of chemoresistance and disease relapse. Here the various ways that the microenvironment can contribute to the resistance and persistence of leukemia are discussed. The targeting of the microenvironment by leukemia cells to create an environment more suitable for cancer progression is described. The role of soluble factors, drug transporters, microvesicles, as well as the importance of direct cell-cell contact, in addition to the effects of inflammation and immune surveillance in microenvironment-mediated drug resistance are discussed. An overview of the clinical potential of translating research findings to patients is also provided. Understanding of and further research into the role of the bone marrow microenvironment in leukemia progression and relapse are crucial towards developing more effective treatments and reduction in patient morbidity.

Epub 2015 Aug 7.,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells exhibit increased B-cell receptor and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activities. The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein bromodomain 4 is essential for the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB. Here, we demonstrate that treatment with the BET protein bromodomain antagonist (BA) JQ1 attenuates MYC and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6, inhibits the nuclear RelA levels and the expression of NF-kappaB target genes, including Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) in MCL cells. Although lowering the levels of the antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma (BCL)2 family proteins, BA treatment induces the proapoptotic protein BIM and exerts dose-dependent lethality against cultured and primary MCL cells. Cotreatment with BA and the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib synergistically induces apoptosis of MCL cells. Compared with each agent alone, cotreatment with BA and ibrutinib markedly improved the median survival of mice engrafted with the MCL cells. BA treatment also induced apoptosis of the in vitro isolated, ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells, which overexpress CDK6, BCL2, Bcl-xL, XIAP, and AKT, but lack ibrutinib resistance-conferring BTK mutation. Cotreatment with BA and panobinostat (pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor) or palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) or ABT-199 (BCL2 antagonist) synergistically induced apoptosis of the ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells. These findings highlight and support further in vivo evaluation of the efficacy of the BA-based combinations with these agents against MCL, including ibrutinib-resistant MCL.","['Departments of Leukemia and Lymphoma & Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Cancer Research, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX;', 'Departments of Leukemia and Lymphoma & Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX;', 'Laboratory of Translational Cancer Research, Tom and Gayle Benson Cancer Center, New Orleans, LA; and.', 'Cancer Research, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Departments of Leukemia and Lymphoma & Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Departments of Leukemia and Lymphoma & Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Departments of Leukemia and Lymphoma & Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Departments of Leukemia and Lymphoma & Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;', 'Departments of Leukemia and Lymphoma & Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;']","['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Btk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",PMC4582333,,,"['S0006-4971(20)30889-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-04-639542 [doi]']",10.1182/blood-2015-04-639542 [doi],20150807,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,['Blood. 2016 Sep 29;128(13):1778.

Most patients were treated with bendamustine in combination with rituximab (BR). However, bendamustine monotherapy was additionally evaluated. Patients treated with BR had a significantly higher overall response rate of 76% (complete response=22%) when compared to those treated solely with bendamustine (overall response rate=50%; complete response=13%).

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells with the t(1:19) translocation express the WNT16 gene, which is thought to contribute to transformation. RESULTS: ER-stress blocks processing of endogenous WNT16 protein in RCH-ACV and 697 ALL cells. Biochemical analysis showed an aggregation of WNT16 proteins in the ER of stressed cells. These large protein masses cannot be completely cleared by ER-associated protein degradation, and require for additional autophagic responses. Pharmacological block of autophagy significantly increased cell death in ER-stressed ALL. Furthermore, murine cells engineered to express WNT16 are similarly sensitized. CONCLUSION: ALL cells expressing WNT16 are sensitive to ER stress, and show enhanced killing after addition of chloroquine.

Epub 2015 Jul 29.,"Cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) belong to eicosanoids and are potent lipid mediators of inflammation. It is well-known that eicosanoids play an important role in numerous pathophysiological processes. Therefore, quantitative analysis of cytochrome P450 metabolites of AA, including hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), epoxyeicosatreinoic acids (EETs), and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) can provide crucial information to uncover underlying mechanisms of cytochrome P450 metabolites of AA related diseases. Herein, we developed a highly sensitive method to identify and quantify HETEs, EETs, and DHETs in lipid extracts of biological samples based on stable isotope probe labeling coupled with ultra high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. To this end, a pair of stable isotope probes, 2-dimethylaminoethylamine (DMED) and d4-2-dimethylaminoethylamine (d4-DMED), were utilized to facilely label eicosanoids. The heavy labeled eicosanoid standards were prepared and used as internal standards for quantification to minimize the matrix and ion suppression effects in mass spectrometry analysis. In addition, the detection sensitivities of DMED labeled eicosanoids improved by 3-104 folds in standard solution and 5-138 folds in serum matrix compared with unlabeled analytes. Moreover, a good separation of eicosanoids isomers was achieved upon DMED labeling. The established method provided substantial sensitivity (limit of quantification at sub-picogram), high specificity, and broad linear dynamics range (3 orders of magnitude). We further quantified cytochrome P450 metabolites of AA in rat liver, heart, brain tissues and human serum using the developed method. The results showed that 19 eicosanoids could be distinctly detected and the contents of 11-, 15-, 16-, 20-HETE, 5,6-EET, and 14,15-EET in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and 5-, 11-, 12-, 15-, 16-, 20-HETE, 8,9-EET, and 5,6-DHET in myeloid leukemia patients had significant changes, demonstrating that these eicosanoids may have important roles on the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and myeloid leukemia.","['Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Basic Medical School, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Basic Medical School, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, PR China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, PR China.

As for many other gammaretroviruses, the KoRV genome can potentially encode an alternate form of Gag protein, glyco-gag. RESULTS: In this study, a convenient assay for assessing KoRV infectivity in vitro was employed: the use of DERSE cells (initially developed to search for infectious xenotropic murine leukemia-like viruses). Using infection of DERSE and other human cell lines (HEK293T), no evidence for expression of glyco-gag by KoRV was found, either in expression of glyco-gag protein or changes in infectivity when the putative glyco-gag reading frame was mutated. Since glyco-gag mediates resistance of Moloney murine leukemia virus to the restriction factor APOBEC3, the sensitivity of KoRV (wt or putatively mutant for glyco-gag) to restriction by murine (mA3) or human APOBEC3s was investigated. Both mA3 and hA3G potently inhibited KoRV infectivity. Interestingly, hA3G restriction was accompanied by extensive G --> A hypermutation during reverse transcription while mA3 restriction was not. Glyco-gag status did not affect the results. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the mechanisms of APOBEC3 restriction of KoRV by hA3G and mA3 differ (deamination dependent vs. independent) and glyco-gag does not play a role in the restriction.","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697-3905, USA. nittat@savannahstate.edu.', 'Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697-3905, USA. nittat@savannahstate.edu.', 'Department of Biology, Savannah State University, 3219 College St, Savannah, GA, 31404-5254, USA. nittat@savannahstate.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697-3905, USA. datha@usc.edu.', 'Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697-3905, USA. datha@usc.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697-3905, USA. fgalvezp6@gmail.com.', 'Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697-3905, USA. fgalvezp6@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Department of Cell Biology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. takavet@gmail.com.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697-3905, USA. hyfan@uci.edu.', 'Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697-3905, USA. hyfan@uci.edu.']","['0 (Gene Products, gag)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",PMC4528783,,,"['10.1186/s12977-015-0193-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-015-0193-1 [pii]']",10.1186/s12977-015-0193-1 [doi],20150808,"['R01 CA094188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA94188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has yet to be determined whether the ZFP809-mediated gene silencing is maintained over a long period. In this study, we established an experimental system that can monitor gene silencing during a long-term cell culture using flow cytometry technology combined with fluorescent reporters for the expression of ZFP809 and the transgene expression driven by the promoters of interest.

In recent years, pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia clinical trials have used discontinuous rather than continuous dosing of dexamethasone in an effort to reduce the incidence of osteonecrosis. However, it is not known whether discontinuous dosing would compromise antileukemic efficacy of glucocorticoids. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of discontinuous dexamethasone against continuous dexamethasone in murine models bearing human acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts (n = 8 patient samples) or murine BCR-ABL+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Plasma dexamethasone concentrations (7.9 to 212 nM) were similar to those achieved in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using conventional dosages. The median leukemia-free survival ranged from 16 to 59 days; dexamethasone prolonged survival from a median of 4 to 129 days in all seven dexamethasone-sensitive acute lymphoblastic leukemias. In the majority of cases (7 of 8 xenografts and the murine BCR-ABL model) we demonstrated equal efficacy of the two dexamethasone dosing regimens; whereas for one acute lymphoblastic leukemia sample, the discontinuous regimen yielded inferior antileukemic efficacy (log-rank p = 0.002). Our results support the clinical practice of using discontinuous rather than continuous dexamethasone dosing in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","[""Pharmaceutical Sciences Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Pharmaceutical Sciences Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Pharmaceutical Sciences Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Pharmaceutical Sciences Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Pharmaceutical Sciences Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", 'Harding University College of Pharmacy, Searcy, Arkansas, United States of America.', ""Biostatistics Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", 'Puma Biotechnology Inc., Los Angeles, California, United States of America.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Pharmaceutical Sciences Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Pharmaceutical Sciences Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America.""]","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",PMC4529108,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0135134 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-24022 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0135134 [doi],20150807,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the precise features of the molecular rearrangements and the minimal residual disease follow-up for these five patients. Three resulted from new rearrangements between the BCR and ABL1 sequences (the breakpoints being located within BCR exon 13 in two cases and within BCR exon 18 in one case). The other two cases revealed a complex e8-[ins]-a2 fusion transcript involving a third partner gene, PRDM12 and SPECC1L, respectively. Moreover, single nucleotide polymorphism-array analysis performed in the latter two cases showed copy number alterations shared by the two patients, thus identifying genes that were deleted during rearrangement and suggesting their potential role in CML pathogenesis. Interestingly, we highlight that the prognosis of alterations, such as the presence of an e8a2 transcript or the deletion of various genes, which have been controversial, may be definitively erased by the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).","[""Laboratoire D'hematologie, Centre De Biologie Sud, Hospices Civils De Lyon, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Laboratoire D'hematologie, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire De Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."", ""Laboratoire D'hematologie, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Regional De Brest, Brest, France."", ""Laboratoire D'hematologie, Institut De Biologie, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire De Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'Service De Cancerologie Biologique, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire De Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""Service Clinique d'onco-Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Departemental Vendee, La-Roche-sur-Yon, France."", ""Service D'hematologie Clinique, Groupe Hospitalier L'archet, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire De Nice, Nice, France."", ""Service D'hematologie Clinique, Hopital Fleyriat, Bourg-en-Bresse, France."", ""Service D'hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire De Dijon, Dijon, France."", ""Laboratoire D'hematologie, Hopital Pasteur, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire De Nice, Nice, France."", ""Service D'hematologie Sterile, Institut Cancerologie-Hematologie, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Regional De Brest, Brest, France."", ""Laboratoire D'hematologie, Centre De Biologie Sud, Hospices Civils De Lyon, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Laboratoire D'hematologie, Centre De Biologie Sud, Hospices Civils De Lyon, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Laboratoire D'hematologie, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Regional De Brest, Brest, France."", ""Laboratoire D'hematologie, Centre De Biologie Sud, Hospices Civils De Lyon, Pierre-Benite, France."", ""Laboratoire D'hematologie, Hopital Pasteur, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire De Nice, Nice, France."", ""Laboratoire D'hematologie, Centre De Biologie Sud, Hospices Civils De Lyon, Pierre-Benite, France.""]","['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,['10.1002/gcc.22263 [doi]'],10.1002/gcc.22263 [doi],20150807,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,"['GBMHM (Groupe des Biologistes Moleculaires des Hemopathies Malignes, French', 'Molecular Biology Group in Hematology)']",,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 5.,"The herb Momordica cochinchinensis has been used for a variety of purposes, and been shown to have anticancer properties. The present study assessed the potency and the underlying mechanisms of action of the ethyl acetate extract of seeds of Momordica cochinchinensis (ESMC2) on breast cancer cells. Therefore, the effects of ESMC2 on the cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis of MDAMB231 cells were investigated. The results showed that ESMC2 exerted a marked growth inhibitory effect on the cells. Cell cycle arrest in G2 phase following treatment with ESMC2 was associated with a marked increase in the protein levels of cyclin B1, cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and a decrease in cyclin D1 expression. In addition, ESMC2 dosedependently induced cell apoptosis, which was mediated via upregulation of the apoptosis-associated proteins p53, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)associated X protein, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer and Bcl-2-associated death promoter expression, as well as downregulation of nuclear factor kappa B, Bcl2 and myeloid cell leukemia1. Furthermore, the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Akt phosphorylation were decreased by ESMC2 in a dosedependent manner, indicating that ESMC2 exerted its effects via the mitogen-activated protein kinase/JNK pathway. Furthermore, nude mouse xenotransplant models were used to evaluate the tumor growth inhibitory effects of ESMC2. The possible chemical components of ESMC2 were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 12 compounds were detected from the major peaks based on the similarity index with entries of a compound database. The results of the present study may aid in the development of novel therapies for breast cancer.","[""School of Pharmacy, Health Science Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, P.R.

This cell line can be cultured into Langerhans cell (LC) or interstitial DC-like cells using the same cytokine cocktails used for the differentiation of their primary counterparts. Currently, there is an increasing interest in the study and clinical application of DC generated in the presence of IFNalpha, as these IFNalpha-DC produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines and have been suggested to be more potent in their ability to cross-present protein antigens, as compared to the more commonly used IL-4-DC. Here, we report on the generation of IFNalpha-induced MUTZ-DC. We show that IFNalpha MUTZ-DC morphologically and phenotypically display characteristic DC features and are functionally equivalent to ""classic"" IL-4 MUTZ-DC. IFNalpha MUTZ-DC ingest exogenous antigens and can subsequently cross-present HLA class-I restricted epitopes to specific CD8+ T cells. Importantly, mature IFNalpha MUTZ-DC express CCR7, migrate in response to CCL21, and are capable of priming naive antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, we show that the MUTZ-3 cell line offers a viable and sustainable model system to study IFNalpha driven DC development and functionality.","['Dept of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Medical Oncology, VU University medical center-Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dept of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",PMC4529224,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0135219 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-31662 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0135219 [doi],20150807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated SPHK1 has been found in numerous cancer types and been shown to contribute to survival, chemotherapeutic resistance and malignancy. However, its role in large granular Natural Killer (NK) large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia has not been investigated. Here, we examine SPHK1 as a therapeutic target in LGL leukemia. We found that SPHK1 is overexpressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from LGL leukemia patients which results in elevated S1P in the sera. The use of SPHK1 inhibitors, SKI-II or SKI-178, decreased leukemic NK cell viability and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. SKI-II and SKI-178 restored the sphingolipid balance by increasing ceramide and decreasing S1P in leukemic NKL cells. SKI-II and SKI-178 also induced apoptosis in primary NK-LGLs from leukemia patients. Mechanistic studies in NK-LGL cell lines demonstrated that SKI-178 and SKI-II induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M. We found that SKI-178 induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at Ser70, and that this was dependent on CDK1. We further show that SPHK1 inhibition with SKI-178 leads to decreased JAK-STAT signaling. Our data demonstrate that SPHK1 represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of NK-LGL leukemia.","['a Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute; Penn State College of Medicine ; Hershey , PA USA.', 'b University of Virginia Cancer Center; University of Virginia ; Charlottesville , VA USA.', 'a Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute; Penn State College of Medicine ; Hershey , PA USA.', 'c Department of Pharmacology ; Penn State College of Medicine ; Hershey , PA USA.', 'b University of Virginia Cancer Center; University of Virginia ; Charlottesville , VA USA.', 'd Center for Applied Proteomics and Molecular Medicine; George Mason University ; Manassas , VA USA.', 'd Center for Applied Proteomics and Molecular Medicine; George Mason University ; Manassas , VA USA.', 'c Department of Pharmacology ; Penn State College of Medicine ; Hershey , PA USA.', 'b University of Virginia Cancer Center; University of Virginia ; Charlottesville , VA USA.', 'b University of Virginia Cancer Center; University of Virginia ; Charlottesville , VA USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0', ""(N'-((1E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethylidene)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-ca"", 'rbohydrazide)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",PMC4847818,['NOTNLM'],"['LGL leukemia', 'SKI-178,SKI-II', 'apoptosis', 'large granular lymphocyte', 'natural killer', 'sphingosine kinase 1']",['10.1080/15384047.2015.1078949 [doi]'],10.1080/15384047.2015.1078949 [doi],,"['P01 CA171983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA044579/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098472/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA098472/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 6.,"Multidrug resistance caused by the overexpression of ABC transporter proteins in cancer cells remains a major obstacle limiting chemotherapy efficacy. Drugs inhibiting these transporters have been shown to increase the anti-proliferative properties of chemotherapeutics. As we previously described, proadifen, a P450 monooxygenase inhibitor, might also be able to inhibit some ABC transporters, including breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Because mitoxantrone (MTX) is a strong BCRP substrate and is often used in the treatment of leukemia, we investigated the effect of 24 h proadifen pre-treatment on the cytotoxicity of MTX in leukemic cell lines that are sensitive to MTX (HL-60) and MTX-resistant ABCG2-overexpressing subclone (cBCRP). We show for the first time that proadifen is able to enhance the cytotoxic properties of MTX in cBCRP cells, particularly through the inhibition of BCRP expression and activity. This proadifen-MTX synergism was also mediated by the inhibition of various cellular proteins engaged in apoptosis, including Mc-1, Bcl-xL, survivin and activation of procaspase-3. Proadifen also decreased the expression of gammaH2AX, which is involved in the recruitment of reparation proteins. Moreover, the inhibition of DNA damage repair proteins Ku86 and B23 after proadifen treatment indicate a possible role of proadifen in DNA repair blockage, thus suppressing the reparation rate of MTX-induced DSBs.","['Institute of Biology and Ecology, Department of Cellular Biology, Pavol Jozef Safarik University in Kosice, SK-040 01 Kosice, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Biology and Ecology, Department of Cellular Biology, Pavol Jozef Safarik University in Kosice, SK-040 01 Kosice, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Biology and Ecology, Department of Cellular Biology, Pavol Jozef Safarik University in Kosice, SK-040 01 Kosice, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Biology and Ecology, Department of Cellular Biology, Pavol Jozef Safarik University in Kosice, SK-040 01 Kosice, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Biology and Ecology, Department of Cellular Biology, Pavol Jozef Safarik University in Kosice, SK-040 01 Kosice, Slovak Republic.']","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'A510CA4CBT (Proadifen)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,['10.3892/ijo.2015.3116 [doi]'],10.3892/ijo.2015.3116 [doi],20150806,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The associated health risks of alpha-particle exposure for lung cancer are well documented however the risk estimates for leukaemia remain uncertain. To further our understanding of alpha-particle effects in target cells for leukaemogenesis and also to seek general markers of individual exposure to alpha-particles, this study assessed the transmission of chromosomal damage initially-induced in human haemopoietic stem and progenitor cells after exposure to high-LET alpha-particles. Cells surviving exposure were differentiated into mature T-cells by extra-thymic T-cell differentiation in vitro. Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridisation (M-FISH) analysis of naive T-cell populations showed the occurrence of stable (clonal) complex chromosome aberrations consistent with those that are characteristically induced in spherical cells by the traversal of a single alpha-particle track. Additionally, complex chromosome exchanges were observed in the progeny of irradiated mature T-cell populations. In addition to this, newly arising de novo chromosome aberrations were detected in cells which possessed clonal markers of alpha-particle exposure and also in cells which did not show any evidence of previous exposure, suggesting ongoing genomic instability in these populations. Our findings support the usefulness and reliability of employing complex chromosome exchanges as indicators of past or ongoing exposure to high-LET radiation and demonstrate the potential applicability to evaluate health risks associated with alpha-particle exposure.","['Medical Research Council, Didcot, Oxon, United Kingdom.', 'Medical Research Council, Didcot, Oxon, United Kingdom.', 'Medical Research Council, Didcot, Oxon, United Kingdom; Division of Biosciences, Department of Life Sciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, United Kingdom.']",['0 (CD3 Complex)'],PMC4529306,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0134046 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-12056 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0134046 [doi],20150807,['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL1 induces endogenous oxidative stress promoting genomic instability and imatinib resistance. In the present work, we investigated the extent of oxidative stress, DNA damage, apoptosis and expression of apoptosis-related genes in BCR-ABL1 cells sensitive and resistant to imatinib. The resistance resulted either from the Y253H mutation in the BCR-ABL1 gene or incubation in increasing concentrations of imatinib (AR). UV irradiation at a dose rate of 0.12 J/(m2 . s) induced more DNA damage detected by the T4 pyrimidine dimers glycosylase and hOGG1, recognizing oxidative modifications to DNA bases in imatinib-resistant than -sensitive cells. The resistant cells displayed also higher susceptibility to UV-induced apoptosis. These cells had lower native mitochondrial membrane potential than imatinib-sensitive cells, but UV-irradiation reversed that relationship. We observed a significant lowering of the expression of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDHB) gene, encoding a component of the complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is involved in apoptosis sensing. Although detailed mechanism of imatinib resistance in AR cells in unknown, we detected the presence of the Y253H mutation in a fraction of these cells. In conclusion, imatinib-resistant cells may display a different extent of genome instability than their imatinib-sensitive counterparts, which may follow their different reactions to both endogenous and exogenous DNA-damaging factors, including DNA repair and apoptosis.","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland. ewelinas@biol.uni.lodz.pl.', 'Department of Clinical Cytobiology, Medical Center for Postgraduate Education, Marymoncka 99, 01-813 Warsaw, Poland. graho@cmkp.edu.pl.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland. katarzyny.wojcik@gmail.com.', 'Department of Orthodontics, Medical University of Lodz, Pomorska 251, 92-216 Lodz, Poland. elzbieta.pawlowska@umed.lodz.pl.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA. tskorski@temple.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland. jblasiak@biol.uni.lodz.pl.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC4581238,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'DNA damage', 'apoptosis', 'imatinib resistance', 'reactive oxygen species']","['ijms160818111 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms160818111 [doi]']",10.3390/ijms160818111 [doi],20150805,"['R01 CA134458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA134458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diphosphorylated gemcitabine irreversibly inhibits ribonucleotide reductase thereby preventing deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. Functioning as a potent chemotherapeutic, gemcitabine decreases neoplastic cell proliferation and induces apoptosis which accounts for its effectiveness in the clinical treatment of several leukemia and carcinoma cell types. A brief plasma half-life due to rapid deamination, chemotherapeutic-resistance and sequelae restrict gemcitabine utility in clinical oncology. Selective ""targeted"" gemcitabine delivery represents a molecular strategy for prolonging its plasma half-life and minimizing innocent tissue/organ exposure. METHODS: A previously described organic chemistry scheme was applied to synthesize a UV-photoactivated gemcitabine intermediate for production of gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu]. Immunodetection analysis (Western-blot) was applied to detect the presence of any degradative fragmentation or polymerization. Detection of retained binding-avidity of gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] was determined by cell-ELISA using populations of chemotherapeutic-resistant mammary adenocarcinoma (SKBr-3) that highly over-express the HER2/neu trophic membrane receptor. Cytotoxic anti-neoplastic potency of gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] and the benzimidazole tubulin/microtubule inhibitors, albendazole, flubendazole and mebendazole was established against chemotherapeutic-resistant mammary adenocarcinoma (SKBr-3). Related investigations evaluated the potential for gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] in dual combination with mebendazole to evoke increased levels of cytotoxic anti-neoplatic potency compared to gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu]. RESULTS: Covalent gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] immunochemotherapeutic and each benzimidazole (n=3) exerted cytotoxic anti-neoplastic potency against chemotherapeutic-resistant mammary adenocarcinoma (SKBr-3). Covalent gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] immunochemotherapeutic or gemcitabine in dual combination with mebendazole created increased levels of cytotoxic anti-neoplastic potency that were greater than attained with gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] or gemcitabine alone. CONCLUSION: Gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] in dual combination with benzimidazoles can produce enhanced levels of cytotoxic anti-neoplastic activity and potentially provide a basis for treatment regimens with a wider margin-of-safety. Such benefits would be possible through the collective properties of; [i] selective ""targeted"" gemcitabine delivery; [ii] relatively lower toxicity of benzimidazoles compared to many if not most conventional chemotherapeutics; [iii] reduced total dosage requirements faciliated by additive or synergistic anti-cancer properties; and [iv] differences in sequelae for gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] compared to benzimidazole tubulin/microtubule inhibitors.","['Department of Basic Sciences (College of Veterinary Medicine), Mississippi State University, USA.', 'Department of Basic Sciences (College of Veterinary Medicine), Mississippi State University, USA.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine at Wise Center, Mississippi State University, USA.']",,PMC4531380,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-HER2/neu', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Chemotherapeutic-resistant', 'Covalent immunochemotherapeutic', 'Cytotoxic anti-neoplastic potency', 'Dual combination anti-cancer therapy', 'Gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu]', 'Mammary adenocarcinoma']",,1000109 [pii],,['T35 OD010432/OD/NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS709163'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study on 69 patients with newly diagnosed AML to further define the correlates of systemic coagulation activation in this hematological malignancy. Tissue factor procoagulant activity (TF PCA) of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and TF expression by circulating microparticles (MPs) were assessed by single-stage clotting and thrombin generation assay, respectively. Soluble plasma TF antigen and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by cultured PBMCs were measured by ELISA. Cell-free plasma DNA was quantified by staining with a fluorescent dye. RESULT: TF PCA of PBMCs was significantly increased in AML patients as compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, TF PCA was significantly associated with decompensated DIC at presentation, as defined by a plasma fibrinogen level of </=1 g/L (n = 11). In addition to TF PCA and circulating blasts, serum lactate dehydrogenase, a surrogate marker for leukemic cell turnover, correlated with plasma D-Dimer in the total patient cohort and was significantly increased in DIC patients, suggesting a role for myeloblast apoptosis/necrosis in activation of the TF-dependent coagulation pathway. Consistently, TF-bearing plasma MPs were more frequently detected and levels of soluble TF antigen were significantly higher in DIC vs. non-DIC patients. No association was found between TF PCA expression and VEGF secretion by isolated PBMCs, but significantly increased levels of cell-free plasma DNA pointed to a contribution of the intrinsic contact pathway to systemic coagulation activation in the total patient cohort and in patients with lower TF PCA expression. While PBMC-associated TF PCA had no effect on long-term survival, DIC occurrence at presentation increased the risk of early mortality. CONCLUSION: In newly diagnosed AML, TF expression by PBMCs and shedding of TF-bearing plasma MPs are central to the pathogenesis of DIC, but additional pathways, such as DNA liberation, may contribute to systemic coagulation activation.","['II.

Despite high-dose melphalan therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and the introduction of immunomodulatory drugs like bortezomib or lenalidomide, that have been associated with improved survival, MM is still incurable and new treatment options are needed. In B cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) inhibitors have shown promising in vitro and first clinical results. In our study, we analyzed the potential of Syk as a target in MM. METHODS: The MM cell lines AMO-1, U266 and RPMI8226 and primary MM cells were treated with the Syk inhibitors BAY61-3606, R406 or Piceatannol and proliferation, migration and apoptosis induction were analyzed. Effects on involved intracellular signaling cascades were determined by Western blotting. Furthermore, we analyzed synergistic and additive effects of Syk inhibitors in combination with established anti-myeloma drugs and experimental inhibitors (e.g. PI-3-Kinase inhibitor NVP-BEZ235). RESULTS: Incubation of MM cell lines as well as primary MM cells with Syk inhibitors resulted in a reduced proliferation and stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha) induced migration that was accompanied by a concentration dependent inhibition of the MAP-Kinase, characterized by reduced phosphorylation of ERK an p38 molecules, and NF-kappaB signalling pathways. Furthermore, Syk inhibition induced apoptosis in MM cells in a dose-dependent manner, characterized by reduced expression of pro-caspase 3, increased PARP-1 cleavage and enhanced release of cytochrome c. In addition combined treatment of MM cells with Syk inhibitors and NVP-BEZ235 (dual PI3-kinase/mTOR inhibitor) or MAPK inhibitors (PD98059, SP600125, U0126, SB203580) resulted in increased apoptotic activity of the drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that Syk inhibition might represent a promising new treatment option in MM with an increased efficacy when combined with MAP kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, our study strongly underlines the potency of Syk inhibitors as a potential therapeutic treatment option for MM patients.","['Medical Clinic III, Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Str. 25, 53127 Bonn, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic III, Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Str. 25, 53127 Bonn, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic III, Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Str. 25, 53127 Bonn, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic III, Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Str. 25, 53127 Bonn, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic III, Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Str. 25, 53127 Bonn, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic III, Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Str. 25, 53127 Bonn, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic III, Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Str. 25, 53127 Bonn, Germany.']",,PMC4526421,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Multiple myeloma', 'Piceatannol', 'Plasmacell malignancy', 'R406', 'Signal transduction Bay61-3606', 'Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)', 'Syk inhibitors', 'Tyrosine kinase']","['10.1186/s40164-015-0016-z [doi]', '16 [pii]']",10.1186/s40164-015-0016-z [doi],20150805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For those individuals who have access to antiretroviral therapy, these drugs can effectively suppress, but not cure, HIV-1 infection. Indeed, the only documented case for an HIV/AIDS cure was a patient with HIV-1 and acute myeloid leukemia who received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from a graft that carried the HIV-resistant CCR5-32/32 mutation. Other attempts to establish a cure for HIV/AIDS using HCT in patients with HIV-1 and malignancy have yielded mixed results, as encouraging evidence for virus eradication in a few cases has been offset by poor clinical outcomes due to the underlying cancer or other complications. Such clinical strategies have relied on HIV-resistant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that harbor the natural CCR5-32/32 mutation or that have been genetically modified for HIV-resistance. Nevertheless, HCT with HIV-resistant cord blood remains a promising option, particularly with inventories of CCR5-32/32 units or with genetically modified, human leukocyte antigen-matched cord blood.","['StemCyte international Cord Blood Center, Baldwin Park, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Irell and Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Beckman Research institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Beckman Research institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'StemCyte international Cord Blood Center, Baldwin Park, CA, USA.', 'CCR5-Delta32/Delta32 Research Department, StemCyte international Cord Blood Center, Baldwin Park, CA, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Carolinas Cord Blood Bank, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', ""St Louis Cord Blood Bank, SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, St Louis, MO, USA."", 'Enhance Quality Consulting Inc., Oviedo, FL, USA.', 'Cell Therapy Service and Cord Blood Bank, Banc de Sang i Teixits, Barcelona, Spain.', 'BMT/Hematologic Malignancies, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Immunobiology and Observational Research, CIBMTR, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Irell and Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.']",,PMC4524463,['NOTNLM'],"['CCR5 mutation', 'CCR5-32/32 cord blood inventory', 'curing HIV infection', 'genetic modification of stem cells', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation']","['10.2147/SCCAA.S56050 [doi]', 'sccaa-8-109 [pii]']",10.2147/SCCAA.S56050 [doi],20150728,['R01 AI029329/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The approval of obinutuzumab by US Food and Drug Administration was based on a pivotal, phase III, randomized trial of chlorambucil monotherapy (n=118), chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (n=333), or chlorambucil plus rituximab (n=330) in previously untreated patients with CLL. Obinutuzumab was administered intravenously as 1,000 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil was associated with an overall response rate of 78% and a median progression-free survival of 26.7 months. Overall, obinutuzumab was fairly well tolerated in this pivotal study. The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was infusion-related reactions (20%), neutropenia (33%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and infections (7%). Obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil is a safe and effective new treatment option for previously untreated elderly patients with CLL. It should become the new standard of care for these patients with significant co-morbidities who are not candidates for fludarabine-based therapy. Obinutuzumab combination therapy with several agents that inhibit kinases involved in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, as well as many other agents utilized in the frontline and relapsed/refractory setting, is currently under investigation. As the results from these studies become available, the role of obinutuzumab is expected to expand to other settings.","['Department of Pharmacy, Georgia Regents University Medical Center, Augusta, GA, USA.']",,PMC4524526,['NOTNLM'],"['GA101', 'chlorambucil', 'obinutuzumab', 'untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia']","['10.2147/TCRM.S71839 [doi]', 'tcrm-11-1113 [pii]']",10.2147/TCRM.S71839 [doi],20150728,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, CMV reactivation was reported to be associated with a decreased risk of relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We herein retrospectively evaluated the impact of early CMV reactivation on the incidence of disease relapse after allo-HCT using the database of the Transplant Registry Unified Management Program (TRUMP) at the JSHCT. Patients who underwent their first allo-HCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors between 2000 and 2009, and who survived without disease relapse until day 100 after transplantation, were analyzed. CMV reactivation was associated with a decreased cumulative incidence of relapse among patients with AML, but not in patients with other hematological malignancies in our study. However, this benefit was nullified by the increased rate of non-relapse mortality. The underlying mechanism is unclear, but the immunological reaction against CMV reactivation plays an essential role in this association. Thus, immune augmentation treatment options including vaccination and adoptive T-cell transfer might be useful for taking advantage of the efficacy of CMV reactivation while minimizing the increase in non-relapse mortality.","['Center for Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital.']",,,,,['10.11406/rinketsu.56.825 [doi]'],10.11406/rinketsu.56.825 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax, which is the most important regulatory protein of HTLV-1, is associated with aggressive proliferation of host cells and is also a major target antigen for CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs). Recently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has proven effective for ATL, and donor-derived Tax-specific CTL might contribute to graft-versus-ATL effects in some recipients who maintained complete remission after allo-HSCT. We, for the first time, analyzed the Tax-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, phenotypes and functions of Tax-specific CTLs at single-cell levels in HLA-A24(+) ATL patients who underwent allo-HSCT. We found that 1) a particular amino acid sequence motif (PDR) in the CDR3 region of TCR-beta was conserved in different patients and also within the same patient before and after allo-HSCT, and 2) the PDR(+) Tax-specific CTL clone selectively expanded in ATL long-term survivors as less-differentiated effector memory CTLs. Actually, the PDR(+) CTL showed not only strong binding activity for the Tax-tetramer but also strong killing activity against patients' HTLV-1-infected T-cells without any reaction against normal cells. We are presently evaluating the killing activities of PDR(+) TCR-transduced T-cells against Tax in immunodeficient mice, with the aim of developing a new immunotherapy for ATL.","['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University.']","['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,['10.11406/rinketsu.56.815 [doi]'],10.11406/rinketsu.56.815 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the roles of miR-29 in the molecular pathophysiology of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) has not been investigated. Here, we show that lower levels of miR-29a were significantly associated with higher blast counts in the bone marrow and with increased disease-free survival in T-ALL patients. Furthermore, miR-29a levels are extremely reduced in T-ALL cells compared to normal T cells. Microarray analysis following introduction of synthetic miR-29a mimics into Jurkat cells revealed the downregulation of several predicted targets (CDK6, PXDN, MCL1, PIK3R1, and CXXC6), including targets with roles in active and passive DNA demethylation (such as DNMT3a, DNMT3b, and members of the TET family and TDG). Restoring miR-29a levels in Jurkat and Molt-4 T-ALL cells led to the demethylation of many genes commonly methylated in T-ALL. Overall, our results suggest that reduced miR-29a levels may contribute to the altered epigenetic status of T-ALL, highlighting its relevance in the physiopathology of this disease.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, Regional Blood Center, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, Regional Blood Center, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, Regional Blood Center, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'School of Ceilandia, University of Brasilia, Brasilia, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, Regional Blood Center, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, Regional Blood Center, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, Regional Blood Center, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, Regional Blood Center, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, Regional Blood Center, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (PXDN protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (PIK3R1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class Ia Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",PMC4637998,['NOTNLM'],"['DNMT', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'TET', 'epigenetic regulation', 'miR-29a']",['10.1111/cas.12766 [doi]'],10.1111/cas.12766 [doi],20150921,,,"['(c) 2015 The Authors.

In this work, such alkylated imidazoles were synthesized and complexed with silver(I) by means of an eight/nine-step synthetic pathway we devised to access a new class of biologically active silver complexes. The synthesis involves selective iodination of the imidazole backbone, followed by Sonogashira coupling to replace the backbone iodine. The installed alkyne moiety is then subjected to reductive hydrogenation with Pearlman's catalyst. The imidazole N1 atom is arylated by the palladium-catalyzed Buchwald N-arylation method. The imidazole N3 position was then methylated with methyl iodine, whereupon the synthesis was terminated by complexation of the imidazolium salt with silver(I) oxide. The synthetic pathway provided an overall yield of approximately 20 %. The resulting complexes were tested in vitro against HL60 and MOLM-13 leukemic cells, two human-derived cell lines that model acute myeloid leukemia. The most active compounds exhibiting low IC50 values of 14 and 27 muM, against HL60 and MOLM-13 cells, respectively. The imidazole side chain was found to be essential for high cytotoxicity, as the imidazole complex bearing a C7 side chain at the 4-position was four- to sixfold more potent than the corresponding imidazole elaborated with a methyl group.","['Department of Chemistry, University of Bergen, Allegaten 41, 5007 Bergen (Norway).', 'Center for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen (Norway).', 'Center for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen (Norway).', 'Center for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen (Norway).', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, P.B. 1400, 5021 Bergen (Norway).', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Bergen, Allegaten 41, 5007 Bergen (Norway). hans.bjorsvik@kj.uib.no.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '2465-56-7 (carbene)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)', '7GBN705NH1 (imidazole)', 'OP0UW79H66 (Methane)']",PMC4576820,['NOTNLM'],"['cytotoxicity', 'imidazoles', 'leukemia', 'metallodrugs', 'silver']",['10.1002/cmdc.201500234 [doi]'],10.1002/cmdc.201500234 [doi],20150806,,,"['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Here we evaluated outcomes of 1,041 adult transplant recipients at two centers between 2006 and 2013 and investigated how the effect of sex-mismatching differed in myeloablative, reduced-intensity, and non-myeloablative total lymphoid irradiation with anti-thymocyte globulin conditioning. Among patients who underwent myeloablative conditioning, male recipients with female donors had increased chronic graft-versus-host disease (hazard ratio 1.83, P<0.01), increased non-relapse mortality (hazard ratio 1.84, P=0.022) and inferior overall survival (hazard ratio 1.59, P=0.018). In contrast, among patients who received reduced-intensity conditioning, male recipients with female donors had increased acute graft-versus-host disease (hazard ratio 1.96, P<0.01) but no difference in non-relapse mortality or overall survival. Among the patients who underwent total lymphoid irradiation with anti-thymocyte globulin, male recipients with female donors showed no increase in graft-versus-host disease or non-relapse mortality. Notably, only in the cohort receiving total lymphoid irradiation with anti-thymocyte globulin were male recipients with female donors significantly associated with reduced relapse (hazard ratio 0.64, P<0.01), and allo-antibody responses against H-Y antigens were predictive of reduced relapse. In the cohort given total lymphoid irradiation with anti-thymocyte globulin, the graft-versus-leukemia effect resulted in superior overall survival in recipients of sex-mismatched grafts (HR 0.69, P=0.037). In addition, only in the cohort treated with total lymphoid irradiation with anti-thymocyte globulin were female recipients with male donors associated with reduced relapse (hazard ratio 0.59, P<0.01) and superior survival (hazard ratio 0.61, P=0.014) compared with sex-matched pairs. We conclude that the risks and benefits of sex-mismatched transplants appear to differ according to conditioning strategy and this could affect donor selection.","['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Health Research and Policy, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA, USA.', 'Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA evmeyer@stanford.edu.']",,PMC4825314,,,"['haematol.2015.125294 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.125294 [doi]']",10.3324/haematol.2015.125294 [doi],20150806,"['1K08HL119590-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL119590/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '1P030CA124435-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA124435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the concurrent effects of three polymorphisms affecting the integrity of DNA consist of ABCB1 C3435T, ABCG2 C421A, and XRCC1 Arg194Trp on development of chronic myeloid leukemia were studied. Furthermore, the role of these polymorphisms in clinical and laboratory outcomes of patients was evaluated. In this case-control study, 70 CML patients and 140 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. The clinical features of patients such as phase of disease and response to treatment and laboratory data before and after treatment with imatinib mesylate were collected. ABCB1 C3435T, ABCG2 C421A, and XRCC1 Arg194Trp single nucleotide polymorphisms were evaluated by restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction. The T allele of ABCB1 C3435T, T allele of XRCC1 Arg194Trp, and C allele of ABCG2 C421A polymorphisms were significantly higher in patients than controls. TT genotype of ABCB1 and TT genotype of XRCC1 were associated with higher risk of chronic myeloid leukemia development. CC421 ABCG2/TT3435 ABCB1 and CC421 ABCG2/TT27157 XRCC1 were also correlated with a higher risk of CML. Patients with C allele of ABCB1 had poor cytogenetic response, and correlation of CC421 ABCG2/TT3435 ABCB1 diplotype with accelerated phase of CML was significant. Patients with CC421 ABCG2/TT3435 ABCB1 and CC421 ABCG2/TT27157 XRCC1 diplotypes might be at higher risk to rapid and severe development of CML and have weaker response to treatments with imatinib.","['Department of Biology, Sanandaj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Sanandaj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran. abdi@muk.ac.ir.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran. abdi@muk.ac.ir.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran. bayazidg@yahoo.com.', 'Liver and Digestive Research Center, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran. bayazidg@yahoo.com.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Tohid Hospital, Geryashan Boulevard, Sanandaj, Iran. bayazidg@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.']","['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1)', '0 (XRCC1 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1', 'ABCG2', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib mesylate', 'Polymorphism', 'XRCC1']","['10.1007/s13277-015-3874-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-3874-4 [pii]']",10.1007/s13277-015-3874-4 [doi],20150807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 6.,"MOTIVATION: An ever-increasing body of evidence supports the importance of B cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) sequence restriction, alias stereotypy, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This phenomenon accounts for approximately 30% of studied cases, one in eight of which belong to major subsets, and extends beyond restricted sequence patterns to shared biologic and clinical characteristics and, generally, outcome. Thus, the robust assignment of new cases to major CLL subsets is a critical, and yet unmet, requirement. RESULTS: We introduce a novel application, ARResT/AssignSubsets, which enables the robust assignment of BcR IG sequences from CLL patients to major stereotyped subsets. ARResT/AssignSubsets uniquely combines expert immunogenetic sequence annotation from IMGT/V-QUEST with curation to safeguard quality, statistical modeling of sequence features from more than 7500 CLL patients, and results from multiple perspectives to allow for both objective and subjective assessment. We validated our approach on the learning set, and evaluated its real-world applicability on a new representative dataset comprising 459 sequences from a single institution.

Epub 2015 Jul 27.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes for cancer related mortality worldwide. Poor prognosis of HCC patients is mainly due to frequent metastasis and recurrence. Deregulation of metastasis suppressors in malignant cells plays critical roles during cancer metastasis. Thus, novel metastasis suppressors are urgently needed to be uncovered to shed new light on molecular mechanisms driving HCC metastasis. In the present study, decreased expression of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) was demonstrated in HCC, and its expression levels were even lower in HCC with metastasis. Downregulated LIFR expression predicted poor prognosis in HCC patients. LIFR was an independent and significant risk factor for their recurrence and survival. Silencing LIFR resulted in forced metastasis of HCC cells, whereas ectopic overexpression of LIFR attenuated migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, LIFR knockdown could activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase/V-akt Murine Thymoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (PI3K/AKT) signaling through enhancing phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), which successively promoted matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) expression and HCC metastasis. Combination of LIFR and p-AKT or MMP13 was a more powerful predictor of poor prognosis for HCC patients. Together, these findings conclude that LIFR functions as a novel metastasis suppressor in HCC and may serve as a prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.","['Department of Pathology, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200438, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200438, China.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (MMP13 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinase 13)']",,,,"['bgv108 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgv108 [doi]']",10.1093/carcin/bgv108 [doi],20150727,,,"['(c) The Author 2015.

Epub 2015 Aug 6.,"The RNA-binding protein, CELF1, binds to a regulatory sequence known as the GU-rich element (GRE) and controls a network of mRNA transcripts that regulate cellular activation, proliferation, and apoptosis. We performed immunoprecipitation using an anti-CELF1 antibody, followed by identification of copurified transcripts using microarrays. We found that CELF1 is bound to a distinct set of target transcripts in the H9 and Jurkat malignant T-cell lines, compared with primary human T cells. CELF1 was not phosphorylated in resting normal T cells, but in malignant T cells, phosphorylation of CELF1 correlated with its inability to bind to GRE-containing mRNAs that served as CELF1 targets in normal T cells. Lack of binding by CELF1 to these mRNAs in malignant T cells correlated with stabilization and increased expression of these transcripts. Several of these GRE-containing transcripts that encode regulators of cell growth were also stabilized and up-regulated in primary tumor cells from patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Interestingly, transcripts encoding numerous suppressors of cell proliferation that served as targets of CELF1 in malignant T cells, but not normal T cells, exhibited accelerated degradation and reduced expression in malignant compared with normal T cells, consistent with the known function of CELF1 to mediate degradation of bound transcripts. Overall, CELF1 dysfunction in malignant T cells led to the up-regulation of a subset of GRE-containing transcripts that promote cell growth and down-regulation of another subset that suppress cell growth, producing a net effect that would drive a malignant phenotype.","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA Department of Microbiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA Center for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Translational Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA Center for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Translational Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA Center for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Translational Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA Center for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Translational Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA Center for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Translational Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']","['0 (CELF1 Protein)', '0 (CELF1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",PMC4574752,['NOTNLM'],"['CELF1 phosphorylation', 'GRE', 'GU-rich element', 'cancer', 'mRNA stability']","['rna.049940.115 [pii]', '10.1261/rna.049940.115 [doi]']",10.1261/rna.049940.115 [doi],20150806,"['R56 AI057484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 AI096925/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'AI072068/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI096925/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI072068/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,"['(c) 2015 Bohjanen et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for', 'the RNA Society.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, PI3K inhibitors also significantly sensitized CML CD34+ cells to imatinib-induced apoptosis. MiR-21 or PI3K inhibitor in combination with imatinib treatment significantly decreased AKT phosphorylation and c-Myc expression than either agent did alone, but did not affect Bim and Bcl-6 expresssion. These findings indicate that miR-21 is required for maintaining the imatinib-resistant phenotype of CML CD34+ cells through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thus providing the basis for a promising therapeutic approach to eliminate CML LSCs.","[""Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Bioactive Substances, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Courses, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Bioactive Substances, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Courses, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of clinical Laboratory, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Bioactive Substances, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Bioactive Substances, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Bioactive Substances, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Courses, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Bioactive Substances, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Courses, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Bioactive Substances, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Courses, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Bioactive Substances, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Bioactive Substances, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.

Each assay was performed in blood samples from CML patients (n=224) treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, taken at diagnosis (n=14) and follow-up (n=210). Patient samples were categorized as optimal response (n=120), suboptimal response (n=54), and treatment failure (n=36). Treatment-failed patients had a significantly higher MRP1 expression (5.24% vs. 3.54%, P=0.006) and Pgp expression (5.25% vs. 3.48%, P=0.005) than responders. Both MRP1 (%) and Pgp (%) were highly specific (95.2% and 94.5%) and relatively accurate (83.0% and 82.5%) in the detection of treatment non-responders. Of treatment-failed patients, 41.2% had a positive result in at least one assay and of these patients without ABL1 kinase domain mutation, 51.9% were positive in at least one assay. However, the rhodamine-123 efflux assay failed to discriminate two patient groups.

Early response assessment has an established role as predictor of remission rate, and overall and disease-free survival. Assessment of blast percentage on bone marrow aspirate smears at this stage has its own limitations. MATERIALS AND METHOD: In this study, a total of 100 AML cases that were positive for CD34 at the time of diagnosis were included in the study. Blast percentage obtained in bone marrow aspirate smears by morphology was compared with that obtained in bone marrow biopsy using CD34 immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were discordant in 19% of the cases. In 15% of the cases, bone marrow aspirate blast count was </= 5% and bone marrow biopsy blast percentage was >5%. CONCLUSION: Early response assessment plays an important role in management of acute myeloid leukemia. In patients with CD34-positive blasts, the CD34 IHC can improve the detection of residual blasts on Day 14 bone marrow biopsy in comparison with morphological assessment of blast percentage in bone marrow aspirate.","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'early response']",['10.1111/ijlh.12406 [doi]'],10.1111/ijlh.12406 [doi],20150806,,,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DC is classically described as a mucocutaneous triad of oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy and abnormal skin pigmentation. However, excessive telomere shortening can affect almost any organ system, so the clinical manifestations are protean, including developmental delay, cerebellar hypoplasia, exudative retinopathy, aplastic anaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis, head and neck cancer and dental abnormalities, and may be multi-systemic. Undiagnosed patients may be seen by essentially any medical subspecialist. Correct diagnosis is important to ensure appropriate management, and for initiating investigations to identify affected family members. Treatment is often supportive, with transplantation offering cure for pulmonary fibrosis or bone marrow failure. Higher rates of mortality and morbidity with transplantation often require regimen alterations, underscoring the need for correct diagnosis. Short telomeres result from mutations in genes essential for telomere maintenance (e.g. genes encoding subunits of the telomerase enzyme complex). Disease severity reflects not only the severity of the defect, but also the inheritance of short telomeres, giving rise to incomplete penetrance and genetic anticipation. Attendees of the inaugural Australian Short Telomere Syndrome Conference were updated on the current scientific and clinical understanding of these disorders, and discussed the best approach for management of these patients in the Australian context. This review will include recommendations from the conference and aims to increase awareness of short telomere disorders.","[""Haematology Department, Sydney Children's Hospital Network (Westmead), Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Dyskeratosis Congenita', 'aplastic', 'cirrhosis', 'pulmonary fibrosis', 'telomere']",['10.1111/imj.12868 [doi]'],10.1111/imj.12868 [doi],,,,['(c) 2016 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying and distinguishing TP53 and ATM functional defects has become relevant as epigenetic and posttranscriptional dysregulation of the ATM/p53 axis is increasingly being recognized as the underlying cause of chemoresistance. Also, specific treatments sensitizing TP53- or ATM-deficient CLL cells are emerging. We therefore developed a new ATM-p53 functional assay with the aim to (i) identify and (ii) distinguish abnormalities of TP53 versus ATM and (iii) enable the identification of additional defects in the ATM-p53 pathway. Reversed transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (RT-MLPA) was used to measure ATM and/or p53-dependent genes at the RNA level following DNA damage using irradiation. Here, we showed that this assay is able to identify and distinguish three subgroups of CLL tumors (i.e., TP53-defective, ATM-defective and WT) and is also able to detect additional samples with a defective DDR, without molecular aberrations in TP53 and/or ATM. These findings make the ATM-p53 RT-MLPA functional assay a promising prognostic tool for predicting treatment responses in CLL.","['1] Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands [2] Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Bioinformatics Laboratory, Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '1] Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands [2] Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', '1] Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands [2] Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Center Leeuwarden, Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', '1] Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands [2] LYMMCARE (Lymphoma and Myeloma Center), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '1] Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands [2] LYMMCARE (Lymphoma and Myeloma Center), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', '1] Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands [2] Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands [3] LYMMCARE (Lymphoma and Myeloma Center), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",PMC4558513,,,"['cddis2015223 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2015.223 [doi]']",10.1038/cddis.2015.223 [doi],20150806,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone marrow karyotyping and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed at baseline and at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after the initiation of treatment with a third tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses were defined according to the European LeukemiaNet recommendations. BCR-ABL1 mutations were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: We evaluated 25 chronic myeloid leukemia patients who had been previously treated with imatinib and a second tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Nine patients were switched to dasatinib, and 16 patients were switched to nilotinib as a third-line therapy. Of the chronic phase patients (n=18), 89% achieved a complete hematologic response, 13% achieved a complete cytogenetic response and 24% achieved a major molecular response. The following BCR-ABL1 mutations were detected in 6/14 (43%) chronic phase patients: E255V, Y253H, M244V, F317L (2) and F359V. M351T mutation was found in one patient in the accelerated phase of the disease. The five-year overall, progression-free and event-free survivals were 86, 54 and 22% (p<0.0001), respectively, for chronic phase patients and 66%, 66% and 0% (p<0.0001), respectively, for accelerated phase patients. All blast crisis patients died within 6 months of treatment. Fifty-six percent of the chronic phase patients lost their hematologic response within a median of 23 months. CONCLUSIONS: Although the responses achieved by the third tyrosine kinase inhibitor were not sustainable, a third tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be an option for improving patient status until a donor becomes available for transplant. Because the long-term outcome for these patients is poor, the development of new therapies for resistant chronic myeloid leukemia patients is necessary.","['Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",PMC4518767,,,"['S1807-59322015000800550 [pii]', '10.6061/clinics/2015(08)04 [doi]']",10.6061/clinics/2015(08)04 [doi] S1807-59322015000800550 [pii],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphopeptides derived from aberrantly phosphorylated proteins that are presented on tumors and not on normal tissues by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules are promising candidates for future cancer immunotherapies, because they are tumor specific and have been shown to elicit cytotoxic T cell responses. Robust phosphopeptide enrichments that are suitable for low input amounts must be developed to characterize HLA-associated phosphopeptides from clinical samples that are limited by material availability. We present two complementary mass spectrometry-compatible, iron(III)-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) methods that use either nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) or iminodiacetic acid (IDA) in-house-fabricated columns. We developed these protocols to enrich for subfemtomole-level phosphopeptides from cell line and human tissue samples containing picograms of starting material, which is an order of magnitude less material than what is commonly used. In addition, we added a peptide esterification step to increase phosphopeptide specificity from these low-input samples. To date, hundreds of phosphopeptides displayed on melanoma, ovarian cancer, leukemia and colorectal cancer have been identified using these highly selective phosphopeptide enrichment protocols in combination with a program called 'CAD Neutral Loss Finder' that identifies all spectra containing the characteristic neutral loss of phosphoric acid from phosphorylated serine and threonine residues. This methodology enables the identification of HLA-associated phosphopeptides presented by human tissue samples containing as little as nanograms of peptide material in 2 d.","['Department of Chemistry, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', '1] Department of Chemistry, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.

Furthermore, such molecules may be applied as therapeutic agents in the case of some diseases, including dermatological disturbances, immunodeficiency, and cancer (mainly leukemia). In spite of this, there is a growing body of evidences showing that vitamin A doses exceeding the nutritional requirements may lead to negative consequences, including bioenergetics state dysfunction, redox impairment, altered cellular signaling, and cell death or proliferation, depending on the cell type. Neurotoxicity has long been demonstrated as a possible side effect of inadvertent consumption, or even under medical recommendation of vitamin A and retinoids at moderate to high doses. However, the exact mechanism by which such molecules exert a neurotoxic role is not clear yet.

Statistical inference centers on identifying the activation state of proteins and their patterns of molecular interaction formalized as dependence structure. Inference on dependence structure is particularly important when proteins are selected because they are part of a common molecular pathway. In that case, inference on dependence structure reveals properties of the underlying pathway. We propose a probability model that represents molecular interactions at the level of hidden binary latent variables that can be interpreted as indicators for active versus inactive states of the proteins. The proposed approach exploits available expert knowledge about the target pathway to define an informative prior on the hidden conditional dependence structure. An important feature of this prior is that it provides an instrument to explicitly anchor the model space to a set of interactions of interest, favoring a local search approach to model determination. We apply our model to reverse-phase protein array data from a study on acute myeloid leukemia. Our inference identifies relevant subpathways in relation to the unfolding of the biological process under study.","['Assistant Professor, Department of Biostatistics, UCLA School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Professor, Department of Mathematics, University of Texas at Austin.', 'Professor, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Texas M.

Epub 2015 Aug 5.,"Plasma membrane is now recognized to contain tightly packed cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich domains, known as lipid or membrane rafts, which are more ordered than the surrounding lipid bilayer. Lipid rafts are crucial for the compartmentalization of signaling processes in the membrane, mostly involved in cell survival and immune response. However, in the last 15 years, a large body of evidence has also identified raft platforms as scaffolds for the recruitment and clustering of death receptor Fas/CD95 and downstream signaling molecules, leading to the concept of death-promoting lipid rafts. This raft-Fas/CD95 coclustering was first described at the early 2000s as the underlying mechanism for the proapoptotic action of the alkylphospholipid analog edelfosine in leukemic cells, hence facilitating protein-protein interactions and conveying apoptotic signals independently of Fas/CD95 ligand. Edelfosine induces apoptosis in hematologic cancer cells and activated T-lymphocytes. Fas/CD95 raft coclustering is also promoted by Fas/CD95 ligand, agonistic Fas/CD95 antibodies, and additional antitumor drugs. Thus, death receptor recruitment in rafts is a physiologic process leading to cell demise that can be pharmacologically modulated. This redistribution and local accumulation of apoptotic molecules in membrane rafts, which are usually accompanied by displacement of survival signaling molecules, highlight how alterations in the apoptosis/survival signaling balance in specialized membrane regions modulate cell fate. Membrane rafts might also modulate apoptotic and nonapoptotic death receptor signaling. Here, we discuss the role of lipid rafts in Fas/CD95-mediated apoptotic cell signaling in hematologic cancer cells and normal leukocytes, with a special emphasis on their involvement as putative therapeutic targets in cancer and autoimmune diseases.","['Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain cgajate@usal.es fmollin@usal.es.', 'Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain cgajate@usal.es fmollin@usal.es.']","['0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['autoimmune disease', 'cancer', 'death receptor']","['jlb.2MR0215-055R [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.2MR0215-055R [doi]']",10.1189/jlb.2MR0215-055R [doi],20150805,,,['(c) Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 5.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of malignancies that may be sensitive to the NK cell antitumor response. However, NK cells are frequently defective in AML. In this study, we found in an exploratory cohort (n = 46) that NK cell status at diagnosis of AML separated patients in two groups with a different clinical outcome. Patients with a deficient NK cell profile, including reduced expression of some activating NK receptors (e.g., DNAX accessory molecule-1, NKp46, and NKG2D) and decreased IFN-gamma production, had a significantly higher risk of relapse (p = 0.03) independently of cytogenetic classification in multivariate analysis. Patients with defective NK cells showed a profound gene expression decrease in AML blasts for cytokine and chemokine signaling (e.g., IL15, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, and CXCR4), Ag processing (e.g., HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, and CD74) and adhesion molecule pathways (e.g., PVR and ICAM1). A set of 388 leukemic classifier genes defined in the exploratory cohort was independently validated in a multicentric cohort of 194 AML patients. In total, these data evidenced the interplay between NK cells and AML blasts at diagnosis allowing an immune-based stratification of AML patients independently of clinical classifications.","[""INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche-S1160, 75010 Paris, France; Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75010 Paris, France;"", ""Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75010 Paris, France; Service d'Hematologie Adulte, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France; Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, EA3518, 75010 Paris, France;"", ""INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche-S1160, 75010 Paris, France; Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75010 Paris, France;"", ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Histocompatibilite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France;"", ""INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche-S1172, 59045 Lille, France; Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre de Biologie-Pathologie Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire Lille, Universite de Lille, 59000 Lille, France;"", ""INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche-S1160, 75010 Paris, France; Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75010 Paris, France;"", ""Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75010 Paris, France; Laboratoire d'Hematologie Biologique, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France; Tumorotheque, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France;"", ""Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75010 Paris, France; Laboratoire d'Hematologie Biologique, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France; Tumorotheque, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France;"", 'Universite de Versailles-Saint Quentin, 78000 Versailles, France;', ""Universite Paris-Est Creteil, 94000 Creteil, France; Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Henri Mondor, 94000 Creteil, France;"", ""Service d'Hematologie Adulte, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France; Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, EA3518, 75010 Paris, France;"", 'INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche-S1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, 69008 Lyon, France; Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche-5286, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, 69008 Lyon, France; Universite Unite Mixte de Recherche-S1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, 69008 Lyon, France; Universite de Lyon, 69000 Lyon, France; and ProfileXpert, 69008 Lyon, France.', ""Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75010 Paris, France;"", ""INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche-S1172, 59045 Lille, France; Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre de Biologie-Pathologie Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire Lille, Universite de Lille, 59000 Lille, France;"", ""Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75010 Paris, France; Service d'Hematologie Adulte, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France; Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, EA3518, 75010 Paris, France;"", ""INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche-S1160, 75010 Paris, France; Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75010 Paris, France; Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Histocompatibilite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France; nicolas.dulphy@univ-paris-diderot.fr antoine.toubert@univ-paris-diderot.fr."", ""INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche-S1160, 75010 Paris, France; Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 75010 Paris, France; Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Histocompatibilite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France; nicolas.dulphy@univ-paris-diderot.fr antoine.toubert@univ-paris-diderot.fr.""]","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (HLA-DR alpha-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)', '0 (IFNGR2 protein, human)', '0 (IL15 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.1 (ST6GAL1 protein, human)']",,,,"['jimmunol.1500262 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1500262 [doi]']",10.4049/jimmunol.1500262 [doi],20150805,,,"['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,,,,,,"['GEO/GSE34885', 'GEO/GSE50928']",,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 6.,"Thrombomodulin, encoded by the THBD gene, is a critical regulator of coagulation and innate immunity. Its gene variant (rs3176123, 2729A>C) in the 3' untranslated region has been reported to be associated with vasculopathies. The present study analyzed the impact of THBD variation on transplant outcomes in a cohort of 317 patients who underwent unrelated HLA-matched bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for hematologic malignancies through the Japan Marrow Donor Program. The donor A/C or C/C genotype vs. the donor A/A genotype resulted in a lower incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease [GVHD; hazard ratio (HR) 0.66; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.44-0.99; P = 0.05] according to a multivariate analysis. In patients with grades II-IV acute GVHD, the donor A/C or C/C genotype vs. the donor A/A genotype was associated with significantly better overall survival rates (HR 0.45; 95 % CI 0.21-0.99, P = 0.05), while this effect was absent in other patients. A functional analysis using lymphocytes obtained from healthy individuals revealed that the 2729C allele has a higher level of THBD mRNA than the 2729A allele. These findings suggest the functional relevance of the rs3176123 variation and indicate that higher thrombomodulin expression by individuals with the 2729C allele likely accounts for their decreased risk for acute GVHD development and subsequent mortality.","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Kanazawa University School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa, Japan. haruka84@stu.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, 1-1 Yazakokarimata, Nagakute, 480-1195, Japan. takami-knz@umin.ac.jp.', 'Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa, Japan. luis@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Kyushu University Faculty of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, Japan. keitarom@med.kyushu-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Kanazawa University School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa, Japan. shohei@aichi-med-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan. moni5@mac.com.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kanto-Koshinetsu Block Blood Center, Tokyo, Japan. k-kashiwase@ktks.bbc.jrc.or.jp.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Prevention, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan. ymorisim@aichi-cc.jp.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. tafukuda@ncc.go.jp.', 'Department of Promotion for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Aichi Medical University, Nagoya, Japan. ykodera@river.ocn.ne.jp.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. n-doki@cick.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan. miyamu@nagoya-1st.jrc.or.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. tmori@a3.keio.jp.', 'Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa, Japan. snakao8205@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Kanazawa University School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa, Japan. sohtake@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Kanazawa University School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa, Japan. eriko86@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.']","['0 (THBD protein, human)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow transplantation', 'Graft-versus-host disease', 'Single nucleotide variation', 'THBD', 'Unrelated donor']","['10.1007/s12185-015-1852-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-015-1852-7 [pii]']",10.1007/s12185-015-1852-7 [doi],20150806,,,,,,,,,['Int J Hematol. 2015 Oct;102(4):507-8.

IRIS was initially described in patients suffering from a HIV infection who experienced immune recovery following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy.

Besides HIV integrase and the MLL1-menin complex, LEDGF/p75 interacts with various cellular proteins via its integrase binding domain (IBD). Here we present structural characterization of IBD interactions with transcriptional repressor JPO2 and domesticated transposase PogZ, and show that the PogZ interaction is nearly identical to the interaction of LEDGF/p75 with MLL1. The interaction with the IBD is maintained by an intrinsically disordered IBD-binding motif (IBM) common to all known cellular partners of LEDGF/p75. In addition, based on IBM conservation, we identify and validate IWS1 as a novel LEDGF/p75 interaction partner. Our results also reveal how HIV integrase efficiently displaces cellular binding partners from LEDGF/p75. Finally, the similar binding modes of LEDGF/p75 interaction partners represent a new challenge for the development of selective interaction inhibitors.","['Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the ASCR, v.v.i., Flemingovo nam. 2, 166 10 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague, Vinicna 5, 128 44 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics of the ASCR, v.v.i., Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'KU Leuven, Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Kapucijnenvoer 33, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics of the ASCR, v.v.i., Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the ASCR, v.v.i., Flemingovo nam. 2, 166 10 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics of the ASCR, v.v.i., Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'KU Leuven, Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Kapucijnenvoer 33, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Kapucijnenvoer 33, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Kapucijnenvoer 33, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Kapucijnenvoer 33, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Kapucijnenvoer 33, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the ASCR, v.v.i., Flemingovo nam. 2, 166 10 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the ASCR, v.v.i., Flemingovo nam. 2, 166 10 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics of the ASCR, v.v.i., Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague, Czech Republic.']","['0 (CDCA7L protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Iws1 protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (lens epithelium-derived growth factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (HIV Integrase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (PogZ protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Transposases)']",,,,"['ncomms8968 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms8968 [doi]']",10.1038/ncomms8968 [doi],20150806,,,,,,,,,,,['PDB/2N3A'],,,,,,,,,

Pediatric central nervous system tumors encompass a wide variety of diagnoses, from benign to malignant. Any brain tumor can be associated with significant morbidity, even when low grade, and mortality from pediatric central nervous system tumors is disproportionately high compared to other childhood malignancies. Management of children with central nervous system tumors requires knowledge of the unique aspects of care associated with this particular patient population, beyond general oncology care. Pediatric brain tumor patients have unique needs during treatment, as cancer survivors, and at end of life.

Hydrophobic triterpene acids also possess anti-cancer properties, but due to their low solubility they do not occur in significant amounts in aqueous extracts. Using cyclodextrins we solubilised mistletoe triterpenes (mainly oleanolic acid) and investigated the effect of a mistletoe whole plant extract on human acute myeloid leukaemia cells in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Single Viscum album L. extracts containing only solubilised triterpene acids (TT) or lectins (viscum) inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and ex vivo. The combination of viscum and TT extracts (viscumTT) enhanced the induction of apoptosis synergistically. The experiments demonstrated that all three extracts are able to induce apoptosis via caspase-8 and -9 dependent pathways with down-regulation of members of the inhibitor of apoptosis and Bcl-2 families of proteins. Finally, the acute myeloid leukaemia mouse model experiment confirmed the therapeutic effectiveness of viscumTT-treatment resulting in significant tumour weight reduction, comparable to the effect in cytarabine-treated mice. These results suggest that the combination viscumTT may have a potential therapeutic value for the treatment AML.","['Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Otto Heubner Centre for Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine (OHC), Charite -Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Otto Heubner Centre for Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine (OHC), Charite -Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Otto Heubner Centre for Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine (OHC), Charite -Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Cell Pathology, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Freie Universitat, Berlin, Germany.', 'EPO GmbH, Berlin, Germany.', 'Birken AG, Niefern-Oeschelbronn, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Otto Heubner Centre for Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine (OHC), Charite -Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Otto Heubner Centre for Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine (OHC), Charite -Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.']","['0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)']",PMC4526680,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0133892 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-04802 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0133892 [doi],20150805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The serine/arginine-rich protein kinase family (SRPKs) plays a critical role in regulating pre-mRNA splicing events through the extensive phosphorylation of splicing factors from the family of serine/arginine-rich proteins (SR proteins). Previous investigations have described the overexpression of SRPK1 and SRPK2 in leukemia and other cancer types, suggesting that they would be useful targets for developing novel antitumor strategies. Herein, we evaluated the effect of selective pharmacological SRPK inhibition by N-(2-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)isonicotinamide (SRPIN340) on the viability of lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cell lines. Along with significant cytotoxic activity, the effect of treatments in regulating the phosphorylation of the SR protein family and in altering the expression of MAP2K1, MAP2K2, VEGF and FAS genes were also assessed. Furthermore, we found that pharmacological inhibition of SRPKs can trigger early and late events of apoptosis. Finally, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission, molecular docking and molecular dynamics were analyzed to gain structural information on the SRPK/SRPIN340 complex. These data suggest that SRPK pharmacological inhibition should be considered as an alternative therapeutic strategy for fighting leukemias. Moreover, the obtained SRPK-ligand interaction data provide useful structural information to guide further medicinal chemistry efforts towards the development of novel drug candidates.","['Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.', 'Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Biologia Geral, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.', 'Centro Infantil Boldrini, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Veterinaria, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.', 'Laboratorio Nacional de Biociencias, Centro Nacional de Pesquisa em Energia e Materiais, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.', 'Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'Centro Infantil Boldrini, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brasil.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (SRPIN340)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (SRPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (SRPK2 protein, human)']",PMC4526641,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0134882 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-16866 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0134882 [doi],20150805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ph chromosome is a product of the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2). Additional genetic changes occur in less than 10 % of CML cases at the time of diagnosis and other genetic changes are seen in 60-80 % of the cases in advanced disease. Even though deletions in chromosome 9 are not rare findings in advanced phase-CML, del(9)(p23p11.1) as sole additional abnormality detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique, to our knowledge has not been described in the literature. RESULTS: A complete cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analysis, molecular biology method (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)), and immunophenotype confirmed to be a CML case in blast crisis (BC). It revealed del(9)(p23p11.1) as sole abnormality detected by FISH technique besides Ph chromosome, which leads to monoallely of tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) before Imatinib mesylate (IM) treatment.

Epub 2015 Aug 4.,"Chromosome 3q26.2 abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia, including inv(3)/t(3;3) and t(3;21), have been studied and are associated with a poor prognosis. Their prevalence, response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, and prognostic significance in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are largely unknown. In this study, we explored these aspects using a cohort of 2013 patients with CML diagnosed in the era of TKI therapy. Chromosome 3 abnormalities were observed in 116 (5.8%) of 2013 cases. These cases were divided into 5 distinct groups: A, inv(3)(q21q26.2)/t(3;3)(q21;q26.2), 26%; B, t(3;21)(q26.2;q22), 17%; C, other 3q26.2 rearrangements, 7%; D, rearrangements involving chromosome 3 other than 3q26.2 locus, 32%; and E, gain or loss of partial or whole chromosome 3, 18%. In all, 3q26.2 rearrangements were the most common chromosome 3 abnormalities (50%, groups A-C). 3q26.2 rearrangements emerged at different leukemic phases. For cases with 3q26.2 rearrangements that initially emerged in chronic or accelerated phase, they had a high rate of transformation to blast phase. Patients with 3q26.2 abnormalities showed a marginal response to TKI treatment, and no patients achieved a long-term sustainable response at a cytogenetic or molecular level. Compared with other chromosomal abnormalities in CML, patients with 3q26.2 rearrangements had poorer overall survival.

Epub 2015 Aug 4.,"BACKGROUND: Precursor T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) is a rare lymphoma presenting clinically in children and adolescents with a rapidly enlarging mediastinal mass, dyspnea, and cervical lymphadenopathy requiring quick diagnosis. The objective of the current study was to report on the spectrum of cytomorphology and flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI). METHODS: The clinical profile, cytomorphological features, FCI, and cell block immunocytochemistry (CB-ICC) of all cases of T-LBL diagnosed from 2011 through 2013 were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifteen cases of precursor T-LBL (10 fine-needle aspiration samples and 5 pleural/pericardial fluid samples) were evaluated. Smears demonstrated dispersed lymphoblasts, with a high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio and scanty basophilic cytoplasm. Nuclei demonstrated notches, clefts, and indentations. The chromatin was condensed in small and intermediate-sized blasts and dispersed in larger blasts. Nucleoli were present only in the larger blasts. Hand mirror-shaped cells and mitoses were variable. With regard to immunophenotyping, flow cytometry demonstrated positivity for CD2 (15 of 15 cases), surface CD3 (14 of 15 cases), cytoplasmic CD3 (15 of 15 cases), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) (8 of 15 cases), CD5 (13 of 15 cases), CD10 (7 of 15 cases), and human leukocyte antigen-D related (HLA-DR) (1 of 15 cases). Dual CD4/CD8 positivity was observed in all cases forming a tight cluster, which is consistent with the cortical T-LBL subtype. CB-ICC demonstrated a uniform CD3-positive/TdT-positive/CD20-negative phenotype. In 7 cases in which TdT was negative by flow cytometry, CB-ICC was positive. CONCLUSIONS: Combining cytomorphology and FCI enables the accurate and rapid diagnosis of T-LBL on fine-needle aspiration and effusion cytology specimens, thereby obviating the need for a biopsy.","['Department of Cytology and Gynecological Pathology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Cytology and Gynecological Pathology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Cytology and Gynecological Pathology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Cytology and Gynecological Pathology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['cytology', 'effusion cytology', 'flow cytometry', 'immunophenotyping', 'precursor T-lymphoblastic lymphoma']",['10.1002/cncy.21584 [doi]'],10.1002/cncy.21584 [doi],20150804,,,['(c) 2015 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical performances of a novel assay for the quantification of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts (e13a2 and e14a2) and ABL1 in a single reaction. This assay is based on the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in multiplex format. In a retrospective comparative clinical study performed in a reference laboratory, RNA was extracted from 48 CML patient blood samples with various BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratios and RT-qPCR was performed using either MAScIR assay or the RT-qPCR simplex reference assay used in routine clinical testing. The comparative clinical results showed high qualitative and quantitative concordance (correlation coefficient >0.95) between MAScIR and the reference assays. The present study illustrates the utility of MAScIR assay as a sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective quantitative device to monitor the BCR-ABL1 ratios by RT-qPCR on whole blood of diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia patients. This test could be used as an aid in the assessment of molecular response to available treatments.","['MAScIR: Moroccan Foundation for Advanced Sciences, Innovation and Research, Medical Biotechnology Center, Rabat Design, Rue Mohamed El Jazouli, Madinat Al Irfane, 10100, Rabat, Morocco.']","['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,['10.1007/s12185-015-1839-4 [doi]'],10.1007/s12185-015-1839-4 [doi],20150805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Matched case-control study. SETTING: Seascale, Cumbria, UK. PARTICIPANTS: For each case of LNHL recorded in patients under age 25 years during 1950-2006, up to 20 matched controls were chosen and parental occupational details obtained; an exception was a single working young adult, whose own occupation (and that of controls) was used. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Contact levels of occupations were categorised as: low/medium (reference group), high or very high contact levels, as in previous studies, with provision for certain unusual occupations. In particular, specialist policemen responsible for security and access at the nearby Sellafield nuclear complex were allocated to the highest contact category, and those Sellafield employees who worked in controlled areas to the middle (high) category. Since of possible bias, unusual contact aspects noted in the main research and development (R&D) building were reserved for a supplementary analysis. ORs were calculated for the occupational contact levels. RESULTS: Compared to the reference group, the social class adjusted ORs for the high and very high contact categories were 8.18 (95% CI 0.95 to 70.33) and 14.90 (1.20 to 184.90), respectively, with a significant trend across the categories (p value=0.024). In the supplementary analysis with R&D workers moved to the very high contact category, the OR for the latter became 29.68 (2.12 to 415.79), and the p value for trend, 0.011. CONCLUSIONS: The Seascale LNHL excess was most marked among those young people linked with high occupational contact levels; it is therefore not an exception to the pattern of family infection shown by other PM-related excesses. The findings have implications for the choice of controls in certain types of virus study.","['The Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",,PMC4538261,['NOTNLM'],['EPIDEMIOLOGY'],"['bmjopen-2015-008432 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008432 [doi]']",10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008432 [doi],20150804,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,"['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

It is associated with poor prognosis and is a challenging clinical problem. The objective of this paper was to provide a characterization of the CNS niche in leukemia, to elucidate the culprits of CNS involvement, including diagnostic micro RNAs (miRs) and early leukemia prognosis. CNS niche is a proper location for homing of leukemic stem cells, thus representing a candidate target in the treatment of leukemia. Recent advances in the study of leukemia hallmarks have enlightened miRs as novel biomarkers for diagnosis and detection of CNS involvement in leukemia, thus providing the opportunity to develop novel therapeutic approaches. Given the importance of prognosis and early diagnosis of CNS involvement in leukemias as well as the severe side effects of current treatments, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches should focus on identification and inhibition of the factors contributing to CNS involvement, including CXCR3, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and MCP1. MiRs such as miR-221 and miR-222 are emerging as potential tools for an innovative non-invasive therapy of CNS in leukemia affected patients.","['Health Research Institute, Research Center of Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Health Research Institute, Research Center of Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran. najmaldinsaki@gmail.com.', 'Child Health Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Health Research Institute, Research Center of Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Health Research Institute, Research Center of Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Central nervous system', 'Chemokine', 'Leukemia', 'MicroRNA', 'Stem cell niche']","['10.1007/s12094-015-1370-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-015-1370-3 [pii]']",10.1007/s12094-015-1370-3 [doi],20150805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 4.,"Neutrophils influence innate and adaptative immunity, notably through the generation of numerous cytokines and chemokines and through the modulation of their constitutive apoptosis. Several signaling cascades are known to control neutrophil responses, including the MEK pathway, which is normally coupled to ERK. However, we show here that in human neutrophils stimulated with cytokines or TLR ligands, MEK and ERK are activated independently of each other. Pharmacological blockade of MEK had no effect on the induction of ERK kinase activity and vice versa. In autologous PBMC exposed to the same stimuli or in neutrophils exposed to chemoattractants, this uncoupling of MEK and ERK was not observed. Whereas we had shown before that MEK inhibition impairs cytokine generation translationally in LPS- or TNF-stimulated neutrophils, ERK inhibition affected this response transcriptionally and translationally. Transcriptional targets or ERK include the mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK-1) and its substrates, C/EBPbeta and CREB, whereas translational targets include the S6 kinase and its substrate, the S6 ribosomal protein. In addition to affecting cytokine production, ERK inhibition interfered with how LPS or TNF promotes neutrophil survival and levels of the myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) antiapoptotic protein. Whereas the ERK-activating kinase was not identified, we found that the MAP3K, TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), acts upstream of ERK and MEK in neutrophils. Our results document a functional uncoupling of the MEK/ERK module under certain stimulatory conditions and suggest that therapeutic strategies based on MEK inhibition might benefit from being complemented by ERK inhibition, particularly in chronic inflammatory conditions featuring a strong neutrophilic component.","['*Pulmonary Division, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada; and Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.', '*Pulmonary Division, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada; and Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.', '*Pulmonary Division, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada; and Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.', '*Pulmonary Division, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada; and Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.', '*Pulmonary Division, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada; and Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada patrick.mcdonald@USherbrooke.ca.']","['EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'cytokines', 'signaling', 'transcription', 'translation']","['jlb.2MA1214-599R [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.2MA1214-599R [doi]']",10.1189/jlb.2MA1214-599R [doi],20150804,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,['(c) Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was aimed to investigate the methylation status of DNMT3A intragenic differentially methylated region 2 (DMR2) using real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (RQ-MSP) and analyze its clinical significance in AML. Aberrant hypomethylation of DNMT3A gene was found in 55.3% (84/152) of AML cases, but the status of DNMT3A hypomethylation was not correlated with the expression of four DNMT3A isoforms as well as DNMT3A mutation. There was no significant difference in the rates of complete remission (CR) between patients with and without DNMT3A hypomethylation. However, the patients with DNMT3A hypomethylation had shorter overall survival (OS) time than those without DNMT3A hypomethylation (7 months vs. 11 months, P=0.034). Moreover, the patients with DNMT3A hypomethylation also showed significantly shorter OS than those without DNMT3A hypomethylation in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) (7 months vs. 25 months, P=0.011). Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent adverse impact of DNMT3A hypomethylation in CN-AML. Our data suggest that DNMT3A DMR2 hypomethylation is a negative prognostic hallmark in CN-AML.","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.

Epub 2015 Jul 4.,"6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) plays an important role in treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPA) is an enzyme involved in 6-MP metabolic pathway that convert the inosine triphosphate (ITP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and prevents the accumulation of the toxic metabolite ITP. Our objective was to evaluate the ITPA 94C>A, IVS2+21A>C polymorphisms in patients with ALL treated with 6-MP and prediction of its clinical outcomes. Our study population consisted of 70 patients diagnosed with ALL in the Division of Hematology-Oncology of Tehran Mofid Hospital. PCR was carried out to amplify exon 2, exon 3, intron 2, and intron 3 of ITPA gene then, all the amplified fragments were subjected to directional sequencing and then association between genotype and 6-MP toxicity was studied. In this study two exonic variants including 94C>A and 138G>A showed a prevalence of 8.5% and 36.4%, respectively. Two intronic variants, IVS2+21A>C and IVS3+101G>A were found in 13.5% and 7% of the samples, respectively. The rate of myelosuppression in the presence of mutant homozygote and heterozygous alleles (94C>A, 138G>A, IVS2+21A>C and IVS3+101G>A) was higher than that of wild type alleles during the use of 6-MP. Hepatotoxicity in patients with mutant homozygous and heterozygous 94C>A and IVS3+101G>A during the treatment 6-MP was higher than before treatment with 6-MP. Our results showed that patients with aberrant ITPase genotype (mutant homozygous or heterozygous), more likely to be myelosuppressed and show liver toxicity after treatment with 6-MP. Our results suggest that pre-therapeutic screening of patients for ITPA 94C>A, IVS2+21A>C and IVS3+101G>A can help in minimizing the adverse effects of 6-MP in ALL patients.","['Molecular Medicine & Genetics Departments, Faculty of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine & Genetics Departments, Faculty of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.

In dose-ranging studies, idelalisib exposure increased in a less than dose-proportional manner, likely because of solubility-limited absorption. The approved starting dose of 150 mg twice daily was supported by extensive exposure-response evaluations, with dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily being allowed for specific toxicities. Idelalisib may be administered without regard to food on the basis of the absence of clinically relevant food effects, and was accordingly dosed in primary efficacy/safety studies. Idelalisib is metabolized primarily via aldehyde oxidase (AO) and, to a lesser extent, via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A. Coadministration with the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole 400 mg once daily resulted in a ~79 % increase in the idelalisib area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Administration with the potent inducer rifampin resulted in a 75 % decrease in idelalisib exposure (AUC) and, as such, coadministration with strong inducers should be avoided. GS-563117 is an inactive primary circulating metabolite of idelalisib formed mainly via AO. Unlike idelalisib, GS-563117 is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A. Accordingly, idelalisib 150 mg twice-daily dosing increases the midazolam AUC 5.4-fold. Clinically, idelalisib is not an inhibitor of the transporters P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or OAPT1B3. In a population pharmacokinetic model, no meaningful impact on idelalisib pharmacokinetics was noted for any of the covariates tested.

The underlying epigenetic mechanism is not clear. We studied the role of a transcriptional modulator, megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) in this process. We report here that MKL1 deficiency ameliorated BDL-induced liver fibrosis in mice as assessed by histological stainings and expression levels of pro-fibrogenic genes. MKL1 silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated TGF-beta induced transactivation of pro-fibrogenic genes in portal fibroblast cells. TGF-beta stimulated the binding of MKL1 on the promoters of pro-fibrogenic genes and promoted the interaction between MKL1 and SMAD3. While SMAD3 was necessary for MKL1 occupancy on the gene promoters, MKL1 depletion impaired SMAD3 binding reciprocally. TGF-beta treatment induced the accumulation of trimethylated histone H3K4 on the gene promoters by recruiting a methyltransferase complex. Knockdown of individual members of this complex significantly weakened the binding of SMAD3 and down-regulated the activation of portal fibroblast cells. In conclusion, we have identified an epigenetic pathway that dictates TGF-beta induced pro-fibrogenic transcription in portal fibroblast thereby providing novel insights for the development of therapeutic solutions to treat liver fibrosis.","['Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Nursing, Jiangsu Jiankang Vocational University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.

The mechanisms underpinning these activities remain poorly understood. In this study, the cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activities of fucoidan were investigated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The human AML cell lines NB4, KG1a, HL60, and K562 were treated with fucoidan and cell cycle, cell proliferation, and expression of apoptotic pathways molecules were analyzed. Fucoidan suppressed the proliferation and induced apoptosis through the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell lines NB4 and HL60, but not in KG1a and K562 cells. In NB4 cells, apoptosis was caspase-dependent as it was significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor. P21/WAF1/CIP1 was significantly up-regulated leading to cell cycle arrest. Fucoidan decreased the activation of ERK1/2 and down-regulated the activation of AKT through hypo-phosphorylation of Thr(308) residue but not Ser(473). In vivo, a xenograft model using the NB4 cells was employed. Mice were fed with fucoidan and tumor growth was measured following inoculation with NB4 cells. Subsequently, splenic natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic activity was also examined. Oral doses of fucoidan significantly delayed tumor growth in the xenograft model and increased cytolytic activity of NK cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the selective inhibitory effect of fucoidan on APL cells and its protective effect against APL development in mice warrant further investigation of fucoidan as a useful agent in treatment of certain types of leukemia.","['Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Marinova Pty Ltd., Cambridge, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.']","['0 (Polysaccharides)', '9072-19-9 (fucoidan)']",,,,['10.1002/jcp.25119 [doi]'],10.1002/jcp.25119 [doi],,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 1.,"Myeloid leukemia cells maintain a high intracellular ROS level and use redox signals for survival. The metabolism of ROS also affects cell fate, including cell death and differentiation. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are major antioxidant enzymes that have high levels of expression in myeloid leukemia cells. However, the role of SODs in the regulation of myeloid leukemia cells' biological function is still unclear. To investigate the function of SODs in myeloid leukemia cell death and differentiation, we used myeloid leukemia cell lines K562, MEG-01, TF-1, and HEL cells for this study. We found that PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells is accompanied by cell death and SOD1 down-regulation, while SOD2 expression is not affected. The role of SOD1 is verified when ATN-224, a SOD1 specific inhibitor, inhibits cell proliferation and promotes cell death in myeloid leukemia cells without PMA treatment. Moreover, inhibition or silencing of SODs further increases cell death and decreases polyploidization induced by PMA while they were partially reversed by SOD1 overexpression. Thus, SOD1 expression is required for myeloid leukemia cell fate determination. In addition, the knockdown of PKD2 reduces cell death and promotes polyploidization induced by PMA. PMA/PKD2-mediated necrosis via PARP cleavage involves both SOD1-dependent and -independent pathways. Finally, ATN-224 enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation by Ara-C. Taken together, the results demonstrate that SOD1 regulates cell death and differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells. ATN-224 may be beneficial for myeloid leukemia therapy.","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan; Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan.

Epub 2015 Aug 4.,"Steroid hormone-regulated differentiation of uterine stromal cells, known as decidualization, is essential for embryo implantation. The role of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1) during this differentiation process is unclear. Development of conditional Esr1-null mice showed that deletion of this gene in both epithelial and stromal compartments of the uterus leads to a complete blockade of decidualization, indicating a critical role of ESR1 during this process. To further elucidate the cell type-specific function of ESR1 in the uterus, we created WE(d/d) mice in which Esr1 is ablated in uterine luminal and glandular epithelia but is retained in the stroma. Uteri of WE(d/d) mice failed to undergo decidualization, indicating that epithelial ESR1 contributes to stromal differentiation via a paracrine mechanism. We noted markedly reduced production of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in WE(d/d) uteri. Supplementation with LIF restored decidualization in WE(d/d) mice. Our study indicated that LIF acts synergistically with progesterone to induce the expression of Indian hedgehog (IHH) in uterine epithelium and its receptor patched homolog 1 in the stroma. IHH then induces the expression of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II, a transcription factor that promotes stromal differentiation. To address the mechanism by which LIF induces IHH expression, we used mice lacking uterine epithelial signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, a well-known mediator of LIF signaling. Our study revealed that LIF-mediated induction of IHH occurs without the activation of epithelial signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 but uses an alternate pathway involving the activation of the ERK1/2 kinase. Collectively our results provide unique insights into the paracrine mechanisms by which ESR1 directs epithelial-stromal dialogue during pregnancy establishment.","['Departments of Molecular and Integrative Physiology (S.P., M.K.B.) and Comparative Biosciences (M.J.L., I.C.B.), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801.', 'Departments of Molecular and Integrative Physiology (S.P., M.K.B.) and Comparative Biosciences (M.J.L., I.C.B.), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801.', 'Departments of Molecular and Integrative Physiology (S.P., M.K.B.) and Comparative Biosciences (M.J.L., I.C.B.), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801.', 'Departments of Molecular and Integrative Physiology (S.P., M.K.B.) and Comparative Biosciences (M.J.L., I.C.B.), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801.']","['0 (COUP Transcription Factor II)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Patched Receptors)', '0 (Patched-1 Receptor)', '0 (Ptch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (ihh protein, mouse)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",PMC4552438,,,['10.1210/me.2015-1142 [doi]'],10.1210/me.2015-1142 [doi],20150804,"['R21 HD078983/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HD055787/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parvovirus B19 (B19V) shows a remarkably restricted tropism for erythropoietin-dependent erythroid differentiation stages, and thus this virus provides an opportunity to deliver cargo to these intermediate differentiated cells. Here we report the construction of a delivery system from B19V subunits that maintains the highly selective cell-entry of the native virus and offers versatile cargo transport. To obtain this specific carrier, we conjugated the cell-targeting VP1u region of B19V to NeutrAvidin as a loading platform for biotinylated cargos. The VP1u-NeutrAvidin conjugate delivered fluorophores, DNA, and toxic payloads specifically to erythroid cells around the proerythroblast differentiation stage, including erythroleukemic cells. The VP1u-NeutrAvidin represents a unique cell surface marker which exclusively detects intermediate erythroid differentiation stages. Furthermore, the cell-entering property of this viral-based targeting system offers opportunities for erythroid-specific drug delivery or gene therapy.","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Bern , 3012 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Bern , 3012 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Bern , 3012 Bern, Switzerland.', 'CSL Behring AG , 3014 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Bern , 3012 Bern, Switzerland.', 'CSL Behring AG , 3014 Bern, Switzerland.']","['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (capsid protein VP1, parvovirus B19)', '0 (neutravidin)', '1405-69-2 (Avidin)']",,,,['10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5b00321 [doi]'],10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5b00321 [doi],20150813,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the first case of C. innocuum osteomyelitis and bacteremia in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Findings were compared with previously reported cases of C. innocuum infections in immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, leukemia, and organ transplantation. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 32-year-old Japanese male was admitted for persistent low-grade fever and purpura lasting for 1 month. Complete blood counts and cytogenetic analysis identified Ph1-positive ALL, which was successfully treated using chemotherapy. However, the patient developed high fever and lumbar pain during complete remission. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and computed tomography demonstrated osteomyelitis. C. innocuum was identified as the causative agent and the patient was successfully treated using antibiotic therapy. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: We performed a literature review revealing a number of common aspects to the clinical presentation of C. innocuum infection and an association with various comorbidities. Further, we highlight the most efficient diagnostic and treatment strategies for C. innocuum osteomyelitis. CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium innocuum can be a causative pathogen of osteomyelitis and bacteremia in immunocompromised patients.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8655 Japan ; Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8655 Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8655 Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8655 Japan.', 'Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8655 Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Diseases, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8655 Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8655 Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8655 Japan.']",,PMC4518021,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Clostridium innocuum', 'Direct 16S-rRNA sequencing', 'Neutropenic enterocolitis', 'Osteomyelitis']","['10.1186/s40064-015-1176-3 [doi]', '1176 [pii]']",10.1186/s40064-015-1176-3 [doi],20150729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 3.,"Aurora kinase B, one of the three members of the mammalian Aurora kinase family, is the catalytic component of the chromosomal passenger complex, an essential regulator of chromosome segregation in mitosis. Aurora B is overexpressed in human tumors although whether this kinase may function as an oncogene in vivo is not established. Here, we report a new mouse model in which expression of the endogenous Aurkb locus can be induced in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of Aurora B in cultured cells induces defective chromosome segregation and aneuploidy. Long-term overexpression of Aurora B in vivo results in aneuploidy and the development of multiple spontaneous tumors in adult mice, including a high incidence of lymphomas. Overexpression of Aurora B also results in a reduced DNA damage response and decreased levels of the p53 target p21(Cip1) in vitro and in vivo, in line with an inverse correlation between Aurora B and p21(Cip1) expression in human leukemias. Thus, overexpression of Aurora B may contribute to tumor formation not only by inducing chromosomal instability but also by suppressing the function of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(Cip1).","['Cell Division and Cancer Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cell Division and Cancer Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cell Division and Cancer Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cell Division and Cancer Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid, Spain.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', 'Histopathology Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid, Spain.', 'Histopathology Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cytogenetics Unit, M.

Epub 2015 Aug 3.,"PURPOSE: ROR1, a receptor in the noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, is upregulated in malignant B cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. It has been shown that the Wnt/PCP pathway drives pathogenesis of CLL, but which factors activate the ROR1 and PCP pathway in CLL cells remains unclear. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: B lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of CLL patients were negatively separated using RosetteSep (StemCell) and gradient density centrifugation. Relative expression of WNT5A, WNT5B, and ROR1 was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Protein levels, protein interaction, and downstream signaling were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Migration capacity of primary CLL cells was analyzed by the Transwell migration assay. RESULTS: By analyzing the expression in 137 previously untreated CLL patients, we demonstrate that WNT5A and WNT5B genes show dramatically (five orders of magnitude) varying expression in CLL cells. High WNT5A and WNT5B expression strongly associates with unmutated IGHV and shortened time to first treatment. In addition, WNT5A levels associate, independent of IGHV status, with the clinically worst CLL subgroups characterized by dysfunctional p53 and mutated SF3B1. We provide functional evidence that WNT5A-positive primary CLL cells have increased motility and attenuated chemotaxis toward CXCL12 and CCL19 that can be overcome by inhibitors of Wnt/PCP signaling. CONCLUSIONS: These observations identify Wnt-5a as the crucial regulator of ROR1 activity in CLL and suggest that the autocrine Wnt-5a signaling pathway allows CLL cells to overcome natural microenvironmental regulation.","['Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Medical Faculty, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.

Epub 2015 Aug 3.,"PURPOSE: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is potentially curative for acute leukemia (AL), but carries considerable risk. Machine learning algorithms, which are part of the data mining (DM) approach, may serve for transplantation-related mortality risk prediction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This work is a retrospective DM study on a cohort of 28,236 adult HSCT recipients from the AL registry of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The primary objective was prediction of overall mortality (OM) at 100 days after HSCT. Secondary objectives were estimation of nonrelapse mortality, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival at 2 years. Donor, recipient, and procedural characteristics were analyzed. The alternating decision tree machine learning algorithm was applied for model development on 70% of the data set and validated on the remaining data. RESULTS: OM prevalence at day 100 was 13.9% (n=3,936). Of the 20 variables considered, 10 were selected by the model for OM prediction, and several interactions were discovered. By using a logistic transformation function, the crude score was transformed into individual probabilities for 100-day OM (range, 3% to 68%). The model's discrimination for the primary objective performed better than the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation score (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.701 v 0.646; P<.001). Calibration was excellent. Scores assigned were also predictive of secondary objectives. CONCLUSION: The alternating decision tree model provides a robust tool for risk evaluation of patients with AL before HSCT, and is available online (http://bioinfo.lnx.biu.ac.il/ approximately bondi/web1.html). It is presented as a continuous probabilistic score for the prediction of day 100 OM, extending prediction to 2 years. The DM method has proved useful for clinical prediction in HSCT.","[""Roni Shouval, Hila Mishan-Shamay, Avichai Shimoni, and Arnon Nagler, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer; Roni Shouval, Ori Bondi, and Ron Unger, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel; Myriam Labopin, Norbert C.

Epub 2015 Aug 3.,"PURPOSE: Previous studies have reported that survivors of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have an increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma; however, risks associated with specific treatments and immune-related risk factors have not been quantified. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated second melanoma risk among 44,870 1-year survivors of first primary NHL diagnosed at age 66 to 83 years from 1992 to 2009 and included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. Information on NHL treatments, autoimmune diseases, and infections was derived from Medicare claims. RESULTS: A total of 202 second melanoma cases occurred among survivors of NHL, including 91 after chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and 111 after other NHL subtypes (cumulative incidence by age 85 years: CLL/SLL, 1.37%; other NHL subtypes, 0.78%). Melanoma risk after CLL/SLL was significantly increased among patients who received infused fludarabine-containing chemotherapy with or without rituximab (n=18: hazard ratio [HR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.40; n=10: HR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.42 to 6.01, respectively). Significantly elevated risks also were associated with T-cell activating autoimmune diseases diagnosed before CLL/SLL (n=36: HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.34 to 3.84) or after CLL/SLL (n=49: HR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.66 to 5.12). In contrast, among patients with other NHL subtypes, melanoma risk was not associated with specific treatments or with T-cell/B-cell immune conditions. Generally, infections were not associated with melanoma risk, except for urinary tract infections (CLL/SLL), localized scleroderma, pneumonia, and gastrohepatic infections (other NHLs). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest immune perturbation may contribute to the development of melanoma after CLL/SLL. Increased vigilance is warranted among survivors of NHL to maximize opportunities for early detection of melanoma.","['Clara J.K. Lam, Rochelle E. Curtis, Graca M. Dores, Eric A. Engels, Neil E.

Given their potential to stimulate both adaptive and innate antitumor immune responses, dendritic cells (DCs) have come under intense scrutiny in recent years as pharmacological tools for cancer immunotherapy. Conceptually, the clinical effectiveness of this form of active immunotherapy relies on the completion of three critical steps: 1) the DCs used as immunotherapeutic vehicles must properly activate the antitumor immune effector cells of the host, 2) these immune effector cells must be receptive to stimulation by the DCs and be competent to mediate their antitumor effects, which 3) requires overcoming the various immune-inhibitory mechanisms used by the tumor cells. In this review, following a brief overview of the pivotal milestones in the history of cancer immunotherapy, we will introduce the reader to the basic immunobiological and pharmacological principles of active cancer immunotherapy using DCs. We will then discuss how current research is trying to define the optimal parameters for each of the above steps to realize the full clinical potential of DC therapeutics. Given its high suitability for immune interventions, acute myeloid leukemia was chosen here to showcase the latest research trends driving the field of DC-based cancer immunotherapy.","['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tumor Immunology Group (S.A., H.H.V.A., H.G., E.L., V.F.V.T., Z.N.B.), and Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Center for Oncological Research (E.L.S.), University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium;

With the introduction of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), many older adults are now eligible to receive allo-HCT, including those who are medically less fit to receive myeloablative conditioning. Furthermore, AML patients commonly have no human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical or medically suitable sibling donor available to proceed with allo-HCT. Technical advances in donor matching, suppression of alloreactivity, and supportive care have made it possible to use alternative donors, such as unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) and partially HLA-matched related (haploidentical) donors. Outcomes after alternative donor allo-HCT are now approaching the outcomes observed for conventional allo-HCT with matched related and unrelated donors. Thus, with both UCB and haploidentical donors available, lack of donor should rarely be a limiting factor in offering an allo-HCT to adults with AML.","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, 420 Delaware Street SE, Mayo Mail Code 480, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. nbejanya@umn.edu.', 'Hematology and Oncology Department, Staten Island University Hospital, 475 Seaview Ave, Staten Island, NY 10305, USA. husamhaddad@yahoo.com.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, 420 Delaware Street SE, Mayo Mail Code 480, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. bruns072@umn.edu.']",,PMC4484998,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Haploidentical', 'Transplantation', 'UCB', 'alternative donor']","['jcm4061240 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm4061240 [doi]']",10.3390/jcm4061240 [doi],20150609,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may involve the subperiosteum and dura mater and, on rare occasions, can also invade the brain parenchyma. The disease is most commonly seen in children or young adults; however, it has been described in multiple age groups. MS can be seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia and other myeloproliferative disorders. This entity has the potential to be underdiagnosed if the MS appearance precedes the first diagnosis of leukemia. The main reason is that their appearance on CT and MRI has a broad differential diagnosis, and proper diagnosis of MS can only be made if the imaging findings are correlated with the clinical history and laboratory findings. Herein, we describe the intracranial CNS manifestations of MS in patients with AML on CT and MRI involving the brain and/or meninges. This study is based on a systematic review of the literature. In addition, three case reports from the author's institution with AML and intracranial involvement of MS are included.

The DCs were generated from the PBMC samples that were collected from the PB of 10 consecutive ALL children. On day 3 of culturing, the cells in the antigen + no Talpha1 (AN) and antigen + Talpha1 (AT) groups were incubated with 100 microl lysates obtained from freezethaw cycling. After 5 days of incubation, the AT group was administered with 100 ng/ml Talpha1. On day 8, the DCs were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated cluster of differentiation (CD)1a, CD83 and HLADR antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. In addition, the killing activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from the different groups on wildtype leukemia cells was measured. The DCs in the AT group exhibited more apparent, characteristic dendritic morphologies than the control and AN group DCs. Furthermore, the lowest expression level of CD1a, and the highest expression of CD83 and HLADR were observed in the AT group when compared with the AN and control groups (P<0.05). The lactate dehydrogenase release assay demonstrated that the killing rate of CTL in the AT group was significantly higher than that in the control and AN groups (P<0.01). Thus, Talpha1 may markedly promote the phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs, and may serve as a suitable immunomodulator of DCbased immunotherapy for treatment of hematological malignancies.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, P.R.

Traditionally, AML classification and risk stratification relied on cytogenetic studies; however, molecular detection of gene mutations is playing an increasingly important role in classification, risk stratification, and management of AML. Molecular testing does not take the place of cytogenetic testing results, but plays a complementary role to help refine prognosis, especially within specific AML subgroups. With the exception of acute promyelocytic leukemia, AML therapy is not targeted but the intensity of therapy is driven by the prognostic subgroup. Many prognostic scoring systems classify patients into favorable, poor, or intermediate prognostic subgroups based on clinical and genetic features. Current standard of care combines cytogenetic results with targeted testing for mutations in FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, and KIT to determine the prognostic subgroup. Other gene mutations have also been demonstrated to predict prognosis and may play a role in future risk stratification, although some of these have not been confirmed in multiple studies or established as standard of care. This paper will review the contribution of cytogenetic results to prognosis in AML and then will focus on molecular mutations that have a prognostic or possible therapeutic impact.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Divisions of Hematopathology and Molecular Genetic Pathology, University of Minnesota, MMC Box 609 Mayo, 420 Delaware St. SE.

Previous studies have shown the exhaustion of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) in leukemic marrow, whereas hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remain functional upon relocation to non-leukemic marrow. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms, especially the specific niche components that are responsible for the degeneration of HPCs, are unknown. In this study, we focused on murine bone mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their supporting function for normal hematopoietic cells in Notch1-induced acute T-cell lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) mice. We demonstrate that the proliferative capability and differentiation potential of T-ALL MSCs were impaired due to accelerated cellular senescence. RNA-seq analysis revealed significant transcriptional alterations in leukemic MSCs. After co-cultured with the MSCs from T-ALL mice, a specific inhibitory effect on HPCs was defined, whereas in vivo repopulating potential of normal HSCs was not compromised. Furthermore, osteoprotegerin was identified as a cytokine to improve the function of T-ALL MSCs and to enhance normal HPC output via the p38/ERK pathway. Therefore, this study reveals a novel cellular mechanism underlying the inhibition of HPC generation in T-ALL. Leukemic MSCs may serve as a cellular target for improving normal hematopoietic regeneration therapeutically.","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colleage, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colleage, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colleage, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colleage, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colleage, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colleage, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colleage, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colleage, Tianjin, China.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colleage, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colleage, Tianjin, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine and Department of Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Colleage, Tianjin, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China.']",['0 (Osteoprotegerin)'],,,,"['leu2015210 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.210 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.210 [doi],20150804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 4.,"Bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) are very effective in recruiting and activating T cells. We tested the cytotoxicity of the CD33/CD3 BiTE antibody construct AMG 330 on primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells ex vivo and characterized parameters contributing to antileukemic cytolytic activity. The E:T ratio and the CD33 expression level significantly influenced lysis kinetics in long-term cultures of primary AML cells (n=38). AMG 330 induced T-cell-mediated proinflammatory conditions, favoring the upregulation of immune checkpoints on target and effector cells. Although not constitutively expressed at the time of primary diagnosis (n=123), PD-L1 was strongly upregulated on primary AML cells upon AMG 330 addition to ex vivo cultures (n=27, P<0.0001). This phenomenon was cytokine-driven as the sole addition of interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha also induced expression. Through blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, AMG 330-mediated lysis (n=9, P=0.03), T-cell proliferation (n=9, P=0.01) and IFN-gamma secretion (n=8, P=0.008) were significantly enhanced. The combinatorial approach was most beneficial in settings of protracted AML cell lysis. Taken together, we have characterized a critical resistance mechanism employed by primary AML cells under AMG 330-mediated proinflammatory conditions. Our results support the evaluation of checkpoint molecules in upcoming clinical trials with AMG 330 to enhance BiTE antibody construct-mediated cytotoxicity.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU-Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Clinical Co-operation Group Immunotherapy at the Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'AMGEN Research (Munich) GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'AMGEN Research (Munich) GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'AMGEN Research (Munich) GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU-Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Clinical Co-operation Group Immunotherapy at the Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU-Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Clinical Co-operation Group Immunotherapy at the Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Dr von Haunersches Kinderspital, Ludwig Maximilians-Universitat (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU-Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU-Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Clinical Co-operation Group Immunotherapy at the Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU-Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU-Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU-Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'AMGEN Research (Munich) GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU-Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, LMU-Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Clinical Co-operation Group Immunotherapy at the Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']","['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '6Z4B5PJ4OP (AMG 330)']",,,,"['leu2015214 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.214 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.214 [doi],20150804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 4.,"l-asparaginase (ASNase), a key component in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), hydrolyzes plasma asparagine and glutamine and thereby disturbs metabolic homeostasis of leukemic cells. The efficacy of such therapeutic strategy will depend on the capacity of cancer cells to adapt to the metabolic challenge, which could relate to the activation of compensatory metabolic routes. Therefore, we studied the impact of ASNase on the main metabolic pathways in leukemic cells. Treating leukemic cells with ASNase increased fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) and cell respiration and inhibited glycolysis. FAO, together with the decrease in protein translation and pyrimidine synthesis, was positively regulated through inhibition of the RagB-mTORC1 pathway, whereas the effect on glycolysis was RagB-mTORC1 independent. As FAO has been suggested to have a pro-survival function in leukemic cells, we tested its contribution to cell survival following ASNase treatment. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO significantly increased the sensitivity of ALL cells to ASNase. Moreover, constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway increased apoptosis in leukemic cells treated with ASNase, but did not increase FAO. Our study uncovers a novel therapeutic option based on the combination of ASNase and FAO inhibitors.","['CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Charles University Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CIC bioGUNE Technology Park of Bizkaia, Derio, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Structural Biology and Cell Signaling, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Bioenergetics, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Charles University Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CIC bioGUNE Technology Park of Bizkaia, Derio, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Structural Biology and Cell Signaling, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Bioenergetics, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Equipe 11 labellisee par la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer; INSERM U1138; Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Metabolomics and Molecular Cell Biology Platforms; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Charles University Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Structural Biology and Cell Signaling, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Bioenergetics, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Bioenergetics, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Equipe 11 labellisee par la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer; INSERM U1138; Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Metabolomics and Molecular Cell Biology Platforms; Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Pole de Biologie; Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou; AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes; Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'CIC bioGUNE Technology Park of Bizkaia, Derio, Spain.', 'Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular biology, University of the Basque Country, Leioa, Spain.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Charles University Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Charles University Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.']","['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,"['leu2015213 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.213 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.213 [doi],20150804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By analyzing and comparing the similarities and differences among these three networks, a number of key pathways were highlighted. In addition, identifying the upstream and the downstream nodes, which were composed of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs in the networks provided assistance in identifying associations between circleregulations or selfadaptation regulations among these elements. In the present study, the TP53 gene and the TP53 pathway were observed to be important in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the predicted transcriptional factors, including EFKB1 and E2F1, which were found with selfadaptaion associations and certain abnormally expressed miRNAs in the network of differentially expressed factors, requires further examination in further investigations of the pathogenesis of ALL.

Epub 2015 Jul 31.,"Double-unit cord blood (DCB) grafts are a rapidly available stem cell source for adults with high-risk leukemias. However, how disease-free survival (DFS) after DCB transplantation (DCBT) compares to that of unrelated donor transplantation (URDT) is not fully established. We analyzed 166 allograft recipients (66 8/8 HLA-matched URDT, 45 7/8 HLA-matched URDT, and 55 DCBT) ages 16 to 60 years with high-risk acute leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). URDT and DCBT recipients were similar except DCBT recipients were more likely to have lower weight and non-European ancestry and to receive intermediate-intensity conditioning. All URDT recipients received a CD34(+) cell-selected (T cell-depleted) graft. Overall, differences between the 3-year transplantation-related mortality were not significant (8/8 URDT, 18%; 7/8 URDT, 39%; and DCBT, 24%; P = .108), whereas the 3-year relapse risk was decreased after DCBT (8/8 URDT, 23%; 7/8 URDT, 20%; and DCBT 9%, P = .037). Three-year DFS was 57% in 8/8 URDT, 41% in 7/8 URDT, and 68% in DCBT recipients (P = .068), and the 3-year DFS in DCBT recipients was higher than that of 7/8 URDT recipients (P = .021). In multivariate analysis in acute leukemia patients, factors adversely associated with DFS were female gender (hazard ratio [HR], 1.68; P = .031), diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR, 2.09; P = .004), and 7/8 T cell-depleted URDT (HR, 1.91; P = .037). High DFS can be achieved in adults with acute leukemia and CML with low relapse rates after DCBT. Our findings support performing DCBT in adults in preference to HLA-mismatched T cell-depleted URDT and suggest DCBT is a readily available alternative to T cell-depleted 8/8 URDT, especially in patients requiring urgent transplantation.","['Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York; Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.

Epub 2015 Jul 20.,"Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is involved in many biological processes, including erythropoiesis and cell proliferation. However, the role of SPARC in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remains to be elucidated. Pyrimidine analogue cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) is among the most effective agents used in the treatment of acute leukemia. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the chemotherapeutic activity of Ara-C was enhanced by the overexpression of SPARC. DNA microarray technology and RNA sequencing were employed to examine differential gene expression in the apoptosis signaling pathway after gene change occurred in cells following drug treatment. The results showed that upregulation of the expression of SPARC induced SKM-1 cell death and inhibited proliferation. Additionally, the apoptotic rate of SPARC overexpression combined with Ara-C increased significantly. Transcription factors CPBP and ZNF333 regulated the 69 genes and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Moreover, the mRNA and protein expression of apoptosis-related genes in the DNA microarray results were increased. These results suggest that SPARC expression changes with Ara-C, revealing a possible application in the treatment of MDS.","[""Department of Emergency, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Yuzhong, Chongqing 400016, P.R.

Epub 2015 Aug 4.,"The relationship between miscarriage and fertility is complex. While most healthcare settings treat miscarriage as a problem of subfertility in assisted reproduction units, others believe that miscarriage occurs in super-fertile women. Infertile women undergoing assisted reproduction are at a greater risk of having a miscarriage especially at an advanced age compared with women conceiving naturally. Aberrant expression of immunological factors and chromosomal abnormalities underlie both infertility and miscarriage. Common risk factors include increased maternal age, obesity, smoking, alcohol, pre-existing medical conditions and anatomical abnormalities of the reproductive system. Management pathways of both conditions may be similar with pre-implantation genetic testing and assisted reproductive technology used in both conditions. This paper discusses the synergies and differences between the two conditions in terms of their epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, risk factors and management strategies. The two conditions are related as degrees of severity of reproductive failure with common pathways in manifestation and management.","['Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, University of Aberdeen Medical School, Foresterhill, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZD, UK.', ""Dugald Baird Centre for Research on Women's Health, Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, Cornhill Road, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZL, UK.""]","['0 (Antibodies, Antiphospholipid)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Mucin-1)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['advanced maternal age', 'assisted reproductive technology', 'infertility', 'miscarriage', 'recurrent miscarriage', 'spontaneous abortion', 'subfertility']",['10.2217/whe.15.19 [doi]'],10.2217/whe.15.19 [doi],20150804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, our group demonstrated that a heptamer, mh1 (Bcl2), targeting human Bcl-2 mRNA, can be taken up by cells without the use of any transfection reagents and can induce the apoptosis of leukemia cells. However, little is known regarding the mechanism of naked small guide (sg)RNA uptake by cultured cells. Therefore, in the present study the effects of various inhibitors on the induction of apoptosis by naked sgRNA treatment were investigated in order to identify the uptake pathway required for sgRNA function in cultured cells. Addition of the endocytosis inhibitors chlorpromazine, nystatin or methylbetacyclodextrin together with naked effective sgRNA was unable to diminish the apoptosisinducing effects of naked sgRNA or the reduction in target mRNA, suggesting that functional uptake of sgRNA by cells is clathrin, caveolae and raftindependent. Next, chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosome acidification, and brefeldin A, an inhibitor that blocks protein transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum were administered. In the presence of these compounds, the apoptosisinducing effects of naked sgRNA were reduced. These results suggest that a vesicular transport process is involved in sgRNAmediated TRUE gene silencing. A greater understanding of how naked sgRNAs enter cells and how they reach their target RNAs may aid in the design of more specificallytargeted and potent sgRNA drugs.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Dental Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608586, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Dental Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608586, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Dental Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608586, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Life Sciences, Niigata University of Pharmacy and Applied Life Sciences, Niigata, Niigata 9568603, Japan.']","['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Guide)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '0 (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin)', '1400-61-9 (Nystatin)', 'U42B7VYA4P (Chlorpromazine)']",,,,['10.3892/mmr.2015.4160 [doi]'],10.3892/mmr.2015.4160 [doi],20150731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At nanomolar concentrations, they were equipotent to CDDO-Im for inducing differentiation and apoptosis in U937 leukemia cells. As inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to carcinogenesis, we also assessed their cytoprotective potential. The new compounds suppressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells and significantly elevated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and quinone reductase (NQO1) mRNA and protein levels in various mouse tissues in vivo. Most importantly, pharmacokinetic studies performed in vitro in human plasma and in vivo showed that each new analogue was more stable than CDDO-Im. Much higher concentrations of the new derivatives were found in mouse liver, lung, pancreas and kidney after gavage in contrast to CDDO-Im. Because of their better bioavailability and their excellent anti-inflammatory profile in vitro, CDDO-2P-Im and CDDO-3P-Im were tested for prevention in a highly relevant mouse lung cancer model, in which A/J mice develop lung carcinomas after injection of vinyl carbamate, a potent carcinogen.

We investigated the effects of NVP-BKM120, a potent pan-class I PI3K inhibitor, in lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines. METHODS: Effects of NVP-BKM120 on cell viability, clonogenicity, apoptosis, cell cycle, cell signalling and autophagy were assessed in vitro on T-ALL (Jurkat and MOLT-4) and BL (Daudi and NAMALWA) cell lines. RESULTS: NVP-BKM120 treatment decreased cell viability and clonogenic growth in all tested cells. Moreover, the drug arrested cell cycling in association with a decrease in Cyclin B1 protein levels, and increased apoptosis. Immunoblotting analysis of cells treated with the drug revealed decreased phosphorylation, in a dose-dependent manner, of AKT, mTOR, P70S6K and 4EBP1, with stable total protein levels. Additionally, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in BAD phosphorylation, in association with augmented BAX:BCL2 ratio. Quantification of autophagy showed a dose-dependent increase in acidic vesicular organelles in all cells tested. CONCLUSION: In summary, our present study establishes that NVP-BKM120 presents an effective antitumour activity against T-ALL and BL cell lines.","['Haematology and Hemotherapy Centre-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo 13083-970, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Hemotherapy Centre-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo 13083-970, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Hemotherapy Centre-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo 13083-970, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Hemotherapy Centre-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo 13083-970, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Hemotherapy Centre-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo 13083-970, Brazil; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Hemotherapy Centre-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo 13083-970, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Hemotherapy Centre-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo 13083-970, Brazil.', 'Haematology and Hemotherapy Centre-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo 13083-970, Brazil; Department of Biological Sciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Diadema, Sao Paulo 09913-030, Brazil.

In this current study, temsirolimus effectively reduced cell growth in GCB and ABC diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma (GCB=30-66%, ABC=45-57%). Combination treatment with the PI3K-delta inhibitor idelalisib additively effected ABC and GCB lymphoma (GCB=16-38%, ABC=25-50%). Since Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) plays a significant role for the survival of ABC lymphoma, this study also combined the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib with temsirolimus, which resulted in additive cell growth reduction (ibrutinib 50%, temsirolimus 44%, combination 25%) in ABC lymphoma. In contrast, bortezomib, which has been shown previously to be efficient in ABC lymphoma, revealed an antagonistic effect with temsirolimus in some GCB lymphoma (temsirolimus 53%, temsirolimus+bortezomib 63%).

The mutation is associated with poor prognosis, and the aberrant protein product has been hypothesized as an attractive therapeutic target. Various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed targeting FLT3, but in spite of initial optimism the first generation TKIs tested in clinical studies generally induce only partial and transient hematological responses. The limited treatment efficacy generally observed may be explained by numerous factors; extensively pretreated and high risk cohorts, suboptimal pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds, acquired TKI resistance, or the possible fact that inhibition of mutated FLT3 alone is not sufficient to avoid disease progression. The second-generation agent quizartinb is showing promising outcomes and seems better tolerated and with less toxic effects than traditional chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, new generations of TKIs might be feasible for use in combination therapy or in a salvage setting in selected patients.

The goal of this study was to explore the association between being born large for gestational age and the risk for ALL by race/ethnicity to determine if the role of this risk factor differed by these characteristics. The authors compared birth certificate data of 575 children diagnosed with ALL who were younger than 5 years and included in the Texas Cancer Registry, Texas Department of Health, between the years 1995 and 2003 with 11,379 controls matched by birth year. Stratified odds ratios were calculated for risk of ALL by birth weight for gestational age, categorized in 3 groups, small, appropriate, and large for gestational age (SGA, AGA, and LGA, respectively), for each race/ethnicity group. The risk of developing ALL was higher among Hispanics who were LGA (odds ratio [OR] = 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34-2.68) compared with LGA non-Hispanic whites (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.87-1.86) after adjusting for infant gender, year of birth, maternal age, birth order, and presence of Down syndrome. However, the difference was not statistically significant. These results suggest that there may be differences in the association between higher growth in utero and risk of childhood ALL among Hispanics versus non-Hispanic whites.","[""a Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine , Texas Children's Cancer Center , Houston , Texas , USA."", 'b Childhood Cancer Prevention and Epidemiology Center , Houston , Texas , USA.', 'd School of Health Sciences , Liverpool Hope University , Liverpool , United Kingdom.', 'c School of Human Ecology , The University of Texas at Austin , Austin , Texas , USA.', ""a Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine , Texas Children's Cancer Center , Houston , Texas , USA."", ""a Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine , Texas Children's Cancer Center , Houston , Texas , USA."", 'b Childhood Cancer Prevention and Epidemiology Center , Houston , Texas , USA.', ""a Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine , Texas Children's Cancer Center , Houston , Texas , USA."", 'b Childhood Cancer Prevention and Epidemiology Center , Houston , Texas , USA.', ""a Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine , Texas Children's Cancer Center , Houston , Texas , USA."", 'b Childhood Cancer Prevention and Epidemiology Center , Houston , Texas , USA.', ""a Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine , Texas Children's Cancer Center , Houston , Texas , USA."", 'b Childhood Cancer Prevention and Epidemiology Center , Houston , Texas , USA.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'cancer control', 'epidemiology']",['10.3109/08880018.2015.1052867 [pii]'],,20150803,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is because signal from these tissues suffers from severe inhomogeneity in the main static B0 field originated from the intrinsic honeycomb structures in trabecular bone. One way to reduce effects of B0 field inhomogeneity is by using the intermolecular double quantum coherence (iDQC) technique, which has been shown in other systems to obtain signals insensitive to B0 field inhomogeneity. In the present study, we employed an iDQC approach to enhance the spectral resolution of RBM. The feasibility and performance of this method for achieving high resolution MRS was verified by experiments on phantoms and pig vertebral bone samples. Unsaturated fatty acid peaks which overlap in the conventional MRS were well resolved and identified in the iDQC spectrum. Quantitative comparison of fractions of three types of fatty acids was performed between iDQC spectra on the in situ RMB and conventional MRS on the extracted fat from the same RBM. Observations of unsaturated fatty acids with iDQC MRS may provide valuable information and may hold potential in diagnosis of diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and leukemia.","[""Department of Electronic Science, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Plasma and Magnetic Resonance, State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Xiamen University, Xiamen, People's Republic of China.""]",['0 (Fatty Acids)'],,,,['10.1088/0031-9155/60/16/6391 [doi]'],10.1088/0031-9155/60/16/6391 [doi],20150803,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Altered DNA methylation is highly prevalent in ALL and raises the possibility that DNA methylation-based biomarkers could predict patient outcome. In this study, genome-wide methylation analysis, using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform, was carried out on 52 diagnostic patient samples from 4 genetic subtypes [ETV6-RUNX1, high hyperdiploidy (HeH), TCF3-PBX1 and dic(9;20)(p11-13;q11)] in a 1:1 case-control design with patients who went on to relapse (as cases) and patients achieving long-term remission (as controls). Pyrosequencing assays for selected loci were used to confirm the array-generated data. Non-negative matrix factorization consensus clustering readily clustered samples according to genetic subgroups and gene enrichment pathway analysis suggested that this is in part driven by epigenetic disruption of subtype specific signaling pathways. Multiple bioinformatics approaches (including bump hunting and individual locus analysis) were used to identify CpG sites or regions associated with outcome. However, no associations with relapse were identified. Our data revealed that ETV6-RUNX1 and dic(9;20) subtypes were mostly associated with hypermethylation; conversely, TCF3-PBX1 and HeH were associated with hypomethylation. We observed significant enrichment of the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway in TCF3-PBX1 as well as an enrichment of genes involved in immunity and infection pathways in ETV6-RUNX1 subtype. Taken together, our results suggest that altered DNA methylation may have differential impacts in distinct ALL genetic subtypes.","['a Northern Institute for Cancer Research; Faculty of Medical Sciences; Newcastle University ; Newcastle upon Tyne , UK.']","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",PMC4622588,['NOTNLM'],"['450K', 'ALL', 'biomarker', 'childhood', 'methylation', 'relapse']",['10.1080/15592294.2015.1061174 [doi]'],10.1080/15592294.2015.1061174 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival rates have increased over the past few decades to ~70%, due to improved supportive care, optimized risk stratification and intensified chemotherapy. In most children, AML presents as a de novo entity, but in a minority, it is a secondary malignancy. The diagnostic classification of pediatric AML includes a combination of morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping and molecular genetics. Outcome is mainly dependent on the initial response to treatment and molecular and cytogenetic aberrations. Treatment consists of a combination of intensive anthracycline- and cytarabine-containing chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation in selected genetic high-risk cases or slow responders. In general, ~30% of all pediatric AML patients will suffer from relapse, whereas 5%-10% of the patients will die due to disease complications or the side-effects of the treatment. Targeted therapy may enhance anti-leukemic efficacy and minimize treatment-related morbidity and mortality, but requires detailed knowledge of the genetic abnormalities and aberrant pathways involved in leukemogenesis. These efforts towards future personalized therapy in a rare disease, such as pediatric AML, require intensive international collaboration in order to enhance the survival rates of pediatric AML, while aiming to reduce long-term toxicity.","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, 3015CN Rotterdam, The Netherlands. j.d.e.derooij@erasmusmc.nl."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, 3015CN Rotterdam, The Netherlands. c.m.zwaan@erasmusmc.nl."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, 3015CN Rotterdam, The Netherlands. m.vandenheuvel@erasmusmc.nl.""]",,PMC4470244,['NOTNLM'],"['clinical management', 'cytogenetics', 'molecular aberrations', 'pediatric AML']","['jcm4010127 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm4010127 [doi]']",10.3390/jcm4010127 [doi],20150109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike gene mutations, epigenetic changes are potentially reversible, which makes them attractive for therapeutic intervention. Agents that affect epigenetics are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, azacitidine and decitabine. Because of their relatively mild side effects, azacitidine and decitabine are particularly feasible for the treatment of older patients and patients with co-morbidities. Both drugs have remarkable activity against AML blasts with unfavorable cytogenetic characteristics. Recent phase 3 trials have shown the superiority of azacitidine and decitabine compared with conventional care for older AML patients (not eligible for intensive treatment). Results of treatment with modifications of the standard azacitidine (seven days 75 mg/m(2) SC; every four weeks) and decitabine (five days 20 mg/m(2) IV; every four weeks) schedules have been reported. Particularly, the results of the 10-day decitabine schedule are promising, revealing complete remission (CR) rates around 45% (CR + CRi (i.e., CR with incomplete blood count recovery) around 64%) almost comparable with intensive chemotherapy. Application of hypomethylating agents to control AML at the cost of minimal toxicity is a very promising strategy to ""bridge"" older patients with co-morbidities to the potential curative treatment of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. In this article, we discuss the role of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in AML.","['Department of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center, PO Box 9191, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands. marjan.cruijsen@radboudumc.nl.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Freiburg Medical Center, D-79106, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Haga Hospital, 2545 CH, The Hague, The Netherlands. p.wijermans@hagaziekenhuis.nl.', 'Department of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center, PO Box 9191, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands. gerwin.huls@radboudumc.nl.']",,PMC4470235,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'azacitidine', 'decitabine', 'elderly', 'epigenetics', 'hypomethylating agents']","['jcm4010001 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm4010001 [doi]']",10.3390/jcm4010001 [doi],20141225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to develop novel targeted therapies, we tested the efficacy of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) inhibitor (TAK-960) in sarcoma. All the sarcoma cell lines were sensitive to TAK-960 with IC50s in the low nanomolar range. We chose MPNST, CHP100 and LS141 for our studies and of which MPNST cells exclusively underwent polyploidy after a delay in mitosis for about 18 hours; CHP100 cells, after a 24h mitotic delay, died of apoptosis; LS141, after a delay in mitosis stayed at 4N with mild apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by TAK-960 in CHP100 was associated with down-regulation of Mcl-1 and the effect was recapitulated by down-regulating PLK1 by siRNA, confirming that the effect of TAK-960 on Mcl-1 expression is target specific. With suppression of Mcl-1 by siRNA, TAK-960 induced apoptosis in MPNST cells as well. These effects were confirmed in vivo, such that TAK-960 more effectively inhibited CHP100 than MPNST xenografts. In the setting of PLK-1 inhibition, Mcl-1 down regulation is shown to be an important determinant of apoptosis. Collectively, the net effect of this is to drive cells to apoptosis, resulting in a greater anti-tumor effect in vivo. Therefore, targeting PLK-1 should have a greater impact in treating sarcomas provided there is concomitant suppression of Mcl-1. These results further indicate that Mcl-1 could be an important biomarker to predict sensitivity to the induction of apoptosis by PLK-1 targeted therapy in sarcoma.","['a Jennifer Goodman Linn Laboratory of New Drug Development; Department of Medicine; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ; New York , NY USA.', 'a Jennifer Goodman Linn Laboratory of New Drug Development; Department of Medicine; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ; New York , NY USA.']","['0', '(4-((9-cyclopentyl-7,7-difluoro-5-methyl-6-oxo-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-pyrimido(4,5', '-b)(1,4)diazepin-2-yl)amino)-2-fluoro-5-methoxy-N-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)benzami', 'de)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)', 'TL2TJE8QTX (4-Aminobenzoic Acid)']",PMC4825583,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'PLK1', 'apoptosis', 'polyploidy', 'sarcoma']",['10.1080/15384101.2015.1078033 [doi]'],10.1080/15384101.2015.1078033 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, it was shown that HLA I expression and KIR receptor-ligand mismatch significantly impact ALL cytolysis. We characterized 14 different primary childhood AML blasts by flow cytometry including NKG2D ligands. Further HLA I typing of blasts was performed and HLA I on the AML blasts was quantified. In two healthy volunteer NK cell donors HLA I typing and KIR genotyping were done. Blasts with high NKG2D ligand expression had significantly higher lysis by isolated NK cells. Grouping the blasts by NKG2D ligand expression led to a significant inverse correlation of HLA I expression and cytolysis in NKG2D low blasts. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation of NKG2D ligand expression and blast cytolysis was shown. No impact of KIR ligand-ligand mismatch was found but a significantly increased lysis of homozygous C2 blasts by KIR2DL1 negative NK cells (donor B) was revealed. In conclusion, NKG2D signaling leads to NK cell mediated lysis of childhood AML despite high HLA I expression.","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen, University of Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Strasse 1, 72076 Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen, University of Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Strasse 1, 72076 Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen, University of Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Strasse 1, 72076 Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen, University of Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Strasse 1, 72076 Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen, University of Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Strasse 1, 72076 Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen, University of Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Strasse 1, 72076 Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen, University of Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Strasse 1, 72076 Tubingen, Germany.""]","['0 (HLA-E antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)']",PMC4510257,,,['10.1155/2015/473175 [doi]'],10.1155/2015/473175 [doi],20150708,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 6.,"Cancer is characterized by a remarkable intertumoral, intratumoral, and cellular heterogeneity that might be explained by the cancer stem cell (CSC) and/or the clonal evolution models. CSCs have the ability to generate all different cells of a tumor and to reinitiate the disease after remission. In the clonal evolution model, a consecutive accumulation of mutations starting in a single cell results in competitive growth of subclones with divergent fitness in either a linear or a branching succession. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a highly malignant cancer of the lymphoid system in the bone marrow with a dismal prognosis after relapse. However, stabile phenotypes and functional data of CSCs in ALL, the so-called leukemia-initiating cells (LICs), are highly controversial and the question remains whether there is evidence for their existence. This review discusses the concepts of CSCs and clonal evolution in respect to LICs mainly in B-ALL and sheds light onto the technical controversies in LIC isolation and evaluation. These aspects are important for the development of strategies to eradicate cells with LIC capacity. Common properties of LICs within different subclones need to be defined for future ALL diagnostics, treatment, and disease monitoring to improve the patients' outcome in ALL.","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany ; LOEWE Center for Cell and Gene Therapy Frankfurt, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany ; LOEWE Center for Cell and Gene Therapy Frankfurt, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany ; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany ; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",,PMC4506911,,,['10.1155/2015/137164 [doi]'],10.1155/2015/137164 [doi],20150706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of TRB1 in the immune response is not understood. To evaluate this role, we examined regulation of TRB1 expression and the function of TRB1 in interleukin-2 (IL-2) induction in Jurkat cells, a human acute T cell leukemia cell line. We found that TRB1 was strongly induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin in these cells. IL-2 expression was induced in Jurkat cells activated by PMA and ionomycin; however, knockdown of TRB1 resulted in decreased induction of IL-2. TRB1 null Jurkat cells established using the CRISPR/Cas9 system also showed reduction of IL-2 expression on PMA/ionomycin stimulation. TRB1 knockdown also markedly inhibited IL-2 promoter activation. To determine the mechanism of the stimulatory effect on IL-2 induction, we focused on histone deacetylases (HDACs), and found that HDAC1 preferentially interacts with TRB1. TRB1 suppressed the interaction of HDAC1 with nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFAT2), which is a crucial transcription factor for IL-2 induction. These results indicate that TRB1 is a positive regulator of IL-2 induction in activated T cells.","['Department of Cell Signaling, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University.']","['0 (Calcium Ionophores)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (NFATC1 protein, human)', '0 (TRIB1 protein, human)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,['10.1248/bpb.b15-00002 [doi]'],10.1248/bpb.b15-00002 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we evaluated the in vivo effect of DAS, NIL, and IM on intracellular calcium concentration, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in peripheral blood leukocytes of 45 newly diagnosed patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML-PBM). Our data demonstrated that treatment with DAS and NIL showed an higher modulating potential than IM on intracellular calcium concentration by inhibiting the thapsigargin, a sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor, and Lithium (Li) an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) receptor inhibitor activities. Moreover our data demonstrated that NIL and DAS have significantly increased apoptosis more than IM by involving both intracellular calcium signaling as well as oxidative stress. The acquisition of the oxidative stress and calcium channels receptors values data could help the hematologist to modulate and improve the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) pathology.","['Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Productions, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Productions, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Productions, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Productions, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Productions, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Naples, Italy.', 'Clinical Trials Unit, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Fondazione G.

We aimed to (i) prospectively evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during and after SR-ALL therapy, and (ii) identify associated predictors. Parents of 160 SR-ALL patients enrolled on Children's Oncology Group (COG) therapeutic trial AALL0331 at 31 sites completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scales (physical, emotional and social functioning) and Family Assessment Device-General Functioning (FAD-GF) at 1, 6 and 12 months after diagnosis, and 3 months post-therapy. Mean PedsQL scores in physical, emotional and social functioning were impaired 1 month after diagnosis but steadily improved. Three months post-therapy, impaired physical and social functioning was observed in 27.8 and 25.8% of patients, respectively. In repeated-measures analysis, problematic family functioning predicted emotional (OR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.03-3.34) and social (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.21-3.27) impairment. Larger household size was associated with social impairment (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.45). Adverse neurological event(s) during therapy predicted post-therapy physical (OR = 5.17, 95% CI 1.61-16.63) and social (OR = 8.17, 95% CI 1.19-56.16) impairment. HRQOL 1 month after diagnosis was not predictive of HRQOL 3 months after therapy completion. In conclusion, children with SR-ALL experience considerable impairment in HRQOL at the end of induction, but rapidly improve. However, many still experience physical and social impairment 3 months post-therapy, suggesting a role for continued family and physical functioning support. Longer follow-up is needed to determine if post-therapy deficits change over time.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health and Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainsville, FL.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Institute, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health and Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainsville, FL.', ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), Philadelphia, PA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.']",,PMC5138856,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'childhood leukemia', 'late effects', 'physical functioning', 'quality of life']",['10.1002/ijc.29708 [doi]'],10.1002/ijc.29708 [doi],20150903,"['U10 CA180834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CCOP U10 CA95861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA095861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 RR024138/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001427/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS712892'],['(c) 2015 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 31.,"The prognostic relevance of epigenetic modifying genes (DNMT3A, TET2, and IDH1/2) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been investigated extensively. However, the prognostic implications of these mutations after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have not been evaluated comprehensively in patients with normal-karyotype (NK)-AML. A total of 115 patients who received allogeneic HCT for NK-AML were retrospectively evaluated for the FLT3-ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2, WT1, NRAS, ASXL2, FAT1, DNAH11, and GATA2 mutations in diagnostic samples and analyzed for long-term outcomes after allogeneic HCT. The prevalence rates for the mutations were as follows: FLT3-ITD positivity (FLT3-ITD(pos)) (32.2%), NPM1 mutation (43.5%), CEBPA mutation (double) (24.6%), DNMT3A mutation (DNMT3A(mut)) (31.3%), DNMT3A R882(mut) (18.3%), TET2 mutation (8.7%), and IDH1/2 mutation (16.5%). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were 57.3% and 58.1%, respectively. A multivariate analysis revealed that FLT3-ITD(pos) (hazard ratio, [HR], 2.23; P = .006) and DNMT3A R882(mut) (HR, 2.74; P = .002) were unfavorable prognostic factors for OS. In addition, both mutations were significant risk factors for EFS and relapse. People with DNMT3A R882(mut) accompanied by FLT3-ITD(pos) had worse OS and EFS, and higher relapse rates than those with the other mutations, which were confirmed in a propensity score 1:2 matching analysis. These results suggest that DNMT3A R882(mut), particularly when accompanied by FLT3-ITD(pos), is a significant prognostic factor for inferior transplantation survival outcome by increasing relapse risk, even after allogeneic HCT.","['Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Jeollanam-do, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Jeollanam-do, Korea.

Epub 2015 Jul 31.,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic natural killer (NK) cell lymphocytosis is currently a provisional entity. This study demonstrated NK cell lymphocytosis in patients with asymptomatic lymphocytosis and presented the hematological and phenotypic findings. METHODS: Flow cytometry analysis was performed for investigation of unexplained peripheral lymphocytosis. NK cells were determined by the phenotype of CD3-/CD16+/CD56+. Chronic NK cell lymphocytosis was defined by a NK cell count of >/= 2 x 10(9)/L, persistent for over 6 months, no evidence of B- or T-cell clonality and no hematologic disorders. RESULTS: Among 190 patients with peripheral lymphocytosis, 15(7.9%) patients, age 42-72 years, were identified to have NK cell lymphocytosis, with a median NK cell count of 3.1 x 10(9)/L (range 2.1-7.3 x 10(9)/L). Persistent NK cell lymphocytosis was confirmed with a median follow-up of 18 months. CD56(bright) NK cell populations were seen in eight patients and CD56(dim) NK cells in seven patients. CD57 co-expression was seen in both CD56(dim) and CD56(bright) cells. CD7, CD2, or CD8 expression was seen in some of the NK populations. The NK cell lymphocytosis appeared stable and no progression to NK cell leukemia during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that chronic NK cell lymphocytosis, similar to monoclonal B lymphocytosis or T-cell clones, may account for asymptomatic lymphocytosis. There were no identifiable causes of the NK cell expansion. The variable phenotype may represent the heterogeneity and pathological features of NK lymphocytosis.","['Alkali Soil Natural Environmental Science Center, Northeast Forestry University, Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration, Ministry of Education, Harbin, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Alkali Soil Natural Environmental Science Center, Northeast Forestry University, Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration, Ministry of Education, Harbin, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CD56', 'CD57', 'Natural killer cells', 'aberrant phenotype', 'lymphocytosis']",['10.1111/ijlh.12410 [doi]'],10.1111/ijlh.12410 [doi],20150731,,,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 30.,"BACKGROUND: Safe and effective treatments are urgently needed for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. We investigated the efficacy and safety of vosaroxin, a first-in-class anticancer quinolone derivative, plus cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: This phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken at 101 international sites. Eligible patients with acute myeloid leukaemia were aged 18 years of age or older and had refractory disease or were in first relapse after one or two cycles of previous induction chemotherapy, including at least one cycle of anthracycline (or anthracenedione) plus cytarabine. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to vosaroxin (90 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 4 in a first cycle; 70 mg/m(2) in subsequent cycles) plus cytarabine (1 g/m(2) intravenously on days 1-5) or placebo plus cytarabine through a central interactive voice system with a permuted block procedure stratified by disease status, age, and geographical location. All participants were masked to treatment assignment. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival and the primary safety endpoint was 30-day and 60-day all-cause mortality. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat; safety analyses included all treated patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01191801. FINDINGS: Between Dec 17, 2010, and Sept 25, 2013, 711 patients were randomly assigned to vosaroxin plus cytarabine (n=356) or placebo plus cytarabine (n=355). At the final analysis, median overall survival was 7.5 months (95% CI 6.4-8.5) in the vosaroxin plus cytarabine group and 6.1 months (5.2-7.1) in the placebo plus cytarabine group (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.73-1.02; unstratified log-rank p=0.061; stratified p=0.024). A higher proportion of patients achieved complete remission in the vosaroxin plus cytarabine group than in the placebo plus cytarabine group (107 [30%] of 356 patients vs 58 [16%] of 355 patients, p<0.0001). Early mortality was similar between treatment groups (30-day: 28 [8%] of 355 patients in the vosaroxin plus cytarabine group vs 23 [7%] of 350 in the placebo plus cytarabine group; 60-day: 70 [20%] vs 68 [19%]). Treatment-related deaths occurred at any time in 20 (6%) of 355 patients given vosaroxin plus cytarabine and in eight (2%) of 350 patients given placebo plus cytarabine. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 116 (33%) and 58 (17%) patients in each group, respectively. Grade 3 or worse adverse events that were more frequent in the vosaroxin plus cytarabine group than in the placebo plus cytarabine group included febrile neutropenia (167 [47%] vs 117 [33%]), neutropenia (66 [19%] vs 49 [14%]), stomatitis (54 [15%] vs 10 [3%]), hypokalaemia (52 [15%] vs 21 [6%]), bacteraemia (43 [12%] vs 16 [5%]), sepsis (42 [12%] vs 18 [5%]), and pneumonia (39 [11%] vs 26 [7%]). INTERPRETATION: Although there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between groups, the prespecified secondary analysis stratified by randomisation factors suggests that the addition of vosaroxin to cytarabine might be of clinical benefit to some patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia.

Epub 2015 Jul 30.,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Although Down syndrome (DS) patients have a higher risk of developing transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) and acute leukemia, very little data is available on long-term outcome in Taiwanese patients. The current study was designed to determine the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of DS patients with TMD or acute leukemia (AL). METHODS: In 25 consecutive DS patients with TMD or AL enrolled from 1990 to 2012, clinical manifestations and treatment protocols were investigated and GATA1 (GATA binding protein 1) mutations were identified. Among 16 DS-acute myeloid leukemia (DS-AML) patients, clinical outcomes were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. RESULTS: Most of our DS patients had TMD (32%), acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (24%), or acute erythromegakaryoblastic leukemia (16%). The median follow-up time was 22.5 months (1-230 months). The age was younger and the hemoglobin (Hb) level and platelet count were higher in TMD patients than in leukemia patients. Among DS-AML patients, the Hb level was higher in survivors than nonsurvivors (8.8 +/- 2.7 g/dL vs. 5.8 +/- 2.4 g/dL; p = 0.044) and the age was older in relapsed patients than in nonrelapsed patients (43.8 +/- 18 months old vs. 21.6 +/- 8.6 months old; p = 0.025). The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 44%, higher in patients receiving appropriate chemotherapy than in those receiving inadequate treatment (63.6% vs. 0%, p = 0.001), and higher in those diagnosed with TMD or AL after 2008 than before 2008 (33.3% vs. 75%; p = 0.119). CONCLUSION: Outcome in DS-AML patients is optimal if appropriate treatment is provided. With modification of the treatment strategy in 2008, OS increased in Taiwan.","['Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Medical Genetics, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Medical Genetics, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Medical Genetics, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

The structures of eighteen title compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, 1H NMR and MS, and the in vitro anti-proliferative activity against human hepatoma Hep-3B cells, pancreatic Capan-1 cells and leukemia HL60 cells was evaluated by a MTT assay. The preliminary results showed that the title compounds not only had more significant anti-proliferative activity against three tested cancer cell lines than that of the parent ciprofloxacin 1, but also exhibited the highest activity against Capan-1 cells.

Epub 2015 May 27.,"Vitamin A (retinol) and its active metabolite, all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), play critical roles in regulating the differentiation, growth, and migration of immune cells. Similarly, as critical signaling molecules in the regulation of the cell cycle, retinoids are important in cancers. Concentrations of atRA are tightly regulated in tissues, predominantly by the availability of retinol, synthesis of atRA by ALDH1A enzymes and metabolism and clearance of atRA by CYP26 enzymes. The ALDH1A and CYP26 enzymes are expressed in several cell types in the immune system and in cancer cells. In the immune system, the ALDH1A and CYP26 enzymes appear to modulate RA concentrations. Consequently, alterations in the activity of ALDH1A and CYP26 enzymes are expected to change disease outcomes in inflammation. There is increasing evidence from various disease models of intestinal and skin inflammation that treatment with atRA has a positive effect on disease markers. However, whether aberrant atRA concentrations or atRA synthesis and metabolism play a role in inflammatory disease development and progression is not well understood. In cancers, especially in acute promyelocytic leukemia and neuroblastoma, increasing intracellular concentrations of atRA appears to provide clinical benefit. Inhibition of the CYP26 enzymes to increase atRA concentrations and combat therapy resistance has been pursued as a drug target in these cancers. This chapter covers the current knowledge of how atRA and retinol regulate the immune system and inflammation, how retinol and atRA metabolism is altered in inflammation and cancer, and what roles atRA-metabolizing enzymes have in immune responses and cancers.","['Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Taking advantage of a population of 608 patients, we identified the strongest prognostic markers of survival and, subsequently, in a cohort of 212 patients we integrated data of cytogenetic lesions, IGHV mutational status, and CD38 expression in a new and easy scoring system we called the integrated CLL scoring system (ICSS). ICSS defines 3 groups of risk: (1) low risk (patients with 13q(-) or normal fluorescence in-situ hybridization analysis results, mutated IGHV, and CD38) (2) high risk (all 11q(-) or 17p(-) patients and/or all unmutated IGHV and CD38(+) patients); and (3) intermediate risk (all remaining patients). RESULTS: Using only these 3 already available prognostic factors, we were able to properly redefine patients and better predict the clinical course of the disease. CONCLUSION: ICSS could become a useful tool for CLL patients' management.","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Avanzata, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Avanzata, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Avanzata, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Avanzata, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Avanzata, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Avanzata, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Avanzata, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Avanzata, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Avanzata, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, IOV-IRCSS, Padua, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, IOV-IRCSS, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Avanzata, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Avanzata, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Avanzata, Italy.

Epub 2015 Aug 2.,"The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib has shown a strong anti-leukemic effect in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, remission is often transient. To better understand the role of sorafenib, we performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who received sorafenib in combination with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at our center. Seventeen patients with FLT3-ITD positive AML were treated with sorafenib in combination with allogeneic HSCT. Seven patients received sorafenib therapy pre- and posttransplant, and 10 patients were given sorafenib only posttransplant. Median duration of sorafenib treatment was 13 months (range 1-42); median dose was 600 mg (range 100-1200). Fourteen patients (82 %) achieved a complete remission (CR), while 5 patients (29 %) eventually developed progressive disease. Developing chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) had a strong protective influence on the risk of sorafenib resistance (p = 0.028, HR 0.08, 95 % CI 0.01-0.76). In a total of 8 patients, sorafenib had to be stopped, paused or dose-reduced due to toxicity. In 5 patients with pronounced toxicity, we switched to an alternating dosing schedule with 1 month on/1 month off sorafenib. These patients subsequently remained in sustained complete molecular remission, with a median follow-up of 20 months. Our data indicate that sorafenib can achieve high rates of sustained remission in high-risk patients treated in combination with HSCT.","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Petersgraben 4, 4031, Basel, Switzerland. astrid.plessl@usb.ch.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Petersgraben 4, 4031, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Petersgraben 4, 4031, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Petersgraben 4, 4031, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Petersgraben 4, 4031, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Petersgraben 4, 4031, Basel, Switzerland.']","['0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic', 'Sorafenib', 'Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor', 'flt3']","['10.1007/s00277-015-2461-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-015-2461-5 [pii]']",10.1007/s00277-015-2461-5 [doi],20150802,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: An Excel-based model was created to project the cost of treating a simulated cohort of severely neutropenic AML patients undergoing antifungal prophylaxis. The model compares (i) standard prophylactic dosing with voriconazole and (ii) CYP2C19 genotyping of all AML patients to guide voriconazole dosing and prescribing. RESULTS: Based on the model, genotype-guided dosing of voriconazole conservatively spares 2.3 patients per year from invasive fungal infections. Implementing proactive genotyping of all AML patients in a simulated 100 patient cohort is expected to save a total of $41467 or $415 per patient. CONCLUSIONS: The model, based on the robust literature of clinical and economic data, predicts that proactive genotype-guided voriconazole prophylaxis is likely to yield modest cost savings while improving patient outcomes. The primary driver of savings is the avoidance of expensive antifungal treatment and extended hospital stays, costing $30 952 per patient, in patients succumbing to fungal infection.","['H.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), shedding from various cells, express antigens, reflecting their cellular origin. The current study was designed to explore the role of circulating EVs as potential biomarkers of AML activity and predictors of thrombogenicity in patients with this malignancy. Blood samples were collected from healthy controls and patients with newly diagnosed AML at three time points: diagnosis, nadir, and remission. EV concentration, cell origin, and expression of coagulation proteins were characterized using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. EV cytokine contents were evaluated by protein array. Procoagulant activity was assessed using Factor Xa chromogenic assay. Forty-two AML patients were enrolled in the study. Total EV numbers were higher in patients in first remission compared with controls, whereas blast EV counts were higher in patients at diagnosis compared with controls and patients in remission. Blast EV levels were significantly lower in patients who achieved remission and were alive at 3-year follow up compared with their succumbed counterparts. At all three time points, percentage of endothelial EVs was higher in patients compared with controls. EV procoagulant activity was elevated at diagnosis and in remission, and, unlike controls' EVs, patients' EVs increased endothelial cell thrombogenicity. EVs of AML patients express membrane proteins of blast cells and might serve as biomarkers of leukemia dynamics and presence of minimal residual disease. Increased levels of endothelial EVs and their procoagulant activity may indicate a vascular injury associated with a hypercoagulable state in AML.","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel; Internal Medicine C, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel; Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.

Epub 2015 Jul 30.,"Curcumin exhibits anti-cancer properties manifested by activation of pro-apoptotic signaling. We have demonstrated earlier that apoptosis of HL-60 human leukemia cells induced by curcumin is controlled by ceramide generated by neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) which contributes to sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) inhibition favoring accumulation of ceramide in cells. Here we report that the activity of nSMase, ceramide accumulation and death of HL-60 cells are inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 proteins, while down-regulation of nSMase interferes with degradation of Bcl-2 but not Bcl-xL. Activation of nSMase in curcumin-treated cells requires the activity of apoptosis initiator caspase-8 and executioner caspase-3, whereas nSMase depletion prevents activation of caspase-3, but not caspase-8. These data place nSMase activation downstream of caspase-8 and Bcl-xL and indicate a mutual regulation between nSMase and caspase-3 activity on one hand, and Bcl-2 level on the other hand in curcumin-treated cells. The activation of nSMase and ceramide accumulation also depended on the depletion of glutathione. The depletion of glutathione required the activity of caspase-8 and caspase-3 as well as the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Together, the data indicate a crosstalk among Bcl-2, Bc-xL, caspases and glutathione during curcumin-induced apoptosis and point to the superior role of caspase-8 activity, Bcl-xL down-regulation and glutathione depletion in the pro-apoptotic cascade leading to nSMase activation and generation of ceramide.","['Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Assiut University, Assiut 71516, Egypt; Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia.

Renal involvement in PMF is rare, but kidney tissue samples from these patients reveal MPN-related glomerulopathy, a recently discovered condition, in the late stages of the disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the first case described in the medical literature of a patient with early renal glomerular involvement in PMF/MPN. A 60-year-old man with stage 4 chronic kidney disease and a recent diagnosis of PMF (within 4 weeks of presentation at our renal division) presented with generalized body swelling, acute kidney injury, and massive nephrotic-range proteinuria. Kidney biopsy was performed to determine the etiology of the patient's renal dysfunction and revealed early renal glomerular involvement that was histologically characteristic of MPN-related glomerulopathy. Early diagnosis and prompt medical management returned the patient's kidney functionality to the levels seen on initial presentation at our hospital. CONCLUSION: Large studies with long follow-up durations are necessary to identify and categorize the risk factors for the development of MPN-related glomerulopathy, to standardize therapeutic regimens, and to determine whether aggressive management of the myelofibrosis slows the progression of kidney disease.","['Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. arun.nephron@gmail.com.', 'Department of Nephrology, The University of Texas Medical School at Houston, Houston, TX, USA. ntrang03@yahoo.com.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA. maen.abdelrahim@dm.duke.edu.', 'Department of Renal Pathology, The University of Texas Medical School at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.

There is the potential to compromise efficacy when chemotherapy dosages are reduced, but the impact of dose adjustment on clinical response and toxicity in hematologic malignancies is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of utilizing a percent of ABW for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induction chemotherapy dosing. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study included 146 patients who received 7 + 3 induction (cytarabine and anthracycline) for treatment of AML. Study design evaluated the relationship between percentage of ABW dosing and complete response (CR) rates in patients newly diagnosed with AML. RESULTS: Percentage of ABW dosing did not influence CR rates in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for AML (p = 0.83); nor did it influence rate of death at 30 days or relapse at 6 months (p = 0.94). When comparing patients dosed at 90-100 % of ABW compared to <90 % ABW, CR rates were not significantly different in patients classified as poor risk (p = 0.907). All favorable risk category patients obtained CR. CONCLUSIONS: Preemptive dose reductions for obesity did not influence CR rates for patients with AML undergoing induction chemotherapy and did not influence the composite endpoint of death at 30 days or disease relapse at 6 months.","['Department of Pharmacy, The University of Kansas Hospital Cancer Center Pharmacy, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Mail Stop 5022, Westwood, KS, 66205, USA. wbray@kumc.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Kansas School of Pharmacy, The University of Kansas Hospital Cancer Center Pharmacy, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Mail Stop 5022, Westwood, KS, 66205, USA. cbivona@kumc.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Kansas School of Pharmacy, The University of Kansas Hospital Cancer Center Pharmacy, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Mail Stop 5022, Westwood, KS, 66205, USA. mrockey@kumc.edu.', 'University of Kansas School of Pharmacy, The University of Kansas Hospital, 3901 Rainbow Blvd, Mail Stop 4047, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA. dhenry@kumc.edu.', 'University of Kansas School of Pharmacy, The University of Kansas Hospital, 3901 Rainbow Blvd, Mail Stop 4047, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA. dgrauer@kumc.edu.', 'University of Kansas School of Medicine, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Mail Stop 5003, Westwood, KS, 66205, USA. sabhyankar@kumc.edu.', 'University of Kansas School of Medicine, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Mail Stop 5003, Westwood, KS, 66205, USA. oaljitawi@kumc.edu.', 'University of Kansas School of Medicine, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Mail Stop 5003, Westwood, KS, 66205, USA. sganguly@kumc.edu.', 'University of Kansas School of Medicine, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Mail Stop 5003, Westwood, KS, 66205, USA. jmcguirk@kumc.edu.', 'University of Kansas School of Medicine, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Mail Stop 5003, Westwood, KS, 66205, USA. asingh3@kumc.edu.', 'University of Kansas School of Medicine, The University of Kansas Cancer Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Mail Stop 5003, Westwood, KS, 66205, USA. tlin@kumc.edu.']","['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",PMC4725583,['NOTNLM'],"['Actual body weight', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Adjusted body weight', 'Induction chemotherapy', 'Obesity']","['10.1007/s00280-015-2829-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-015-2829-1 [pii]']",10.1007/s00280-015-2829-1 [doi],20150801,"['K23 CA158146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23CA158146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS742839'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 3.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effects of Schisandrae semen essential oil (SSeo) on apoptosis events and the mechanisms associated with these effects in human leukemia U937 cells. The treatment of U937 cells with SSeo significantly inhibited survival and induced apoptosis. Schisandrae semen essential oil treatment increased the levels of death receptors and Fas, and activated caspases accompanied by proteolytic degradation of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase, which was associated with the downregulation of members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family protein expression; however, a pan-caspase inhibitor reversed SSeo-induced apoptosis. Treating the cells with SSeo also caused truncation of Bid, translocation of proapoptotic Bax to the mitochondria, and loss of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, thereby inducing the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Subsequently, SSeo upregulated the translocation of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors, such as endonuclease G and apoptosis-inducing factor, into the nucleus during the apoptotic process. Notably, SSeo immediately increased the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine, a common ROS quencher, almost completely blocked SSeo-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these findings indicate that SSeo caused ROS- and caspase-dependent cell death involving mitochondrial dysfunction and nuclear translocation of mitochondrial proapoptosis proteins.

Such studies have provided additional evidence regarding the risks of cancer, particularly leukemia, associated with lower-dose radiation exposures from medical, environmental, and occupational radiation sources, and have questioned the previous findings with regard to possible thresholds for cardiovascular disease and cataracts. Integrated analysis of next generation genomic and epigenetic sequencing of germline and somatic tissues could soon propel our understanding further regarding disease risk thresholds, radiosensitivity of population subgroups and individuals, and the mechanisms of radiation carcinogenesis.

To our knowledge, this is the first report describing viremia due to HPIV-1. After administering mogamulizumab, lymphocyte count in the blood was drastically decreased and the patient suffered from complicated infections including gram-negative bacterial sepsis, cytomegalovirus antigenemia and aspergillosis. Although these infections were successfully controlled by broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy, patchy ground-grass opacities in the both lungs were gradually worsened. He finally died due to acute respiratory failure. Since findings of the chest CT was consistent with typical patterns of viral pneumonia, we screened major respiratory viruses in the peripheral blood with multiplex PCR, and it turned out that RNA of HPIV-1 was positive. Although ATL cells were not detected in the autopsied lungs and a variety of other tissues, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, which are commonly observed in RNA viral infection, were abundantly observed in the autopsied lung tissue. These findings suggest that mogamulizumab accomplished complete remission of ATL, while the chemotherapy-induced prolonged lymphopenia caused fatal pneumonia and viremia due to HPIV-1. As it has been well recognized that community respiratory viruses including HPIV-1 often cause fatal pneumonia in patients with leukemia, but also there is no specific treatment for HPIV-1, we have to enforce standard precautions especially when we treat leukemic patients with intensively immunosuppressive agents such as mogamulizumab.","['Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Respiratory and Digestive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan; Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Ryukyu University Hospital, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan; Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Ryukyu University Hospital, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Heartlife Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Respiratory and Digestive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunohematology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Japan.

Identification of prognostic factors for these patients, especially for patients with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), remains a challenge. This is largely due to the relative rarity of the disease and lack of adequate samples for biological research. T-LBL is more common in Asia than in Western countries. In an attempt to explore novel prognostic markers for T-LBL, we conducted retrospective study of archived diagnostic specimens from 57 Chinese patients with well-defined diagnosis of T-LBL. Using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR, we analyzed miR-17 and miR-19 expression levels in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph node specimens from these patients, together with reactive lymph node controls. We correlated molecular findings to patients' immunophenotype and clinical follow-up information. MYC protein expression was also evaluated in these patients. We found that miR-17 and miR-19 levels were concordant and upregulated in T-LBL in comparison with controls. Statistical analysis showed that higher expression of miR-17 and miR-19, and positive MYC protein results were associated with a shorter overall survival of T-LBL. In addition, miR-17 and miR-19 appeared to be independent prognostic factors for T-LBL. We demonstrate here that upregulation of miR-17 and miR-19 correlates with poor clinical outcome of T-LBL, indicating that miR-17 and miR-19 may be considered as potential unfavorable prognostic markers for T-LBL.","['Department of Pathology, Shanxi Cancer Hospital and Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030013, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanxi Cancer Hospital and Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030013, China.', 'Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, 030013, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanxi Cancer Hospital and Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030013, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanxi Cancer Hospital and Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030013, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Shanxi Cancer Hospital and Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030013, China.

The insolubility of this compound, however, has precluded the use of many classical drug-target interaction assays for its study. Thus, a direct demonstration of the proposed mechanism of action, and preferences for individual Bcl-2 family members, remain to be established. METHODS: Employing modified proteins and lipids, we recapitulated the constitutive association and topology of mitochondrial outer membrane Mcl-1 and Bak in synthetic large unilamellar liposomes, and measured bakdependent bilayer permeability. Additionally, cellular and tumor models, dependent on Mcl-1 for survival, were employed. RESULTS: We show that regulation of bilayer permeabilization by the tBid - Mcl-1 - Bak axis closely resemblesthe tBid - Bcl-XL - Bax model. Obatoclax rapidly and completely partitioned into liposomal lipid but also rapidly exchanged between liposome particles. In this system, obatoclax was found to be a direct and potent antagonist of liposome-bound Mcl-1 but not of liposome-bound Bcl-XL, and did not directly influence Bak. A 2.5 molar excess of obatoclax relative to Mcl-1 overcame Mcl-1-mediated inhibition of tBid-Bak activation. Similar results were found for induction of Bak oligomers by Bim. Obatoclax exhibited potent lethality in a cellmodel dependent on Mcl-1 for viability but not in cells dependent on Bcl-XL. Molecular modeling predicts that the 3-methoxy moiety of obatoclax penetrates into the P2 pocket of the BH3 binding site of Mcl-1. A desmethoxy derivative of obatoclax failed to inhibit Mcl-1 in proteoliposomes and did not kill cells whose survival depends on Mcl-1. Systemic treatment of mice bearing Tsc2(+) (/) (-) Em-myc lymphomas (whose cells depend on Mcl-1 for survival) with obatoclax conferred a survival advantage compared to vehicle alone (median 31 days vs 22 days, respectively; p=0.003). In an Akt-lymphoma mouse model, the anti-tumor effects of obatoclax synergized with doxorubicin. Finally, treatment of the multiple myeloma KMS11 cell model (dependent on Mcl-1 for survival) with dexamethasone induced Bim and Bim-dependent lethality. As predicted for an Mcl-1 antagonist, obatoclax and dexamethasone were synergistic in this model. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings indicate that obatoclax is a potent antagonist of membranerestricted Mcl-1. Obatoclax represents an attractive chemical series to generate second generation Mcl-1 inhibitors.","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. mai.nguyen@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. regina.cencic@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. franziska.ertel@gmx.de.', 'Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. cynthia.bernier@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. jerry.pelletier@mcgill.ca.', 'Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. jerry.pelletier@mcgill.ca.', 'Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. anne.roulston@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. john.silvius@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. gordon.shore@mcgill.ca.', 'Goodman Cancer Research Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. gordon.shore@mcgill.ca.']","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",PMC4522062,,,"['10.1186/s12885-015-1582-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-015-1582-5 [pii]']",10.1186/s12885-015-1582-5 [doi],20150801,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically relevant, low concentrations of doxorubicin synergize in vitro and in vivo with DCA to further enhance p53 activation and to block tumor progression. Leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic cells containing mutant p53 are resistant to the above-described combination approach. However, DCA synergized with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG to specifically eliminate these cells.

However, while CAR T-cells have shown complete responses in a majority of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphomas are more difficult to treat. Different CAR designs and conditioning protocols seem to affect the persistence of patient responses. However, factors that determine if patients receiving the same CARs will respond or not remain obscure. In Sweden, a phase I/IIa trial using third-generation CAR T-cells is ongoing in which we intend to compare tumor biology and immunology, in each patient, to treatment response. CAR T-cell therapy is a powerful tool to add to the treatment options for this patient group but we need to perform the necessary basic research on the multifactorial mechanisms of action to give patients the best possible option of survival. Such studies are also crucial to expand the success of CAR T-cells beyond CD19+ B-cell malignancy.

Although existing data for baseline characteristics and CMML prognostication have been robustly developed and externally validated, these results have been limited by the small size of single-institution cohorts. We developed an international CMML data set that included 1832 cases across eight centers to establish the frequency of key clinical characteristics. Of note, we found that the majority of CMML patients were classified as World Health Organization CMML-1 and that a 7.5% bone marrow blast cut-point may discriminate prognosis with higher resolution in comparison with the existing 10%. We additionally interrogated existing CMML prognostic models and found that they are all valid and have comparable performance but are vulnerable to upstaging. Using random forest survival analysis for variable discovery, we demonstrated that the prognostic power of clinical variables alone is limited. Last, we confirmed the independent prognostic relevance of ASXL1 gene mutations and identified the novel adverse prognostic impact imparted by CBL mutations. Our data suggest that combinations of clinical and molecular information may be required to improve the accuracy of current CMML prognostication.","['Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Avicenne, Bobigny, France."", 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Service d'Hematologie Seniors, Hopital St Louis, Universite Paris 7, Paris, France."", 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, UK.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', ""Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Gustave Roussy, INSERM U1170, Villejuif, France.']",,PMC4526779,,,"['bcj201553 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2015.53 [doi]']",10.1038/bcj.2015.53 [doi],20150731,"['K08 CA188529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TP53 mutations were closely associated with older age, lower white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, FAB M6 subtype, unfavorable-risk cytogenetics and CK, but negatively associated with NPM1 mutation, FLT3/ITD and DNMT3A mutation. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that TP53 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival among the total cohort and the subgroup of patients with CK. A scoring system incorporating TP53 mutation and nine other prognostic factors, including age, WBC counts, cytogenetics and gene mutations, into survival analysis proved to be very useful to stratify AML patients. Sequential study of 420 samples showed that TP53 mutations were stable during AML evolution, whereas the mutation was acquired only in 1 of the 126 TP53 wild-type patients when therapy-related AML originated from different clone emerged.

T cells are pivotal in eradicating leukemia through a graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect and leukemia relapse is considered a failure of GVL. T-cell exhaustion is a state of T-cell dysfunction mediated by inhibitory molecules including programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3). To evaluate whether T-cell exhaustion and inhibitory pathways are involved in leukemia relapse post alloSCT, we performed phenotypic and functional studies on T cells from peripheral blood of acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving alloSCT. Here we report that PD-1(hi)TIM-3(+) cells are strongly associated with leukemia relapse post transplantation. Consistent with exhaustion, PD-1(hi)TIM-3(+) T cells are functionally deficient manifested by reduced production of interleukin 2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).

However, distinguishing LPL from MZL and from atypical cases of CLL can sometimes be difficult because of overlapping features. Recent studies have identified a recurrent L265P mutation in the MYD88 gene in most cases of LPL. Although this represents a promising diagnostic marker for LPL, the mutation is also reported in rare cases of MZL and CLL (as well as other types of B-cell lymphoma). Detection rates for this mutation have varied depending on the analytic methodology. OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic utility of MYD88 L265P mutation in diagnosing low-grade B-cell lymphomas. DESIGN: We developed a novel pyrosequencing assay for the MYD88 L265P mutation and assessed its diagnostic utility in 317 cases of low-grade B-cell lymphoma (45 LPL [14%], 53 MZL [17%], and 219 CLL [69%]). We incorporated formal clinical and pathologic review of selected cases to ensure the most accurate diagnosis and subclassification. RESULTS: The MYD88 L265P mutation was identified in 43 cases of LPL (96%), including 3 nonimmunoglobulin-M LPL cases. In contrast, the mutation was present in only 2 cases of MZL (4%), and 5 cases of CLL (2%). Thus, pyrosequencing for the MYD88 L265P mutation demonstrates a high clinical sensitivity and specificity to distinguish LPL from MZL and CLL. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the strong association of the MYD88 L265P mutation with LPL, as well as the existence of rare cases of small B-cell lymphoma that complicate this association.","['From the Department of Hematopathology/Molecular Genetics Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock (Dr Insuasti-Beltran); TriCore Reference Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico (Dr Gale); and the Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque (Drs Wilson, Foucar, and Czuchlewski).']","['0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)']",,,,['10.5858/arpa.2014-0322-OA [doi]'],10.5858/arpa.2014-0322-OA [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 30.,"Natural killer (NK) immune cells mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by aggregating FcgammaRIIIA/CD16, contributing significantly to the therapeutic effect of CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAb). In this study, we show that CD16 ligation on primary human NK cells by the anti-CD20 mAb rituximab or ofatumumab stably impairs the spontaneous cytotoxic response attributable to cross-tolerance of several unrelated NK-activating receptors (including NKG2D, DNAM-1, NKp46, and 2B4). Similar effects were obtained from NK cells isolated from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in an autologous setting. NK cells rendered hyporesponsive in this manner were deficient in the ability of these cross-tolerized receptors to phosphorylate effector signaling molecules critical for NK cytotoxicity, including SLP-76, PLCgamma2, and Vav1. These effects were associated with long-lasting recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 to the CD16 receptor complex. Notably, pharmacologic inhibition of SHP-1 with sodium stibogluconate counteracted CD20 mAb-induced NK hyporesponsiveness, unveiling an unrecognized role for CD16 as a bifunctional receptor capable of engendering long-lasting NK cell inhibitory signals. Our work defines a novel mechanism of immune exhaustion induced by CD20 mAb in human NK cells, with potentially negative implications in CD20 mAb-treated patients where NK cells are partly responsible for clinical efficacy.","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci-Bolognetti, Fondazione Eleonora Lorillard Spencer Cenci, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci-Bolognetti, Fondazione Eleonora Lorillard Spencer Cenci, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.

Improvements in the accuracy of diagnosing AMegL as well as interest in the molecular analysis of leukemias have led to an increased amount of data available on this rare AML subtype. In this review, we will analyze the diverse molecular features unique to AMegL and how they have influenced the development of novel treatment strategies, including polyploidization. The review will also consider the data available on clinical outcomes in AMegL and how it is a poor individual prognostic factor for AML. Finally, the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant in AMegL will be explored.","['Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, USA.

Epub 2015 Jul 31.,"Despite major improvements in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation over the past decades, corticosteroid-refractory (SR) acute (a) and chronic (c) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) cause high mortality. Preclinical evidence indicates the potent anti-inflammatory properties of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. In this retrospective survey, 19 stem cell transplant centers in Europe and the United States reported outcome data from 95 patients who had received ruxolitinib as salvage therapy for SR-GVHD. Patients were classified as having SR-aGVHD (n=54, all grades III or IV) or SR-cGVHD (n=41, all moderate or severe). The median number of previous GVHD-therapies was 3 for both SR-aGVHD (1-7) and SR-cGVHD (1-10). The overall response rate was 81.5% (44/54) in SR-aGVHD including 25 complete responses (46.3%), while for SR-cGVHD the ORR was 85.4% (35/41). Of those patients responding to ruxolitinib, the rate of GVHD-relapse was 6.8% (3/44) and 5.7% (2/35) for SR-aGVHD and SR-cGVHD, respectively. The 6-month-survival was 79% (67.3-90.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI)) and 97.4% (92.3-100%, 95% CI) for SR-aGVHD and SR-cGVHD, respectively. Cytopenia and cytomegalovirus-reactivation were observed during ruxolitinib treatment in both SR-aGVHD (30/54, 55.6% and 18/54, 33.3%) and SR-cGVHD (7/41, 17.1% and 6/41, 14.6%) patients. Ruxolitinib may constitute a promising new treatment option for SR-aGVHD and SR-cGVHD that should be validated in a prospective trial.","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell

Epub 2015 May 23.,"BACKGROUND: Although of interest, few data exist on the clinical characteristics of Japanese patients with an extremely high triglyceride level (>/= 1000 mg/dL). OBJECTIVE: We assessed the clinical characteristics of Japanese patients with an extremely high triglyceride level. METHODS: We investigated the presence of coronary artery disease, history of pancreatitis, the presence of fatty liver, and the potential causes of elevated triglyceride in Japanese subjects with an extremely high level of fasting triglyceride (>/= 1000 mg/dL) among 70,368 subjects whose serum triglyceride was measured for any reason at Kanazawa University Hospital from April 2004 to March 2014. RESULTS: We identified 215 (0.31%) subjects (mean age, 46 years; male, 170, mean body mass index, 25 kg/m(2)) with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Among them, 4 (1.9%) subjects were classified as type I, 97 (45.1%) subjects were type IV, and 114 (53.0%) subjects were type V hyperlipidemia, according to Fredrickson's classification. Among 215 subjects, 116 subjects (54.0%) drank alcohol, 58 (27.0%) showed heavy intake (>/= 60 g/d), and 64 (29.8%) subjects had diabetes. In total, 59 (27.4%) subjects had transient severe hypertriglyceridemia caused by corticosteroids (N = 19), antidepressant (N = 18), l-asparaginase and steroids for acute lymphoid leukemia (N = 15), hormone replacement therapy for breast cancer (N = 9), beta-blocker (N = 5), hypothyroidism (N = 4), pregnancy (N = 4), and panhypopituitarism (N = 2). As many as 119 (55.3%) subjects exhibited fatty liver. Moreover, 12 (5.6%) and 17 (7.9%) subjects had a history of pancreatitis and coronary artery disease, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of situations can cause severe hypertriglyceridemia. We suggest that potential secondary causes should be carefully assessed for such patients.","['Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medicine, Kanazawa, Japan.

Imatinib was administered continuously, starting from the eighth day of remission induction chemotherapy, then through five courses of consolidation or until allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Patients who were not transplanted were maintained on imatinib for 2 years. Eighty-two patients (94.3%) achieved complete remission (CR). Among these 82 CR patients, 40 experienced recurrence of leukemia. The 5-year relapse free survival (RFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rates were 39.0% and 33.4%, respectively. In total, 56 patients underwent allogeneic HCT in first CR. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse and OS rate of them were 59.1% and 52.6%, respectively. Six of seven patients who were maintained on imatinib after completion of consolidation relapsed and the median time of RFS was 40.7 months. In total patient, cumulative molecular CR rate was 88.5% and median time of molecular CR duration was 13 months. Initial imatinib dose intensity was significantly associated with median CR duration (P < 0.0001), and overall survival (P = 0.002). During the initial phase of treatment of patients with Ph(+) ALL, it is important to maintain imatinib dose intensity.","['Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Inje University College of Medicine, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Busan, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Inje University College of Medicine, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Busan, Korea.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan Paik Hospitals, Busan, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan Paik Hospitals, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Korea.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Catholic University Medical Center, Daegu, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Catholic University Medical Center, Daegu, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Yeungnam University Medical Center, Daegu, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Yeungnam University Medical Center, Daegu, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology Clinic, Center for Specific Organs Cancer, National Cancer Center, Ilsan, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, Gyeongsang National University Hospital, Jinju, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan University Hospital, Ulsan, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University of Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Incheon, Korea.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan, Korea.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University College of Medicine, Hallym Medical Center, Anyang, Korea.']","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,['10.1002/ajh.24137 [doi]'],10.1002/ajh.24137 [doi],20151012,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 2.,"In 2010, our hospital introduced a higher target teicoplanin trough concentration of >/=20 mg/L by Day 3 for haematological malignancy patients. This study aimed to explore whether target trough concentrations were achieved, to identify factors associated with trough concentrations attained, and to assess clinical efficacy with teicoplanin treatments and nephrotoxicity. This was a retrospective, single-centre, cohort study of 172 teicoplanin treatments in 104 adults with haematological malignancy. Mixed-effects regression was used to evaluate factors affecting trough concentrations, and logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between trough concentrations and treatment outcomes. Nephrotoxicity was assessed using the RIFLE criteria. Considerable variability in trough concentrations was observed, with trough concentrations >/=20 mg/L rarely achieved early in therapy. A mixed-effects regression model explaining 52% of the variation in trough concentrations was developed. Dose and day of therapy were positively associated with trough concentration, whilst estimated renal function and, interestingly, acute myeloid leukaemia diagnosis were negatively associated (P<0.05). Results suggested a positive relationship between trough concentration and the likelihood of a favourable outcome for coagulase-negative staphylococcal central line-associated bloodstream infections. Elucidation of a specific target concentration requires further investigation. Teicoplanin was well tolerated renally. Findings suggest a risk of underexposure if conventional teicoplanin doses are used in haematological malignancy patients. Given the variability in trough concentrations observed, the identified factors affecting trough concentrations attained and the suggested link with clinical outcome, individualised initial dosing followed by therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to ensure early adequate exposure in this vulnerable patient group.","['School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tallaght Hospital, Dublin 24, Ireland.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tallaght Hospital, Dublin 24, Ireland.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tallaght Hospital, Dublin 24, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Tallaght Hospital, Dublin 24, Ireland.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tallaght Hospital, Dublin 24, Ireland.', 'School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.

Epub 2015 Jul 31.,"Lenalidomide is often used in the maintenance setting for multiple myeloma and has been linked to the development of secondary primary malignancies. The mechanism of lenalidomide causing secondary malignancies has not been fully elucidated, but case reports and phase 3 trials have captured this uncommon occurrence. A case series describing development of secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients receiving lenalidomide maintenance therapy is presented. Based on data published in the literature thus far and commonalities among patients in this case series, secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia is likely duration related rather than dose related. Increased cognizance of this secondary malignancy will allow for a more accurate characterization of its true incidence. Regimens for acute lymphoblastic leukemia can be used for management of secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia with plan for stem cell transplantation. Further studies are needed to identify risk factors for development of secondary malignancy and the best management approach for these patients.

Because of the various results from different centers, the optimal therapy for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients is still uncertain. This study aimed to better understand predictive factors and role of auto-HSCT in the postremission therapy for adult ALL patients. METHODS: The outcomes of 135 adult patients with ALL, who received the first auto-HSCT in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center of Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 1, 1994 to February 28, 2014, were retrospectively analyzed. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and simultaneous effects of multiple covariates were estimated with the Cox model. RESULTS: Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years for the whole cohort were 59.1 +/- 4.5% and 59.0 +/- 4.4%, respectively. The cumulative nonrelapse mortality and relapse rate at 5 years were 4.5 +/- 0.03% and 36.6 +/- 0.19%. For both OS and DFS, acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at diagnosis, blast cell proportion >/=5% on the 15 th day of induction therapy, and extramedullary infiltration before HSCT were the poor prognosis factors. In addition, age >/=35 years predicted poor DFS. Only T-ALL and high LDH were the independent undesirable factors associated with OS and DFS in Cox regression model. For 44 patients who had results of pretransplantation minimal residual disease (MRD), positive MRD (MRD >/=0.01%) indicated poor OS (P = 0.044) and DFS (P = 0.008). Furthermore, for the standard risk group, the patients with negative MRD (MRD <0.01%) had better results (OS at 18 months was 90.0 +/- 9.5%, while for the patients with positive MRD OS was 50.0 +/- 35.4%, P = 0.003; DFS at 18 months was 90.0 +/- 9.5%, while for the positive MRD group DFS was 0%, P < 0.001).

We found that miR-320a expression was reduced in K562 and in CML cancer stem cells. Moreover, we found that miR-320a inhibited K562 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and promoted apoptosis by targeting BCR/ABL oncogene. As an upstream regulator of BCR/ABL, miR-320a directly targets BCR/ABL. The enhanced expression of miR-320a inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT and NF-kappaB; however, the expression of phosphorylated PI3K, AKT and NF-kappaB were restored by the overexpression of BCR/ABL. In K562, infected with miR-320a or transfected with SiBCR/ABL, the protein levels of fibronectin, vimentin, and N-cadherin were decreased, but the expression of E-cadherin was increased. The expression of mesenchymal markers in miR-320a-expressing cells was restored to normal levels by the restoration of BCR/ABL expression. Generally speaking, miR-320a acts as a novel tumor suppressor gene in CML and miR-320a can decrease migratory, invasive, proliferative and apoptotic behaviors, as well as CML EMT, by attenuating the expression of BCR/ABL oncogene.","['Clinical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical College, 0086-027-7398722, China.', 'Clinical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical College, 0086-027-7398722, China.', 'Weifang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Department of Urology. 0086-0536-8300338, China.', 'Clinical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical College, 0086-027-7398722, China.']","['0 (MIRN320 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC4521206,,,"['srep12460 [pii]', '10.1038/srep12460 [doi]']",10.1038/srep12460 [doi],20150731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, a vast array of BCR-associated kinases has emerged as rational therapeutic targets changing treatment paradigms in B cell malignancies. Based on high efficacy in early-stage clinical trials, there is rapid clinical development of inhibitors targeting BCR signaling pathway.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the PIP4K2A expression in hematological malignancies and verify the effects of PIP4K2A silencing on proliferation and survival of leukemia cell lines. PIP4K2A was found to be a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein with reduced levels in leukemia cell lines compared to normal leukocytes. PIP4K2A mRNA levels were significantly reduced in bone marrow cells from acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) patients compared with healthy donors and in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with >/=5% compared with <5% bone marrow blasts. Low PIP4K2A expression (lowest tertile versus 2 higher tertiles) negatively impacted overall survival of MDS patients by univariate analysis. PIP4K2A silencing did not modulate cell proliferation, clonogenicity and apoptosis of HEL and Namalwa leukemia cells. In summary, we characterized the expression of PIP4K2A in a cohort of patients with hematological malignancies and we found that PIP4K2A mRNA expression is downregulated in RAEB-1/RAEB-2 MDS and ALL cells, and PIP4K2A silencing does not modulate cell survival in HEL and Namalwa leukemia cells.","['Department of Clinical Pathology, School of Medical Sciences, University of Campinas - UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, School of Medical Sciences, University of Campinas - UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas - UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas - UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas - UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas - UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, School of Medical Sciences, University of Campinas - UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas - UNICAMP, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

We compared the levels of chemokine receptors in marrow samples from 82 children with ALL at diagnosis versus 15 at relapses, and quantified the levels of chemokines in central system fluid (CSF) samples. The functional role of specific chemokines was studied in vitro and in vivo. The expression of some chemokine receptors was upregulated upon leukemic relapse, both in B- and in T-ALL, and in cases of medullary and extramedullary involvement. CXCL10 induced chemotaxis in leukemic cell lines and in primary leukemic cells, depending upon the levels of CXCR3 expression. CXCL10 specifically diminished chemotherapy-induced apoptosis on ALL cells expressing CXCR3, partially inhibiting caspase activation and maintaining the levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Finally, immunodeficient mice engrafted with CXCR3-expressing human leukemic cells showed decreased infiltration of marrow, spleen, and CNS after receiving a CXCR3-antagonist molecule. CXCR3 signaling in ALL may have a dual function: chemotactic for the localisation of leukemic blasts in specific niches, and it may also confer resistance to chemotherapy, enhancing the chances for relapses.","['Servicio de Oncohematologia, Hospital Universitario Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Oncohematologia, Hospital Universitario Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.', 'Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain.', 'Servicio de Oncohematologia, Hospital Universitario Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Oncohematologia, Hospital Universitario Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales y Tecnologicas (CIEMAT), Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Spain.', 'Servicio de Oncohematologia, Hospital Universitario Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Oncohematologia, Hospital Universitario Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Oncohematologia, Hospital Universitario Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.

Moreover, during recent years, a plethora of studies has demonstrated that omega-3 FAs possess therapeutic role against certain types of cancer. It is also known that omega-3 FAs can improve efficacy and tolerability of chemotherapy. Previous reports showed that suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB, activation of AMPK/SIRT1, modulation of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, and up-regulation of novel anti-inflammatory lipid mediators such as protectins, maresins, and resolvins, are the main mechanisms of antineoplastic effect of omega-3 FAs.

We also discussed the chemistry, dietary source, and bioavailability of omega-3 FAs, and the potential molecular mechanisms of anticancer and adverse effects.","['Applied Biotechnology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'National Research Council, Institute of Food Sciences, 83100, Avellino, Italy.', 'National Research Council, Institute of Food Sciences, 83100, Avellino, Italy. glrusso@isa.cnr.it.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Gazi University, 06330, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Pharmacognosy Research Laboratories, Medway School of Science, University of Greenwich, Chatham-Maritime, Kent, ME4 4TB, UK.', 'Department of Drug Sciences, Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Technology Section, University of Pavia, Via Taramelli 12, 27100, Pavia, Italy. maria.daglia@unipv.it.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Alagappa University, Karaikudi, 630 004, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036, Rende, CS, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, 87036, Rende, CS, Italy.', 'Applied Biotechnology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Clinical trials', 'Nuclear factor-kappaB', 'Omega-3 FA']","['10.1007/s10555-015-9572-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s10555-015-9572-2 [pii]']",10.1007/s10555-015-9572-2 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 31.,"Aberrant methylation of let-7a-3 promoter has been observed in various malignancies. However, the clinical relevance of let-7a-3 methylation remains poorly known in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study was to investigate the let-7a-3 methylation status and to explore its clinical significance in AML. let-7a-3 promoter was significantly hypomethylated in AML patients compared to controls (median 4.51 vs 0.49) (P = 0.0003). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis discriminated all patients or cytogenetically normal patients from controls with an areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.737 or 0.783, respectively (P < 0.001). Patients with favorable/intermediate karyotypes had significantly higher let-7a-3 unmethylation than controls. Patients with DNMT3A mutations had a trend of high level of let-7a-3 unmethylation than did those with wild-type DNMT3A (median 6.76 vs 3.66, P = 0.096). There was no significant difference in overall survival between patients with and without hypomethylated let-7a-3 (median 12 vs 5 months, P = 0.103). No correlation was observed between the level of let-7a-3 expression and let-7a-3 unmethylation in AML samples (R = 0.197, P = 0.150). However, the level of let-7a-3 expression was increased in a dose-dependent manner in THP-1 line treated with 5-aza-dC, while the methylation density of let-7a-3 promoter decreased with 5-aza-dC dose. Our findings suggest that let-7a-3 hypomethylation is associated with favorable and intermediate karyotypes but not a prognostic predictor for AML patients. Let-7a-3 expression may be partially regulated by promoter methylation.","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. dwqian@yahoo.com."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. linjiangmail@sina.com.cn."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. qianjun0007@hotmail.com.""]","['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, human)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['5-aza-dC', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Hypomethylation', 'Let-7a-3']","['10.1007/s13277-015-3734-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-3734-2 [pii]']",10.1007/s13277-015-3734-2 [doi],20150731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus durable protection against infections should be provided. The aim of the study was to compare the levels of vaccine-derived antibodies in children with cancer compared to those of healthy children and to investigate how therapy influences the levels of specific antibodies. PROCEDURE: A group of 40 children, diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or solid tumor (ST), followed in Poznan University of Medical Sciences Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, were recruited for evaluation of humoral immunity. Antibody levels were checked before treatment and 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. RESULTS: In patients with ALL or ST, levels of IgG against tetanus and diphtheria were significantly lower than in the control group. Among ALL patients, 9% remained negative for tetanus and diphtheria antibodies 12 months after therapy. Among patients with ST 3 months after chemotherapy, there were no protective antibodies in 12% against tetanus, and in 18% against diphtheria. All patients reconstituted immunity 6 and 12 months after therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that a considerable number of cancer patients lose immunity against diphtheria and tetanus after therapy. Compared to ST, patients with ALL lose protective antibody levels more often. Patients with ST reconstituted antibodies after the treatment cessation, while levels in ALL patients remained low.","['Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Human Genetics Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Medical Sciences Poznan, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Diagnostic Poznan, Poznan, Poland.', 'Family Medicine Department, University of Medical Sciences Poznan, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Human Genetics Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Medical Sciences Poznan, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Health Promotion, University of Medical Sciences Poznan, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Health Promotion, University of Medical Sciences Poznan, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Diagnostic Poznan, Poznan, Poland.', 'Family Medicine Department, University of Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Medical Diagnostic Poznan, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Health Promotion, University of Medical Sciences Poznan, Poznan, Poland.']","['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxoid)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['immunocompromised patient', 'infectious diseases', 'solid tumor', 'vaccines']",['10.1002/pbc.25685 [doi]'],10.1002/pbc.25685 [doi],20150730,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical significance of HHV-6 reactivation after allo-HSCT remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis to elucidate the impact of HHV-6 reactivation on transplantation outcomes. Of 236 patients who underwent allo-HSCT, 138 (58.5%) developed HHV-6 reactivation and 98 (41.5%) did not. Univariate analysis indicated that at 3 years, patients with HHV-6 reactivation had significantly higher NRM (27.7% versus 13.7%, P = .003) and worse overall survival (42.1% versus 59.0%, P = .008) than those without reactivation. In multivariate analysis, HHV-6 reactivation was associated with higher incidence of acute GVHD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.87; P = .01), cytomegalovirus reactivation (HR, 2.24; P < .001), and NRM (HR, 2.73; P = .007). Subgroup analysis stratified according to conditioning intensity indicated that a significant impact of HHV-6 reactivation on acute GVHD was observed only in patients who received myeloablative conditioning (MAC). These results indicate that HHV-6 reactivation was associated with development of acute GVHD, cytomegalovirus reactivation, and NRM. Furthermore, adverse impact of HHV-6 reactivation on transplantation outcomes was prominent in the setting of MAC.","['Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.

A total of 33 patients (33/153, 21.6%) had recurrent disease. The positive predictive values of declining donor chimerism for hematologic and isolated extramedullary relapse were 58.8% and 10% (P=0.018, Chi-Square). The positive predictive values of declining donor chimerism in BMB, BMT, BMNK and PBB for hematologic relapse were 11.6%, 0%, 0% and 0% under close monitoring in patients with B-ALL. Only the donor chimerism in BMB significantly decreased in the group with hematologic relapse as compared with the group without hematologic relapse (P=0.00, Independent-samples T test) in patients with B-ALL. The median drop of donor chimerism in PBT, BMT, PBNK and BMNK were 0%, 0%, 5.9% and 2.8% one or two weeks prior to hematologic relapse in patients with non-B-ALL. The donor chimerism in PBNK significantly decreased prior to hematologic relapse in the group with hematologic relapse as compared with the group without hematologic relapse (P=0.022, Independent-samples T test).These data suggest donor chimerism of BMB can be used to predict the occurrence of hematologic relapse in patients with B-ALL. Donor chimerism decrease in PBNK was associated with a somewhat increased risk of hematologic relapse in patients with non-B-ALL. Therefore, our results reveal a more effective path to individually predict for hematologic relapse by dynamic monitoring different cell lineages in different disease.","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Medical College, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Medical College, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Medical College, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Medical College, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Medical College, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Central Laboratory, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Medical College, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Medical College, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China.""]",,PMC4520605,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0133671 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-11544 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0133671 [doi],20150730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 30.,"Computed tomography (CT) has great clinical utility and its usage has increased dramatically over the years. Concerns have been raised, however, about health impacts of ionising radiation exposure from CTs, particularly in children, who have a higher risk for some radiation induced diseases. Direct estimation of the health impact of these exposures is needed, but the conduct of epidemiological studies of paediatric CT populations poses a number of challenges which, if not addressed, could invalidate the results. The aim of the present paper is to review the main challenges of a study on the health impact of paediatric CTs and how the protocol of the European collaborative study EPI-CT, coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), is designed to address them. The study, based on a common protocol, is being conducted in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom and it has recruited over one million patients suitable for long-term prospective follow-up. Cohort accrual relies on records of participating hospital radiology departments. Basic demographic information and technical data on the CT procedure needed to estimate organ doses are being abstracted and passive follow-up is being conducted by linkage to population-based cancer and mortality registries. The main issues which may affect the validity of study results include missing doses from other radiological procedures, missing CTs, confounding by CT indication and socioeconomic status and dose reconstruction. Sub-studies are underway to evaluate their potential impact. By focusing on the issues which challenge the validity of risk estimates from CT exposures, EPI-CT will be able to address limitations of previous CT studies, thus providing reliable estimates of risk of solid tumours and leukaemia from paediatric CT exposures and scientific bases for the optimisation of paediatric CT protocols and patient protection.","['Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology (CREAL), Barcelona, Spain.

Epub 2015 Jul 30.,"Bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethanolic extract of the stems of Aristolochia fordiana led to the isolation of six new dihydrobenzofuran neolignans (1-3 and 7-9), three new 2-aryldihydrobenzofurans (4-6), a new 8-O-4' neolignan (10), and 14 known analogues (11-24). The structures of compounds 1-10 were established by spectroscopic methods, and their absolute configurations were determined by analyses of the specific rotation and electronic circular dichroism data. The neuroprotective effects of compounds 1-24 against glutamate-induced cell death were tested in hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22. Compounds 17 and 20-24 exhibited moderate neuroprotective activity by increasing the endogenous antioxidant defense system. In addition, the neolignans activated the Nrf2 (nuclear factor E2-related factor 2) pathway, resulting in the increase of the expression of endogenous antioxidant protein HO-1 (heme oxygenase-1). The active compounds also preserved the levels of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2), which was decreased by glutamate. Collectively, these results suggested that the active neolignans protect neurons against glutamate-induced cell death through maintaining the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway as well as preserving the Bcl-2 protein and might be promising novel beneficial agents for oxidative stress-associated diseases.","[""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou 510006, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou 510006, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou 510006, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Longquanyi District Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine , Chengdu 610100, People's Republic of China."", ""The 2nd Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine , Guangzhou 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou 510006, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou 510006, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou 510006, People's Republic of China."", ""The 2nd Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine , Guangzhou 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou 510006, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",,,,['10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b00220 [doi]'],10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b00220 [doi],20150730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 27.,"Interleukin-24 (IL-24), a member of the IL-10 cytokine gene family, causes growth suppression and apoptosis in various solid tumor cells. However, the effects of IL-24 on hematopoietic malignant cells have not been extensively explored. In this report, we constructed an RGD-engineered recombinant adenoviral vector, Ad.RGD-IL-24, and assessed its effects on human myeloid leukemia cells. Ad vector mediates gene transfer into leukemia cells with high efficiency. Ectopic over-expression of IL-24 has significant growth inhibition and differentiation inducement effects on these cells. Treatment with Ad.RGD-IL-24 could potentially induce leukemia cells' cell-cycle arrest. In addition, IL-24 expression could significantly induce apoptosis of the THP-1 cells. Ad.RGD-IL-24 had a potent effect on the up-regulation of the expression of GRP78/Bip, GADD34 and Bax, down-regulation of the expression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and induced the activation of Caspase-3, which may be responsible for its apoptosis-inducing effect on THP-1 cells. Furthermore, IL-24 expression could retard transplanted leukemia cell tumor growth in vivo in athymic nude mice. These findings showed the marked antitumor activity of IL-24 and provided potential perspectives in designing therapeutic or vaccine strategies in immuno-gene therapy of myeloid leukemia.","['Blood Transfusion Research Institute, Wuxi Red Cross Blood Center, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214021, PR China; Medical Biotechnology Institute, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215007, PR China.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Institute, Wuxi Red Cross Blood Center, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214021, PR China.', 'Medical Biotechnology Institute, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215007, PR China.', 'Miami University, Oxford, OH 45056, United States.', 'Medical Biotechnology Institute, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215007, PR China.', 'Medical Biotechnology Institute, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215007, PR China.', 'Medical Biotechnology Institute, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215007, PR China.', 'Medical Biotechnology Institute, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215007, PR China.

The cancer incidence data from nuclear medicine and oncology institutes were gathered and presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cancer incidence data for the last 30 years (1984-2014) are included to describe a data set of male and female patients. The data analysis concerning occurrence, trends of common cancers in male and female patients, stage-wise distribution, and mortality/follow-up cases is also incorporated for the last 10 years (2004-2014). RESULTS: The total population of provincial capital Lahore is 9,800,000. The total number of cancer cases was 80,390 (males 32,156, females 48,134). The crude incidence rates in PAECCR areas were 580.8/105 during 2010 to 885.4/105 in 2014 (males 354.1/105, females 530.1/105). The cancer incidence rates for head and neck (15.70%), brain tumors (10.5%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, 9.53%) were found to be the highest in male patients, whereas breast cancer (46.7%), ovary tumors (6.80%), and cervix (6.31%) cancer incidence rates were observed to be the most common in female patients. The age range distribution of diagnosed and treated patients in conjunction with the percentage contribution of cancer patients from 15 different cities of Punjab province treated at the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology, Lahore are also included. Leukemia was found to be the most common cancer for the age group of 1-12 years. It has been identified that the maximum number of diagnosed cases were found in the age range of 51-60 years for males and 41-50 years for female cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Overall cancer incidence of the thirty years demonstrated that head and neck and breast cancers in males and in females respectively are the most common cancers in Punjab province in Pakistan, at rates almost the highest in Asia, requiring especial attention. The incidence of brain, NHL, and prostate cancers among males and ovarian and cervix cancers among females have increased rapidly. These data from a major population of Punjab province should be helpful for implementation of appropriate planning, prevention and cancer control measures and for determination of risk factors within the country.","['Cancer Prevention and Control Research Group, Department of Medical Physics, Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan E-mail : kmasoodinmol@yahoo.com.']",,,,,['10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.13.5297 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autophosphorylation of BCR-ABL oncogenes results in proliferation of CML. The study deals with estimation of rate constant involved in each step of the cellular autophosphorylation process, which are consequently playing important roles in the proliferation of cancerous cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mathematical model was proposed for autophosphorylation of BCR-ABL oncogenes utilizing ordinary differential equations to enumerate the rate of change of each responsible system component. The major difficulty to model this process is the lack of experimental data, which are needed to estimate unknown model parameters. Initial concentration data of each substrate and product for BCR-ABL systems were collected from the reported literature. All parameters were optimized through time interval simulation using the fminsearch algorithm. RESULTS: The rate of change versus time was estimated to indicate the role of each state variable that are crucial for the systems. The time wise change in concentration of substrate shows the convergence of each parameter in autophosphorylation process. CONCLUSIONS: The role of each constituent parameter and their relative time dependent variations in autophosphorylation process could be inferred.","['Department of Bioinformatics, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, India E-mail : pritish@iiita.ac.in.']","['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,['10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.13.5273 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common form of childhood cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study concerned 50 children diagnosed with ALL (mean age, 8.55+/-2.54) compared to 40 healthy controls (mean age, 8.00+/-1.85). The Hb, serum copper, ceruloplasmin oxidase, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and protein were measured in all groups. One proteinous component was isolated by gel filtration chromatography from the precipitate produced by polyethylene glycol. RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of AOPP, copper and decrease in total antioxidant activity were noted in the cases. Statistical analysis also showed a significant increase (p<0.01) in the activity of serum ceruloplasmin oxidase in patients with ALL compared to normal subjects. The maximum velocity (Vmax) and Michaelis constant had values of 104.2 U/L and 11.7 mM, respectively. The DeltaH* values for ceruloplasmin oxidase in ALL patients were positive, confirming the reaction to be endothermic. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study showed a significant increase in AOPP, ceruloplasmine oxidase and decrease in total antioxidant activity .These parameters may play a role in development of DNA damage in childhood patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Recent studies have suggested that chronic inflammation can be a triggering factor in the clonal change in chronic myeloproliferative neoplasia (CMPN). In our study, we evaluated the existence of a chronic inflammation process in our Philadelphia negative (Ph-)CMPN patients using inflammation parameters in combination with demographic, laboratory and clinical characteristics of the patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratorial data, and thrombosis histories of 99 Ph-CMPN patients, who were diagnosed at our outpatient clinic of hematology in accordance with WHO 2008 criteria, were analyzed retrospectively,with 80 healthy individuals of matching gender and age included as controls. Complete blood counts, sedimentation, C reactive protein (CRP), JAK V617F gene mutations, abdomen ultrasound images and previous thrombosis histories of these patients were retrospectively analyzed.

The simulated data showed initial spikes in nanoparticle concentration in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, whereas concentration in plasma decreased rapidly. These simulation results were consistent with previously published in vivo data. At shorter time scales, the simulated data predicted decrease of nanoparticles from plasma with concomitant increase in the liver, spleen, and kidneys before decaying at longer timepoints. Interestingly, the simulated data predicted an unaccounted accumulation of about 50% of the injected dose of nanoparticles. Incorporation of an additional compartment into the model justified the presence of unaccounted nanoparticles in this compartment. Our results suggest that the proposed PBPK model can be an excellent tool for prediction of optimal dose of nanoparticle-encapsulated drugs for cancer treatment.","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Delaware Newark, Delaware, USA.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Delaware Newark, Delaware, USA ; Nemours Biomedical Research, A I DuPont Hospital for Children Wilmington, Delaware, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Delaware Newark, Delaware, USA.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Delaware Newark, Delaware, USA ; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Delaware Newark, Delaware, USA ; Department of Biological Sciences, Center for Translational Cancer Research, University of Delaware Newark, Delaware, USA.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Delaware Newark, Delaware, USA ; Department of Biological Sciences, Center for Translational Cancer Research, University of Delaware Newark, Delaware, USA ; Lankenau Institute for Medical Research Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Delaware Newark, Delaware, USA.']",,PMC4394613,,,['10.1002/psp4.13 [doi]'],10.1002/psp4.13 [doi],20150312,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diphosphorylated gemcitabine irreversibly inhibits ribonucleotide reductase thereby preventing deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. Functioning as a potent chemotherapeutic, gemcitabine decreases neoplastic cell proliferation and induces apoptosis which accounts for its effectiveness in the clinical treatment of several leukemia and carcinoma cell types. A brief plasma half-life due to rapid deamination, chemotherapeuticresistance and sequelae restricts gemcitabine utility in clinical oncology. Selective ""targeted"" gemcitabine delivery represents a molecular strategy for prolonging its plasma half-life and minimizing innocent tissue/organ exposure. METHODS: A previously described organic chemistry scheme was applied to synthesize a UV-photoactivated gemcitabine intermediate for production of gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu]. Immunodetection analysis (Western-blot) was applied to detect the presence of any degradative fragmentation or polymerization. Detection of retained binding-avidity for gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] was determined by cell-ELISA using populations of chemotherapeutic-resistant mammary adenocarcinoma (SKBr-3) that highly over-express the HER2/neu trophic membrane receptor. Anti-neoplastic cytotoxicity of gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] and the tubulin/microtubule inhibitor, griseofulvin was established against chemotherapeutic-resistant mammary adenocarcinoma (SKBr-3). Related investigations evaluated the potential for gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] in dual combination with griseofulvin to evoke increased levels of anti-neoplastic cytotoxicity compared to gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu]. RESULTS: Covalent gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] immunochemotherapeutic and griseofulvin exerted anti-neoplastic cytotoxicity against chemotherapeutic-resistant mammary adenocarcinoma (SKBr-3). Covalent gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] immunochemotherapeutic or gemcitabine in dual combination with griseofulvin created increased levels of anti-neoplastic cytotoxicity that were greater than was attainable with gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] or gemcitabine alone. CONCLUSION: Gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] in dual combination with griseofulvin can produce enhanced levels of anti-neoplastic cytotoxicity and potentially provide a basis for treatment regimens with a wider margin-of-safety. Such benefits would be possible through the collective properties of; [i] selective ""targeted"" gemcitabine delivery; [ii] relatively lower toxicity of griseofulvin compared to many if not most conventional chemotherapeutics; [iii] reduced total dosage requirements faciliated by additive or synergistic anti-cancer properties; and [iv] differences in sequelae for gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] compared to griseofulvin functioning as a tubulin/microtubule inhibitor.","['Department of Basic Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine at Wise Center, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, Mississippi 39762, USA.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine at Wise Center, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, Mississippi 39762, USA.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine at Wise Center, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, Mississippi 39762, USA.']",,PMC4516389,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-HER2/neu', 'Anti-neoplastic cytotoxicity', 'Chemotherapeutic-resistant', 'Covalent immunochemotherapeutic', 'Dual combination anti-cancer therapy', 'Gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu]', 'Griseofulvin', 'Mammary adenocarcinoma', 'Tubulin/microtubule inhibitor']",['10.4172/2161-0444.1000141 [doi]'],,,['T35 OD010432/OD/NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS708413'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 29.,"To design an effective antibody therapy to improve clinical outcomes in leukemia, the identification of novel cell surface antigens is needed. Herein, we demonstrate a role for transmembrane tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tmTNF-alpha) in leukemia. To characterize tmTNF-alpha expression in acute leukemia (AL), normal hematopoietic cells, and nonhematopoietic tissues, we used a monoclonal antibody, termed C1, which specifically recognizes the tmTNF-alpha domain. We found that tmTNF-alpha was preferentially expressed by AL and leukemia stem cells (LSCs). More abundant expression correlated with poor risk stratification, extramedullary infiltration, and adverse clinical parameters. Moreover, knockdown of tmTNF-alpha(+) expression rendered leukemia cells more sensitive to chemotherapy in vitro and delayed regeneration of leukemia in NOD-SCID mice. Targeting tmTNF-alpha by C1 resulted in leukemia cell killing via antibody-dependent cell-mediated and complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro and inhibited leukemia cell growth in vivo while simultaneously sparing normal hematopoietic cells. Notably, C1 administration impaired the regeneration of leukemia in secondary serial transplantation into NOD-SCID mice.

Epub 2015 Jul 29.,"Megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1), also known as MAL or myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A), is a coactivator of serum response factor, which regulates transcription of actin and actin cytoskeleton-related genes. MKL1 is known to be important for megakaryocyte differentiation and function in mice, but its role in immune cells is unexplored. Here we report a patient with a homozygous nonsense mutation in the MKL1 gene resulting in immunodeficiency characterized predominantly by susceptibility to severe bacterial infection. We show that loss of MKL1 protein expression causes a dramatic loss of filamentous actin (F-actin) content in lymphoid and myeloid lineage immune cells and widespread cytoskeletal dysfunction. MKL1-deficient neutrophils displayed reduced phagocytosis and almost complete abrogation of migration in vitro. Similarly, primary dendritic cells were unable to spread normally or to form podosomes. Silencing of MKL1 in myeloid cell lines revealed that F-actin assembly was abrogated through reduction of globular actin (G-actin) levels and disturbed expression of multiple actin-regulating genes. Impaired migration of these cells was associated with failure of uropod retraction likely due to altered contractility and adhesion, evidenced by reduced expression of the myosin light chain 9 (MYL9) component of myosin II complex and overexpression of CD11b integrin. Together, our results show that MKL1 is a nonredundant regulator of cytoskeleton-associated functions in immune cells and fibroblasts and that its depletion underlies a novel human primary immunodeficiency.","['University College London Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom;', 'University College London Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom;', 'University College London Genetics Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom;', 'University College London Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom;', 'University College London Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom;', 'University College London Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom;', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom;', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom;', 'Birmingham Heartland Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom;', 'London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London, London, United Kingdom;', 'University College London Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom;', 'University College London Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom; Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Immunology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom; and University College London Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, London, United Kingdom.']","['0 (Actins)', '0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",PMC4671330,,,"['S0006-4971(20)30884-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-12-611012 [doi]']",10.1182/blood-2014-12-611012 [doi],20150729,"['095198/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '090233/Z/09/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '095198/Z/10/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['Blood. 2015 Sep 24;126(13):1519-20.

Epub 2015 Jul 30.,"INTRODUCTION: It is widely recognized that plasma cells (PCs) are under-represented in flow cytometry (FC) studies, but the causes of this phenomenon are poorly understood. We sought to study potential variables that affect PC recovery by flow cytometry (FC) in the analysis of plasma cell myeloma (PCM). METHODS: We retrospectively performed PC differential counts and morphologic assessment on PCM peripheral blood (PB) smears, bone marrow (BM) aspirate smears and posterythrocyte lysis cytospins. PCs were enumerated by FC, excluding erythroid events/debris, and were defined as CD38(bright+), CD45(dim to negative) events. PC recovery was calculated as follows: cytospin/aspirate, FC/aspirate, and FC/cytospin. RESULTS: Sixty-four BM analyses from 42 patients showed a mean aspirate PC% of 32.9 +/- 23.2%. The mean PC% decreased in both the cytospin (10.9%) and by FC (8.2%). The difference between PC% in the cytospin and by FC was statistically significant (P < 0.03). Mature PC morphology and lower aspirate PC% had poorer recovery (P < 0.05) but higher-risk cytogenetics (deletions of 13q and TP53) was associated with increased PC recovery. Immunophenotype, heavy chain type, and treatment did not affect PC recovery. PB specimens had superior recovery compared with BM samples. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to prior reports, the greatest loss of PC in BM evaluation occurs between the aspirate and postlysis specimens; however, a small amount occurs from further processing. Additional morphologic and cytogenetic factors also appear to influence recovery in addition to overall PC%.","['Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Plasma cells', 'cytogenetics', 'flow cytometry', 'myeloma', 'plasma cell leukemia']",['10.1111/ijlh.12411 [doi]'],10.1111/ijlh.12411 [doi],20150730,,,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 30.,"PURPOSE: Wilms tumor gene single nucleotide polymorphism (WT1 SNP) rs16754 has been described as a favorable risk marker in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Subsequent studies revealed inconsistent results in both adult and pediatric patients. We analyzed its impact on clinical outcome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for the first time. METHODS: WT1 SNP rs16754 of 158 children with ALL treated according to ALL Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster treatment trials from 1990 to 2009 and 43 hematopoietic stem cell donors was analyzed by allelic discrimination. WT1 SNP status was correlated with disease characteristics and clinical outcome comparing SNP (WT1(GG/AG)) and wildtype (WT1(AA)). RESULTS: At least one minor allele was found in 23.4 % of patients and 34.9 % of donors (P = 0.07). Distribution of patient and disease characteristics was similar between WT1(GG/AG) and WT1(AA). In multivariate analyses, WT1 SNP was an independent good prognostic marker for cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR WT1(AA) vs. WT1(GG/AG) HR = 3.384, P = 0.021) and event-free survival (EFS; event risk WT1(AA) vs. WT1(GG/AG) HR = 2.503, P = 0.036). Univariate subanalyses of patients who underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation revealed more significant differences in CIR (P = 0.017), EFS (P = 0.012), and overall survival (OS; P = 0.017). Donor's WT1 SNP status did not affect outcome. We found no correlation between WT1 SNP and WT1 expression level at diagnosis (P = 0.634). CONCLUSION: WT1 SNP rs16754 predicts improved CIR and EFS. Outcome differences were more prominent in transplanted children. Our findings identify WT1 SNP rs16754 as a favorable risk marker in pediatric ALL which is independent from known risk factors.","['Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Statistics, Computer Sciences and Documentation, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany. bernd.gruhn@med.uni-jena.de.']",['0 (WT1 Proteins)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'Pediatrics', 'Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)', 'Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1)', 'rs16754']","['10.1007/s00432-015-2018-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-015-2018-y [pii]']",10.1007/s00432-015-2018-y [doi],20150730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA methylation was correlated with gene expression. Furthermore, we established and validated an epigenetic signature differentiating pure-FLC from other HCCs. LINE-1 methylation correlated with shorter recurrence-free survival and overall survival in resected pure-FLC patients. Unsupervised clustering using CG sites located in islands distinguished pure-FLC from nc-HCC. Major DNA methylation changes occurred outside promoters, mainly in gene bodies and intergenic regions located in the vicinity of liver developmental genes (i.e., SMARCA4 and RXRA). Partially methylated domains were more prone to DNA methylation changes. Furthermore, we identified several putative tumor suppressor genes (e.g., DLEU7) and oncogenes (e.g., DUSP4). While approximately 70% of identified gene promoters gaining methylation were marked by bivalent histone marks (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) in embryonic stem cells, approximately 70% of those losing methylation were marked by H3K4me3. Finally, we established a pure FLC DNA methylation signature and validated it in an independent dataset. Our analysis reveals a distinct epigenetic signature of pure FLC as compared to nc-HCC, with DNA methylation changes occurring in the vicinity of liver developmental genes. These data suggest new options for targeting FLC based on cancer epigenome aberrations.","['a Department of Leukemia ; the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ; Houston , TX USA.']",['Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma'],PMC4622466,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'LINE-1', 'fibrolamellar carcinoma', 'next-generation sequencing', 'oncogenes', 'partially methylated domains', 'tumor suppressor genes']",['10.1080/15592294.2015.1076955 [doi]'],10.1080/15592294.2015.1076955 [doi],,['R01 CA158112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RBL-2H3 viability was decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner after lysine-functionalized RNT (K-RNT) exposure. In addition, K-RNTs had a significant effect on RBL-2H3 degranulation. When K-RNT exposure was concurrent with IgE sensitization, 50 and 100 mg l(-1) K-RNTs elicited a heightened degranulatory response compared with IgE alone. Exposure to 50 and 100 mg l(-1) K-RNTs also caused degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells not sensitized with IgE (0 ng ml(-1) IgE). Furthermore, in cells preexposed to K-RNTs for 2 h and subsequently washed, sensitized, and stimulated with IgE, a potentiated degranulatory response was observed. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy and a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-functionalized RNT construct (termed FITC(1)/TBL(19)-RNT), we demonstrated a strong and direct affiliation between RNTs and RBL-2H3 cell membranes. We also demonstrated cellular internalization of RNTs after 2 h of exposure. Together, these data demonstrate that RNTs may affiliate with the cellular membrane of RBL-2H3 cells and can be internalized. These interactions can affect viability and alter the ability of these cells to elicit IgE-FcepsilonR mediated degranulation.","['*Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, T6G 2E9; ede@ualberta.ca.', '*Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, T6G 2E9;', '*Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, T6G 2E9;', 'National Institute for Nanotechnology, 11421 Saskatchewan Drive, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, T6G 2M9; and.', 'National Institute for Nanotechnology, 11421 Saskatchewan Drive, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, T6G 2M9; and.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, 313 Snell Engineering Center, 360 Huntington Avenue, Northeastern University, Boston, Maryland 02115.', '*Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, T6G 2E9;', '*Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, T6G 2E9; National Institute for Nanotechnology, 11421 Saskatchewan Drive, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, T6G 2M9; and.']","['0 (Biocompatible Materials)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['degranulation', 'inflammation', 'nanotoxicology', 'rosette nanotubes', 'self-assembly']","['kfv166 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfv166 [doi]']",10.1093/toxsci/kfv166 [doi],20150729,,,"['(c) The Author 2015.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of resveratrol-downregulated phosphorylated liver kinase B1 (pLKB1) on the senescence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) stem cells. The protein expressions of pLKB1 and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a regulator of pLKB1, were measured in CD34(+)CD38(-) KG1a cells treated with resveratrol (40 mumol/L) or not by Western blotting. Senescence-related factors were examined, including p21 mRNA tested by real-time PCR, cell morphology by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) staining, cell proliferation by MTT assay and cell cycle by flow cytometry. Besides, apoptosis was flow cytometrically determined. The results showed that pLKB1 was highly expressed in CD34(+)CD38(-) KG1a cells, and resveratrol, which could downregulate pLKB1 through activation of SIRT1, induced senescence and apoptosis of CD34(+)CD38(-) KG1a cells. It was concluded that resveratrol-downregulated pLKB1 is involved in the senescence of AML stem cells.","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. 1723037335@qq.com.']","['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (STK11 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.3 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",,,,"['10.1007/s11596-015-1457-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11596-015-1457-7 [pii]']",10.1007/s11596-015-1457-7 [doi],20150731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in DNMT3A(mut) cn-AML patients remains unclear. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations and explored the role of allo-HSCT in 308 cn-AML patients who received consolidation of intensive chemotherapy or allo-HSCT in our center from March 2005 to May 2014. In the whole cohort, 63 patients (20.5%) were identified with DNMT3A exon 23 mutations and R882H was the most frequent variant. DNMT3A(mut) patients had shorter overall survival (3-year OS: 31.9% vs. 52.0%, P = 0.009) and disease-free survival (3-year DFS: 21.8% vs. 40.1%, P = 0.004) compared with DNMT3A(wt) patients. Based on FLT3/NPM1/CEBPA mutations, 308 cn-AML patients were divided into favorable/intermediate group (n = 262) and unfavorable group (n = 46). There were no significant differences in 3-year OS and 3-year DFS between DNMT3A(mut) and DNMT3A(wt) patients in both favorable/intermediate and unfavorable groups. Additionally, in multivariate analysis, DNMT3A mutation remained an independent adverse prognostic factor for the survival. In the DNMT3A(mut) cohort, 23 complete remission (CR) patients received allo-HSCT consolidation and 32 CR patients received chemotherapy consolidation, dramatic differences were observed in 3-year OS (51.7% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.048) and 3-year DFS (41.6% vs. 14.9%, P = 0.024) between allo-HSCT group and chemotherapy group. Collectively, DNMT3A mutation is a poor prognostic factor for cn-AML patients and allo-HSCT could improve survival of cn-AML patients with DNMT3A mutations.","[""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Suzhou Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Suzhou Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Suzhou Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,['10.1002/ajh.24135 [doi]'],10.1002/ajh.24135 [doi],,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 29.,"IFNs orchestrate immune defense through induction of hundreds of genes. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is involved in various cellular functions, but little is known about its role in IFN responses. Prior work identified STAT1 SUMOylation as an important mode of regulation of IFN-gamma signaling. In this study, we investigated the roles of SUMO in IFN signaling, gene expression, protein stability, and IFN-induced biological responses. We first show that SUMO overexpression leads to STAT1 SUMOylation and to a decrease in IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation. Interestingly, IFNs exert a negative retrocontrol on their own signaling by enhancing STAT1 SUMOylation. Furthermore, we show that expression of each SUMO paralog inhibits IFN-gamma-induced transcription without affecting that of IFN-alpha. Further, we focused on IFN-induced gene products associated to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, and we show that neither IFN-alpha nor IFN-gamma could increase PML and Sp100 protein expression because they enhanced their SUMO3 conjugation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Because it is known that SUMO3 is important for the recruitment of RING finger protein 4, a poly-SUMO-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase, and that PML acts as a positive regulator of IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation, we went on to show that RING finger protein 4 depletion stabilizes PML and is correlated with a positive regulation of IFN signaling. Importantly, inhibition of IFN signaling by SUMO is associated with a reduction of IFN-induced apoptosis, cell growth inhibition, antiviral defense, and chemotaxis. Conversely, inhibition of SUMOylation results in higher IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and biological responses. Altogether, our results uncover a new role for SUMO in the modulation of IFN response.","['INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 75006 Paris, France.', 'INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 75006 Paris, France sebastien.nisole@inserm.fr mounira.chelbi-alix@parisdescartes.fr.', 'INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 75006 Paris, France sebastien.nisole@inserm.fr mounira.chelbi-alix@parisdescartes.fr.']","['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO3 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,"['jimmunol.1500035 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1500035 [doi]']",10.4049/jimmunol.1500035 [doi],20150729,,,"['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment reduces Wnt signaling in LSCs and often results in molecular remission of CML; however, LSCs persist long term despite BCR-ABL1 inhibition, ultimately causing disease relapse. We demonstrate that TKIs induce the expression of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family ligand CD70 in LSCs by down-regulating microRNA-29, resulting in reduced CD70 promoter DNA methylation and up-regulation of the transcription factor specificity protein 1. The resulting increase in CD70 triggered CD27 signaling and compensatory Wnt pathway activation. Combining TKIs with CD70 blockade effectively eliminated human CD34(+) CML stem/progenitor cells in xenografts and LSCs in a murine CML model. Therefore, targeting TKI-induced expression of CD70 and compensatory Wnt signaling resulting from the CD70/CD27 interaction is a promising approach to overcoming treatment resistance in CML LSCs.","['Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 35, 3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Tumor Immunology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Murtenstrasse 35, 3010 Bern, Switzerland.

We report the clinical and biological data, and final outcome of 48 paediatric patients with primary-resistant AML enrolled in the Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica AML 2002/01 clinical trial. These patients had a significantly higher white blood cell count at diagnosis compared to other AML patients. Cytogenetic and molecular features did not differ between patients with primary induction failure and patients allocated to the high-risk group. For the whole patient population, the probability of overall survival, event-free survival (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was 21.8% +/- 6.2, 20.4% +/- 5.9, and 49.5% +/- 11.3, respectively. Twenty-eight (58%) patients received haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); 3 were autologous and 25 were allogeneic. Patients who underwent HSCT had improved EFS (31.2% vs. 5%, P < 0.0001). Only one of the 20 patients who did not receive HSCT is alive and disease free. The 19 patients in complete remission at time of HSCT showed significantly better DFS than the 9 with active disease (46% vs. 0%, P = 0.02). This study represents one of the largest series with long-term follow up of paediatric AML patients with primary refractory disease. Children who underwent transplantation had an encouraging long-term outcome. Disease recurrence remains the major cause of treatment failure; a better understanding of the disease biology is desirable to develop more effective treatment strategies.","[""Paediatric Onco-Haematology, Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Division, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Torino, Italy."", ""Paediatric Onco-Haematology, Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Division, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Torino, Italy."", 'Department of Woman and Child Health, Haemato-Oncology Division, University of Padova, Azienda Ospedale Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, Haemato-Oncology Division, University of Padova, Azienda Ospedale Padova, Padova, Italy.', ""Paediatric Onco-Haematology, Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Division, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Torino, Italy."", ""Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Roma, Italy."", 'Department of Paediatric Haematology, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Paediatric Haemato-Oncology, Santobono-Pausilipon Hospital, Napoli, Italy.', 'Paediatric Oncology and Haematology Unit ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Department of Paediatrics, University of Bologna Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, Bologna, Italy.', ""Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Roma, Italy."", 'University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukaemia', 'childhood leukaemia', 'induction failure', 'relapse', 'stem cell transplantation']",['10.1111/bjh.13611 [doi]'],10.1111/bjh.13611 [doi],20150730,,,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both gammaHCD and LGL leukemia share some similar clinical features, such as cytopenias, splenomegaly, and recurrent infections. Association of these two diseases is exceptional and suggest pathogenic link. We report two cases of gammaHCD associated with T-LGL leukemia. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Patient 1 was a 70-year-old woman, with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, refractory to chlorambucil-rituximab treatment. She developed during the follow up a gammaHCD with T-LGL leukemia, unresponsive to melphalan, thalidomide, and steroids, requiring supportive care. Patient 2 was a 40-year-old man with chronic severe asymptomatic neutropenia, revealing both gammaHCD and T-LGL leukemia. He is still well without any treatment nor complications, with 7 years follow up. CONCLUSION: Several types of B lymphoproliferative disease are associated with LGL leukemia. Although exceptional, this association of two rare lymphoproliferative disorders, with a different phenotype, does not seem fortuitous.","['a Service de Medecine Interne, CHU Hotel Dieu, 1 Place Alexis-Ricordeau , 44093 Nantes Cedex 1 , France.', 'a Service de Medecine Interne, CHU Hotel Dieu, 1 Place Alexis-Ricordeau , 44093 Nantes Cedex 1 , France.', 'a Service de Medecine Interne, CHU Hotel Dieu, 1 Place Alexis-Ricordeau , 44093 Nantes Cedex 1 , France.', 'a Service de Medecine Interne, CHU Hotel Dieu, 1 Place Alexis-Ricordeau , 44093 Nantes Cedex 1 , France.', ""b Service d'Hematologie, CHU Hotel Dieu, 1 Place Alexis-Ricordeau , 44093 Nantes Cedex 1 , France."", 'c Service de Biochimie, CHU Hotel Dieu , 1 Place Alexis-Ricordeau, 44093 Nantes Cedex 1 , France.', 'a Service de Medecine Interne, CHU Hotel Dieu, 1 Place Alexis-Ricordeau , 44093 Nantes Cedex 1 , France.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Franklin disease', '*Gamma heavy chain disease', '*Large granular lymphocyte leukemia']",['10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000037 [doi]'],10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000037 [doi],20160219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach has become highly successful for certain cancers. However, as the list of targeted therapies expands, their efficacy becomes more limited, and toxicity accumulates. What we have learned in the past decades is that while the targeted therapeutics approach may be highly successful in less complex tumors, cancers defined by carcinogen-induced genomic chaos, such a UV-induced melanoma or tobacco-induced lung cancer, are driven by a multitude of competing molecular pathways and, as such, are not as successfully managed by a similar approach. Luckily, in the past years, the field of cancer immunotherapy has become more fully developed with the emergence of checkpoint blockade inhibitor therapy. These promising new agents are particularly well suited for tumors with a high mutational burden due to underlying genomic disarray. While still in its infancy, we predict that cancer immunotherapy will offer a better alternative to our current targeted approach and eagerly await the results of several ongoing clinical trials that will elucidate this new direction in cancer therapy.","['From the Division of Medical Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)']",,,,"['10.1097/PPO.0000000000000135 [doi]', '00130404-201507000-00010 [pii]']",10.1097/PPO.0000000000000135 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the number and the size of relevant genes leave conventional Sanger sequencing impracticable in terms of costs, required input DNA, and turnaround time. Since most published protocols and commercially available reagents for targeted resequencing of gene panels are established and validated for the analysis of fresh bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood it remains to be proven whether the available technology can be transferred to the analysis of archival trephines. Therefore, the performance of the recently available Ion AmpliSeq AML Research panel (LifeTechnologies) was evaluated for the analysis of fragmented DNA extracted from archival bone marrow trephines. Taking fresh aspirate as gold standard all clinically relevant mutations (n = 17) as well as 25 well-annotated SNPs could be identified reliably with high quality in the corresponding archival trephines of the training set (n = 10). Pre-treatment of the extracted DNA with Uracil-DNA-Glycosylase reduced the number of low level artificial sequence variants by more than 60%, vastly reducing time required for proper evaluation of the sequencing results. Subsequently, randomly picked FFPE samples (n = 41) were analyzed to evaluate sequencing performance under routine conditions. Thereby all known mutations (n = 43) could be verified and 36 additional mutations in genes not yet covered by the routine work-up (e.g., TET2, ASXL1, DNMT3A), demonstrating the feasibility of this approach and the gain of diagnostically relevant information. The dramatically reduced amount of input DNA, the increase in sensitivity as well as calculated cost-effectiveness, low hands on , and turn-around-time, necessary for the analysis of 237 amplicons strongly argue for replacing Sanger sequencing by this semiconductor-based targeted resequencing approach.","['Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']","['1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)']",PMC4519100,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0133930 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-13775 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0133930 [doi],20150729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of RAS mutations and the association between RAS mutations and other genetic aberrations in Arab Asian children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Diagnostic samples of 485 patients (<18 years) with acute leukemia from Iraq and Jordan were obtained, using Flinders Technology Associates filter papers. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were performed in Japan. RESULTS: RAS mutations were detected in 86/318 (27%) of ALL cases and 35/167 (21%) of AML cases. The frequency of NRAS mutation was similar to that of KRAS mutation in ALL. Two RAS mutations were detected in nine patients. Among 264 Iraqi patients with ALL, RAS mutation was significantly associated with lower initial white blood cell count. Of 57 patients with chimeric transcripts, only two patients with either TEL-AML1 or E2A-PBX1 had KRAS mutation. The frequency of NRAS mutation was four times higher than that of KRAS mutation in AML. FAB-M4 and M5 subsets were associated with RAS mutation. Among 134 Iraqi patients with AML, 18 patients had RAS mutations and other genetic aberrations. In particular, 9 of 25 (36%) with MLL-rearrangement had RAS mutations. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of oncogenic RAS mutations was higher among Arab Asian children than in other countries. RAS mutations in AML were found to coexist with other genetic aberrations, particularly MLL rearrangement.","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Baghdad University, Baghdad Medical City, Baghdad, Iraq.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Welfare Teaching Hospital, Baghdad Medical City, Baghdad, Iraq."", 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Baghdad University, Baghdad Medical City, Baghdad, Iraq.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Welfare Teaching Hospital, Baghdad Medical City, Baghdad, Iraq."", 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Baghdad University, Baghdad Medical City, Baghdad, Iraq.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Welfare Teaching Hospital, Baghdad Medical City, Baghdad, Iraq."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shinshu University Hospital, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Central Teaching Hospital for Children, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Central Teaching Hospital for Children, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Central Teaching Hospital for Children, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Department of Pathology, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan.', 'Japan Iraq Medical Network, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Japan Chernobyl Foundation, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.']","['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'AML', 'Arab Asian children', 'FTA', 'MLL-rearrangement', 'RAS']",['10.1002/pbc.25683 [doi]'],10.1002/pbc.25683 [doi],20150729,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there exists a controversy that WT1 as a marker for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in acute leukemias. We detected WT1-RNA transcript level to estimate the diagnostic value of monitoring MRD in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: WT1 mRNA expression levels were detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) in bone marrow (BM) samples from 107 childhood ALL and 35 childhood AML at diagnosis. MRD was consecutively performed after induction and consolidation (early intensification in ALL) chemotherapy. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the largest areas under the curve (AUC) were applied to define optimal threshold value of MRD level. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (+LR) and negative likelihood ratio (-LR) were used to evaluate diagnostic power for MRD. Relapse free survival (RFS) was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier statistical method. RESULTS: The largest areas under the curve (AUC), specificity, +LR and -LR showed higher accuracy in childhood AML than ALL. Compared the diagnostic parameters, the post-induction time wasn't good enough to show the better time than post-consolidation time for MRD assessment in AML. The threshold was set at 150 WT1 copies/104 ABL copies as the optimal cut-off value of MRD level post induction in childhood AML. MRD+ (WT1>150) children had increased the risk of relapse with poor prognosis, showing lower RFS than MRD- group (p=0.01). However, the threshold 70 WT1 copies/104 ABL copies post induction in childhood ALL did not show clinical significance for predicting prognosis (p=0.056). CONCLUSIONS: WT1 gene will be a useful marker for monitoring MRD to predict relapse in childhood AML. But it did not show good enough to monitor MRD in childhood ALL.","[""Department of Pediatrics Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China. 2738988234@qq.com.""]","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",,,,,9242 [pii],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We study here the effects of DC 70% ethanol extract alone, or in combination with cisplatin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel on pancreatic endocrine HP62 and pancreatic ductal carcinoma PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. Antiproliferation activity assay, cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry, apoptosis-related markers by antibody array, and RT-PCR assay were used for this study. DC extract inhibited proliferation of HP62 with IC50 (50% inhibition concentration) at 0.037+/-0.002% (v/v), PANC-1 at 0.0058 +/- 0.0004% and BxPC-3 at 0.021 +/- 0.003%. DC at 0.0033% combined with 1 nM of paclitaxel showed inhibition synergy on PANC-1 cells with a combination index of 0.44. Apoptosis focused antibody array profile indicated upregulation of cytochrome C, claspin, cIAP-2 and HTRA2/Omi apoptosis-related markers in DC-treated HP62 and PANC-1. Our data suggest that DC acts through targeting the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in the pancreatic cancer cells. The high antiproliferation potency of DC on PANC-1 is potentially useful as an adjunct therapy for treating pancreatic cancer, which is known for developing resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics.","['a Department of Surgery , University of British Columbia , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '25067-58-7 (Polyynes)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,['10.1080/01635581.2015.1055367 [doi]'],10.1080/01635581.2015.1055367 [doi],20150729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcomes of t(6;9) AML are generally poor, with low five-year overall survival and increased risk for relapse. Furthermore, FLT3-ITD is one of the most common molecular abnormalities found in AML that is associated with increased risk of treatment failure and mortality. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with the best available donor is a standard treatment option for these cases once remission is achieved. We report a challenging case of t(6;9) and FLT3-positive AML in a young adult male. After failing multiple standard induction regimens, morphologic remission was eventually achieved with a FLT3 inhibitor (sorafenib) and a hypomethylating agent (azacytidine). However, despite allogeneic HCT and re-initiation of sorafenib in the post-HCT setting, he experienced early relapse with the original [FLT3-ITD and t(6;9)] and new (FLT3-D835 and +8) molecular and cytogenetic markers, respectively.

Pten defect also causes the premature oocytes and ovary aging. We and other groups have found that the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling regulates the proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). PTEN functions as a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway. Thus, we thought that the fate of SSCs might be controlled by Pten. RESULTS: We report that promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF) and undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1 (UTF1), both of which are germ cell-specific transcriptional factors, are regulated by Pten. Conditional deletion of Pten leads to reduction in PLZF expression but induction of UTF1, which is associated with SSCs depletion and infertility in males with age. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that Pten is required for the long-term maintenance of SSCs and precise regulation of spermatogenesis in mouse. The finding of a Pten-regulated GFRalpha1(+)/PLZF(-)/UTF1(+) progenitor population provides a new insight into the precise mechanisms controlling SSC fate.","['Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital / Faculty of Basic Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.', 'Centre for Reproductive Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People Hospital, Shanghai, 200233 China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.', 'Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101 China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.', 'College of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.', 'Centre for Reproductive Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People Hospital, Shanghai, 200233 China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.']",,PMC4517568,['NOTNLM'],"['PI3K-Akt signaling', 'PLZF', 'Pten knockout', 'Spermatogonial stem cells', 'UTF1']","['10.1186/s13578-015-0034-x [doi]', '34 [pii]']",10.1186/s13578-015-0034-x [doi],20150728,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of ultraviolet radiation is well-known in the pathogenesis of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). CD10 is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase known as common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA). Although CD10 expression has been investigated in some cutaneous tumors, to our knowledge, data regarding its expression in cutaneous epithelial neoplasms are very limited. In this study, we aimed to determine the immunohistochemical expression of CD10 in BCC and SCC and to find whether it could distinguish between these two skin malignancies. METHODS: Twenty SCC and 42 BCC cases were retrieved randomly from Ayatollah Rouhani Hospital pathology archive and CD10 expression was determined in tumoral and stromal cells of each case based on immunohistochemical method. Positive CD10 staining was identified as brown cytoplasmic, with or without cell membrane staining. RESULTS: In all the 20 SCC cases, tumor cells failed to stain with CD10 in contrast to the stromal cells that showed CD10 expression in 18 cases (90%). In BCC cases, the expression of CD10 was noted in tumor cells in 25 cases (59.5%) and in stromal cells of 32 cases (76.2%). There was no relation between CD10 expression in aggressive and non- aggressive BCC. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CD10 is a useful immunohistochemical marker to differentiate between BCC and SCC. At least, if tumor cells were CD10 positive, this would favor BCC over SCC. Due to small number of aggressive BCC in contrast to non- aggressive types, more studies need to be done to prove or rule out this finding.","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran.']",,PMC4478460,['NOTNLM'],"['BCC', 'CD 10', 'Immunostaining', 'SCC']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the results are conflicting. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to define the effect of ABCB1 polymorphism on ALL risk. METHODS: We identified 8 eligible studies involving 1,308 cases and 1,427 controls through searching PubMed and Enbase databases. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to access the strength of the association with both fixed effects and random effect models. RESULTS: We found ABCB1 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of ALL under the homozygote genotypes (TT vs. CC: OR, 1.29, 95% CI, 1.08-1.54), the recessive model (TT vs. CT + CC: OR, 1.47, 95% CI, 1.02-2.13) and the allele model (T vs. C: OR, 1.14, 95% CI, 1.04-1.25). Similar results were indicated in Asian populations (TT vs. CC: OR, 1.79, 95% CI, 1.32-2.43; TT vs. CT + CC: OR, 2.55, 95% CI, 1.47-4.43; T vs. C: OR, 1.38, 95% CI, 1.18-1.62), but not in Caucasian populations.

Epub 2015 Jul 2.,"Fenretinide, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide, (4-HPR), a synthetic retinoid, owes its cancer-toxic effects in part to the generation of ceramide, a potent tumor-suppressing sphingolipid. As such, 4-HPR has garnered considerable interest as a chemotherapeutic. Cancer cells, however, via various metabolic routes, inactivate ceramide, and this can limit 4-HPR efficacy. As relatively little is known regarding 4-HPR-induced ceramide management in acute myelogeneous leukemia (AML), we undertook the present study to evaluate the impact of 4-HPR on ceramide production, metabolism, and cytotoxicity. In KG-1, HL-60, and HL-60/VCR (multidrug resistant) human leukemia cells, 4-HPR induced 15-, 2-, and 20-fold increases in ceramide (measured using [3H]palmitic acid), respectively. By use of specific inhibitors we show that ceramide was produced by sphingomyelinase and de novo pathways in response to 4-HPR exposure. HL-60/VCR cells metabolized ceramide to glucosylceramide (GC). 4-HPR exposure (1.25-10 muM) reduced viability in all cell lines, with approximate IC50's ranging from 1 to 8.0 muM. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated in response to 4-HPR treatment, and the concomitant cytotoxicity was reversed by addition of vitamin E. 4-HPR was not cytotoxic nor did it elicit ceramide formation in K562, a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line; however, K562 cells were sensitive to a cell-deliverable form of ceramide, C6-ceramide. Treatment of Molt-3, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, with 4-HPR revealed moderate ceramide production (5-fold over control), robust conversion of ceramide to GC and sphingomyelin, and resistance to 4-HPR and C6-ceramide. In conclusion, this work demonstrates diversity within and among leukemia in 4-HPR sensitivity and ceramide generation and subsequent metabolism. As such, knowledge of these metabolic pathways can provide guidance for enhancing ceramide-driven effects of 4-HPR in treatment of leukemia.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, East Carolina University, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Greenville, NC 27834, USA; Affiliated with Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena 83523, Egypt.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, East Carolina University, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Greenville, NC 27834, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0716, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0716, USA; Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0716, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, East Carolina University, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Greenville, NC 27834, USA.

In the present study, we have evaluated the sensitivity of different hematological malignancies to Saq-NO. Saq-NO efficiently diminished the viability of Jurkat, Raji, HL-60 and K562 cells. While Jurkat and Raji cells (established from pediatric patients) displayed abrogated proliferative potential, HL-60 and K652 cells (originated from adults) exposed to Saq-NO treatment underwent caspase dependent apoptosis. In addition, similar sensitivity to Saq-NO was observed in mononuclear blood cells obtained from pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Western blot analysis indicated p70S6 kinase as a possible intracellular target of Saq-NO action. Moreover, the addition of a NO moiety to Lopinavir resulted in improved antitumor potential as compared to the parental compound, suggesting that NO-derived HIV protease inhibitors are a potential new source of anticancer drugs with unique mode of action.","['Department of Immunology, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic"", Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic"", Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic"", Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Clinical Center ""Dr Dragisa Misovic"", Medical Faculty, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute for Health Care of Mother and Child of Serbia ""Dr Vukan Cupic"", Medical Faculty, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Clinical Center ""Dr Dragisa Misovic"", Medical Faculty, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic"", Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic"", Belgrade University, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.

In particular, AML following myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, AML-MRC) has a poor prognosis. We hypothesized that patients with cytopenias prior to AML, but no known prior MDS, may share biologic features with AML-MRC. We evaluated 140 AML patients without prior MDS who had complete blood count (CBC) data available 6-36 months prior to their diagnosis. Cytopenia, defined as clinically unexplained thrombocytopenia or macrocytic anemia, was present in 29/140 (21%) patients. Compared to non-cytopenic patients, AML patients with prior cytopenia were older and more often met morphologic or cytogenetic criteria for AML-MRC. Prior cytopenia was associated with shorter survival in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics (median OS 4.2 versus 24.1 months, p<0.0001), but not in patients with adverse-risk cytogenetics (median OS 4.4 versus 6.0 months, p=0.57). Prior thrombocytopenia, but not macrocytic anemia, was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (p=0.01) independent of treatment approach, karyotype risk, and age on multivariable analysis. Our data suggest that AML patients with prior cytopenias have features similar to AML-MRC, and in particular support the use of prior unexplained thrombocytopenia as an independent marker of high-risk disease.","['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, United States.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, United States."", 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, United States.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, United States.

Epub 2015 Jul 29.,"INTRODUCTION: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was a standard therapy in chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). As a result of the effective therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), HCT was shifted to defined clinical situations. We present the results of observational prospective analysis of 28 CML patients undergoing HCT after exposure to, at least, two lines of TKI (including dasatinib and/or nilotinib), with respect to response, overall survival (OS), treatment toxicity, graft versus host disease (GVHD), and progression/relapse incidence. RESULTS: All the patients but one engrafted with median time 19 days. OS for patients in CP1 and CP2/accelerated phase (AcP) were 92.9 and 85.7 %, respectively. Six patients allotransplanted in blast crisis (BC) CML died early after HCT. Eighteen patients achieved deep molecular remission (MR(4.5) or MR(4.0)). Relapse incidence was 29.6 %. Median time to progression (TTP) differs significantly depending on the CML phase prior to HCT, the best response achieved after HCT and development of chronic GvHD. NRM yielded the values 7.1, 12.5, and 50 % in CP1, CP2/AcP, and BC, respectively. Fatal outcome, due to veno-occlusive disease (VOD), was observed in two (7 %) patients. In five (17.9 %) patients, mild or moderate VOD was observed with no negative impact of preceding therapy with TKI2. Acute GvHD was diagnosed in 25.9 % of patients, while chronic GvHD developed in 42.9 % of individuals. CONCLUSION: Pretransplantation therapy with TKI2 in CP CML is safe and reasonable.

Epub 2015 Jun 26.,"BACKGROUND: The t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation results in the expression of the fusion protein NPM/ALK that when expressed in T-lymphocytes gives rise to anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL). In search of new therapy options the dichloromethane extract of the ethnomedicinal plant Neurolaena lobata (L.) R.Br. ex Cass was shown to inhibit NPM/ALK expression. PURPOSE: Therefore, we analysed whether the active principles that were recently isolated and found to inhibit inflammatory responses specifically inhibit growth of NPM/ALK+ ALCL, leukaemia and breast cancer cells, but not of normal cells, and the intravasation through the lymphendothelial barrier. METHODS: ALCL, leukaemia and breast cancer cells, and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were treated with isolated sesquiterpene lactones and analysed for cell cycle progression, proliferation, mitochondrial activity, apoptosis, protein and mRNA expression, NF-kappaB and cytochrome P450 activity, 12(S)-HETE production and lymphendothelial intravasation. RESULTS: In vitro treatment of ALCL by neurolenin B suppressed NPM/ALK, JunB and PDGF-Rbeta expression, inhibited the growth of ALCL cells late in M phase, and induced apoptosis via caspase 3 without compromising mitochondrial activity (as a measure of general exogenic toxicity). Moreover, neurolenin B attenuated tumour spheroid intravasation probably through inhibition of NF-kappaB and CYP1A1. CONCLUSION: Neurolenin B specifically decreased pro-carcinogenic NPM/ALK expression in ALK+ ALCL cells and, via the inhibition of NF-kB signalling, attenuated tumour intra/extravasation into the lymphatics. Hence, neurolenin B may open new options to treat ALCL and to manage early metastatic processes to which no other therapies exist.","['Institute of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Strasse 10, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.

Epub 2015 Jul 26.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common adult acute leukemia. Despite treatment, the majority of the AML patients relapse within 5 years. In silico analysis of several available databases of AML patients showed that the expression of adenylate cyclase 7 (ADCY7) significantly inversely correlates with the overall survival of AML patients. To determine whether ADCY7 supports AML development, we employed an shRNA-encoding lentivirus system to inhibit adcy7 expression in human AML cells including U937, MV4-11, and THP-1 cells. The ADCY7 deficiency resulted in decreased cell growth, elevated apoptosis, and lower c-Myc expression of these leukemia cells. This indicates that G protein-coupled receptor signaling contributes to AML pathogenesis. Our study suggests that inhibition of ADCY7 may be novel strategy for treating leukemia.","['Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China; Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA; Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA; Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA; Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, Shandong 264003, China.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA; Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.

Epub 2015 Jul 29.,"The degree of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) binding to myosin-exposed apoptotic cells (MEACs) correlates with worse patient outcomes, suggesting a link to disease activity. Therefore, we studied MEAC formation and the effects of MEAC binding on CLL cells. In cell line studies, both intrinsic (spontaneous or camptothecin-induced) and extrinsic (FasL- or anti-Fas-induced) apoptosis created a high percent of MEACs over time in a process associated with caspase-3 activation, leading to cytoplasmic myosin cleavage and trafficking to cell membranes. The involvement of common apoptosis pathways suggests that most cells can produce MEACs and indeed CLL cells themselves form MEACs. Consistent with the idea that MEAC formation may be a signal to remove dying cells, we found that natural IgM antibodies bind to MEACs. Functionally, co-culture of MEACs with CLL cells, regardless of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene mutation status, improved leukemic cell viability. Based on inhibitor studies, this improved viability involved BCR signaling molecules.

We screened samples from 145 patients treated on the MRC UKALL2003 trial for PTEN mutations using heteroduplex analysis and gene deletions using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and related genotype to response to therapy and long-term outcome. PTEN loss-of-function mutations/gene deletions were detected in 22% (PTEN(ABN)). Quantification of mutant level indicated that 67% of mutated cases harbored more than one mutant, with up to four mutants detected, consistent with the presence of multiple leukemic sub-clones. Overall, 41% of PTEN(ABN) cases were considered to have biallelic abnormalities (mutation and/or deletion) with complete loss of PTEN in a proportion of cells. In addition, 9% of cases had N- or K-RAS mutations. Neither PTEN nor RAS genotype significantly impacted on response to therapy or long-term outcome, irrespective of mutant level, and there was no evidence that they changed the highly favorable outcome of patients with double NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations. These results indicate that, for pediatric patients treated according to current protocols, routine screening for PTEN or RAS abnormalities at diagnosis is not warranted to further refine risk stratification.","['Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK & UCL Cancer Trials Centre, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.', ""Department of Haematology, Sheffield Children's Hospital, Sheffield, UK."", 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.']","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",PMC4705426,,,"['leu2015206 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.206 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.206 [doi],20150729,"['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'Department of Health/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study was aimed to determine whether there were conditions under which the addition of imperatorin would reverse the resistance of HCC cells to cisplatin-based therapy. In this study, we found that addition of imperatorin significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin to HCC cells. Since the Mcl-1 was overexpressed in HCC cell lines (HepG2, HepG3B, PLC, Huh7) compared with normal liver cell line (L-O2), we found that the Mcl-1 expression was downregulated by imperatorin but not influenced by cisplatin in HCC cells. In addition, our results showed the combination of imperatorin and cisplatin induced apoptosis and Psim collapse more significantly compared with treatment of imperatorin or cisplatin alone. Furthermore, the imperatorin-induced sensitization for cisplatin-cytotoxicity to HCC cells was abolished by the transfection of Mcl-1 expression plasmid. Finally, we found that the addition of imperatorin significantly reversed the resistance to cisplatin in cisplatin-resistant HCC cells, which was Mcl-1 dependent. In summary, our study revealed that combination with imperatorin could enhance the antitumor activity of cisplatin via targeting Mcl-1 and reverse the resistance to cisplatin in HCC.","[""Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, West College Road No.109, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China 325027."", ""Department of Gastroenterology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, West College Road No.109, Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, 325027."", ""Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, West College Road No.109, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China 325027."", ""Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, West College Road No.109, Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, 325027."", ""Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, West College Road No.109, Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, 325027."", ""Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, West College Road No.109, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China 325027."", ""Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, West College Road No.109, Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, 325027."", 'Department of Infectious Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, FuXue lane No.2, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China 325000. wzzhenzhenpan@126.com.', ""Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, West College Road No.109, Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, 325027. wenzhouchenweipan@126.com.""]","['0 (Furocoumarins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'K713N25C78 (imperatorin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cisplatin', 'HCC', 'Imperatorin', 'Mcl-1']","['10.1007/s13277-015-3591-z [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-3591-z [pii]']",10.1007/s13277-015-3591-z [doi],20150729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emergency endoscopic sinus surgery and intra- and extra-ocular orbital decompression were performed. The sinusitis resolved after surgery and intravenous antibiotics. Her vision improved within 24 hours and eventually recovered completely after six months. Her CLL remained in an indolent state, needing no active treatment.

This study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy and select subpopulations most sensitive to the regimen in Chinese B-iNHL patients. METHODS: 334 B-iNHL patients from our center were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS: Patients received R-based chemoimmunotherapy showed significantly higher rates of overall response (OR) (93.0% vs. 53.4%, P < 0.001) and complete response (CR) (63.3% vs. 16.0%, P < 0.001) compared with the patients received other therapies. Survival analysis showed that rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy could obviously improve the progression-free survival (PFS) (110 vs. 49 months, P = 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (120 vs. 72 months, P < 0.001) in patients with B-iNHLs. Interestingly, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, we found that the patients with beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG) < 3.5 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) < 220 U/L, zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70) negative, and non high-risk genetic abnormality could achieve more benefits from R-based regimens with higher CR rate (P = 0.003, 0.029, 0.013 and 0.038, respectively). Meanwhile, more CLL patients achieved minimal residual disease (MRD) negative after rituximab-based treatment (46.5% vs. 10.3%, P < 0.001). Moreover, CLL patients with MRD < 1%, LDH < 220 U/L, complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR), beta2-MG < 3.5 mg/L and non high-risk cytogenetic abnormality showed superior outcome compared to the controls (P = 0.001, 0.000, 0.000, 0.001 and 0.013, respectively). No other side-effects increased in chemoimmunotherapy group except the elevation of grade 3-4 neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the superior efficacy of rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy as an initial therapy in Chinese cohort with newly diagnosed B-iNHLs and further identify subpopulations that are more sensitive to R-based chemoimmunotherapy in CLL group.","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China. zengjunli@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China. yx021021@sina.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, NanChang, 330006, China. yx021021@sina.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China. shuhuayilove@163.com.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, 52246, USA. zhimingoo@gmail.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China. yuyuzhen2003@yahoo.com.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China. yanzi_zjyl@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China. fxy308@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China. benrun@sina.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China. zoudehui72@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China. qi_jy@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, 52246, USA. fenghuang-zhan@uiowa.edu.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China. drqiu99@medmail.com.cn.', 'Umbilical Cord Blood Bank of Tianjin, Tianjin, 300020, China. drqiu99@medmail.com.cn.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (R-CHOP protocol)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'R-FCM protocol']",PMC4517647,,,"['10.1186/s12885-015-1534-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-015-1534-0 [pii]']",10.1186/s12885-015-1534-0 [doi],20150729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, changes in phenotype and function of T cells have been described in various hematologic malignancies, mimicking T cell exhaustion known from chronic viral infections. Detailed knowledge about phenotype and function of T cells in AML patients at different stages of the disease is indispensable for optimal development and application of immunotherapeutic strategies for this disease. METHODS: We used flow cytometry-based assays to characterize T cell phenotype and function in peripheral blood and bone marrow of AML patients at diagnosis, at relapse after intensive chemotherapy, and at relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Surface expression of CD244, PD-1, CD160, and TIM-3 was determined, and proliferation and production of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2 were measured. RESULTS: We detected similar expression of inhibitory molecules on T cells from patients at diagnosis and from age-matched healthy controls. At relapse after SCT, however, PD-1 expression was significantly increased compared to diagnosis, both on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. This pattern was not associated with age and cytomegalovirus (CMV) status but with a shift towards effector memory cells in relapsed AML patients. Proliferation and cytokine production assays did not reveal functional defects in T cells of AML patients, neither at diagnosis nor at relapse. CONCLUSION: We thus conclude that T cell exhaustion does not play a major role in AML. Immunotherapeutic strategies targeting autologous T cells thus have particularly good prospects in the setting of AML.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany. frauke.schnorfeil@helmholtz-muenchen.de.', 'Clinical Cooperation Group Immunotherapy, Helmholtz Institute Munich, Munich, Germany. frauke.schnorfeil@helmholtz-muenchen.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany. felix.lichtenegger@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Clinical Cooperation Group Immunotherapy, Helmholtz Institute Munich, Munich, Germany. felix.lichtenegger@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Internal Medicine IV, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany. felix.lichtenegger@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany. kathi_emmerig@gmx.de.', 'Clinical Cooperation Group Immunotherapy, Helmholtz Institute Munich, Munich, Germany. kathi_emmerig@gmx.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany. miriam-schlueter@gmx.de.', 'Clinical Cooperation Group Immunotherapy, Helmholtz Institute Munich, Munich, Germany. miriam-schlueter@gmx.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany. julia.s.neitz@gmail.com.', 'Clinical Cooperation Group Immunotherapy, Helmholtz Institute Munich, Munich, Germany. julia.s.neitz@gmail.com.', 'Division of Clinical Infectiology, Department of Internal Medicine IV, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany. rika.draenert@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany. wolfgang.hiddemann@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Clinical Cooperation Group Pathogenesis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Helmholtz Institute Munich, Munich, Germany. wolfgang.hiddemann@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany. marion.subklewe@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Clinical Cooperation Group Immunotherapy, Helmholtz Institute Munich, Munich, Germany. marion.subklewe@med.uni-muenchen.de.']",['0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)'],PMC4518596,,,"['10.1186/s13045-015-0189-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-015-0189-2 [pii]']",10.1186/s13045-015-0189-2 [doi],20150730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that cyclin E/Cdk2 phosphorylates and stabilizes the pro-survival Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1, a key cell death resistance determinant to the small molecule Bcl-2 family inhibitors ABT-199 and ABT-737, mimetics of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3). Cyclin E levels were elevated and there was increased association of cyclin E/Cdk2 with Mcl-1 in ABT-737-resistant compared to parental cells. Cyclin E depletion in various human tumor cell-lines and cyclin E-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts showed decreased levels of Mcl-1 protein, with no change in Mcl-1 mRNA levels. In the absence of cyclin E, Mcl-1 ubiquitination was enhanced, leading to decreased protein stability. Studies with Mcl-1 phosphorylation mutants show that cyclin E/Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of Mcl-1 residues on its PEST domain resulted in increased Mcl-1 stability (Thr92, and Thr163) and Bim binding (Ser64). Cyclin E knock-down restored ABT-737 sensitivity to acquired and inherently resistant Mcl-1-dependent tumor cells. CDK inhibition by dinaciclib resulted in Bim release from Mcl-1 in ABT-737-resistant cells. Dinaciclib in combination with ABT-737 and ABT-199 resulted in robust synergistic cell death in leukemic cells and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient samples. Collectively, our findings identify a novel mechanism of cyclin E-mediated Mcl-1 regulation that provides a rationale for clinical use of Bcl-2 family and Cdk inhibitors for Mcl-1-dependent tumors.","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Cardiology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.']","['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",PMC4627281,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-199', 'CLL', 'Cdk2', 'Mcl-1', 'cyclin E', 'dinaciclib ABT-737']","['4857 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4857 [doi]']",,,"['R01 CA127264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA184137/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA127264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 28.,"Ikaros (IKZF1) is a tumor suppressor that binds DNA and regulates expression of its target genes. The mechanism of Ikaros activity as a tumor suppressor and the regulation of Ikaros function in leukemia are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Ikaros controls cellular proliferation by repressing expression of genes that promote cell cycle progression and the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway. We show that Ikaros function is impaired by the pro-oncogenic casein kinase II (CK2), and that CK2 is overexpressed in leukemia. CK2 inhibition restores Ikaros function as transcriptional repressor of cell cycle and PI3K pathway genes, resulting in an antileukemia effect. In high-risk leukemia where one IKZF1 allele has been deleted, CK2 inhibition restores the transcriptional repressor function of the remaining wild-type IKZF1 allele. CK2 inhibition demonstrated a potent therapeutic effect in a panel of patient-derived primary high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts as indicated by prolonged survival and a reduction of leukemia burden. We demonstrate the efficacy of a novel therapeutic approach for high-risk leukemia: restoration of Ikaros tumor suppressor activity via inhibition of CK2.

We herein demonstrated that the hematopoietic-specific deletion of Ezh2 in mice induced heterogeneous hematopoietic malignancies. Myelodysplasia was detected in mice following the deletion of Ezh2, and resulted in the development of MDS and MDS/MPN. Thrombocytosis was induced by Ezh2 loss and sustained in some mice with myelodysplasia. Although less frequent, Ezh2 loss also induced T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the clonal expansion of B-1a B cells. Gene expression profiling showed that PRC2 target genes were derepressed upon the deletion of Ezh2 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, but were largely repressed during the development of MDS and MDS/MPN. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequence analysis of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) revealed a compensatory function of Ezh1, another enzymatic component of PRC2, in this process. The deletion of Ezh1 alone did not cause dysplasia or any hematologic malignancies in mice, but abolished the repopulating capacity of hematopoietic stem cells when combined with Ezh2 loss. These results clearly demonstrated an essential role of Ezh1 in the pathogenesis of hematopoietic malignancies induced by Ezh2 insufficiency, and highlighted the differential functions of Ezh1 and Ezh2 in hematopoiesis.","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan;', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; and.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan; College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;']","['EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",,,,"['S0006-4971(20)30952-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-03-634428 [doi]']",10.1182/blood-2015-03-634428 [doi],20150728,,,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 70% of RCCs are clear-cell type (ccRCC), and in >80% the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is mutated or silenced. We developed a novel, high-content, screening strategy for the identification of small molecules that are synthetic lethal with genes mutated in cancer. In this strategy, the screen and counterscreen are conducted simultaneously by differentially labeling mutant and reconstituted isogenic tumor cell line pairs with different fluorochromes and using a highly sensitive high-throughput imaging-based platform. This approach minimizes confounding factors from sequential screening, and more accurately replicates the in vivo cancer setting where cancer cells are adjacent to normal cells. A screen of ~12,800 small molecules identified homoharringtonine (HHT), an FDA-approved drug for treating chronic myeloid leukemia, as a VHL-synthetic lethal agent in ccRCC. HHT induced apoptosis in VHL-mutant, but not VHL-reconstituted, ccRCC cells, and inhibited tumor growth in 30% of VHL-mutant patient-derived ccRCC tumorgraft lines tested. Building on a novel screening strategy and utilizing a validated RCC tumorgraft model recapitulating the genetics and drug responsiveness of human RCC, these studies identify HHT as a potential therapeutic agent for a subset of VHL-deficient ccRCCs.","['Kidney Cancer Program, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology-Oncology Division, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Kidney Cancer Program, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology-Oncology Division, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Kidney Cancer Program, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology-Oncology Division, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Kidney Cancer Program, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology-Oncology Division, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA.', 'Kidney Cancer Program, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Kidney Cancer Program, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Kidney Cancer Program, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Kidney Cancer Program, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Kidney Cancer Program, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Kidney Cancer Program, Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology-Oncology Division, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (VHL protein, human)']",PMC4627284,['NOTNLM'],"['high-content drug screen', 'omacetaxine mepesuccinate', 'patiend-derived xenografts', 'tumorgrafts']","['4773 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4773 [doi]']",,,['P30 CA142543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 28.,"BACKGROUND: Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) result in durable responses in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Previous reports have suggested that in patients with relapsed CLL, a dose-intensified rituximab regimen increases response rates in comparison with standard-dose rituximab. It is unknown whether rituximab intensification of the FCR regimen will result in improved response rates and patient outcomes in patients with previously untreated CLL. METHODS: A single-arm study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a modified FCR regimen with multiple-dose rituximab (FCR3) in 65 patients with previously untreated CLL. The results were compared with those for a historical cohort treated with FCR. RESULTS: The overall response rate to FCR3 was 97%, with 75% of the patients achieving a complete remission. Minimal residual disease negativity was achieved for 62% of the patients according to flow cytometry. The median time to progression (TTP) was 81 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was not reached, with 58% of the patients still alive at a median survivor follow-up of 9.7 years. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, and major infections were observed with 45%, 5%, and 1.9% of the FCR3 courses, respectively. Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) or therapy-related acute myelogenous leukemia (t-AML) developed in 7 patients (11%; P < .01 vs the historical FCR cohort). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with previously untreated CLL, FCR3 resulted in response rates, TTP, and OS similar to those of a historical cohort of patients treated with FCR. FCR3 was associated with an increased incidence of t-MDS/t-AML.","['Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Leukemia, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California Irvine, Orange, California.']","['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",PMC4824541,['NOTNLM'],"['and rituximab (FCR)', 'chemoimmunotherapy', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'cyclophosphamide', 'fludarabine', 'rituximab', 'therapy-related acute myelogenous leukemia', 'therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome']",['10.1002/cncr.29605 [doi]'],10.1002/cncr.29605 [doi],20150728,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS773425'],['(c) 2015 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we investigated whether the expressions of HO-1 mRNA and protein were associated with AML chemoresistance. METHODS: Bone marrow or peripheral blood was obtained from newly diagnosed (n = 26), relapsed (n = 10), and completely remitted (n = 18) patients with AML (M3 exclusion) and healthy donors (n = 10). Small interfering RNA was used to stably silence HO-1 gene expression in AML cell lines. The expressions of HO-1, hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) mRNA and proteins were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis induction was analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The drug-resistant AML cell line HL-60R was significantly less sensitive to cytarabine and daunorubicin than HL-60 cells. HO-1 mRNA and proteins were highly expressed in HL-60R cells. However, down-regulating HO-1 significantly enhanced the sensitivity of HL-60R to chemotherapy, and the expressions of HIF-1a and GLUT1 mRNA and proteins decreased. Meanwhile, the expressions of caspase-3 and caspase-8 proteins increased, while that of bcl-2 decreased. Overexpressions of HO-1, HIF-1a, and GLUT1 were associated with poor response of AML to chemotherapy.

Our study demonstrates that dual drug loaded nanoparticles work in a synergistic manner, lowering the dose and confirming that both drugs reach the target cell specifically, maximizing the cytotoxicity while minimizing the chances of cell resistance to any one drug.","['Institute Nanoscience CNR (NNL, CNR-NANO) via Arnesano, Lecce, Italy. ilariaelena.palama@nano.cnr.it.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biodegradable Plastics)', '0 (Hypolipidemic Agents)', '0 (Polyelectrolytes)', '0 (Polymers)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,['10.1039/c4bm00289j [doi]'],10.1039/c4bm00289j [doi],20140926,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we evaluated the outcome of 56 high-risk MDS patients who were treated with 5-AZA between 2005 and 2013. 5-AZA was administered in an outpatient basis at a dose 75 mg/m(2) s.c. with the following schedule: 5 days on/weekend off/2 days on (5/2/2). RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR) was 50%; 21.2% patients achieved complete response (CR), 3.8% partial response (PR), and 25% hematologic improvement (HI); 34.6% had stable disease (SD) and 15.4% showed progressive disease (PD). The estimated median event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 11 and 17 months, respectively. Interestingly, the estimated time to acute myeloid leukemia transformation was 30 months, which refers to patients who responded to AZA treatment or remained stable. Patients who responded to the 5-AZA achieving CR, PR, and HI had better EFS and OS compared to the patients who had SD or PD. In addition, Delta WHO Classification-based Prognostic Score System (DeltaWPSS), which represents the improvement of WPSS risk group before and after treatment, was associated with significantly improved OS and better EFS. Finally, the response to treatment was not associated with the expression of p53. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, 5-AZA is an effective treatment for high-risk MDS. Improved OS and EFS were found mainly in patients who responded to the treatment while DeltaWPSS seems to represent a promising future prognostic tool.",,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['5-Azacytidine', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)', ""'Real world' data""]",['10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000039 [doi]'],10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000039 [doi],20150728,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the specific effects of an HPC line transduced with Bcr-Abl, KOBA, on BM-derived OP9 stroma cells. DNA microarray analysis revealed that OP9 cells co-cultured with KOBA cells (OP9/L) show diverse changes in the gene expression. OP9/L cells showed significant down-regulation of Cdkn genes and up-regulation of Icam1, leading to the increased proliferation capacity of OP9 cells and enhanced transmigration of leukemia cells through them. The effects were attributed to direct Notch activation of OP9 cells by KOBA cells. OP9/L cells also showed a markedly altered cytokine gene expression pattern, including a robust increase in a variety of proinflammatory genes and a decrease in hematopoietic cytokines such as Cxcl12, Scf, and Angpt1. Consequently, OP9/L cells promoted the proliferation of KOBA cells more efficiently than parental OP9 cells, whereas the activity supporting normal myelopoiesis was attenuated. In mice bearing KOBA leukemia, the characteristic genetic changes observed in OP9/L cells were reflected differentially in the endothelial cells (ECs) and mesenchymal stroma cells (MCs) of the BM. The ECs were markedly increased with Notch-target gene activation and decreased Cdkn expression, whereas the MCs showed a marked increase in proinflammatory gene expression and a profound decrease in hematopoietic genes. Human CML cell lines also induced essentially similar genetic changes in OP9 cells. Our results suggest that CML cells remodel the hematopoietic microenvironment by changing the gene expression patterns differentially in ECs and MCs of BM.","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']","['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sipa1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC4517910,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0134026 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-08912 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0134026 [doi],20150728,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 28.,"The incidence of HIV-related lymphomas (HRLs) is increased by 60-100 times in patients with HIV. When compared to the general population, patients with HRLs often present with extranodal lymphoid proliferation, most frequently of the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, liver and bone marrow. MicroRNAs (miRs) are non-coding double-stranded RNA molecules of 18-25 nucleotides that regulate post-translational gene expression by inhibiting translation or promoting degradation of messenger RNA complementary sequences. Before their discovery, tumorigenesis was thought to have been caused by the alteration of protein-coding oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, but once identified in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, miRs function as either oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes was confirmed in different types of malignancies. Since miRs are clearly involved in tumorigenesis in many cancers, their role in HRLs is now receiving attention. A few studies have been conducted thus far in some HRLs on the involvement of miR in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies. Since B-cell lymphomas arise from various stages of B-cell development in both HIV-infected and HIV-naive patients, investigators have tried to determine the different miR signatures in B-cell development. As classic immunohistochemistry staining is sometimes not enough for the differential diagnosis of HRLs, in the present review, we have described the potential use of miRs in the prognosis and diagnosis of these diseases.","['a Division of Hematopathology , Tygerberg Academic Hospital , Tygerberg , South Africa .']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['HIV-associated lymphoma', 'microRNA']",['10.3109/10408363.2015.1030063 [doi]'],10.3109/10408363.2015.1030063 [doi],20150728,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 28.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may lead to previously unrecognized adverse events. This study evaluated the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in chronic-phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. METHODS: Four hundred sixty-eight newly diagnosed CP CML patients treated with TKIs were analyzed. The molecular and cytogenetic response data, creatinine, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were followed from the start of therapy to the last follow-up (median, 52 months). GFR was estimated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (4%) had TKI-associated AKI. Imatinib was associated with a higher incidence of AKI in comparison with dasatinib and nilotinib (P = .014). Fifty-eight patients (14%) developed CKD while they were receiving a TKI; 49 of these patients (84%) did so while they were being treated with imatinib (P < .001). Besides imatinib, age, a history of hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were also associated with the development of CKD. In patients with no CKD at the baseline, imatinib was shown to reduce GFR over time. Interestingly, imatinib did not cause a significant decline in the GFRs of patients with a history of CKD. Imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib increased the mean GFR after 3 months of treatment, and nilotinib led with the most significant increase (P < .001). AKI or CKD had no significant impact on overall cytogenetic and molecular response rates or survival. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of TKIs may be safe in the setting of CKD in CP CML patients, but close monitoring is still warranted.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Nephrology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']","['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",PMC4519988,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'dasatinib', 'glomerular filtration rate changes', 'imatinib', 'kidney injury', 'nilotinib', 'outcome', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",['10.1002/cncr.29587 [doi]'],10.1002/cncr.29587 [doi],20150728,"['P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS706333'],['(c) 2015 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that using the combined activity of the monoclonal antibody anti-CD20 (rituximab) and Listeria monocytogenes toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) for this condition could produce an enhanced treatment effect. Here, we tested the effect of the joint activity of rituximab and LLO, which is a cell membrane toxin, in human leukemia cell lines. The human B-leukemia Raji cell line, which expresses CD20, and the T-cell Jurkat cell line, which does not express CD20, for comparison were used in model tests. Cell cytotoxicity of rituximab or LLO and both applied jointly to the cell lines was compared in the presence of human plasma complement. Optimal cytotoxic effects dependent on rituximab or LLO concentration were tested separately. LD50 values were determined and used for optimal application of a mixture of the two factors. The cytotoxic effect on Raji cells of both rituximab and LLO was more than 2.5 times that of LLO alone and 1.5 times that of rituximab alone. At the highest tested concentrations, a mixture of the tested factors had a non-specific cytotoxic effect on the Jurkat cell line, as well. The rituximab and LLO binding sites appear to be in a similar region of the Raji leukemia cell membrane, suggesting an effective interaction of both factors. The joint interaction of these compounds in cell membrane pore formation suggests an explanation for the more effective cytotoxic activity that their combination was observed in this experiment.","['Laboratory of Cytometry, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Cytometry, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Cytometry, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Cytometry, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Applied Microbiology, Institute of Microbiology, Faculty of Biology, Warsaw University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Applied Microbiology, Institute of Microbiology, Faculty of Biology, Warsaw University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Cytometry, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland Department of Clinical Cytology, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland ghoser@cmkp.edu.pl.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hemolysin Proteins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'R06ZRQ1YX9 (hlyA protein, Listeria monocytogenes)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['cytotoxicity', 'flow cytometry', 'human plasma', 'leukemia', 'listeriolysin O', 'rituximab']","['0394632015595778 [pii]', '10.1177/0394632015595778 [doi]']",10.1177/0394632015595778 [doi],20150727,,,['(c) The Author(s) 2015.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This might cause misdiagnosis and thereby lead to prolonged diagnostic delay. The present study aimed to identify children with ALL with joint involvement and to compare their characteristics and outcome with children with ALL without joint involvement. METHODS: Case records of 286 children diagnosed with ALL between 1992 and 2013 were reviewed and analysed in this retrospective, descriptive study. RESULTS: Fifty-three (18.5%) children with ALL presented with localised joint pain, and half of them had objective signs of arthritis. The mean number of joints involved was 2.5, most frequently presenting as asymmetric oligoarthritis. The suspected misdiagnosis were reactive arthritis (19/53), osteomyelitis (9/53) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (8/53). Children with joint involvement had less objective signs of haematological disease. Cytopenia was absent in 24% in children with joint involvement (vs 8% without, p=0.001), 50% had only one cell line affected (vs 21%, p=0.0005) and 44% had no organomegaly (vs 29%, p=0.05). Median diagnostic delay was 4 vs 2 weeks. The 5-year event-free and overall survival was superior for children with joint involvement: 94% vs 87% (p=0.049), and 96% vs 83% (p=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: ALL with joint involvement is a frequent finding (18.5%). The clinical signs of leukaemia are less prominent, but non-articular pain should alert the clinician of a possible diagnosis of leukaemia. The overall and event-free survivals were superior compared with the children without joint involvement.","['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Haematology', 'Musculo-Skeletal', 'Oncology', 'Pain', 'Rheumatology']","['archdischild-2014-307751 [pii]', '10.1136/archdischild-2014-307751 [doi]']",10.1136/archdischild-2014-307751 [doi],20150727,,,"['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Epub 2015 Jul 28.,"The JAK-STAT pathway has a substantial role in lymphoid precursor cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Nonetheless, the contribution of JAK2 to T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) development remains poorly understood. We have identified one activating TEL-JAK2 translocation and four missense mutations accumulated in 2 out of 16 T-LBL samples. Two of them are novel JAK2 mutations and the other two are reported for the first time in T-LBL. Notably, R683G and I682T might have arisen owing to RNA editing. Mutated samples showed different mutated transcripts suggesting sub-clonal heterogeneity. Functional approaches revealed that two JAK2 mutations (H574R and R683G) constitutively activate JAK-STAT signaling in gamma2A cells and can drive the proliferation of BaF3-EpoR cytokine-dependent cell line. In addition, aberrant hypermethylation of SOCS3 might contribute to enhance the activation of JAK-STAT signaling. Of utmost interest is that primary T-LBL samples harboring JAK2 mutations exhibited increased expression of LMO2, suggesting a mechanistic link between JAK2 mutations and the expression of LMO2, which was confirmed for the four missense mutations in transfected gamma2A cells. We therefore propose that active JAK2 contribute to T-LBL development by two different mechanisms, and that the use of pan-JAK inhibitors in combination with epigenetic drugs should be considered in future treatments.","['Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas- Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas- Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas- Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biomedicas en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas- Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biomedicas en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas- Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biomedicas en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Valencia, Spain.', 'IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biomedicas en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Valencia, Spain.', 'IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas- Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Fundacion IFIMAV, Santander, Spain.', 'Unidad de Epidemiologia Ambiental y Cancer, Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Consorcio de Investigacion Biomedica de Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS Puerta de Hierro, Majadahonda, Spain.', 'Unidad de Epigenetica del Cancer, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA-CSIC), Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA), Oviedo, Spain.', 'Unidad de Epigenetica del Cancer, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias (IUOPA-CSIC), Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA), Oviedo, Spain.', 'Departamento de Inmunologia y Oncologia, Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia (CNB), Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas- Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biomedicas en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO), Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas- Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (CSIC-UAM), Madrid, Spain.', 'IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biomedicas en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Valencia, Spain.']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",PMC4705429,,,"['leu2015202 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.202 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.202 [doi],20150728,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is an important cytokine that stimulates oligodendrocyte proliferation and survival in vitro. Opalin is a unique molecular marker for mature oligodendrocytes. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the role of LIF on Opalin and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) expression in the cerebral cortex of cuprizone-induced MS mice. The mice were treated with cuprizone for five weeks in order to induce MS. The mice were then divided into 3 groups. The first group was injected intraperitoneally (IP) with LIF for six weeks in the amount of 30 microg/kg bw per day. The second group (SHAM) was injected IP with normal saline and the third group was left without injection as a control. After six weeks the mice were killed, the cerebral cortex was harvested, and the expression of MOG and Opalin was studied. Using western blotting we found that LIF increases Opalin and MOG expression in the cerebral cortex extracts as compared to SHAM and control groups. However, no significant difference in the Opalin and MOG expression was seen between SHAM and control groups. It is concluded that LIF may have an important role in the process of remyelination by increasing Opalin expression and MOG expression.","['Professor Farhad Mashayekhi, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran, phone: 0098-9113330017, fax: 0098-131-3233647, e-mail: umistbiology@yahoo.co.uk.']","['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Mog protein, mouse)', '0 (Myelin Proteins)', '0 (Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein)', '0 (Opalin protein, mouse)', '5N16U7E0AO (Cuprizone)']",,,,"['25338 [pii]', '10.5114/fn.2015.52411 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 27.,"In survival analysis, the absolute measure of cumulative risk provided by the Kaplan-Meier estimator is still the most used quantity for its easy calculation and direct interpretability. However, for describing the survival after an intervention that may occur at different times from baseline observation, the Kaplan-Meier estimator generally yields to biased results if intervention is considered as fixed at baseline. The main focus of the present paper is to extend the use of a multiple timescale model in the presence of a time dependent intervention. The aim is to obtain 1) an estimate of treatment effect in terms of hazard ratios by flexible modeling, 2) a valid prediction tool, i.e. estimate of prognosis for a patient who changes treatment later in time, and 3) an appropriate graphical representation of survival in the presence of a time dependent treatment change, accounting for different timescales. We will show the advantages of this approach on the comparison of chemotherapy versus transplant in children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission. We considered a model with two timescales that accounts for the change in treatment at different times in the disease course. An alternative approach to survival estimates is also proposed which has some advantages over the traditional landmark approach: it uses all the data available to plot survival from the date of remission, it avoids the arbitrary choice of a landmark time and explicitly models the change in hazard due to transplant.","['Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, via Cadore 48, Monza, 20900, Italy.', 'Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, via Cadore 48, Monza, 20900, Italy.', 'Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, via Cadore 48, Monza, 20900, Italy.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['hazard', 'multiple timescales', 'piece-wise Poisson model.', 'survival', 'time-dependent treatment']",['10.1002/sim.6597 [doi]'],10.1002/sim.6597 [doi],20150727,,,"['Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Continuing efforts by collaborative clinical study groups in Europe, North America, and Japan have rescued approximately half of the MLL-r ALL patients with intensive chemotherapy with or without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Recent progress has clarified the unique mechanism of MLL-r ALL: the aberrant methylation and histone modifications via DOT1L and other related molecules by MLL fusion proteins lead to leukemogenetic gene expression, thus to overt leukemia. In order to overcome this dismal subtype of ALL, novel targeted therapy based on leukemia biology is urgently needed.

The pioneer factor PBX1 translates epigenetic cues and mediates estrogen induced ERalpha binding. Here we demonstrate that PBX1 plays a central role in regulating the ERalpha transcriptional response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling. PBX1 regulates a subset of EGF-ERalpha genes highly expressed in aggressive breast tumours. Retrospective stratification of luminal patients using PBX1 protein levels in primary cancer further demonstrates that elevated PBX1 protein levels correlate with earlier metastatic progression. In agreement, PBX1 protein levels are significantly upregulated during metastatic progression in ERalpha-positive breast cancer patients. Finally we reveal that PBX1 upregulation in aggressive tumours is partly mediated by genomic amplification of the PBX1 locus. Correspondingly, ERalpha-positive breast cancer patients carrying PBX1 amplification are characterized by poor survival. Notably, we demonstrate that PBX1 amplification can be identified in tumor derived-circulating free DNA of ERalpha-positive metastatic patients. Metastatic patients with PBX1 amplification are also characterized by shorter relapse-free survival. Our data identifies PBX1 amplification as a functional hallmark of aggressive ERalpha-positive breast cancers. Mechanistically, PBX1 amplification impinges on several critical pathways associated with aggressive ERalpha-positive breast cancer.","['Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Studies, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Studies, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Studies, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Studies, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Studies, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Laboratory of Medicine, Histopathology Department, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Budapest, HU.', 'Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Budapest, HU.', 'Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Budapest, HU.', 'Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Budapest, HU.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'MTA TTK Lendulet Cancer Biomarker Research Group, 2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University and MTA-SE Pediatrics and Nephrology Research Group, Budapest, HU.', 'The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, London, UK.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ESR1 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",PMC4673133,['NOTNLM'],"['breast cancer', 'drug resistance', 'estrogen receptor', 'metastasis', 'pioneer factors']","['4243 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4243 [doi]']",,,"['12011/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'BBS/B/03785/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', '103034/Z/13/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resultant recombinant L-asparaginases (EwA, YpA, HpA small i, Cyrillic RrA) exhibit reasonable cytotoxic action on the human leukemia cells comparable to the pharmacologically available L-asparaginase EcA and represent practical interest in respect to creation, on their basis, new effective antineoplastic remedies. Further prospects of researches on bacterial L-asparaginases are associated with development of analogs of Rhodospirillum rubrum L-asparaginase (RrA) by means of directed changes of the protein structure using genetic engineering, development of chito-PEGylation for receiving L-asparaginase preparations with improved pharmacokinetic characteristics.","['Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Moscow, Russia.', 'Centre ""Bioengineering"", Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Moscow, Russia.', 'Lomonosov Moscow State University, Chemical Faculty, Moscow, Russia.', 'Lomonosov Moscow State University, Chemical Faculty, Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Moscow, Russia.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['L-asparaginase', 'L-glutaminase', 'PEGylated L-asparaginase', 'chito-PEGylation', 'leukemia', 'recombinant proteins']",['10.18097/PBMC20156103312 [doi]'],10.18097/PBMC20156103312 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 27.,"Comprehensive clinical studies of patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) are lacking. We performed an international retrospective study on 490 patients (age </=18 years) with non-Down syndrome de novo AMKL diagnosed from 1989 to 2009. Patients with AMKL (median age 1.53 years) comprised 7.8% of pediatric AML. Five-year event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 43.7% +/- 2.7% and 49.0% +/- 2.7%, respectively. Patients diagnosed in 2000 to 2009 were treated with higher cytarabine doses and had better EFS (P = .037) and OS (P = .003) than those diagnosed in 1989 to 1999. Transplantation in first remission did not improve survival. Cytogenetic data were available for 372 (75.9%) patients: hypodiploid (n = 18, 4.8%), normal karyotype (n = 49, 13.2%), pseudodiploid (n = 119, 32.0%), 47 to 50 chromosomes (n = 142, 38.2%), and >50 chromosomes (n = 44, 11.8%). Chromosome gain occurred in 195 of 372 (52.4%) patients: +21 (n = 106, 28.5%), +19 (n = 93, 25.0%), +8 (n = 77, 20.7%). Losses occurred in 65 patients (17.5%): -7 (n = 13, 3.5%). Common structural chromosomal aberrations were t(1;22)(p13;q13) (n = 51, 13.7%) and 11q23 rearrangements (n = 38, 10.2%); t(9;11)(p22;q23) occurred in 21 patients. On the basis of frequency and prognosis, AMKL can be classified to 3 risk groups: good risk-7p abnormalities; poor risk-normal karyotypes, -7, 9p abnormalities including t(9;11)(p22;q23)/MLL-MLLT3, -13/13q-, and -15; and intermediate risk-others including t(1;22)(p13;q13)/OTT-MAL (RBM15-MKL1) and 11q23/MLL except t(9;11).

Data on breakthrough invasive fungal infections (IFIs) from various centres are essential, as there are several considerations in treating IFIs in the posaconazole era. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of posaconazole PAP and identify characteristics of IFIs at a single centre in Korea. We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with AML/MDS undergoing remission induction chemotherapy between December 2010 and November 2013. Of the 424 patients, 140 received posaconazole and 284 received fluconazole prophylaxis. The incidence of breakthrough proven/probable IFIs (15.5% vs. 2.9%, P < 0.001) and empirical antifungal treatment (EAFT) (45.8% vs. 12.9%, P < 0.001) decreased in the posaconazole group compared to the fluconazole group. In the posaconazole PAP group, two cases of breakthrough mucormycosis were noted among 13 proven/probable/possible IFI cases (15.4%). Overall and IFI-related mortality was 12.1% and 1.9% respectively. Fungus-free survival was significantly higher in the posaconazole group (74.7% vs. 87.1%, P = 0.028). Breakthrough IFIs and EAFT decreased significantly after posaconazole PAP. The benefit in fungus-free survival was noted with posaconazole PAP. Clinicians should be vigilant to identify non-Aspergillus IFIs with active diagnostic effort.","['Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'The Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Centre, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'The Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Centre, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'The Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Centre, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'The Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Centre, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']","['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Antifungal agent', 'aspergillosis', 'fluconazole', 'posaconazole', 'prophylaxis']",['10.1111/myc.12357 [doi]'],10.1111/myc.12357 [doi],20150727,,,['(c) 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an integrated approach, we uncovered distinct mutation, gene expression and drug response profiles in TCF3-HLF-positive and treatment-responsive TCF3-PBX1-positive ALL. We identified recurrent intragenic deletions of PAX5 or VPREB1 in constellation with the fusion of TCF3 and HLF. Moreover somatic mutations in the non-translocated allele of TCF3 and a reduction of PAX5 gene dosage in TCF3-HLF ALL suggest cooperation within a restricted genetic context. The enrichment for stem cell and myeloid features in the TCF3-HLF signature may reflect reprogramming by TCF3-HLF of a lymphoid-committed cell of origin toward a hybrid, drug-resistant hematopoietic state. Drug response profiling of matched patient-derived xenografts revealed a distinct profile for TCF3-HLF ALL with resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics but sensitivity to glucocorticoids, anthracyclines and agents in clinical development. Striking on-target sensitivity was achieved with the BCL2-specific inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199). This integrated approach thus provides alternative treatment options for this deadly disease.","['Clinic for Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty,

We report on the clinical evolution of 22 CNS venous thrombosis cases occurring in 708 adults treated for ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) with the Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GRAALL)-induction protocol, which included eight L-ASP (6,000 IU/m(2) ) infusions. The prevalence of CNS thrombosis was 3.1%. CNS thrombosis occurred after a median of 18 days (range: 11-31) when patients had received a median of three l-ASP injections (range: 2-7). Patients with CNS thrombosis exhibited a median antithrombin (AT) nadir of 47.5% (range: 36-67%) at Day 17 (range: D3-D28), and 95% of them exhibited AT levels lower than 60%. There were no evident increase in hereditary thrombotic risk factors prevalence, and thrombosis occurred despite heparin prophylaxis which was performed in 90% of patients. Acquired AT deficiency was frequently detected in patients with l-ASP-based therapy, and patients with CNS thrombosis received AT prophylaxis (45%) less frequently than patients without CNS thrombosis (83%), P = 0.0002). CNS thrombosis was lethal in 5% of patients, while 20% had persistent sequelae. One patient received all planned l-ASP infusions without recurrence of CNS thrombotic whereas l-ASP injections were discontinued in 20 patients during the management of thrombosis without a significant impact on overall survival (P = 0.4).","['Hematologie Hopital Morvan, CHU, Brest, France.', 'Hematologie Hopital Purpan, CHU, Toulouse, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Nantes, France.', 'Hematologie Hopital Necker AP-HP, France.', 'Hematologie, HCL, Centre hospitalier Lyon Sud, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Rennes, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Hematologie, CH Dunkerque, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Nancy, France.', 'Hematologie, CH Perpignan, France.', 'Hematologie, Strasbourg, CHU, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Besancon, France.', 'Hematologie, CHR, Metz, France.', 'Hematologie, CHU, Caen, France.', 'Hematologie, Meaux, CHU, France.', 'Maladies Du Sang, CHU, Angers, France.', 'Coordination du groupe GRAALL, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, France.', 'Maladies Du Sang, CHU, Angers, France.', 'Hematologie Hopital Saint-Louis AP-HP, France.', 'Maladies Du Sang/INSERM U892 PRES LUNAM, Angers, CHU, France.', 'Maladies Du Sang/INSERM U892 PRES LUNAM, Angers, CHU, France.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antithrombins)', '0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,['10.1002/ajh.24130 [doi]'],10.1002/ajh.24130 [doi],20151008,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite well-defined roles in hematopoiesis, the functions of GATA2 in the lymphatic vasculature and the mechanisms by which GATA2 mutations result in lymphedema have not been characterized. Here, we have provided a molecular explanation for lymphedema predisposition in a subset of patients with germline GATA2 mutations. Specifically, we demonstrated that Emberger-associated GATA2 missense mutations result in complete loss of GATA2 function, with respect to the capacity to regulate the transcription of genes that are important for lymphatic vessel valve development. We identified a putative enhancer element upstream of the key lymphatic transcriptional regulator PROX1 that is bound by GATA2, and the transcription factors FOXC2 and NFATC1. Emberger GATA2 missense mutants had a profoundly reduced capacity to bind this element. Conditional Gata2 deletion in mice revealed that GATA2 is required for both development and maintenance of lymphovenous and lymphatic vessel valves. Together, our data unveil essential roles for GATA2 in the lymphatic vasculature and explain why a select catalogue of human GATA2 mutations results in lymphedema.",,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (NFATC1 protein, human)', '0 (Nfatc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (mesenchyme fork head 1 protein)', '0 (prospero-related homeobox 1 protein)']",PMC4563742,,,"['78888 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI78888 [doi]']",10.1172/JCI78888 [doi] 78888 [pii],20150727,,,,,['J Clin Invest. 2015 Aug 3;125(8):2924-6.

Changes in TEL-AML1 expression before and after GC exposure were analyzed. Expression of GC-sensitive and GC-resistant leukemia cells following initial diagnosis and during treatment was simulated. Leukemia cells were divided into a GC-unexposed or a GC-exposed group. A methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay was used to detect cell proliferation inhibition, flow cytometry was used to observe cell apoptosis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the mRNA expression of TEL-AML1 before and after exposure, and western blotting was used to analyze protein levels of TEL-AML1 before and after exposure. Inhibitory concentrations of 50% of cells in the Jurkat and CEM cells at 24 h were 382 and 9 mM, respectively, and at 48 h they were 216 and 2 mM. The proliferation inhibition effect of dexamethasone sodium phosphate on Jurkat cells was much lower than that on CEM cells. Jurkat cells showed obvious apoptosis after exposure to 100 mM dexamethasone sodium phosphate for 48 h. In the exposed group, Jurkat cells showed higher TEL-AML1 expression than did CEM cells (P < 0.05). In the unexposed group, TEL-AML1 gene expression in Jurkat cells was not affected by GC exposure (P > 0.05), while the CEM cells presented significant differences before and after exposure (P < 0.05). Sustained high expression of TEL-AML1 participated in and maintained the occurrence of GC resistance.

We have explored the regulatory mechanisms that constitute age-associated barriers, through derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from individuals with premature or physiological ageing. We demonstrate that NF-kappaB activation blocks the generation of iPSCs in ageing. We also show that NF-kappaB repression occurs during cell reprogramming towards a pluripotent state. Conversely, ageing-associated NF-kappaB hyperactivation impairs the generation of iPSCs by eliciting the reprogramming repressor DOT1L, which reinforces senescence signals and downregulates pluripotency genes. Genetic and pharmacological NF-kappaB inhibitory strategies significantly increase the reprogramming efficiency of fibroblasts from Nestor-Guillermo progeria syndrome and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome patients, as well as from normal aged donors. Finally, we demonstrate that DOT1L inhibition in vivo extends lifespan and ameliorates the accelerated ageing phenotype of progeroid mice, supporting the interest of studying age-associated molecular impairments to identify targets of rejuvenation strategies.","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006-Oviedo, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006-Oviedo, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006-Oviedo, Spain.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA."", 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Cell Therapy Program of the University of Barcelona, Faculty of Medicine, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', '1] Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Cell Therapy Program of the University of Barcelona, Faculty of Medicine, 08036 Barcelona, Spain [2] Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), 08035 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Departamento de Anatomia Patologica, Farmacologia y Microbiologia, Universitat de Barcelona, IDIBAPS, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', ""1] Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA [2] Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA [3] Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University and Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA."", 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006-Oviedo, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006-Oviedo, Spain.']","['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Dot1l protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Zmpste24 protein, mouse)']",,,,"['ncb3207 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb3207 [doi]']",10.1038/ncb3207 [doi],20150727,['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],,,,['Cell Cycle. 2015;14(21):3345-6.

Epub 2015 Jul 27.,"OBJECTIVE: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a pathologic entity of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms that severely affect the quality of life accompanied with the risk of leukemia development. Conventional treatment is usually ineffective and has limited impact on prolongation of survival. Dysregulated Janus kinase (JAK) signaling is common in MPN. In two randomized controlled trials, ruxolitinib, a potent pan-JAK inhibitor, has been shown to be highly effective in patients with intermediate- and high-risk MF. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed the therapeutic outcome of 10 MF patients treated with ruxolitinib in our institute. Basic clinical data, JAK2V617F mutational status and Myelofibrosis Symptoms Assessment Form (MF-SAF) to evaluate disease-related symptoms were recorded initially, and at every visit. RESULT: Among these patients, only half of the patients harbored JAK2V617F mutation. After treatment with ruxolitinib, all patients had reduction of splenic size and reached nadir by week 24. Nine patients had body weight increment, and four of them had body weight increment more than 10%. Seven patients had their total symptom score reduced by more than 50% after therapy.

The probable explanation for As2O3-induced cell differentiation is the direct targeting of PML-RARalpha oncoprotein by As2O3, which results in initiation of PML-RARalpha degradation. However, after injection, As2O3 is rapidly methylated in body to different intermediate metabolites such as trivalent monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)) and dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)), therefore, it remains unknown that which arsenic specie is actually responsible for the therapeutic effects against APL. Here we have shown the role of As2O3 (as iAs(III)) and its intermediate metabolites (i.e., MMA(III)/DMA(III)) in NB4 cells. Inorganic iAs(III) predominantly showed induction of cell differentiation, while MMA(III) and DMA(III) specifically showed to induce mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum-mediated apoptosis, respectively. On the other hand, in contrast to iAs(III), MMA(III) showed stronger binding affinity for ring domain of PML recombinant protein, however, could not induce PML protein SUMOylation and ubiquitin/proteasome degradation. In summary, our results suggest that the binding of arsenicals to the ring domain of PML proteins is not associated with the degradation of PML-RARalpha fusion protein. Moreover, methylated arsenicals can efficiently lead to cellular apoptosis, however, they are incapable of inducing NB4 cell differentiation.","['Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Clinical College of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Clinical College of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (dimethylarsinous acid)', '0 (monomethylarsonous acid)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'AJ2HL7EU8K (Cacodylic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",PMC4694856,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'arsenic binding proteins', 'arsenic trioxide', 'monomethylarsonous acid', 'trivalent arsenicals']","['4662 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4662 [doi]']",10.18632/oncotarget.4662 [doi],,['R01 AA020203/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A20 is frequently inactivated by deletions and/or mutations in several B and T cell lymphoma subtypes; however, knowledge of the role of A20 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains limited. In this study, we characterized the A20 gene expression pattern, the expression level of its upstream regulating factor MALT1, and its downstream target NF-kappaB in adult B-ALL. METHODS: The expression level of MALT1, A20 and NF-kappaB1 was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 20 patients with adult B-ALL (including 12 de novo B-ALL and 8 refractory/relapse B-ALL cases), and nine patients with B-ALL in complete remission (CR) using real-time PCR. Sixteen healthy individuals served as controls. RESULTS: Significant A20 overexpression was found in the B-ALL (median: 13.489) compared with B-ALL CR (median: 3.755) (P = 0.003) patients and healthy individuals (median: 8.748) (P = 0.002), while there was no significant difference in A20 expression between B-ALL CR patients and healthy individuals (P = 0.107). Interestingly, the A20 expression level in the B-ALL samples was relatively different with approximately 50% of the B-ALL cases showing a relatively high A20 expression level, while the remaining 50% cases demonstrated slight upregulation or a similar expression level as the healthy controls. However, there was no significant difference in the A20 expression level between de novo B-ALL (median 12.252) and refractory/relapse B-ALL patients (median 21.342) (P = 0.616). Similarly, a significantly higher expression level of NF-kappaB1 was found in the B-ALL (median 1.062) patients compared with healthy individuals (median 0.335) (P < 0.0001), while the NF-kappaB1 expression level was downregulated in the B-ALL CR group (median 0.339), which was significantly lower than that in those with B-ALL (P = 0.001). Moreover, the MALT1 expression level in B-ALL was upregulated (median 1.938) and significantly higher than that in healthy individuals (median 0.677) (P = 0.002) and B-ALL CR patients (median 0.153) (P = 0.008). The correlation of the expression levels of all three genes was lost in B-ALL. CONCLUSIONS: We found that MALT1-A20-NF-kappaB is overexpressed in adult B-ALL, which may be related to the pathogenesis of B-ALL, and this pathway may be considered a potentially attractive target for the development of B-ALL therapeutics.","['Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Department of Emergency, Third Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510150 China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515 China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.']",,PMC4514975,['NOTNLM'],"['A20', 'B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'MALT1', 'NF-kappaB']","['10.1186/s12935-015-0222-0 [doi]', '222 [pii]']",10.1186/s12935-015-0222-0 [doi],20150725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the concentration of DNR was shown to increase in plasma, tumor tissue, and major organs. Flow cytometry analysis with a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye, NIR797, was used to study the effectiveness of Tf as a targeting group for leukemia cells, a finding that was supported by NIRF imaging in tumor-bearing nude mice.

The morphology and cytochemistry of the microarray-captured normal and neoplastic peripheral blood mononuclear cells are identical to the same characteristics in a smear. The microarray permits to determine the proportions of cells positive for the CD antigens on the microarray panel with high correlation with flow cytometry. Using the anti-CD microarray we show that normal granular lymphocytes and lymphocytes with radial segmentation of the nuclei are positive for CD3, CD8, CD16 or CD56 but not for CD4 or CD19. We also show that the described technique permits to obtain a pure leukemic cell population or to separate two leukemic cell populations on different antibody spots and to study their morphology or cytochemistry directly on the microarray.

Epub 2015 Jul 23.,"BACKGROUND AIMS: Protocols for the production of CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19) T cells are often complex and expensive because of the use of retroviral and lentiviral vectors or the need for CAR19 T-cell enrichment. We aimed to simplify the generation of CAR19 T cells from the peripheral blood of normal donors and patients using the piggyBac transposon system of gene modification. METHODS: We varied electroporation voltage, cytokines and stimulation conditions for the generation and expansion of CAR19 T cells over a 3-week culture period. RESULTS: Using optimized electroporation voltage, interleukin-15 alone and co-culturing CAR T cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we were able to expand CAR19 T-cell cultures by up to 765-fold over 3 weeks in normal donors and 180-fold in patients with B-cell malignancies. Final median CAR19 expression of 72% was seen in normal donors, and 81% was seen in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CAR19 T cells produced interferon gamma on stimulation with CD19(+) cell lines and efficiently lysed both CD19(+) cell lines and primary leukemia cells. In addition, combining CAR expression with an inducible caspase safety switch allowed elimination of CAR19 T cells by the application of a small molecule dimerizer. DISCUSSION: We have produced a simple, inexpensive and easily adoptable protocol for the generation of CAR19 T cells suitable for use in clinical trials using the piggyBac transposon system. This provides a robust platform for further enhancing the T-cell product and testing new CAR technologies.","['The Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research, The University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia.', 'The Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research, The University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia; The Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia; Sydney Cellular Therapies Laboratory, Pathology West, Westmead, Australia.', 'The Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research, The University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia; The Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia.', 'The Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research, The University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia; The Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia.', 'The Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research, The University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia; The Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia; Sydney Cellular Therapies Laboratory, Pathology West, Westmead, Australia.', 'The Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research, The University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia; Sydney Cellular Therapies Laboratory, Pathology West, Westmead, Australia.', 'The Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research, The University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia; The Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia; Sydney Cellular Therapies Laboratory, Pathology West, Westmead, Australia.', 'The Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research, The University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia; The Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia; Sydney Cellular Therapies Laboratory, Pathology West, Westmead, Australia.

Grades 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) occurred in 33% of the patients and chronic GvHD was reported in 24%. The 4-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 41% and 32% for relapse, resulting in a 4-year estimated relapse-free and overall survival (OS) of 27% and 33%, respectively. Patients transplanted in CR had lower probability for non-relapse death (P = 0.002) and longer relapse-free and OS (P = 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). In multivariate analysis the only significant prognostic factor for survival was the presence of CR at transplantation (P = 0.005).

We identified a group of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)-derived metabolites, glycerophospholipids, and their endogenous inhibitor, 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA), as regulators of donor hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We provided two pieces of evidence that TOFA could improve hematopoiesis-supporting function of FA MSCs: (a) limiting-dilution cobblestone area-forming cell assay revealed that TOFA significantly increased cobblestone colonies in Fanca-/- or Fancd2-/- cocultures compared to untreated cocultures. (b) Competitive repopulating assay using output cells collected from cocultures showed that TOFA greatly alleviated the abnormal expansion of the donor myeloid (CD45.2+Gr1+Mac1+) compartment in both peripheral blood and BM of recipient mice transplanted with cells from Fanca-/- or Fancd2-/- cocultures.

Constitutive signaling from mutated growth factor receptors is a major driver of leukemic growth, but how aberrant signaling affects the epigenome in AML is less understood. Furthermore, AML cells undergo extensive clonal evolution, and the mutations in signaling genes are often secondary events. To elucidate how chronic growth factor signaling alters the transcriptional network in AML, we performed a system-wide multi-omics study of primary cells from patients suffering from AML with internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 transmembrane domain (FLT3-ITD). This strategy revealed cooperation between the MAP kinase (MAPK) inducible transcription factor AP-1 and RUNX1 as a major driver of a common, FLT3-ITD-specific gene expression and chromatin signature, demonstrating a major impact of MAPK signaling pathways in shaping the epigenome of FLT3-ITD AML.","['School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Section of Experimental Haematology, Leeds Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds LS9 7TF, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Section of Experimental Haematology, Leeds Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds LS9 7TF, UK.', 'Warwick Systems Biology Centre, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK; Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham B15 2TH, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', ""West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham B15 2TG, UK."", ""West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham B15 2TG, UK."", ""Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, St. James's University Hospital, Leeds LS9 7TF, UK."", 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK.', ""School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK; West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham B15 2TG, UK."", 'Warwick Systems Biology Centre, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.

Epub 2015 Jul 27.,"For many years, developing hematopoietic cells have been strictly compartmentalized into a rare population of multi-potent self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), multi-potent hematopoietic progenitor cells (MPP) that are undergoing commitment to particular lineage fates, and recognizable precursor cells that mature towards functional blood and immune cells. A single route to each end-cell type is prescribed in the ""classical"" model for the architecture of hematopoiesis. Recent findings have led to the viewpoint that HSCs and MPPs are more versatile than previously thought. Underlying this are multiple routes to a particular fate and cells having clandestine fate options even when they have progressed some way along a pathway. The primary role of cytokines during hematopoiesis has long been seen to be regulation of the survival and proliferation of developing hematopoietic cells. Some cytokines now clearly have instructive actions on cell-fate decisions. All this leads to a new way of viewing hematopoiesis whereby versatile HSC and MPP are directed towards lineage outcomes via cytokine regulated cell-fate decisions. This means greater flexibility to the shaping of hematopoiesis.","['a School of Immunity and Infection, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham , Edgbaston , Birmingham , UK .']",['0 (Cytokines)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell differentiation', 'cell-fate decisions', 'cytokines', 'hematopoiesis', 'leukemia']",['10.3109/10408363.2015.1021412 [doi]'],10.3109/10408363.2015.1021412 [doi],20150727,['G1001390/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, identifying signals needed for AML propagation is a critical step toward developing new approaches for treating this disease. Here, we show that Tetraspanin 3 is a target of the RNA binding protein Musashi 2, which plays a key role in AML. We generated Tspan3 knockout mice that were born without overt defects. However, Tspan3 deletion impaired leukemia stem cell self-renewal and disease propagation and markedly improved survival in mouse models of AML. Additionally, Tspan3 inhibition blocked growth of AML patient samples, suggesting that Tspan3 is also important in human disease. As part of the mechanism, we show that Tspan3 deficiency disabled responses to CXCL12/SDF-1 and led to defects in AML localization within the niche. These identify Tspan3 as an important regulator of aggressive leukemias and highlight a role for Tspan3 in oncogenesis.","['Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Soonchunhyang Institute of Medi-bio Science, Soonchunhyang University, Asan-si, Chungcheongnamdo 336-745, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Division of Cell Therapy, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore 169857.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, WA 98109, USA.', 'Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Computational Science Research Center and Biomedical Informatics Research Center, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']","['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Tetraspanins)', '0 (Tspan3 protein, human)', '0 (Tspan3 protein, mouse)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",PMC4664079,,,['10.1016/j.stem.2015.06.006 [doi]'],10.1016/j.stem.2015.06.006 [doi],20150723,"['HL097767/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP1 OD006430/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'DP1CA174422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA186043/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP1 CA174422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA186043/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL097767/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007752/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK063031/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK099335/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK099335/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS704950'],['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2015 Jul 26.,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major infectious complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Recently, it was reported that CMV reactivation is associated with a decreased risk of relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of early CMV reactivation on the incidence of disease relapse after allo-HSCT in a large cohort of patients. The Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation's Transplantation-Related Complication Working Group retrospectively surveyed the database of the Transplant Registry Unified Management Program at the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. Patients with AML (n = 1836), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 911), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, n = 223), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n = 569) who underwent their first allo-HSCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors between 2000 and 2009 and who survived without disease relapse until day 100 after transplantation were analyzed. Patients who received umbilical cord blood transplantation were not included. Patients underwent surveillance by pp65 antigenemia from the time of engraftment, and the beginning of preemptive therapy was defined as CMV reactivation. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the risk factors of relapse, nonrelapse, and overall mortality. CMV reactivation and acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were evaluated as time-dependent covariates. CMV reactivation was associated with a decreased incidence of relapse in patients with AML (20.3% versus 26.4%, P = .027), but not in patients with ALL, CML, or MDS. Among 1836 patients with AML, CMV reactivation occurred in 795 patients (43.3%) at a median of 42 days, and 436 patients (23.7%) relapsed at a median of 221 days after allo-HSCT. Acute GVHD grades II to IV developed in 630 patients (34.3%). By multivariate analysis considering competing risk factors, 3 factors were significantly associated with a decreased risk of AML relapse and 1 factor with an increased risk of AML relapse: CMV reactivation (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [CI], .59 to .99), unrelated donor compared with related donor (HR, .59; 95% CI, .42 to .84), development of chronic GVHD (HR, .77; 95% CI, .60 to .99), and pretransplantation advanced disease status compared with standard disease status (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.56 to 2.52). However, CMV reactivation was associated with increased nonrelapse mortality (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.17) and overall mortality (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.69). A beneficial effect of CMV reactivation on subsequent risk of relapse was observed in patients with AML but not in those with other hematological malignancies. However, this benefit was nullified by the increased nonrelapse mortality.

However, the role of HPIP in gastric cancer (GC) is unclear. Here, we show that HPIP is upregulated in most GC patients and promotes GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In GC patients, HPIP positively associates with tumor size and nodal metastasis, and negatively associates with tumor differentiation. Hematopoietic pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor interacting protein increases GC cell proliferation through activation of G1 /S and G2 /M cell cycle transitions, accompanied by a marked increase of the positive cell cycle regulators, including cyclin D1, cyclin A, and cyclin B1. Hematopoietic pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor interacting protein enhances GC cell migration and invasion, and modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which plays a key role in cancer cell migration and invasion. These data underscore the critical role of HPIP in GC cell proliferation and progression and suggest that HPIP inhibition may be a useful therapeutic strategy for GC treatment.","['Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Colorectal Surgery, the Second Artillery General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Colorectal Surgery, the Second Artillery General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China.']","['0 (CCNA1 protein, human)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",PMC4638003,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell growth', 'EMT', 'HPIP', 'gastric cancer', 'migration and invasion']",['10.1111/cas.12754 [doi]'],10.1111/cas.12754 [doi],20150925,,,"['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Tim-3 has been suggested as a negative regulator of anti-tumor immunity due to its function on inducing T cells exhaustion in cancer. In addition to its expression on exhausted T cells, Tim-3 also has been reported to up-regulate on nature killer (NK) cells and promote NK cells functionally exhausted in cancer. While Tim-3 selectively expression on most types of leukemia stem cells, it promotes the progression of acute myeloid leukemia. Recently, data from experimental models of tumor discovered that Tim-3 and Tim-4 up-regulation on tumor associated dendritic cells and macrophages attenuated the anti-tumor effects of cancer vaccines and chemotherapy. Moreover, co-blockage of Tim-3 and PD-1, Tim-3 and CD137, Tim-3 and carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) could enhance cell-mediated immunity in advanced tumor, and combined treatment with anti-Tim-3 and anti-Tim-4 mAbs further increase the efficacy of cancer vaccines.

The patient had presented with multiple white patchy lesions on the palatal gingiva and mucosa 16 years after HSCT; these lesions were consistent with the clinical features of cGVHD. Six years later, oral examination and biopsy revealed upper gingival squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in areas of cGVHD, and he underwent tumour excision. Follow-up examination at 2 years and 4 months after the operation revealed no evidence of recurrence of local SCC or metastasis of the cervical lymph node. The current case highlights the susceptibility of patients with cGVHD to the development of OSCC even two decades after HSCT.

Also, p62/SQSTM1 was increased in response to HCQ. p62/SQSTM1 protein interacts with both LC3-II and ubiquitin protein and is degraded in autophagosomes. Therefore, a reduction of p62/SQSTM1 indicates increased autophagic degradation, whereas an increase of p62/SQSTM1 by HCQ indicates inhibited autophagic degradation. Knock down of p62/SQSTM1 using siRNA were prevented the HCQ-induced LC3-II protein level as well as significantly reduced the HCQ-induced cell death in U937/AR cells.

Epub 2015 May 20.,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that aberrant DNA methylation is a common epigenetic alteration in malignancies. Genetic variations in DNA methyltransferase 1 gene (DNMT1), which encodes the maintenance methyltransferase, have been demonstrated to be involved in cancer susceptibility. In the present study, we investigated whether genetic polymorphisms in DNMT1 could be associated with risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a Chinese population. METHODS: We selected seven tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs, rs11880388, rs10423341, rs7253062, rs11085721, rs2228611, rs2228612 and rs16999593) in DNMT1 and genotyped these SNPs by using TaqMan method in a case-control study of 377 patients with ALL and 500 healthy controls. The logistic regression was used to assess the genetic associations with occurrence of ALL with adjustment for possible confounders. RESULTS: We found that one (rs11085721) of the seven tagSNPs was significantly associated with the risk of ALL. Compared with individuals' with DNMT1 rs11085721 GG genotype, those subjects carrying the rs11085721 GT genotypes were associated with significantly increased risk for ALL (GT vs. GG:OR=1.29, 95% CI=1.10-1.51). Similar association was also observed when combined the individuals with rs11085721 GT and rs11085721 TT genotypes (GT/TT vs. TT:OR=1.29, 95% CI=1.10-1.50). No positive results were observed for the other tagSNPs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the DNMT1 rs11085721 polymorphism may confer susceptibility to ALL in the Chinese population. The initial findings should be validated by large population-based prospective studies in the future.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 210029 Nanjing, China; Nanjing Red Cross Blood Center, 210003 Nanjing, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, 210009 Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Developmental Genetics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, 210029 Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Laboratory medicine, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 210006 Nanjing, China.', 'Nanjing Red Cross Blood Center, 210003 Nanjing, China.', 'Nanjing Red Cross Blood Center, 210003 Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 210029 Nanjing, China.

Epub 2015 Jun 24.,"The key enzyme in leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis is 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), which is expressed in myeloid cells and in B lymphocytes. There are three phosphorylation sites on 5-LO (Ser271, Ser523 and Ser663). Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates 5-LO on Ser523. In this report, we demonstrate by immunoblotting that native 5-LO in mantle B cell lymphoma (MCL) cells (Granta519, JEKO1, and Rec1) and in primary chronic B lymphocytic leukemia cells (B-CLL) is phosphorylated on Ser523. In contrast, we could not detect phosphorylation of 5-LO on Ser523 in human granulocytes or monocytes. Phosphorylated 5-LO was purified from Rec1 cells, using an ATP-agarose column, and the partially purified enzyme could be dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase. Incubation of Rec1 cells with 8-Br-cAMP or prostaglandin E2 stimulated phosphorylation at Ser523. Furthermore, FLAG-5LO was expressed in Rec1 cells, and the cells were cultivated in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP. The 5-LO protein from these cells was immunoprecipitated, first with anti-FLAG, followed by anti-pSer523-5-LO. The presence of 5-LO protein in the final precipitate further supported the finding that the protein recognized by the pSer523 antibody was 5-LO. Taken together, this study shows that 5-LO in B cells is phosphorylated on Ser523 and demonstrates for the first time a chemical difference between 5-LO in myeloid cells and B cells.","['Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, 171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry/ZAFES, Goethe-University, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, 171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'University of Frankfurt Medical School, Department of Molecular Hematology, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Pathology, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge and Karolinska Institutet, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Pathology, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge and Karolinska Institutet, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Karolinska Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry/ZAFES, Goethe-University, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, 171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Karolinska Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, 171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.

Mitochondrial localization of several protein tyrosine kinases is linked to this characteristic metabolic shift in solid tumors, but remains largely unknown in blood cancer. Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) is a key T-cell kinase and widely implicated in blood malignancies. The purpose of our study is to determine whether and how Lck contributes to metabolic shift in T-cell leukemia through mitochondrial localization. METHODS: We compared the human leukemic T-cell line Jurkat with its Lck-deficient derivative Jcam cell line. Differences in mitochondrial respiration were measured by the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption, and mitochondrial superoxide. Detailed mitochondrial structure was visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Lck localization was evaluated by subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy. Proteomic analysis was performed to identify proteins co-precipitated with Lck in leukemic T-cells. Protein interaction was validated by biochemical co-precipitation and confocal microscopy, followed by in situ proximity ligation assay microscopy to confirm close-range (<16 nm) interaction. RESULTS: Jurkat cells have abnormal mitochondrial structure and reduced levels of mitochondrial respiration, which is associated with the presence of mitochondrial Lck and lower levels of mitochondrion-encoded electron transport chain proteins. Proteomics identified CR6-interacting factor 1 (CRIF1) as the novel Lck-interacting protein. Lck association with CRIF1 in Jurkat mitochondria was confirmed biochemically and by microscopy, but did not lead to CRIF1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Consistent with the role of CRIF1 in functional mitoribosome, shRNA-mediated silencing of CRIF1 in Jcam resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction similar to that observed in Jurkat. Reduced interaction between CRIF1 and Tid1, another key component of intramitochondrial translational machinery, in Jurkat further supports the role of mitochondrial Lck as a negative regulator of CRIF1 through competitive binding. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report demonstrating the role of mitochondrial Lck in metabolic reprogramming of leukemic cells. Mechanistically, it is distinct from other reported mitochondrial protein tyrosine kinases. In a kinase-independent manner, mitochondrial Lck interferes with mitochondrial translational machinery through competitive binding to CRIF1. These findings may reveal novel approaches in cancer therapy by targeting cancer cell metabolism.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, H. M.

Epub 2015 Jul 24.,"OBJECTIVES: Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB) pose a clinical challenge. We attempted to estimate the mortality burden of CRGNB among haematological cancer patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. We included adult patients hospitalized in the haemato-oncological/bone marrow transplantation departments for chemotherapy, between 2008 and 2014, with Gram-negative aerobic bacteraemia. We compared patients with CRGNB and carbapenem-susceptible Gram-negative bacteraemia (CSGNB). The primary outcome was 14 day all-cause mortality. In addition, we assessed 1 year survival. Multivariable logistics regression analysis and adjusted Cox regression analysis were conducted. Analyses were adjusted to the propensity for CRGNB bacteraemia. RESULTS: The cohort included mostly young patients (mean age 50.1 years) with acute leukaemia (264/423, 62.4%) and the median absolute neutrophil count at bacteraemia onset was 0 x 10(9)/L. The unadjusted 14 day mortality rate was higher for patients with CRGNB compared with CSGNB [45.6% (47/103) versus 15% (48/320), respectively (P < 0.001)]. Adjusting to baseline prognostic factors, infection characteristics and the propensity score retained a significant association between CRGNB and 14 day mortality (OR 5.14, 95% CI 2.32-11.38). Including only the first bacteraemic episode per patient, 1 year mortality was 74.7% (68/91) for patients with CRGNB versus 49.8% (119/239) for patients with CSGNB (P < 0.001). Adjusting for risk factors associated with 1 year mortality, the HR for mortality with CRGNB was 1.48 (95% CI 1-2.2). CRGNB bacteraemia was associated with several risk factors for mortality, including inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment and less effective definitive antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a significant adjusted association between CRGNB and mortality up to 1 year among haemato-oncological patients receiving chemotherapy.","['Medicine B, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Unit of Infectious Diseases, Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel Division of Infectious Diseases, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheba, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel Division of Infectious Diseases, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel paulm@post.tau.ac.il.']","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Carbapenems)']",,,,"['dkv218 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkv218 [doi]']",10.1093/jac/dkv218 [doi],20150724,,,"['(c) The Author 2015.

Epub 2015 Jun 26.,"Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with multilineage dysplasia show several immunological abnormalities. In this clinical setting, by combining flow cytometry and CDR3 spectratyping we monitored the kinetic of the T-cell repertoire during Azacitidine treatment, in order to explore its potential ability to reverse the immune derangement typical of these disorders. We firstly demonstrated by flow cytometry an increase in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell frequencies after starting treatment. Moreover, when monitored by spectratyping our patients showed significant changes in their T-cell receptor (TCR) CDR3 profiles, which were much more evident in helper T-cells. In fact, the frequency of BV (beta variable) subfamilies showing a skewed CDR3 profile significantly decreased from baseline to the following evaluations in CD4+ T-cells (81% vs. 70%). This pattern was even more pronounced in patients responding to Azacitidine (90% vs. 61%). Our data show that the overall derangement of the T-cell repertoire detectable in patients with MDS and AML with multilineage dysplasia gradually improves during Azacitidine treatment. These findings therefore suggest that Azacitidine could be potentially able, not only to restore the hematopoietic function, but also to reverse the immune derangement typical of these hematologic disorders.","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sassari, Viale San Pietro 12, 07100 Sassari, Italy.

Epub 2015 Jul 21.,"Glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) are highly expressed in most tumor cells and little in normal cells. In this study, treatment of HL-60 cells with lovastatin induced characteristic apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. We demonstrated that lovastatin treatment inhibited Ras and Raf protein translocation to cell membrane and eliminated the phosphorylation of the downstream effectors Akt and ERK, and the subsequent NF-kappaB translocation into nucleus. Specific inhibitors and gamma-tocotrienol confirmed the Ras/Raf/ERK/NF-kappaB/GLO1 and Ras/Akt/NF-kappaB/GLO1 pathways. Data revealed that lovastatin induced HL-60 cell death was attenuated by mevalonate treatment. We demonstrated also that gamma-tocotrienol showed its apoptotic effect on the HL-60 cell through the same pathway. gamma-Tocotrienol enhanced the apoptotic effect of lovastatin through the down-regulation of GLO1 and HMGCR resulting in an increase of methylglyoxal and a decrease of cholesterol and led to the apoptosis of HL-60 cells. Data also revealed that both lovastatin and gamma-tocotrienol induced significant HL-60 cell differentiation. These results suggest that both lovastatin and gamma-tocotrienol could induce differentiation and followed by apoptosis.","['Department of Food Science, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Pingtung 91201, Taiwan.

To address this outstanding question, we surveyed 211 human autophagy-associated genes for tumor-related alterations to DNA sequence and RNA expression levels and examined their association with patient survival outcomes in multiple cancer types with sequence data from The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium. We found 3 (RB1CC1/FIP200, ULK4, WDR45/WIPI4) and one (ATG7) core autophagy genes to be under positive selection for somatic mutations in endometrial carcinoma and clear cell renal carcinoma, respectively, while 29 autophagy regulators and pathway interactors, including previously identified KEAP1, NFE2L2, and MTOR, were significantly mutated in 6 of the 11 cancer types examined. Gene expression analyses revealed that GABARAPL1 and MAP1LC3C/LC3C transcripts were less abundant in breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancers than in matched normal tissue controls; ATG4D transcripts were increased in lung squamous cell carcinoma, as were ATG16L2 transcripts in kidney cancer. Unsupervised clustering of autophagy-associated mRNA levels in tumors stratified patient overall survival in 3 of 9 cancer types (acute myeloid leukemia, clear cell renal carcinoma, and head and neck cancer). These analyses provide the first comprehensive resource of recurrently altered autophagy-associated genes in human tumors, and highlight cancer types and subtypes where perturbed autophagy may be relevant to patient overall survival.","['a The Genome Sciences Centre; BC Cancer Agency ; Vancouver, BC Canada.', 'b Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry ; Simon Fraser University ; Burnaby , BC Canada.', 'a The Genome Sciences Centre; BC Cancer Agency ; Vancouver, BC Canada.', 'a The Genome Sciences Centre; BC Cancer Agency ; Vancouver, BC Canada.', 'c Centre for High-Throughput Biology; University of British Columbia ; Vancouver , BC Canada.', 'a The Genome Sciences Centre; BC Cancer Agency ; Vancouver, BC Canada.', 'b Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry ; Simon Fraser University ; Burnaby , BC Canada.', 'd Department of Medical Genetics ; University of British Columbia ; Vancouver , BC Canada.', 'a The Genome Sciences Centre; BC Cancer Agency ; Vancouver, BC Canada.', 'b Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry ; Simon Fraser University ; Burnaby , BC Canada.', 'a The Genome Sciences Centre; BC Cancer Agency ; Vancouver, BC Canada.', 'd Department of Medical Genetics ; University of British Columbia ; Vancouver , BC Canada.', 'a The Genome Sciences Centre; BC Cancer Agency ; Vancouver, BC Canada.', 'b Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry ; Simon Fraser University ; Burnaby , BC Canada.']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",PMC4590660,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'LAPTM4B', 'SNV', 'SQSTM1', 'TCGA', 'autophagy', 'cancer', 'gene expression', 'mutation', 'tumor']",['10.1080/15548627.2015.1067362 [doi]'],10.1080/15548627.2015.1067362 [doi],,['GPG102167/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), long-term outcomes in adults remain unsatisfactory. Indeed, haploidentical HSCT has become a common treatment for adult patients who lack an HLA-matched donor, though limited data are available on the efficacy of haploidentical HSCT in Ph+ ALL patients. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical outcomes of 82 Ph+ ALL patients who underwent haploidentical HSCT (n = 47) or HLA-matched HSCT (n = 35). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to assess BCR-ABL expression. All of the patients were treated with an imatinib-based regimen before undergoing HSCT. Imatinib treatment was resumed in the patients' posttransplantation following detection of BCR-ABL transcripts. RESULTS: All of the patients achieved neutrophil and platelet engraftment, with the exception of five patients who died prior to engraftment. Haploidentical HSCT was associated with higher incidences of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (51.1 vs. 25.7%, p < 0.05) and chronic GVHD (48.9 vs. 25.7%, p < 0.05) compared with HLA-matched HSCT, but there was no difference in the incidence of either grades III-IV acute GVHD or extensive chronic GVHD. The incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was significantly higher in the patients treated with haploidentical HSCT than in those treated with HLA-matched HSCT (38.3 vs. 14.3%, p < 0.05). Haploidentical HSCT was associated with a significantly lower relapse rate compared with HLA-matched HSCT (44.8 vs. 19.1%, p < 0.05). There were no differences in non-relapse mortality (NRM), leukemia-free survival (LFS), or overall survival (OS) between the patients who received HLA-matched HSCT and those who underwent haploidentical HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the incidence of NRM after HSCT is similar between the patients who receive HLA-matched donor cells and those who receive haploidentical donor cells and that haploidentical HSCT reduces the relapse rate. Haploidentical HSCT represents an encouraging treatment option for Ph+ ALL patients who lack a suitable HLA-matched donor.","['Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Xinqiao Street, Shangpinba District, Chongqing, 400037, China. gaotiantiantiger@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Xinqiao Street, Shangpinba District, Chongqing, 400037, China. chzhang2003@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Xinqiao Street, Shangpinba District, Chongqing, 400037, China. gaolei7765@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Xinqiao Street, Shangpinba District, Chongqing, 400037, China.

Epub 2015 Jul 25.,"The studies of the recent decades posed the question of the association between radiation exposure and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). This association has been proved in secondary MDS originating upon exposure to chemotherapeutics and/or radiation therapy. The long-term study in Japanese atomic (A)-bomb survivors demonstrated the significant linear dose-response for MDS confirming the link between radiation exposure and this form of hematopoietic malignancies. All these findings provide the strong basis for studying MDS in the persons exposed to radiation following the Chernobyl disaster, especially those in the cohort of Chernobyl clean-up workers of 1986-1987. The data on MDS among Chernobyl clean-up workers (1986-1987) diagnosed in 1996-2012 at the reference laboratory of RE Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology are summarized. MDS cases were diagnosed in 23 persons (21 males and 2 females) having been exposed to radiation as clean-up workers of 1986-1987. Refractory anemia (RA) has been detected in 13, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS)-in 2, and refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-in 8 patients. The median age of those MDS patients was 62.0 years. In addition, 5 cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) were recorded in the group of Chernobyl clean-up workers with the median time of 14.8 years from 1986-1987 to diagnosis. The association between radiation exposure and MDS is discussed. The suggested life-long risk for myelodysplastic syndromes among A-bomb survivors in Japan highlights the importance of the continuing follow-up studies in the affected populations in the post-Chernobyl period.","['RE Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology & Radiobiology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Vasylkivska 45, 03022, Kyiv, Ukraine, mzavelevych@yahoo.com.']",,,,,['10.1007/s00277-015-2441-9 [doi]'],10.1007/s00277-015-2441-9 [doi],20150725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we sought to determine the real-world effectiveness of first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors in CML by evaluating response rates, all-cause discontinuation, and adherence. Response monitoring patterns were also analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study, using the McKesson Specialty Health/US Oncology Network (MSH/USON) iKnowMed electronic health record database and medical charts, identified newly diagnosed CML patients who received first-line imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib from July 2007 to March 2011, and were then followed for >/= 18 months. RESULTS: Three hundred patients met study criteria (222 imatinib-treated, 34 dasatinib-treated, and 44 nilotinib-treated in the first-line). Molecular and cytogenetic response assessments were conducted less frequently than recommended (40% never had cytogenetic or molecular monitoring at any time). Patients treated with either dasatinib or nilotinib experienced higher response rates by 6, 12, and 18 months, faster time to major molecular response, and a significantly lower rate of all-cause treatment discontinuation within 18 months relative to imatinib-treated patients. Approximately 56% of all patients were adherent to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. CONCLUSION: Dasatinib and nilotinib were more effective than imatinib as first-line therapy for CML in a community setting, as observed in descriptive and univariate analyses. The frequency of cytogenetic and molecular monitoring was lower than that recommended by current guidelines, including patients with no molecular or cytogenetic assessments during the 18-month follow-up. Therefore, MSH/USON is working toward improving compliance with response monitoring guidelines.","['Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers, Aurora, CO; McKesson Specialty Health/US Oncology Network, The Woodlands, TX.

Epub 2015 Jul 21.,"Protein kinases play a predominant regulatory role in nearly every aspect of cell biology and they can modify the function of a protein in almost every conceivable way. Protein phosphorylation can increase or decrease enzyme activity and it can alter other biological activities such as transcription and translation. Moreover, some phosphorylation sites on a given protein are stimulatory while others are inhibitory. The human protein kinase gene family consists of 518 members along with 106 pseudogenes. Furthermore, about 50 of the 518 gene products lack important catalytic residues and are called protein pseudokinases. The non-catalytic allosteric interaction of protein kinases and pseudokinases with other proteins has added an important regulatory feature to the biochemistry and cell biology of the protein kinase superfamily. With rare exceptions, a divalent cation such as Mg2+ is required for the reaction. All protein kinases exist in a basal state and are activated only as necessary by divergent regulatory stimuli. The mechanisms for switching between dormant and active protein kinases can be intricate. Phosphorylase kinase was the first protein kinase to be characterized biochemically and the mechanism of its regulation led to the discovery of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A, or PKA), which catalyzes the phosphorylation and activation of phosphorylase kinase. This was the first protein kinase cascade or signaling module to be elucidated. The epidermal growth factor receptor-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling module contains protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, and dual specificity protein kinases. PKA has served as a prototype of this enzyme family and more is known about this enzyme than any other protein kinase. The inactive PKA holoenzyme consists of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. After binding four molecules of cAMP, the holoenzyme dissociates into a regulatory subunit dimer (each monomer binds two cAMP) and two free and active catalytic subunits. PKA and all other protein kinase domains have a small amino-terminal lobe and large carboxyterminal lobe as determined by X-ray crystallography. The N-lobe and C-lobe form a cleft that serves as a docking site for MgATP. Nearly all active protein kinases contain a K/E/D/D signature sequence that plays important structural and catalytic roles. Protein kinases contain hydrophobic catalytic and regulatory spines and collateral shell residues that are required to assemble the active enzyme. There are two general kinds of conformational changes associated with most protein kinases. The first conformational change involves the formation of an intact regulatory spine to form an active enzyme. The second conformational change occurs in active kinases as they toggle between open and closed conformations during their catalytic cycles. Because mutations and dysregulation of protein kinases play causal roles in human disease, this family of enzymes has become one of the most important drug targets over the past two decades. Imatinib was approved by the United States FDA for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia in 2001; this small molecule inhibits the BCR-Abl protein kinase oncoprotein that results from the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome. More than two dozen other orally effective mechanism-based small molecule protein kinase inhibitors have been subsequently approved by the FDA. These drugs bind to the ATP-binding site of their target enzymes and extend into nearby hydrophobic pockets. Most of these protein kinase inhibitors prolong survival in cancer patients only weeks or months longer than standard cytotoxic therapies. In contrast, the clinical effectiveness of imatinib against chronic myelogenous leukemia is vastly superior to that of any other targeted protein kinase inhibitor with overall survival lasting a decade or more. However, the near universal and expected development of drug resistance in the treatment of neoplastic disorders requires new approaches to solve this therapeutic challenge.

Epub 2015 Jul 23.,"IL-17-producing cells are important mediators of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Here we demonstrate that a distinct CD8(+) Tc17 population develops rapidly after SCT but fails to maintain lineage fidelity such that they are unrecognizable in the absence of a fate reporter. Tc17 differentiation is dependent on alloantigen presentation by host dendritic cells (DCs) together with IL-6. Tc17 cells express high levels of multiple prototypic lineage-defining transcription factors (eg, RORgammat, T-bet) and cytokines (eg, IL-17A, IL-22, interferon-gamma, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-13). Targeted depletion of Tc17 early after transplant protects from lethal acute GVHD; however, Tc17 cells are noncytolytic and fail to mediate graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. Thus, the Tc17 differentiation program during GVHD culminates in a highly plastic, hyperinflammatory, poorly cytolytic effector population, which we term ""inflammatory iTc17"" (iTc17). Because iTc17 cells mediate GVHD without contributing to GVL, therapeutic inhibition of iTc17 development in a clinical setting represents an attractive approach for separating GVHD and GVL.","['Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Herston, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Herston, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'School of Molecular and Biomedical Science, University of Adelaide and Centre for Molecular Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Herston, QLD, Australia;', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia;', 'Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Advanced Molecular Imaging, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia; Institute of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University, School of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom;', 'Division of Molecular Immunology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, United Kingdom;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', 'Envoi Specialist Pathologists, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; and.', 'School of Molecular and Biomedical Science, University of Adelaide and Centre for Molecular Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia;', 'Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia;', ""Immunology Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.""]","['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-17)']",,,,"['S0006-4971(20)30894-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-01-622662 [doi]']",10.1182/blood-2015-01-622662 [doi],20150723,['MC_U117512792/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['Blood. 2015 Sep 24;126(13):1525-6.

Epub 2015 Jul 23.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is caused by the accumulation of multiple oncogenic lesions, including chromosomal rearrangements and mutations. To determine the frequency and co-occurrence of mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we performed targeted re-sequencing of 115 genes across 155 diagnostic samples (44 adult and 111 childhood cases). NOTCH1 and CDKN2A/B were mutated/deleted in more than half of the cases, while an additional 37 genes were mutated/deleted in 4% to 20% of cases. We found that IL7R-JAK pathway genes were mutated in 27.7% of cases, with JAK3 mutations being the most frequent event in this group. Copy number variations were also detected, including deletions of CREBBP or CTCF and duplication of MYB. FLT3 mutations were rare, but a novel extracellular mutation in FLT3 was detected and confirmed to be transforming. Furthermore, we identified complex patterns of pairwise associations, including a significant association between mutations in IL7R-JAK genes and epigenetic regulators (WT1, PRC2, PHF6). Our analyses showed that IL7R-JAK genetic lesions did not confer adverse prognosis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases enrolled in the UK ALL2003 trial. Overall, these results identify interconnections between the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia genome and disease biology, and suggest a potential clinical application for JAK inhibitors in a significant proportion of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Belgium Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Hematology Unit, University of Perugia, Polo Unico S.M.

Epub 2015 Jul 23.,"We assessed the antileukemic activity of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) through the modulation of expression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) commonly mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We used human leukemic cell lines cells, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as leukemic samples from AML patients to demonstrate the role of 2-DG in tumor cell growth inhibition. 2-DG, through N-linked glycosylation inhibition, affected the cell-surface expression and cellular signaling of both FTL3-ITD and mutated c-KIT and induced apoptotic cell death. Leukemic cells harboring these mutated RTKs (MV4-11, MOLM-14, Kasumi-1, and TF-1 c-KIT D816V) were the most sensitive to 2-DG treatment in vitro as compared with nonmutated cells. 2-DG activity was also demonstrated in leukemic cells harboring FLT3-TKD mutations resistant to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) quizartinib. Moreover, the antileukemic activity of 2-DG was particularly marked in c-KIT-mutated cell lines and cell samples from core binding factor-AML patients. In these cells, 2-DG inhibited the cell-surface expression of c-KIT, abrogated STAT3 and MAPK-ERK pathways, and strongly downregulated the expression of the receptor resulting in a strong in vivo effect in NOD/SCID mice xenografted with Kasumi-1 cells. Finally, we showed that 2-DG decreases Mcl-1 protein expression in AML cells and induces sensitization to both the BH3 mimetic inhibitor of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w, ABT-737, and cytarabine. In conclusion, 2-DG displays a significant antileukemic activity in AML with FLT3-ITD or KIT mutations, opening a new therapeutic window in a subset of AML with mutated RTKs.","['Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.

Epub 2015 Jul 23.,"The tumor suppressor p53 is a key regulator of apoptosis and functions upstream in the apoptotic cascade by both indirectly and directly regulating Bcl-2 family proteins. In cells expressing wild-type (WT) p53, the HDM2 protein binds to p53 and blocks its activity. Inhibition of HDM2:p53 interaction activates p53 and causes apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest. Here, we investigated the ability of the novel HDM2 inhibitor CGM097 to potently and selectively kill WT p53-expressing AML cells. The antileukemic effects of CGM097 were studied using cell-based proliferation assays (human AML cell lines, primary AML patient cells, and normal bone marrow samples), apoptosis, and cell-cycle assays, ELISA, immunoblotting, and an AML patient-derived in vivo mouse model. CGM097 potently and selectively inhibited the proliferation of human AML cell lines and the majority of primary AML cells expressing WT p53, but not mutant p53, in a target-specific manner. Several patient samples that harbored mutant p53 were comparatively unresponsive to CGM097. Synergy was observed when CGM097 was combined with FLT3 inhibition against oncogenic FLT3-expressing cells cultured both in the absence as well as the presence of cytoprotective stromal-secreted cytokines, as well as when combined with MEK inhibition in cells with activated MAPK signaling. Finally, CGM097 was effective in reducing leukemia burden in vivo. These data suggest that CGM097 is a promising treatment for AML characterized as harboring WT p53 as a single agent, as well as in combination with other therapies targeting oncogene-activated pathways that drive AML.","['Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. ellen_weisberg@dfci.harvard.edu james_griffin@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'National Screening Laboratory for the Regional Centers of Excellence in Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Molecular Genetics Core, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. ellen_weisberg@dfci.harvard.edu james_griffin@dfci.harvard.edu.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (NVP-CGM097)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",PMC4596780,,,"['1535-7163.MCT-15-0429 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0429 [doi]']",10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0429 [doi],20150723,"['P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA134660-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS711520'],['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 23.,"MOTIVATION: Targeted kinase inhibitors have dramatically improved cancer treatment, but kinase dependency for an individual patient or cancer cell can be challenging to predict. Kinase dependency does not always correspond with gene expression and mutation status. High-throughput drug screens are powerful tools for determining kinase dependency, but drug polypharmacology can make results difficult to interpret. RESULTS: We developed Kinase Addiction Ranker (KAR), an algorithm that integrates high-throughput drug screening data, comprehensive kinase inhibition data and gene expression profiles to identify kinase dependency in cancer cells. We applied KAR to predict kinase dependency of 21 lung cancer cell lines and 151 leukemia patient samples using published datasets. We experimentally validated KAR predictions of FGFR and MTOR dependence in lung cancer cell line H1581, showing synergistic reduction in proliferation after combining ponatinib and AZD8055.

Epub 2015 Jul 24.,"Cordyceps militaris is a traditional Chinese medicine frequently used for tonic and therapeutic purposes. Reports from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that extracts of the cultivated fruiting bodies of C. militaris (CM) exhibit a potent cytotoxic effect against many cancer cell lines, especially human leukemia cells. Here, we further investigated the underlying mechanism through which CM is cytotoxic to cancer cells. The CM-mediated induction of PARP cleavage and its related DNA damage signal (gammaH2AX) was diminished by caspase inhibitor I. In contrast, a ROS scavenger failed to prevent CM-mediated leukemia cell death. Moreover, two signaling molecules, AKT and p38 MAPK, were activated during the course of apoptosis induction. Employing MTT analysis, we found that a p38 MAPK inhibitor but not an AKT inhibitor could rescue cells from CM-mediated cell death, as well as inhibit the cleavage of PARP, formation of apoptotic bodies and up-regulation of the gammaH2AX signal. These results suggest that CM-mediated leukemia cell death occurs through the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, indicating its potential therapeutic effects against human leukemia.","['Department and Graduate Institute of Microbiology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10051, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 10684, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 10684, Taiwan.', 'Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 10684, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 10684, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 10684, Taiwan.', 'Mucho Biotechnology Inc., Taipei 10684, Taiwan.', 'Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.', 'Center for Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.', 'Department and Graduate Institute of Microbiology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10051, Taiwan.', 'Center for Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-Leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Signaling', 'Cordyceps militaris', 'DNA Damage', 'p38 MAPK']",['10.1142/S0192415X15500603 [doi]'],10.1142/S0192415X15500603 [doi],20150724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 23.,"Unlike other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Mcl-1 also mediates resistance to cancer therapy by uniquely inhibiting chemotherapy-induced senescence (CIS). In general, Bcl-2 family members regulate apoptosis at the level of the mitochondria through a common prosurvival binding groove. Through mutagenesis, we determined that Mcl-1 can inhibit CIS even in the absence of its apoptotically important mitochondrion-localizing domains. This finding prompted us to generate a series of Mcl-1 deletion mutants from both the N and C termini of the protein, including one that contained a deletion of all of the Bcl-2 homology domains, none of which impacted anti-CIS capabilities. Through subsequent structure-function analyses of Mcl-1, we identified a previously uncharacterized loop domain responsible for the anti-CIS activity of Mcl-1. The importance of the loop domain was confirmed in multiple tumor types, two in vivo models of senescence, and by demonstrating that a peptide mimetic of the loop domain can effectively inhibit the anti-CIS function of Mcl-1. The results from our studies appear to be highly translatable because we discerned an inverse relationship between the expression of Mcl-1 and of various senescence markers in cancerous human tissues. In summary, our findings regarding the unique structural properties of Mcl-1 provide new approaches for targeted cancer therapy.","['From the Departments of Immunology and.', 'From the Departments of Immunology and.', 'From the Departments of Immunology and.', 'From the Departments of Immunology and.', 'Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Lerner Research Institute, Department of Colorectal Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195.', 'Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Lerner Research Institute.', 'From the Departments of Immunology and Institutes of Head and Neck, Dermatology, and Plastic Surgery, Taussig Cancer Center; and gastmab@ccf.org.']","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",PMC4571950,['NOTNLM'],"['biomarker', 'cancer', 'cancer therapy', 'cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)', 'chemoresistance', 'protein domain', 'senescence']","['S0021-9258(20)44858-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M115.663898 [doi]']",10.1074/jbc.M115.663898 [doi],20150723,,,"['(c) 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 24.,"PURPOSE: To describe the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of an unselected population of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) including untreated patients. METHODS: HRQoL was measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 including the CLL16 module, EQ-5D, and VAS in an observational study over multiple years. All HRQoL measurements per patient were connected and analysed using area under the curve analysis over the entire study duration. The total patient group was compared with the general population, and three groups of CLL patients were described separately, i.e. patients without any active treatment (""watch and wait""), chlorambucil treatment only, and patients with other treatment(s). RESULTS: HRQoL in the total group of CLL patients was compromised when compared with age- and gender-matched norm scores of the general population. CLL patients scored statistically worse on the VAS and utility score of the EQ-5D, all functioning scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, and the symptoms of fatigue, dyspnoea, sleeping disturbance, appetite loss, and financial difficulties. In untreated patients, the HRQoL was slightly reduced. In all treatment stages, HRQoL was compromised considerably. Patients treated with chlorambucil only scored worse on the EORTC QLQ-C30 than patients who were treated with other treatments with regard to emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, bruises, uncomfortable stomach, and apathy. CONCLUSIONS: CLL patients differ most from the general population on role functioning, fatigue, concerns about future health, and having not enough energy. Once treatment is indicated, HRQoL becomes considerably compromised. This applies to all treatments, including chlorambucil, which is considered to be a mild treatment.","['Department of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Institute for Medical Technology Assessment, P.O.

We developed a structural strategy to identify co-expressed gene networks that are important for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This strategy compared the distributions of expressional correlations between CML and normal states, and it identified a data-driven threshold to classify strongly co-expressed networks that had the best coherence with CML. Using this strategy, we found a transcriptome-wide reduction of co-expression connectivity in CML, reflecting potentially loosened molecular regulation. Conversely, when we focused on nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) associated networks, NPM1 established more co-expression linkages with BCR-ABL pathways and ribosomal protein networks in CML than normal. This finding implicates a new role of NPM1 in conveying tumorigenic signals from the BCR-ABL oncoprotein to ribosome biogenesis, affecting cellular growth.

However, the exact mechanism of ncRNA guidance, particularly piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), for the targeting of epigenetic regulatory factors to specific gene regions is unclear. Although piRNA function was first established in germ-line cells, piRNA may be crucial in cancer cells. This study investigated the potential roles of CDKN2B-related piRNA in leukemia cells to provide a potential tumorigenesis model of leukemia. CDKN2B-related piRNAs, hsa_piR_014637 and hsa_piR_011186 were transduced into the leukemia cell line U937 to study the effect of these two piRNAs on cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, heterochromatin formation, CDKN2B methylation and expression. Our results show that over-expressing hsa_piR_011186 promoted cell-cycle progression and decreased apoptosis. We also observed inhibition of CDKN2B gene expression. These effects were likely mediated by novel piRC (piRNA complex) of CDKN2B-related piRNA that associate with DNMT1, Suv39H1 and/or EZH2 proteins to modulate the methylation of DNA and histone H3 in the promoter region of the CDKN2B gene. The novel piRC complex facilitated epigenetic modifications on the promoter of cell-cycle regulating genes, providing an expanded view of the role of piRNA in the progression of leukemia cells.","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fuzhou, Fujian, 35001, China.', 'Medical Intensive Care Unit, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, 35001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fuzhou, Fujian, 35001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fuzhou, Fujian, 35001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fuzhou, Fujian, 35001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fuzhou, Fujian, 35001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fuzhou, Fujian, 35001, China.']","['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ACUTE LEUKEMIA', 'CDKN2B GENE', 'DNA METHYLATION', 'EPIGENETICS', 'HISTONE MODIFICATION', 'NON-CODING RNA', 'piRNA COMPLEX (piRC)']",['10.1002/jcb.25199 [doi]'],10.1002/jcb.25199 [doi],,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assembled a unique series of 13 infants with T-ALL, which allowed us to identify genotypic abnormalities and to investigate prenatal origins. Matched samples (diagnosis/remission) were analysed by single nucleotide polymorphism-array to identify genomic losses and gains. In three cases, we identified a recurrent somatic deletion on chromosome 3. These losses result in the complete deletion of MLF1 and have not previously been described in T-ALL. We observed two cases with an 11p13 deletion (LMO2-related), one of which also harboured a deletion of RB1. Another case presented a large 11q14.1-11q23.2 deletion that included ATM and only five patients (38%) showed deletions of CDKN2A/B. Four cases showed NOTCH1 mutations; in one case FBXW7 was the sole mutation and three cases showed alterations in PTEN. KMT2A rearrangements (KMT2A-r) were detected in three out of 13 cases. For three patients, mutations and copy number alterations (including deletion of PTEN) could be backtracked to birth using neonatal blood spot DNA, demonstrating an in utero origin. Overall, our data indicates that iT-ALL has a diverse but distinctive profile of genotypic abnormalities when compared to T-ALL in older children and adults.","['Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Program, Research Centre, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Program, Research Centre, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Paediatric Malignancy Cytogenetics Unit, Institute of Child Health & Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, Robert Debre Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Genetics, Robert Debre Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Haematology Laboratory, Saint-Louis Louis Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Program, Research Centre, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLF1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)']",PMC4737125,['NOTNLM'],"['CNAs and in utero origin', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'genomic profile', 'infant']",['10.1111/bjh.13613 [doi]'],10.1111/bjh.13613 [doi],20150724,,,"['(c) 2015 The Authors.

The papulovesicular eruption of TMD provides an important clue to the diagnosis. In contrast, AMKL rarely has associated cutaneous findings. We report the case of a 22-month-old child with trisomy 21 who presented with the acute onset of diffusely scattered and crusted papules, plaques, and vesicles. A thorough infectious evaluation was negative and the patient was unresponsive to empiric antibiotic and antiinflammatory therapies. Complete blood count (CBC) was notable for mild pancytopenia, with a normal peripheral smear. Two weeks later he was reassessed and found to have a population of blasts on repeat CBC. Subsequent evaluation ultimately led to a diagnosis of AMKL. This is the first reported case of a cutaneous eruption in a young child with Down syndrome and transformed AMKL. When children with trisomy 21 present with the acute onset of crusted papules and vesicles that cannot be accounted for by an infectious etiology, a diagnosis of AMKL should be considered even in the absence of a history of TMD.","[""Section of Dermatology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Dermatology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Dermatology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pathology, Stanford Medical Center, Palo Alto, California.', 'Department of Dermatology, Stanford Medical Center, Palo Alto, California.', 'Department of Dermatology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Section of Dermatology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Dermatology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']","['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', 'Myeloproliferative Syndrome, Transient']",,,,['10.1111/pde.12643 [doi]'],10.1111/pde.12643 [doi],20150723,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tamibarotene is a synthetic retinoid with activity in APL patients who relapse after chemotherapy and ATRA, but has not been studied in relapse after treatment with ATO and ATRA. We report on a phase II study of tamibarotene in adult patients with relapsed or refractory APL after treatment with ATRA and ATO (n = 14). Participants were treated with tamibarotene (6 mg/m(2) /d) during induction and for up to six cycles of consolidation. The overall response rate was 64% (n = 9), the rate of complete cytogenetic response was 43% (n = 6) and the rate of complete molecular response was 21% (n = 3).

Here we report a mechanism underlying the ability of proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (BTZ) and carfilzomib (CFZ) to directly induce oxidative and ER stresses in multiple myeloma (MM) cells via transcriptional repression of a gene encoding mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD2). TXNRD2 is critical for maintenance of intracellular red-ox status and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Depletion of TXNRD2 to the levels detected in BTZ- or CFZ-treated cells causes oxidative stress, ER stress and death similar to those induced by proteasome inhibitors. Reciprocally, restoration of near-wildtype TXNRD2 amounts in MM cells treated with proteasome inhibitors reduces oxidative stress, ER stress and cell death by ~46%, ~35% and ~50%, respectively, compared with cells with unrestored TXNRD2 levels. Moreover, cells from three MM cell lines selected for resistance to BTZ demonstrate elevated levels of TXNRD2, indirectly confirming its functional role in BTZ resistance. Accordingly, ectopic expression of TXNRD2 in MM cell xenografts in immunocompromised mice blunts therapeutic effects of BTZ.

Epub 2015 Jul 24.,"Abnormal activation of SETBP1 through overexpression or missense mutations is highly recurrent in various myeloid malignancies; however, it is unclear whether such activation alone is able to induce leukemia development. Here we show that Setbp1 overexpression in mouse bone marrow progenitors through retroviral transduction is capable of initiating leukemia development in irradiated recipient mice. Before leukemic transformation, Setbp1 overexpression significantly enhances the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and expands granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs). Interestingly, Setbp1 overexpression also causes transcriptional repression of critical hematopoiesis regulator gene Runx1 and this effect is crucial for Setbp1-induced transformation. Runx1 repression is induced by Setbp1-mediated recruitment of a nucleosome remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) complex to Runx1 promoters and can be reversed by treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors Entinostat and Vorinostat. Moreover, treatment with these inhibitors caused efficient differentiation of Setbp1 activation-induced leukemia cells in vitro, and significantly extended the survival of mice transplanted with such leukemias, suggesting that HDAC inhibition could be an effective strategy for treating myeloid malignancies with SETBP1 activation.","['Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Setbp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Hdac1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)']",PMC4703539,,,"['leu2015200 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.200 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.200 [doi],20150724,"['R01 CA143193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL118281/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA143193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL118281/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS708723'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative assessment of BMA performed on day 14 (D14) of chemotherapy, to verify the inter-observer agreement, to compare the results of BMA and BMB, and to evaluate the impact of D14 blast clearance on the overall survival (OS). METHODS: A total of 107 patients who received standard induction chemotherapy and had bone marrow samples were included. BMA evaluation was performed by two observers using two methods: quantitative assessment and a qualitative (Likert) scale. ROC curves were obtained correlating the BMA quantification of blasts and the qualitative scale, by both observers, with BMB result as gold-standard. RESULTS: There was a significant agreement between the two observers in both the qualitative and quantitative assessments (Kw = 0.737, p < 0.001, and rs = 0.798, p < 0.001; ICC = 0.836, p < 0.001, respectively). The areas under the curve (AUC) were 0.924 and 0.946 for observer 1 and 0.867 and 0.870 for observer 2 for assessments of the percentage of blasts and qualitative scale, respectively. The best cutoff for blast percentage in BMA was 6% and 7% for observers 1 and 2, respectively. A similar analysis for the qualitative scale showed the best cutoff as ""probably infiltrated"". Patients who attained higher grades of cytoreduction on D14 had better OS. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of D14 BMA using both methods had a significant agreement with BMB and between observers, identifying a population of patients with poor outcome.","['University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rua Prof. Rodolpho Paulo Rocco, 255, Sala 4A 12, Rio de Janeiro, 22251-030, RJ, Brazil. drjoaotadeu@yahoo.com.br.', 'Faculdade de Medicina de Campos, Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil. drjoaotadeu@yahoo.com.br.', 'Instituto Federal de Educacao, Ciencia e Tecnologia Fluminense, Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil. drjoaotadeu@yahoo.com.br.', 'University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rua Prof. Rodolpho Paulo Rocco, 255, Sala 4A 12, Rio de Janeiro, 22251-030, RJ, Brazil. morgadoloureiro@gmail.com.', 'University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rua Prof. Rodolpho Paulo Rocco, 255, Sala 4A 12, Rio de Janeiro, 22251-030, RJ, Brazil.', 'University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rua Prof. Rodolpho Paulo Rocco, 255, Sala 4A 12, Rio de Janeiro, 22251-030, RJ, Brazil.', 'University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rua Prof. Rodolpho Paulo Rocco, 255, Sala 4A 12, Rio de Janeiro, 22251-030, RJ, Brazil. mnucci@hucff.ufrj.br.', 'University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rua Prof. Rodolpho Paulo Rocco, 255, Sala 4A 12, Rio de Janeiro, 22251-030, RJ, Brazil. doyle66@gmail.com.']",,PMC4513973,,,"['10.1186/s13000-015-0365-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13000-015-0365-2 [pii]']",10.1186/s13000-015-0365-2 [doi],20150725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 23.,"Triclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial used widely in hospitals and personal care products, at ~10 mm. Human skin efficiently absorbs TCS. Mast cells are ubiquitous key players both in physiological processes and in disease, including asthma, cancer and autism. We previously showed that non-cytotoxic levels of TCS inhibit degranulation, the release of histamine and other mediators, from rat basophilic leukemia mast cells (RBL-2H3), and in this study, we replicate this finding in human mast cells (HMC-1.2). Our investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect led to the discovery that TCS disrupts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in RBL-2H3 cells in glucose-free, galactose-containing media (95% confidence interval EC50 = 7.5-9.7 microm), without causing cytotoxicity. Using these same glucose-free conditions, 15 microm TCS dampens RBL-2H3 degranulation by 40%. The same ATP disruption was found with human HMC-1.2 cells (EC50 4.2-13.7 microm), NIH-3 T3 mouse fibroblasts (EC50 4.8-7.4 microm) and primary human keratinocytes (EC50 3.0-4.1 microm) all with no cytotoxicity. TCS increases oxygen consumption rate in RBL-2H3 cells. Known mitochondrial uncouplers (e.g., carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone) previously were found to inhibit mast cell function. TCS-methyl, which has a methyl group in place of the TCS ionizable proton, affects neither degranulation nor ATP production at non-cytotoxic doses. Thus, the effects of TCS on mast cell function are due to its proton ionophore structure. In addition, 5 microm TCS inhibits thapsigargin-stimulated degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells: further evidence that TCS disrupts mast cell signaling. Our data indicate that TCS is a mitochondrial uncoupler, and TCS may affect numerous cell types and functions via this mechanism.

It is in fact a form of acute myeloid leukemia notable for highly aggressive behavior with cutaneous, lymph node and bone marrow involvement. This entity is derived from plasmocytoid dendritic cells and has a predilection for extranodal sites, especially the skin. Elderly male patients are the most affected and the prognostic is poor. The first case was reported in 1994 and sice then, single cases and a few small series have been published. This article presents the case of a previously healthy 56-years-old man, who presented himself to a skin eruption consisting in multiple, large dermal ulcerated tumors, located on the trunk and scalp. The lesions were painless and grew in size rapidly. Physical examination was normal except for the skin lesions.

Experiments with lymphoid U937 and monocytic MonoMac6 cell lines have shown a protective effect of PEMF on the death process in cells treated with death inducers. The aim of the current study was to investigate the influence of PEMF on native proliferating leukocytes originating from newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. The effects of exposure to PEMF were studied in PBMCs from 20 children with ALL. PBMCs were stimulated with three doses of PEMF (7 Hz, 30 mT) for 4 h each with 24 h intervals. After the last stimulation, the cells were double stained with annexin V and propidium iodide dye to estimate viability by flow cytometric analysis. The results indicated an increase of annexin V positive as well as double stained annexin V and propidium iodide positive cells after exposure to threefold PEMF stimulation. A low-frequency pulsed electromagnetic field induces cell death in native proliferating cells isolated from ALL patients. The increased vulnerability of proliferating PBMCs to PEMF-induced interactions may be potentially applied in the therapy of ALL.

Epub 2015 Jul 15.,"Oligonucleotide aptamers can specifically bind biomarkers on cancer cells and can be readily chemically modified with different functional molecules for personalized medicine. To target acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, we developed a single-strand DNA aptamer specific for the biomarker CD117, which is highly expressed on AML cells. Sequence alignment revealed that the aptamer contained a G-rich core region with a well-conserved functional G-quadruplex structure. Functional assays demonstrated that this synthetic aptamer was able to specifically precipitate CD117 proteins from cell lysates, selectively bound cultured and patient primary AML cells with high affinity (Kd < 5 nM), and was specifically internalized into CD117-expressing cells. For targeted AML treatment, aptamer-drug conjugates were fabricated by chemical synthesis of aptamer (Apt) with methotrexate (MTX), a central drug used in AML chemotherapy regimens. The formed Apt-MTX conjugates specifically inhibited AML cell growth, triggered cell apoptosis, and induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Importantly, Apt-MTX had little effect on CD117-negative cells under the same treatment conditions. Moreover, exposure of patient marrow specimens to Apt-MTX resulted in selective growth inhibition of primary AML cells and had no toxicity to off-target background normal marrow cells within the same specimens. These findings indicate the potential clinical value of Apt-MTX for targeted AML therapy with minimal to no side effects in patients, and also open an avenue to chemical synthesis of new, targeted biotherapeutics.","['Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, and Cancer Pathology Laboratory, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, and Cancer Pathology Laboratory, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, and Cancer Pathology Laboratory, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, and Cancer Pathology Laboratory, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Molecular Imaging Innovations Institute, Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, 10021, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital, and Cancer Pathology Laboratory, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.

As hemodilution invariably occurs, a means of determining Bone Marrow Purity (BMP) and normalizing FCM blast counts is essential, especially when blast percentages are diagnostically critical as in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplasia (MDS). By evaluating different leukocyte populations in eight initial patients, a formula to predict BMP was developed and compared to the actual BMP determined by manual counts. Performance of the formula was then validated in 86 AML/MDS patients by comparing normalized FCM blast counts to those determined by the reference manual method. A BMP formula was empirically developed, primarily based on changes in lymphocytes which reliably correlated with the actual BMP (R2 = 0.8955). Components of the formula were derived entirely from automated lymphocyte and total leukocyte counts from the peripheral blood and FCM analyses. BMP formula was then validated in 86 AML/MDS patients. When used to normalize blast counts, the formula showed accurate correction when BMP fell between 40%-90%. In this group, correlation of normalized FCM and manual blast counts was acceptable (R(2) = 0.8335), being greatest at lower blast percentages. Normalization of the FCM blast count appropriately reclassified disease in 26.8% of cases. We identified a practical means of estimating hemodilution and allowing FCM blast normalization in the evaluation of AML and MDS.

Additionally, the t(8;14)(q11.2;q32), which can result in the placement of CEBPD (8q11.2) near the regulatory regions of IGH@ (14q32) and consequent overexpression of CEPBD, occurs at a higher frequency in individuals with Down syndrome-associated ALL (DS-ALL) compared to both the general and pediatric population. The coexistence of cytogenetically detectable ETV6 abnormalities and t(8;14)(q11.2;q32) is a rare occurrence in B-ALL and has only been reported in a single case in the literature. FINDINGS: Herein, we present a case of B-ALL in a 9-year old male with Down syndrome in which conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed two reciprocal translocations: a t(8;14)(q11.2;q32) and a t(2;12)(p12;p13). Interphase and metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using break apart probes confirmed the involvement of IGH@ and ETV6 in these translocations, respectively. Additionally, interphase FISH revealed a clonal subpopulation bearing biallelic IGH@ rearrangements not observed by conventional cytogenetic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of B-ALL bearing an ETV6 translocation with a partner gene on the short arm of chromosome 2 confirmed by FISH. Additionally, it is the second reported case of t(8;14)(q11.2;q32)-ALL bearing a concomitant, cytogenetically detectable abnormality involving ETV6. This case provides insight into a novel translocation involving ETV6 as well as potentially unique and understudied mechanisms of clonal evolution in pediatric B-ALL.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA USA.']",,PMC4509750,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'Cytogenetics', 'ETV6', 'FISH']","['10.1186/s40364-015-0036-1 [doi]', '36 [pii]']",10.1186/s40364-015-0036-1 [doi],20150605,,,,,,,,,['Biomark Res. 2015;3:27.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: B7-H3 knockdown in the U937 cell line was performed using small hairpin (sh)RNA lentivirus transduction. The effects on cell proliferation, cycle, migration, and invasion were investigated by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, methyl cellulose colony-forming assay, propidium iodide staining, and Transwell assays in vitro. Changes in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, when combined with chemotherapy drugs, were determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 and Annexin V-FITC/PI assays. U937 xenograft models were used to assess the effects of B7-H3 on tumorigenicity and the therapeutic effect of B7-H3 knockdown in combination with chemotherapy drugs in vivo. RESULTS: Downregulation of B7-H3 significantly decreased U937 cell growth and colony-forming ability. The mean inhibition rate of tumor growth with B7-H3 knockdown was 59.4%, and the expression of both Ki-67 and PCNA in xenografts was significantly reduced. After B7-H3 silencing, the U937 cell cycle was arrested at the G0/G1 phase. The cell migration rate of B7-H3 knockdown cells was reduced more than fivefold, and invasion capacity decreased by 86.7%. B7-H3 RNAi profoundly increased the antitumor effect of chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. On day 19, inhibition rates of tumor growth in B7-H3 shRNA combined with idarubicin, cytarabine, and idarubicin plus cytarabine were 70.5%, 80.0%, and 90.0%, respectively (P=0.006, P=0.004, and P=0.016, respectively). CONCLUSION: B7-H3 may promote U937 cell progression, and shRNA targeting B7-H3 significantly enhances sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. These results may provide new insight into the function of B7-H3 and a promising therapeutic approach targeting B7-H3 in acute monocytic leukemia.","[""Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",,PMC4508088,['NOTNLM'],"['B7-H3', 'acute monocytic leukemia', 'cancer gene therapy', 'chemosensitivity']","['10.2147/OTT.S85272 [doi]', 'ott-8-1721 [pii]']",10.2147/OTT.S85272 [doi],20150714,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 22.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify a brief screening measure for detection of cognitive deficit in children treated for cerebellar tumors that would be useful in clinical practice. METHODS: A sample of 72 children, aged 8-14 years, and within 3 years post diagnosis for standard-risk medulloblastoma (n = 37) or low-grade cerebellar astrocytoma (n = 35) and 38 children in a nontumor group were assessed using teacher-, parent-, and child-report of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). The accuracy of these scores as a screen for a full-scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) < 80 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV UK) was assessed using their receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The questionnaires with the highest areas under the ROC curves were the child- and parent-report PedsQL, the teacher-report BRIEF, and the SDQ. At optimal cutoff scores, their sensitivities (95% CIs) to cases of FSIQ < 80 were 84 (60-96)%, 65 (41-84)%, 79 (54-93)%, and 84 (60-96)%, and their specificities (95% CIs) were 79 (68-86)%, 87 (77-93)%, 77 (66-86)%, and 71 (64-84)% respectively. All cases of FSIQ < 80 screened positive on either teacher-report SDQ or self-report PedsQL. CONCLUSIONS: The PedsQL child- and parent-report and the teacher-report BRIEF and SDQ have moderately good accuracy for discriminating between children with and without a FSIQ < 80. The PedsQL could be used in a clinical setting, and the BRIEF and SDQ in an educational setting, to screen for cases with FSIQ < 80 in children treated for brain tumors.","[""Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK (K.S.B., H.M.Y, C.R.K.); University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK (C.R.K.); School of Psychology, Faculty of Social and Human Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK (C.L.); Division of Health and Social Care Research, King's College London, London, UK (J.L.P.); NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK (J.L.P.)."", ""Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK (K.S.B., H.M.Y, C.R.K.); University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK (C.R.K.); School of Psychology, Faculty of Social and Human Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK (C.L.); Division of Health and Social Care Research, King's College London, London, UK (J.L.P.); NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK (J.L.P.)."", ""Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK (K.S.B., H.M.Y, C.R.K.); University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK (C.R.K.); School of Psychology, Faculty of Social and Human Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK (C.L.); Division of Health and Social Care Research, King's College London, London, UK (J.L.P.); NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK (J.L.P.)."", ""Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK (K.S.B., H.M.Y, C.R.K.); University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK (C.R.K.); School of Psychology, Faculty of Social and Human Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK (C.L.); Division of Health and Social Care Research, King's College London, London, UK (J.L.P.); NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK (J.L.P.)."", ""Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK (K.S.B., H.M.Y, C.R.K.); University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK (C.R.K.); School of Psychology, Faculty of Social and Human Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK (C.L.); Division of Health and Social Care Research, King's College London, London, UK (J.L.P.); NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK (J.L.P.).""]",,PMC4633931,['NOTNLM'],"['cerebellar tumors', 'children', 'cognitive deficit', 'health-related quality of life', 'screening']","['nov129 [pii]', '10.1093/neuonc/nov129 [doi]']",10.1093/neuonc/nov129 [doi],20150722,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2015.

Epub 2015 Jul 22.,"PURPOSE: Targeted MEK inhibition is an emerging therapy in a number of solid tumors. It holds particular promise in BRAF V600E mutation-positive malignant melanoma, where constitutive activation and cell growth through the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway is well established. In vitro and preclinical research indicates that MAPK pathway activation is important in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) leukemogenesis; however, the potential of MEK inhibition has not yet been investigated clinically in the setting of such hematologic malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We report a case of complete hematologic response of CML to MEK inhibition in a patient with synchronous metastatic melanoma, who received treatment with combination BRAF and MEK1/2 inhibitors. We studied the effects of these agents on proliferation and outgrowth of myeloid precursors, and longitudinal shifts in peripheral blood phenotyping during the course of treatment. A model cell line system was used to examine the effects of dabrafenib and trametinib on MAPK and BCR-ABL1 signaling. RESULTS: After 35 weeks on treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors, complete hematologic response was observed without recourse to BCR-ABL1-targeted therapy. MEK inhibition was principally responsible for impaired proliferation of both mature and primitive myeloid precursors, as well as growth and hemoglobinization of erythroid precursors. Paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway was seen in response to BRAF inhibitor therapy but this was easily overcome by clinically relevant doses of concurrent MEK inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that further evaluation of the optimal MAPK targeting approach is warranted to extend therapeutic options in CML.","['Medical Oncology, Austin Health, Austin Hospital, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.

We reasoned that targeted inhibition of a prominent nuclear exporter, XPO1/CRM1, could eradicate self-renewing leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) whose survival depends on timely XPO1-mediated transport of specific protein and RNA cargoes. Using an immunosuppressed mouse model bearing primary patient-derived AML cells, we demonstrate that selinexor (KPT-330), an oral antagonist of XPO1 that is currently in clinical trials, has strong activity against primary AML cells while sparing normal stem and progenitor cells. Importantly, limiting dilution transplantation assays showed that this cytotoxic activity is not limited to the rapidly proliferating bulk population of leukemic cells but extends to the LICs, whose inherent drug resistance and unrestricted self-renewal capacity has been implicated in the difficulty of curing AML patients with conventional chemotherapy alone.","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics, Natick, MA, USA.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics, Natick, MA, USA.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics, Natick, MA, USA.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics, Natick, MA, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplantation, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]","['0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '31TZ62FO8F (selinexor)']",PMC4994896,,,"['leu2015194 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.194 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.194 [doi],20150723,"['K08 CA160660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS811276'],,,,,,,,,,,"['BK, SS, MK and YL are employees of Karyopharm Therapeutics Incorporated and', 'receive compensation and hold equity in the company.

We report that nuclear beta-catenin has a role in leukemia cell-intrinsic but not -extrinsic BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent TKI resistance. Upon imatinib inhibition of BCR-ABL1 kinase activity, beta-catenin expression was maintained in intrinsically resistant cells grown in suspension culture and sensitive cells cultured in direct contact (DC) with bone marrow (BM) stromal cells. Thus, TKI resistance uncouples beta-catenin expression from BCR-ABL1 kinase activity. In beta-catenin reporter assays, intrinsically resistant cells showed increased transcriptional activity versus parental TKI-sensitive controls, and this was associated with restored expression of beta-catenin target genes. In contrast, DC with BM stromal cells promoted TKI resistance, but had little effects on Lef/Tcf reporter activity and no consistent effects on cytoplasmic beta-catenin levels, arguing against a role for beta-catenin in extrinsic TKI resistance. N-cadherin or H-cadherin blocking antibodies abrogated DC-based resistance despite increasing Lef/Tcf reporter activity, suggesting that factors other than beta-catenin contribute to extrinsic, BM-derived TKI resistance. Our data indicate that, while nuclear beta-catenin enhances survival of intrinsically TKI-resistant CML progenitors, it is not required for extrinsic resistance mediated by the BM microenvironment.","['Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Beijing Tsinghua Chang Gung Hospital, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']","['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC4675686,,,"['leu2015196 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.196 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.196 [doi],20150723,"['P01CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA093247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA093247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30CA042014-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA042014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA178397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS708097'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present our unexpected finding that OCT4 is involved in the enhancement of cytokine-induced expansion capabilities of human cord blood (CB) HSC. Activation of OCT4 by Oct4-activating compound 1 (OAC1) in CB CD34(+) cells enhanced ex vivo expansion of HSC, as determined by a rigorously defined set of markers for human HSC, and in vivo short-term and long-term repopulating ability in NSG mice. Limiting dilution analysis revealed that OAC1 treatment resulted in 3.5-fold increase in the number of SCID repopulating cells (SRCs) compared with that in day 0 uncultured CD34(+) cells and 6.3-fold increase compared with that in cells treated with control vehicle. Hematopoietic progenitor cells, as assessed by in vitro colony formation, were also enhanced. Furthermore, we showed that OAC1 treatment led to OCT4-mediated upregulation of HOXB4. Consistently, siRNA-mediated knockdown of HOXB4 expression suppressed effects of OAC1 on ex vivo expansion of HSC. Our study has identified the OCT4-HOXB4 axis in ex vivo expansion of human CB HSC.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Soonchunhyang Institute of Medi-bio Science, Chungcheongnam-do, Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Konkuk University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Konkuk University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']","['0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (POU5F1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",PMC4703453,,,"['leu2015189 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.189 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.189 [doi],20150723,"['P01 DK090948/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL67384/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 DK106846/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL067384/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL112669/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK090948/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS707557'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is strong evidence for the poor prognosis of IKZF1 deletions affecting exons 4-7 and exons 1-8, but evidence for the remaining 33% of cases harboring other variants of IKZF1 deletions is lacking. In an international multicenter study we analyzed the prognostic value of these rare variants in a case-control design. Each IKZF1-deleted case was matched to three IKZF1 wild-type controls based on cytogenetic subtype, treatment protocol, risk stratification arm, white blood cell count and age. Hazard ratios for the prognostic impact of rare IKZF1 deletions on event-free survival were calculated by matched pair Cox regression. Matched pair analysis for all 134 cases with rare IKZF1 deletions together revealed a poor prognosis (P<0.001) that was evident in each risk stratification arm. Rare variant types with the most unfavorable event-free survival were DEL 2-7 (P=0.03), DEL 2-8 (P=0.002) and DEL-Other (P<0.001). The prognosis of each type of rare variant was equal or worse compared with the well-known major DEL 4-7 and DEL 1-8 IKZF1 deletion variants. We therefore conclude that all variants of rare IKZF1 deletions are associated with an unfavorable prognosis in pediatric BCP-ALL.","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Biostatistics, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'DCOG, Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, the Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'DCOG, Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, the Hague, The Netherlands.', 'DCOG, Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, the Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center and Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'DCOG, Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, the Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'COALL Study Group, Research Centre and Clinic for Pediatric Oncology, University Medical Centre Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'BFM-G, Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-Germany Study Group, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'CLIP, Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'AIEOP, Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'CLIP, Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP, Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Pediatric Haematology and Oncology Program, Research Centre, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Haematology and Oncology Program, Research Centre, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'PPLLSG, Polish Pediatric Leukaemia Lymphoma Study Group, Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Haematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'PPLLSG, Polish Pediatric Leukaemia Lymphoma Study Group, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Silesia, Zabrze, Poland.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", ""BFM-A, Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-Austria Study Group, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, St Anna Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""ANZCHOG, Australian and New Zealand Children's Oncology Group, Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", ""ANZCHOG, Australian and New Zealand Children's Oncology Group, Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', ""Department of Haematology, Sheffield Children's Hospital, Sheffield, UK."", 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'BFM-G, Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-Germany Study Group, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'AIEOP, Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'AIEOP, Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'DCOG, Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, the Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'DCOG, Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, the Hague, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",,,,"['leu2015199 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.199 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.199 [doi],20150723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0188-6005'],,

In contrast to JAK2 mutations being mainly associated with polycythaemia vera, CALR mutations are only associated with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and essential thrombocythaemia (ET). CALR mutations are present in the majority of PMF and ET patients lacking JAK2 and MPL mutations. As these CALR mutations are absent from reactive bone marrow (BM) lesions their presence indicates ET or PMF. So far these mutations are detectable only by molecular assays. Their molecular detection is cumbersome because of the great CALR mutation heterogeneity. Therefore, the availability of a simple assay would be of great help. All CALR mutations reported lead to a frameshift generating a new 36 amino-acid C-terminus. We generated a monoclonal antibody (CAL2) to this C-neoterminus by immunizing mice with a representative peptide and compared its performance with Sanger sequencing data in 173 MPNs and other BM diseases. There was a 100% correlation between the molecular and the CAL2 immunohistochemical (IHC) assays. Thus, the detection of CALR mutations by the CAL2 IHC is a specific, sensitive, rapid, simple and low-cost method.","['Reference and Consultation Center for Lymphoma and Haematopathology, Pathodiagnostik Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Reference and Consultation Center for Lymphoma and Haematopathology, Pathodiagnostik Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Reference and Consultation Center for Lymphoma and Haematopathology, Pathodiagnostik Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Synaptic Systems GmbH, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Praxis fur Onkologie, Ludenscheid, Germany.', 'Senckenbergisches Institut fur Pathologie, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Synaptic Systems GmbH, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Medizinisches Versorgungszentrum am Helios Klinikum Emil von Behring, Labor fur molekulare Diagnostik und Mikrobiologie, Berlin, Germany.', 'Medizinisches Versorgungszentrum am Helios Klinikum Emil von Behring, Labor fur molekulare Diagnostik und Mikrobiologie, Berlin, Germany.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",PMC4705422,,,"['leu2015192 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.192 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.192 [doi],20150723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the metabolic responses of cancer cells that permit their survival in different microenvironments. We have used a nuclear magnetic resonance based approach to monitor metabolism in living primary chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) cells and to interrogate their real-time metabolic responses to hypoxia. Our studies demonstrate considerable metabolic plasticity in CLL cells. Despite being in oxygenated blood, circulating CLL cells are primed for hypoxia as measured by constitutively low level hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1alpha) activity and modest lactate production from glycolysis. Upon entry to hypoxia we observed rapid upregulation of metabolic rates. CLL cells that had adapted to hypoxia returned to the 'primed' state when re-oxygenated and again showed the same adaptive response upon secondary exposure to hypoxia. We also observed HIF-1alpha independent differential utilization of pyruvate in oxygenated and hypoxic conditions. When oxygenated, CLL cells released pyruvate, but in hypoxia imported pyruvate to protect against hypoxia-associated oxidative stress. Finally, we identified a marked association of slower resting glucose and glutamine consumption, and lower alanine and lactate production with Binet A0 stage samples indicating that CLL may be divided into tumors with higher and lower metabolic states that reflect disease stage.","['School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']","['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '8558G7RUTR (Pyruvic Acid)']",PMC4705428,,,"['leu2015187 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.187 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.187 [doi],20150723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One thousand sixty-seven patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were studied for their transfusion dependency at initial presentation and transfusion frequency during induction chemotherapy. Three hundred five patients (29 %) showed initial dependence to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and 109 (10 %) to platelet transfusion. Transfusion dependency at presentation was associated with a poorer prognosis. Both initial RBC and platelet transfusion needs were associated with lower response rates (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03). Median overall survival (OS) was 10.8 months for patients with RBC need vs 18.8 months for the other patients (P = 0.02) and 6.8 months for patients with platelet transfusion need vs 13.6 months for the others (P = 0.01). Similarly, transfusion intensity during induction therapy influenced negatively treatment outcome. Median transfusion burden per week was 2.5 (range 0-25.7) RBC units and 1.6 (range 0-15.7) platelet concentrates (PCs). Both high RBC and PC transfusion intensities were associated with lower response rates (P = 0.003 and P < 0.0001). Median OS was 9.08 months for patients with RBC transfusions >3/week vs 18.29 months for those with RBC transfusions </=3/week (P = 0.0003) and 10.75 months for patients with PC transfusions >2/week vs 19.96 months for those with PC </=2/week (P = 0.0003). RBC and platelet transfusion intensities during induction therapy remained of prognostic value in multivariate analysis. Transfusion need at presentation and the frequency of transfusions during induction chemotherapy appear as strong prognostic factors.","['Hemovigilance Department, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Edouard Herriot and Croix-Rousse Hospitals, Lyon, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 165 chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69495, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, Blood Bank Center, Lyon, Rhone-Alpes, France.', 'Hemovigilance Department, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Edouard Herriot and Croix-Rousse Hospitals, Lyon, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, Blood Bank Center, Lyon, Rhone-Alpes, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, Blood Bank Center, Lyon, Rhone-Alpes, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 165 chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69495, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 165 chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69495, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital, 165 chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69495, Pierre Benite, France. xavier.thomas@chu-lyon.fr.']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chemotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Transfusion dependency', 'Transfusion intensity']","['10.1007/s00277-015-2456-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-015-2456-2 [pii]']",10.1007/s00277-015-2456-2 [doi],20150723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 May 15.,"BACKGROUND: The outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia has improved because of intensive chemotherapy and supportive care. The frequency of adverse events has also increased, but the data related to acute central nervous system complications during acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment are sparse. The purpose of this study is to evaluate these complications and to determine their long term outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the hospital reports of 323 children with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia from a 13-year period for acute neurological complications. The central nervous system complications of leukemic involvement, peripheral neuropathy, and post-treatment late-onset encephalopathy, and neurocognitive defects were excluded. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 323 children (7.1%) suffered from central nervous system complications during acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. The majority of these complications (n = 13/23; 56.5%) developed during the induction period. The complications included posterior reversible encephalopathy (n = 6), fungal abscess (n = 5), cerebrovascular lesions (n = 5), syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (n = 4), and methotrexate encephalopathy (n = 3). Three of these 23 children (13%) died of central nervous system complications, one from an intracranial fungal abscess and the others from intracranial thrombosis. Seven of the survivors (n = 7/20; 35%) became epileptic and three of them had also developed mental and motor retardation. CONCLUSIONS: Acute central neurological complications are varied and require an urgent approach for proper diagnosis and treatment. Collaboration among the hematologist, radiologist, neurologist, microbiologist, and neurosurgeon is essential to prevent fatal outcome and serious morbidity.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Uludag University Medical Faculty, Bursa, Turkey.

Epub 2015 Jul 22.,"Increased expression of the interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) has been reported in acute leukemia and solid tumors, but the role of PKR has been unclear. Now, our results indicate that high PKR expression in CD34(+) cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients correlates with worse survival and shortened remission duration. Significantly, we find that PKR has a novel and previously unrecognized nuclear function to inhibit DNA damage response signaling and double-strand break repair. Nuclear PKR antagonizes ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation by a mechanism dependent on protein phosphatase 2A activity. Thus, inhibition of PKR expression or activity promotes ATM activation, gamma-H2AX formation, and phosphorylation of NBS1 following ionizing irradiation. PKR transgenic but not PKR null mice demonstrate a mutator phenotype characterized by radiation-induced and age-associated genomic instability that was partially reversed by short-term pharmacologic PKR inhibition. Furthermore, the age-associated accumulation of somatic mutations that occurs in the Nup98-HOXD13 (NHD13) mouse model of leukemia progression was significantly elevated by co-expression of a PKR transgene, whereas knockout of PKR expression or pharmacologic inhibition of PKR activity reduced the frequency of spontaneous mutations in vivo. Thus, PKR cooperated with the NHD13 transgene to accelerate leukemia progression and shorten survival. Taken together, these results indicate that increased nuclear PKR has an oncogenic function that promotes the accumulation of potentially deleterious mutations. Thus, PKR inhibition may be a therapeutically useful strategy to prevent leukemia progression or relapse, and improve clinical outcomes.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; and University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL;', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; and University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL; Division of Hematology-Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN;', 'University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; and University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL;', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; and University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL;']","['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxd13 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",PMC4582335,,,"['S0006-4971(20)30891-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-03-635227 [doi]']",10.1182/blood-2015-03-635227 [doi],20150722,"['R01 HL054083/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK074367/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000064/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001427/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['Blood. 2015 Sep 24;126(13):1523-4.

Epub 2015 Jul 23.,"BACKGROUND: The effect of artificial sweetener consumption on cancer risk has been debated in animal models for over four decades. To further investigate this relationship, this study aims to synthesise results from several of the most recent studies in humans. METHODS: An online literature search was performed in MEDLINE from 2003 to 2014 using Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using keywords 'artificial', 'sweetener' and 'cancer'. Ninety-two results were then manually assessed for eligibility. Studies were included if the relationship between artificial sweeteners and cancer was their central hypothesis, and if they adjusted for age, gender, smoking status and body mass index. Extracted data included study design, patient characteristics, outcome measure and results. RESULTS: In the five publications that satisfied the inclusion criteria, significant direct associations with artificial consumption were found for laryngeal (odds ratio, OR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.20-4.55), urinary tract tumours (OR 2.12, 95% CI: 1.22-3.89), non-Hodgkin lymphoma in men (RR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.01-1.72), multiple myeloma in men (RR 2.02, 95% CI: 1.20-3.40) and leukaemia (RR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.00-2.02). Inverse relationships were found in breast (OR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.54-0.91, p trend = 0.015) and ovarian (OR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.38-0.81, p trend < 0.001) cancers. CONCLUSION: The statistical value of this review is limited by the heterogeneity and observational designs of the included studies.

Intestinal bacteria play a major role in inflammation and augmenting the GVHD cytokine response. Early studies in murine models showed that manipulating the presence of intestinal flora or counteracting its byproducts could limit GVHD. Thus multiple clinical trials targeting gut decontamination were conducted, with the aims of modulating inflammation and protecting against GVHD, with mixed results.

While the multi-step model of pediatric leukemogenesis suggests interplay between constitutional and somatic genomes, the role of inherited genetic variability remains largely undescribed. Nonsyndromic familial ALL, although extremely rare, provides the ideal setting to study inherited contributions to ALL. Toward this goal, we sequenced the exomes of a childhood ALL family consisting of mother, father and two non-twinned siblings diagnosed with concordant pre-B hyperdiploid ALL and previously shown to have inherited a rare form of PRDM9, a histone H3 methyltransferase involved in crossing-over at recombination hotspots and Holliday junctions. We postulated that inheritance of additional rare disadvantaging variants in predisposing cancer genes could affect genomic stability and lead to increased risk of hyperdiploid ALL within this family. METHODS: Whole exomes were captured using Agilent's SureSelect kit and sequenced on the Life Technologies SOLiD System. We applied a data reduction strategy to identify candidate variants shared by both affected siblings. Under a recessive disease model, we focused on rare non-synonymous or frame-shift variants in leukemia predisposing pathways. RESULTS: Though the family was nonsyndromic, we identified a combination of rare variants in Fanconi anemia (FA) genes FANCP/SLX4 (compound heterozygote - rs137976282/rs79842542) and FANCA (rs61753269) and a rare homozygous variant in the Holliday junction resolvase GEN1 (rs16981869). These variants, predicted to affect protein function, were previously identified in familial breast cancer cases. Based on our in-house database of 369 childhood ALL exomes, the sibs were the only patients to carry this particularly rare combination and only a single hyperdiploid patient was heterozygote at both FANCP/SLX4 positions, while no FANCA variant allele carriers were identified. FANCA is the most commonly mutated gene in FA and is essential for resolving DNA interstrand cross-links during replication. FANCP/SLX4 and GEN1 are involved in the cleavage of Holliday junctions and their mutated forms, in combination with the rare allele of PRDM9, could alter Holliday junction resolution leading to nondisjunction of chromosomes and segregation defects. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that concomitant inheritance of rare variants in FANCA, FANCP/SLX4 and GEN1 on the specific genetic background of this familial case, could lead to increased genomic instability, hematopoietic dysfunction, and higher risk of childhood leukemia.","['Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada. jf.spinella@gmail.com.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada. jasmine.healy@umontreal.ca.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada. vr.saillour@gmail.com.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada. cricher.hsj@gmail.com.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada. cassart.pauline@gmail.com.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada. manon.ouimet@recherche-ste-justine.qc.ca.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada. daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada. daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, 3175 Cote Ste-Catherine, Montreal (Quebec), H3T 1C5, Canada. daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca.']","['0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (PRDM9 protein, human)']",PMC4512039,,,"['10.1186/s12885-015-1549-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-015-1549-6 [pii]']",10.1186/s12885-015-1549-6 [doi],20150723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cutaneous manifestations of small lymphocytic lymphoma are infrequent and the literature regarding them sparse. We describe here a case of a patient with a history of small lymphocytic lymphoma who developed perniosis-like features of the digits. CASE PRESENTATION: An 86-year old male patient with previously diagnosed small lymphocytic lymphoma developed painful erythematous swelling of the periungual area of his fingers and toes. This was associated with a dense dermal infiltration of CD5-positive B-lymphoid cells consistent with his low-grade B-cell lymphoma. Although partially refractory to local radiotherapy, the painful swelling of the fingers and toes resolved fully following systemic therapy with chlorambucil and rituximab. CONCLUSIONS: This unusual cutaneous manifestation of a lymphoma and the favourable response to systemic therapy may be instructive for the management of other patients who develop similar perniosis-like features.","['Louisiana State University School of Medicine, 1501 Kings Hwy, Shreveport, LA, 71103, USA. tmorr4@lsuhsc.edu.', 'British Columbia Cancer Agency, 2410 Lee Avenue, Victoria, British Columbia, V8R 6 V5, Canada. rosetta.mazzola@bccancer.bc.ca.', 'Department of Pathology, Island Health, Victoria, British Columbia, V8R 1 J8, Canada. brian.berry@viha.ca.', 'Department of Pathology, Island Health, Victoria, British Columbia, V8R 1 J8, Canada. doug.sawyer@viha.ca.', 'British Columbia Cancer Agency, 2410 Lee Avenue, Victoria, British Columbia, V8R 6 V5, Canada.

Here we develop a competitive HSPC transplant method in adult zebrafish, using in vivo imaging as a non-invasive readout. We use this system to conduct a chemical screen, and identify epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) as a family of lipids that enhance HSPC engraftment. The pro-haematopoietic effects of EETs were conserved in the developing zebrafish embryo, where 11,12-EET promoted HSPC specification by activating a unique activator protein 1 (AP-1) and runx1 transcription program autonomous to the haemogenic endothelium. This effect required the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) pathway, specifically PI(3)Kgamma. In adult HSPCs, 11,12-EET induced transcriptional programs, including AP-1 activation, which modulate several cellular processes, such as migration, to promote engraftment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the EET effects on enhancing HSPC homing and engraftment are conserved in mammals. Our study establishes a new method to explore the molecular mechanisms of HSPC engraftment, and discovers a previously unrecognized, evolutionarily conserved pathway regulating multiple haematopoietic generation and regeneration processes. EETs may have clinical application in marrow or cord blood transplantation.","[""1] Stem Cell Program and Division of Haematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,

In this setting, alemtuzumab was recognized to be effective. This retrospective study evaluates long-term efficacy and tolerability of low-dose alemtuzumab in relapsed/refractory CLL and correlates clinical outcome with biological feature. Sixty-two consecutive patients (median age 68 years) were evaluated; alemtuzumab was administered 30 mg weekly for up to 18 weeks. Among the patients included in the analysis, 37% were fludarabine-refractory, 33.3% carried a TP53 disruption, 14.8% a NOTCH1 mutation and 9% a SF3B1 mutation. Overall response rate (ORR) was 61.3% (complete remission 25.8%). After a median follow-up of 43 months, overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were 43.1 and 15 months, respectively; while ORR was 77.8% for patients carrying TP53 disruptions (OS 33.8 months) and 43.5% for fludarabine-refractory patients (OS 30 months). Noteworthy, long-term survivors (OS >/= 36 months) were 54.8%. None of the biological poor risk factors negatively impacted on ORR, PFS and OS. Grade >/=3 cytopenia occurred in 24.2% patients, 6.5% experienced a grade >/=3 non-CMV infection and no grade >/=3 CMV-event occurred. In conclusion, low dose-alemtuzumab is safe and effective in relapsed/refractory CLL, also in a long-term follow-up and high-risk genetic subgroups.","[""Hematology Unit, IRCCS Ca'granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan, via Francesco Sforza, 35, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, IRCCS Ca'granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan, via Francesco Sforza, 35, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, IRCCS Ca'granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan, via Francesco Sforza, 35, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, IRCCS Ca'granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan, via Francesco Sforza, 35, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, IRCCS Ca'granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico and University of Milan, via Francesco Sforza, 35, Milan, Italy."", 'Biostatistics Unit, Regina Elena Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment, via Elio Chianesi, 53, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Dept.

Early recovery of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) during induction therapy is emerging as a reliable favorable prognostic indicator that may hold its relevance in resource-constraint settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of medical records of 212 patients of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, aged less than 18 years, treated between January 1996 and December 2009. Time to lymphocyte recovery was analyzed with respect to various prognostic factors and survival and Martingale residuals were used to define ALC cut-offs. RESULTS: High-risk disease characteristics including older age (10 y and older), National Cancer Institute high risk, and central nervous system disease at diagnosis were associated with delayed lymphocyte recovery. The 5-year event-free, relapse-free, and overall survival of patients with day 15 ALC of >/= 500 cells/microL and day 29 ALC of >/= 1000 cells/microL was 81.7% +/- 4%, 86.4% +/- 2.8%, 91.0% +/- 3%, respectively, compared with those with delayed recovery (16.6% +/- 5.6%, 19.3% +/- 6.4%, 32.8% +/- 7.2%, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis both these ALC cut-offs retained their significance as prognostic variables of survival. CONCLUSION: Our analysis revealed ALC to be an important independent predictor of treatment outcome and may provide key prognostic information in settings where minimal residual disease-based risk stratification is not feasible.","['*Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Rohini daggerDepartment of Biostatistics, Army College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, India.']",,,,,"['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000249 [doi]', '00043426-201504000-00020 [pii]']",10.1097/MPH.0000000000000249 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sumoylation has roles in the control of protein stability, activity and localization, and is involved in the regulation of transcription, gene expression, chromatin structure, nuclear transport and RNA metabolism. Sumoylation is also linked, both positively and negatively, with the replication of many different viruses both in terms of modification of viral proteins and modulation of sumoylated cellular proteins that influence the efficiency of infection. One prominent example of the latter is the widespread reduction in the levels of cellular sumoylated species induced by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) ubiquitin ligase ICP0. This activity correlates with relief from intrinsic immunity antiviral defence mechanisms. Previous work has shown that ICP0 is selective in substrate choice, with some sumoylated proteins such the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML being extremely sensitive, while RanGAP is completely resistant. Here we present a comprehensive proteomic analysis of changes in the cellular SUMO2 proteome during HSV-1 infection. Amongst the 877 potentially sumoylated species detected, we identified 124 whose abundance was decreased by a factor of 3 or more by the virus, several of which were validated by western blot and expression analysis. We found many previously undescribed substrates of ICP0 whose degradation occurs by a range of mechanisms, influenced or not by sumoylation and/or the SUMO2 interaction motif within ICP0. Many of these proteins are known or are predicted to be involved in the regulation of transcription, chromatin assembly or modification. These results present novel insights into mechanisms and host cell proteins that might influence the efficiency of HSV-1 infection.","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, The Sir Michael Stoker Building, University of Glasgow Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Gene Regulation and Expression, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Sir James Black Centre, Dundee, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, The Sir Michael Stoker Building, University of Glasgow Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, The Sir Michael Stoker Building, University of Glasgow Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, The Sir Michael Stoker Building, University of Glasgow Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Gene Regulation and Expression, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Sir James Black Centre, Dundee, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, The Sir Michael Stoker Building, University of Glasgow Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.']","['0 (Proteome)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",PMC4511656,,,"['10.1371/journal.ppat.1005059 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-14-02677 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.ppat.1005059 [doi],20150722,"['097945/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '13067/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '098391/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'C434/A13067/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12014/4/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U130169966/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '098391/Z/12/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lower cutoff level of >/=10% blasts in peripheral blood and >/=9% in bone marrow aspirate gave an excellent specificity for NPMc+ AML and a positive-predictive value of 90.9% and a negative-predictive value of 87.6% for NPMc+ AML.

Epub 2015 Jul 22.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the complications that we observed in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during the remission induction, consolidation, and reinduction phases of chemotherapy retrospectively. METHODS: We analysed the clinical records of 128 patients with ALL who were diagnosed and treated in the Department of Pediatric Hematology of Istanbul Medeniyet University Goztepe Training Hospital between August 2009 and April 2014 to document the acute complication other than febrile neutropenia episodes, which developed during the induction, consolidation and reinduction phases of chemotherapy. RESULTS: We documented 279 complications. Of these, 53.05% were in males, 46.95% in females; 32.26% were in standard-risk, 45.52% in medium-risk, 22.22% in high-risk group of patients. Common documented events were pneumonia (25%), therapy-induced hyperglycemia (16.40%) therapy-related hepatitis (15.6%), generalized tonic-clonic seizures (14.8%), anaphylaxis to asparaginase (14.1%), hypertension (13.3%) varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection (13.3%), renal tubulopathy (12.5%). Time of complications was induction phase in 32.62%, consolidation in 19.35%, HR blocks in 18.28%, reinduction 29.75% during the phases. Mortality rate due to complications was 13.28%. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy-related complications can limit the survival rates in children with ALL. To minimize the treatment burden, even very rare complications must be considered and treated promptly with a multidisciplinary approach.","['Pediatric Hematology Department, Goztepe Training Hospital, Istanbul Medeniyet University, Istanbul, Turkey - canbolataylin@hotmail.com.', 'Pediatric Hematology Department, Goztepe Training Hospital, Istanbul Medeniyet University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology Department, Goztepe Training Hospital, Istanbul Medeniyet University, Istanbul, Turkey.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,"['10.23736/S0026-4946.16.04239-0 [doi]', 'R15Y9999N00A150050 [pii]']",10.23736/S0026-4946.16.04239-0 [doi],20150722,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe a comprehensive evaluation of the genomic landscape of 452 CLL cases and 54 patients with monoclonal B-lymphocytosis, a precursor disorder. We extend the number of CLL driver alterations, including changes in ZNF292, ZMYM3, ARID1A and PTPN11. We also identify novel recurrent mutations in non-coding regions, including the 3' region of NOTCH1, which cause aberrant splicing events, increase NOTCH1 activity and result in a more aggressive disease. In addition, mutations in an enhancer located on chromosome 9p13 result in reduced expression of the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5. The accumulative number of driver alterations (0 to >/=4) discriminated between patients with differences in clinical behaviour. This study provides an integrated portrait of the CLL genomic landscape, identifies new recurrent driver mutations of the disease, and suggests clinical interventions that may improve the management of this neoplasia.","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia (IUOPA), Universidad de Oviedo, 33006 Oviedo, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions

CASE REPORT: The patient was a 48-year-old man, who had a history of hairy cell leukemia. Three days after completion of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CDA) chemotherapy, the patient started experiencing abdominal pain. An extensive gastroenterological workup culminated in the patient getting an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that revealed duodenal inflammation and biopsies were taken. The duodenal biopsy was positive for chronic inflammatory infiltrate, primarily consisting of atypical lymphocytes and plasma cells with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positivity, and hence a diagnosis of duodenal involvement with HCL was made. Repeat bone marrow biopsy done 2 weeks after finishing chemotherapy revealed residual disease. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic with a normocellular marrow and no residual disease. Repeat abdomen computerized tomography (CT) scan at completion of therapy showed resolution of duodenal thickening and spleen size of 12 cm.

However, use of feeder layers limits stem cell research, since experimental data may result from a combined ES cell and feeder cell response to various stimuli. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, a buffalo ES cell line was established from in vitro derived blastocysts and characterized by the Alkaline phosphatase (AP) and immunoflourescence staining of various pluripotency markers. We examined the effect of various factors like fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Y-27632 to support the growth and maintenance of bubaline ES cells on gelatin coated dishes, in order to establish feeder free culture systems. We also analyzed the effect of feeder-conditioned media on stem cell growth in gelatin based cultures both in the presence as well as in the absence of the growth factors. RESULTS: The results showed that Y-27632, in the presence of FGF-2 and LIF, resulted in higher colony growth and increased expression of Nanog gene. Feeder-Conditioned Medium resulted in a significant increase in growth of buffalo ES cells on gelatin coated plates, however, feeder layer based cultures produced better results than gelatin based cultures. Feeder layers from buffalo fetal fibroblast cells can support buffalo ES cells for more than two years. CONCLUSION: We developed a feeder free culture system that can maintain buffalo ES cells in the short term, as well as feeder layer based culture that can support the long term maintenance of buffalo ES cells.","['Department of Animal and Poultry Science and Fisheries, Agricultural Institute, Iranian Research Organisation for Science and Technology (IROST), Tehran, Iran.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, India.', 'Embryo Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Biotechnology Centre, National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, India.']",,PMC4503840,['NOTNLM'],"['Buffalo', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'FGF-2', 'LIF', 'Y-27632']",['10.22074/cellj.2016.3728 [doi]'],,20150711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 5 lymphoma and 5 chronic subtypes. Five of them (3 chronic, 2 lymphoma) had been treated with valproic acid (VA) for neurological disorders developed before or after ATL diagnosis, suggesting a beneficial role for VA as a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) in ATL treatment. Total duration of uninterrupted VA treatment ranged from 8 to 37 years. Overall, the 175 incident ATL cases presented with a median survival of 5.43 months. The five VA-treated (VA(+)) patients presented with longer survival compared to VA treatment-free patients (VA(-)). For chronic subtypes, survival periods were of 213 months for 3 VA(+) patients and of 33 months for 11 VA(-) patients (p = 0.023). For lymphoma subtypes, survival periods were of 144 months for 2 VA(+) patients versus 6 months for 49 VA(-) patients (p = 0.0046). ATL cases with skin lesions, particularly lymphoma subtypes, had a longer survival (13.96 months) compared to those without skin lesions (6.06 months, p = 0.002).

When administered for treatment of leukemia in young patients, busulfan could cause damage to the male reproductive system as one of its adverse effects, resulting in sterility. METHODS: We investigated the effects of Korean Red Ginseng extract (KRGE) on busulfan-induced damage and/or dysfunction of the male reproductive system. RESULTS: We found that administration of busulfan to mice: decreased testis weight; caused testicular histological damage; reduced the total number of sperm, sperm motility, serum testosterone concentration; and eventually, litter size. Preadministration of KRGE partially attenuated various busulfan-induced damages to the male reproductive system. These results indicate that KRGE has a protective effect against busulfan-induced damage to the male reproduction system. CONCLUSION: The present study shows a possibility that KRGE could be applied as a useful agent to prevent or protect the male reproductive system from the adverse side effects induced by administration of anticancer agents such as busulfan.","['Ginsentology Research Laboratory, Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Ginsentology Research Laboratory, Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Ginsentology Research Laboratory, Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Ginsentology Research Laboratory, Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Ginsentology Research Laboratory, Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine and Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Science, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, Sangji University, Wonju, Korea.', 'Neuropsychopharmacology and Toxicology Program, College of Pharmacy, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Korea.', 'Neuropsychopharmacology and Toxicology Program, College of Pharmacy, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Korea.', 'Department of Convergence Medical Science, College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Prescriptionology, College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Convergence Medical Science, College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Ginsentology Research Laboratory, Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.']",,PMC4506375,['NOTNLM'],"['Panax ginseng', 'adverse effects', 'anticancer', 'busulfan', 'reproductive systems']","['10.1016/j.jgr.2015.01.002 [doi]', 'S1226-8453(15)00005-6 [pii]']",10.1016/j.jgr.2015.01.002 [doi],20150122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: We investigated the relationship of HLA alleles in 129 ethnic Turkish patients with AML and 126 unrelated, healthy, ethnic Turkish controls using the polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) method via Luminex technology. RESULTS: Allele frequencies of HLA-A*23, HLA-A*68, HLA-B*13, HLA-B*40, and HLA-DRB1*01 were lower in patients with AML compared with control individuals (P =.04, P =.02, P =.005, P = 02, and P =.02, respectively). In contrast, the HLA-DRB1*15 allele frequency was higher than in the controls (P =.01). The most commonly observed haplotype was A*01/B*08/DRB1*03 (5.4% vs 0.8%; P =.03) in patients with AML. In contrast, the most commonly observed haplotype was A*02/B*35/DRB1*04 (2.3% vs 3.2%) in controls. We could not find any haplotypes negatively associated with AML. Also, the homozygosity of HLA-A*01 and HLA-A*02 alleles were higher in patients with AML compared with controls (P =.046; P =.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The HLA-DRB1*15 allele, the A*01/B*08/DRB1*03 haplotypes, and the homozygosity of HLA-A*01 and HLA-A*02 may play a presumptive predisposing factor in AML.

A further case harbored a SNP that is a known risk allele for autoimmune diseases and B cell lymphomas. Thus, TNFAIP3 mutations represent recurrent genetic lesions in T-LGL that affect about 8% of cases, likely contributing to deregulated NF-kappaB activity in this leukemia.","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), Medical Faculty, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Genome Informatics, Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Genome Informatics, Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), Medical Faculty, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), Medical Faculty, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), Medical Faculty, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Tumor Cytogenetics, Department of Haematology and Oncology, Linz, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Tumor Cytogenetics, Department of Haematology and Oncology, Linz, Austria.', 'Division of Haematology and Haemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), Medical Faculty, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), Medical Faculty, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (TNFAIP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['NF-kappaB', 'STAT3', 'T-LGL', 'TNFAIP3', 'tumor suppressor gene']",['10.1002/ijc.29697 [doi]'],10.1002/ijc.29697 [doi],20150730,,,['(c) 2015 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 21.,"The capacity of natural killer (NK) cells to mediate Fc receptor-dependent effector functions, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), largely contributes to their clinical application. Given that activation-induced C-type lectin (AICL), an identified ligand for the NK-activating receptor NKp80, is frequently highly expressed on leukemia cells, the lack of therapeutic AICL-specific antibodies limits clinical application. Here we explore a strategy to reinforce NK anti-leukemia reactivity by combining targeting AICL-expressing leukemia cells with the induction of NK cell ADCC using NKp80-Fc fusion proteins. The NKp80-Fc fusion protein we generated bound specifically to leukemia cells in an AICL-specific manner. Cell binding assays between NK and leukemia cells showed that NKp80-Fc significantly increased NK target cell conjugation. In functional analyses, treatment with NKp80-Fc clearly induced the ADCC effect of NK cells. NKp80-Fc not only promoted NK-mediated leukemia cell apoptosis in the early stage of cell conjugation but also enhanced NK cell degranulation and cytotoxicity activity in the late stage. The bifunctional NKp80-Fc could redirect NK cells toward leukemia cells and triggered NK cell killing in vitro. Moreover, NKp80-Fc enhanced the lysis of NK cells against tumors in leukemia xenograft non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NKp80-Fc potently amplifies NK cell anti-leukemia effects in vitro and in vivo through induction of the NK cell ADCC effect. This method could potentially be useful for molecular targeted therapy, and the fusion proteins may be a promising drug for immunotherapy of leukemia.","['From the Institute of Immunology and Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China.', 'From the Institute of Immunology and Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China, zhxdd@ustc.edu.cn.', 'From the Institute of Immunology and Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China.', 'From the Institute of Immunology and Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China, the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China.', 'From the Institute of Immunology and Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China, the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China.', 'From the Institute of Immunology and Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China, the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China the State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361005, China, and sunr@ustc.edu.cn.']","['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (KLRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",PMC4566223,['NOTNLM'],"['ADCC', 'AICL', 'Fc receptor', 'NKp80', 'fusion protein', 'immunotherapy', 'leukemia', 'natural killer (NK) cells']","['S0021-9258(20)44806-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M115.678912 [doi]']",10.1074/jbc.M115.678912 [doi],20150721,,,"['(c) 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 21.,"Three systems with VACTERL association findings- mutations of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway in mice, murine adriamycin teratogenicity, and human Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway mutations, may all involve a similar mechanism. SHH is up-regulated in irradiated cells, and DNA breaks common with radiation damage in the adriamycin and FA systems are plausible signals for such effects, which would affect development. Since FA related DNA breakage occurs throughout life, SHH disturbances may account for later FA related findings involving hematopoietic and malignancy issues. In support, androgen, a standard treatment for FA hematologic failure, down-regulates SHH, and common FA malignancies such as squamous cell carcinomas and acute myeloid leukemia have been linked to enhanced SHH function. This suggests that interventions lowering SHH levels may be useful therapeutically. Also supporting a connection between pre- and post- natal findings, the frequency and number of VACTERL anomalies with FA correlate with the severity and onset of hematopoietic and malignancy issues. In FA, radial anomalies are the most common of these defects, followed by renal findings, while vertebral and gastrointestinal anomalies are relatively uncommon, a pattern that differs from observations of the VACTERL association. Genes with more severe effects also show a greatly increased incidence of brain abnormalities, and a paucity of such findings with other FA genes suggests that brain development is relatively refractory to SHH related effects, accounting for the rarity of such findings with the association.","['6003 W.

Since virions are particularly unstable, HTLV-1 transmission primarily occurs by transfer of a cell carrying an integrated provirus. After transcription, the viral genomic RNA undergoes reverse transcription and integration into the chromosomal DNA of a cell from the newly infected host. The virus then replicates by either one of two modes: (i) an infectious cycle by virus budding and infection of new targets and (ii) mitotic division of cells harboring an integrated provirus. HTLV-1 replication initiates a series of mechanisms in the host including antiviral immunity and checkpoint control of cell proliferation. HTLV-1 has elaborated strategies to counteract these defense mechanisms allowing continuous persistence in humans.","['Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech), University of Liege (ULg), 4000 Liege, Belgium. a.carpentier@doct.ulg.ac.be.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech), University of Liege (ULg), 4000 Liege, Belgium. py.barez@doct.ulg.ac.be.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech), University of Liege (ULg), 4000 Liege, Belgium. mhamaidia@ulg.ac.be.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech), University of Liege (ULg), 4000 Liege, Belgium. helene.gazon@ulg.ac.be.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech), University of Liege (ULg), 4000 Liege, Belgium. alix.debrogniez@ulg.ac.be.', 'Molecular and Cellular Epigenetics (GIGA) and Molecular Biology (Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech), University of Liege (ULg), 4000 Liege, Belgium.

Our recent study on BMs of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients showed that the mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are altered during leukemic conditions in a clinical course-dependent manner. Leukemic blasts caused reprogramming of transcriptomes in MSCs and remodeling of niche cross-talk, selectively suppressing normal primitive hematopoietic cells while supporting leukemogenesis and chemo- resistance. Notably, differences in BM stromal remodeling were correlated to heterogeneity in subsequent clinical courses of AML, i.e., low numbers of mesenchymal progenitors at initial diagnosis were correlated to complete remission for 5-8 years, and high contents of mesenchymal progenitor or MSCs correlated to early or late relapse, respectively. Thus, stromal remodeling by leukemic cell is an intrinsic part of leukemogenesis that can contribute to the clonal dominance of leukemic cells over normal hematopoietic cells, and can serve as a biomarker for prediction of prognosis.","['The Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center & Department of Medical Lifescience, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea.', 'The Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center & Department of Medical Lifescience, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea.', 'The Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center & Department of Medical Lifescience, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",PMC4576948,,,"['3302 [pii]', '10.5483/bmbrep.2015.48.8.152 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 20.,"Household pesticide exposure during pregnancy has been associated with a more than 2-fold increased risk in infant leukemia, and chlorpyrifos (CPF) is among the most frequently applied insecticides. During early fetal development, liver is a hematopoietic organ with majority of cells being CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (CD34(+)HSC). The in utero injury to CD34(+)HSC has been known to underlie the pathogenesis of several blood disorders, often involving rearrangements of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene on 11q23. In this study, we evaluated the leukemogenic potential of CPF in human fetal liver-derived CD34(+)HSC. Specifically, exposure to 10 muM CPF led to decrease in viability, inhibition in proliferation and induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and occurrence of MLL(+) rearrangements. In particular, we observed CPF-mediated cell cycle disturbance as shown by G0/G1 arrest, in contrast to etoposide (VP-16), an anticancer drug used as a positive control and known to induce G2/M arrest. Further study on mechanisms underlying DNA DSBs and MLL(+) rearrangements revealed that CPF might act as topoisomerase II poison, a mechanism of action similar to VP-16. On the other hand, CPF was also shown to induce early apoptosis through active caspase-3 activation, a pathway known to underlie DNA DSBs and MLL(+) translocations. Our data indicate that in utero injury of CD34(+)HSC by CPF may contribute to the increased risk of infant leukemia. Future work will elucidate the mechanism and the type of CPF-induced MLL(+) translocations in HSC.","['*Dalian Key Laboratory of Hematology, Department of Environmental Health and Toxicology, School of Public Health, Dalian Medical University.

However, it is still unclear which treatments are most effective for these patients. The aim of our study was to analyze the relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) benefit of allogeneic HSCT (alloHSCT) for intermediate-risk AML patients in CR1. A meta-analysis of prospective trials comparing alloHSCT to non-alloHSCT (autologous HSCT [autoHSCT] and/or chemotherapy) was undertaken. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library though October 2014, using keywords and relative MeSH or Emtree terms, 'allogeneic'; 'acut*' and 'leukem*/aml/leukaem*/leucem*/leucaem*'; and 'nonlympho*' or 'myelo*'. A total of 7053 articles were accessed. The primary outcomes were RFS and OS, while the secondary outcomes were treatment-related mortality (TRM) and relapse rate (RR). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each outcome. The primary outcomes were RFS and OS, while the secondary outcomes were TRM and RR. We included 9 prospective controlled studies including 1950 adult patients. Patients with intermediate-risk AML in CR1 who received either alloHSCT or non-alloHSCT were considered eligible. AlloHSCT was found to be associated with significantly better RFS, OS, and RR than non-alloHSCT (HR, 0.684 [95% CI: 0.48, 0.95]; HR, 0.76 [95% CI: 0.61, 0.95]; and HR, 0.58 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.75], respectively). TRM was significantly higher following alloHSCT than non-alloHSCT (HR, 3.09 [95% CI: 1.38, 6.92]). However, subgroup analysis showed no OS benefit for alloHSCT over autoHSCT (HR, 0.99 [95% CI: 0.70, 1.39]). In conclusion, alloHSCT is associated with more favorable RFS, OS, and RR benefits (but not TRM outcomes) than non-alloHSCT generally, but does not have an OS advantage over autoHSCT specifically, in patients with intermediate-risk AML in CR1.","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China; Medical College of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China; Medical College of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of clinical laboratory, PLA Navy General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Tumor diagnosis and treatment center, PLA Navy General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China; Department of Hematology, No. 202 Hospital of PLA, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",,PMC4510363,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0132620 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-57903 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0132620 [doi],20150721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially basic esters, which are positively charged under physiological conditions, were in the crystal violet and the MTT assay up to approximately 100 times more effective than bendamustine, paralleled by a higher fraction of early apoptotic cancer cells and increased expression of p53. Analytical studies performed with bendamustine and representative esters revealed pronounced cellular accumulation of the derivatives compared to the parent compound. In particular, the pyrrolidinoethyl ester showed a high enrichment in tumor cells and inhibition of OCT1- and OCT3-mediated transport processes, suggesting organic cation transporters to be involved.

Epub 2015 Jun 30.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by recurrent chromosomal translocations. In t(4;14) MM, the MM SET domain (MMSET) protein is universally overexpressed and has been suggested to have an important tumorigenic role. However, the exact molecular targets underlying MMSET activity are not well understood. Here, we found in t(4;14) MM cells that MMSET knockdown decreases interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) expression, and ectopic MMSET increases IRF4 expression, suggesting that MMSET is an upstream regulator of IRF4. Further analyses indicated an interaction between MMSET and nuclear factor-kappaB, which both bind to the IRF4 promoter region. A luciferase reporter assay showed that MMSET is an important functional element for the IRF4 promoter. MMSET knockdown induces apoptosis and potentiates the effects of bortezomib in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we found that bortezomib could reduce expression of MMSET and IRF4. This might partly explain the additive effect of combining MMSET knockdown and bortezomib treatment. These results identify MMSET as a key regulator involved in the regulatory network of transcription factor IRF4, which is critical for MM cell survival, suggesting that the combination of MMSET inhibition and bortezomib is likely to improve patient outcome in MM.","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (NSD2 protein, human)']",,,,"['leu2015169 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.169 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.169 [doi],20150630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its treatment is highly dependent on the correct classification of subtype. Previously, we developed a microarray-based subtype classifier based on the relative expression levels of 62 marker genes, which can predict 7 different ALL subtypes with an accuracy as high as 97% in completely independent samples. Because the classifier is based on gene expression rank values rather than actual values, the classifier enables an individualized diagnosis, without the need to reference the background distribution of the marker genes in a large number of other samples, and also enables cross platform application. Here, we demonstrate that the classifier can be extended from a microarray-based technology to a multiplex qPCR-based technology using the same set of marker genes as the advanced fragment analysis (AFA). Compared to microarray assays, the new assay system makes the convenient, low cost and individualized subtype diagnosis of pediatric ALL a reality and is clinically applicable, particularly in developing countries.","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University.

Much experimental evidence demonstrates that ALV-J mutants have caused immune evasion and pose a challenge for traditional efforts to develop effective vaccines. To investigate the potential of a multi-epitope vaccination strategy to prevent chickens against ALV-J infections, a recombinant chimeric multi-epitope protein X (rCMEPX) containing both immunodominant B and T epitope concentrated domains selected from the major structural protein of ALV-J using bioinformatics approach was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3). Its immunogenicity and protective efficacy was studied in chickens. The results showed that rCMEPX could elicit neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses, and antibodies induced by rCMEPX could specifically recognize host cell naturally expressed ALV-J proteins, which indicated that the rCMEPX is a good immunogen. Challenge experiments showed 80% chickens that received rCMEPX were well protected against ALV-J challenge. This is the first report of a chimeric multi-epitope protein as a potential immunogen against ALV-J.","['Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province 271018, China; Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province 271018, China.', 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province 271018, China; Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province 271018, China.', 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province 271018, China; Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province 271018, China.', 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province 271018, China; Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province 271018, China.', 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province 271018, China; Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Shandong Agricultural University, 61 Daizong Street, Taian City, Shandong Province 271018, China.

To prevent or treat cancer, mechanisms that can potentially interfere with clonal evolutionary processes need to be understood better. Mathematical modeling is an important research tool that plays an ever-increasing role in cancer research. This paper discusses how mathematical models can be useful to gain insights into mechanisms that can prevent disease initiation, help analyze treatment responses, and aid in the design of treatment strategies to combat the emergence of drug-resistant cells. The discussion will be done in the context of specific examples. Among defense mechanisms, we explore how replicative limits and cellular senescence induced by telomere shortening can influence the emergence and evolution of tumors. Among treatment approaches, we consider the targeted treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We illustrate how basic evolutionary mathematical models have the potential to make patient-specific predictions about disease and treatment outcome, and argue that evolutionary models could become important clinical tools in the field of personalized medicine.","['Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Ayala School of Biological Sciences, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697; Department of Mathematics, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697.', 'Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Ayala School of Biological Sciences, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697; Department of Mathematics, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697 dwodarz@uci.edu.']",,PMC4517241,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'clonal evolution', 'mathematical models', 'targeted therapy', 'telomeres']","['1501730112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1501730112 [doi]']",10.1073/pnas.1501730112 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly two decades ago we showed that in multi-individual colonies of protochordate colonial tunicates sharing a blood circulation, there exists an exchange of somatic stem cells and germline stem cells, resulting in somatic chimeras and stem cell competitions for gonadal niches. Stem cells are unlike other cells in the body in that they alone self-renew, so that they form clones that are perpetuated for the life of the organism. Stem cell competitions have allowed the emergence of competitive somatic and germline stem cell clones. Highly successful germline stem cells usually outcompete less successful competitors both in the gonads of the genotype partner from which they arise and in the gonads of the natural parabiotic partners. Therefore, natural selection also operates at the level of germline stem cell clones. In the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri the formation of natural parabionts is prevented by a single-locus highly polymorphic histocompatibility gene called Botryllus histocompatibility factor. This limits germline stem cell predation to kin, as the locus has hundreds of alleles. We show that in mice germline stem cells compete for gonad niches, and in mice and humans, blood-forming stem cells also compete for bone marrow niches. We show that the clonal progression from blood-forming stem cells to acute leukemias by successive genetic and epigenetic events in blood stem cells also involves competition and selection between clones and propose that this is a general theme in cancer.","['Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and Ludwig Center for Cancer Stem Cell Research and Medicine, Stanford University; and Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305-5461 irv@stanford.edu.']",['0 (CD47 Antigen)'],PMC4517284,['NOTNLM'],"['Botryllus schlosseri', 'cancer', 'evolution', 'natural selection', 'stem cell competition']","['1505464112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1505464112 [doi]']",10.1073/pnas.1505464112 [doi],,"['R01 AG037968/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA86017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM100315/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA086065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In further experiments, p53 protein expression was increased, and H2AX phosphorylation and p21 protein expression were induced after treatment with 3EZ, 20Ac-ingenol. Moreover, the activation of caspase 3 followed decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio after treatment with 3EZ, 20Ac-ingenol, and accumulation of sub-G1 phase cells was observed in flow cytometry analyses.

Epub 2015 Jul 21.,"Endocytosis is the major regulator process of tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) functional activities. Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) is a key protein involved in RTK intracellular trafficking. Here, we report, by studying 34 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) at diagnosis, that BIN1 gene is downregulated in CML as compared to healthy controls, suggesting an altered endocytosis of RTKs. Rab interactor 1 (RIN1), an activator of BIN1, displayed a similar behavior. Treatment of 57 patients by tyrosine kinase inhibitors caused, along with BCR-ABL1 inactivation, an increase of BIN1 and RIN1 expression, potentially restoring endocytosis. There was a significant inverse correlation between BIN1-RIN1 and BCR-ABL1 expression. In vitro experiments on both CML and nontumorigenic cell lines treated with Imatinib confirmed these results. In order to provide another proof in favor of BIN1 and RIN1 endocytosis function in CML, we demonstrated that Imatinib induced, in K562 cell line, BIN1-RIN1 upregulation accompanied by a parallel AXL receptor internalization into cytoplasmic compartment. This study shows a novel deregulated mechanism in CML patients, indicating BIN1 and RIN1 as players in the maintenance of the abnormal RTK signaling in this hematological disease.","['Laboratory of Pre-clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy. stefania.trino@crob.it.', 'Laboratory of Pre-clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Ospedale Madonna delle Grazie, ASM, Matera, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology ""L. e A.

Epub 2015 Jul 20.,"UNLABELLED: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous hematopoietic neoplasms that are driven by somatically acquired genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations. Accurate risk stratification is essential for delivery of risk-adaptive therapeutic interventions. The current prognostic tools sum the impact of clinical, pathologic, and laboratory parameters. Newer technologies with next-generation targeted deep sequencing and whole-genome and -exome sequencing have identified several recurrent mutations that play a vital role in the pathophysiology of MDS and the impact of these genetic changes on disease phenotype. Equally important, well-annotated databases of MDS patients with paired clinicopathologic and genetic data have enabled better understanding of the independent prognostic impact of several molecular mutations on important clinical endpoints such as overall survival and probability of leukemic progression. Cumulative evidence suggests that genomic data can also be used clinically to aid with the diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of response to specific therapies, and the development of novel and rationally targeted therapies. However, the optimal use of this mutational profiling remains a work in progress and currently there is no standard set of genes or techniques that are recommended for routine use in the clinic. In this review, we discuss the genomic revolution and its impact on our understanding of MDS biology and risk stratification. We also discuss the current role and the challenges of the application of genetic mutational data into daily clinical practice and how future research could help improve the prognostication precision and specific therapy selection for patients with MDS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Heterogeneity in clinical outcomes of MDS is partly related to interpatient variability of recurrent somatic mutations that drive disease phenotype and progression. Although clinical risk stratification tools have functioned well in prognostication for patients with MDS, their ability to predict clinical benefits of specific MDS therapies is limited. Molecular testing shows promise in aiding diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapy-specific benefit prediction for MDS patients. Nonetheless, logistical issues related to assay performance standardization, validation, interpretation, and development of guidelines for how to use the results to inform clinical decisions are yet to be resolved.","['Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA;', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA;', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University and Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University and Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, New Haven, Connecticut, USA amer.zeidan@yale.edu.']",,PMC4571815,['NOTNLM'],"['Biomarkers', 'MDS', 'Molecular testing', 'Mutations', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Prognostication']","['theoncologist.2015-0067 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0067 [doi]']",10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0067 [doi],20150720,['K24 CA111717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['(c)AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 20.,"The vast majority of cases of follicular lymphoma (FL), but not normal B cells, acquire N-glycosylation sites in the immunoglobulin variable regions during somatic hypermutation. Glycans added to sites are unusual in terminating at high mannoses. We showed previously that the C-type lectins, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and mannose receptor, bound to FL surface immunoglobulin (sIg), generating an intracellular Ca(2+) flux. We have now mapped further intracellular pathways activated by DC-SIGN in a range of primary FL cells with detection of phosphorylated ERK1/2, AKT, and PLCgamma2. The SYK inhibitor (tamatinib) or the BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib) each blocked phosphorylation. Activation by DC-SIGN occurred in both IgM(+) and IgG(+) cases and led to upregulation of MYC expression, with detection in vivo observed in lymph nodes. Unlike cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, FL cells expressed relatively high levels of sIg, unchanged by long-term incubation in vitro, indicating no antigen-mediated downregulation in vivo. In contrast, expression of CXCR4 increased in vitro. Engagement of sIg in FL cells or normal B cells by anti-Ig led to endocytosis in vitro as expected, but DC-SIGN, even when cross-linked, did not lead to significant endocytosis of sIg. These findings indicate that lectin binding generates signals via sIg but does not mediate endocytosis, potentially maintaining a supportive antigen-independent signal in vivo. Location of DC-SIGN in FL tissue revealed high levels in sinusoidlike structures and in some colocalized mononuclear cells, suggesting a role for lectin-expressing cells at this site.","['Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary, University of London, John Vane Science Centre, Charterhouse Square, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Pathology and Lymphoid Malignancies Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom;']","['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",,,,"['S0006-4971(20)30819-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-04-640805 [doi]']",10.1182/blood-2015-04-640805 [doi],20150720,"['13-0267/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['Blood. 2015 Oct 15;126(16):1871-2.

That is, depending on the epitope targeted, persons of diverse genetic backgrounds and immunological histories can use highly similar, stereotyped B-cell receptors (BCRs) for a particular response. In some cases, multiple people with immunity to a particular epitope or with a type of B-cell neoplasia will elicit antibodies encoded by essentially identical immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. In other cases, particular VH genes encode antibodies important for immunity against pathogens such as influenza and HIV. It appears that the conserved antibody structures driving these stereotyped responses are highly limited and selected. There are interesting and important convergences in the types of stereotyped BCRs induced in conditions of immunity and B-cell-related pathology such as cancer and autoimmunity. By characterizing and understanding stereotyped B-cell responses, novel approaches to B-cell immunity and in understanding the underlying causes of B-cell pathology may be discovered. In this paper, we will review stereotyped BCR responses in various contexts of B-cell immunity and pathology.","['Department of Medicine, Section of Rheumatology, Knapp Center for Lupus and Immunology Research, Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Rheumatology, Knapp Center for Lupus and Immunology Research, Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA wilsonp@uchicago.edu.']","['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",PMC4528415,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell', 'immunoglobulin', 'variable gene']","['rstb.2014.0238 [pii]', '10.1098/rstb.2014.0238 [doi]']",10.1098/rstb.2014.0238 [doi] 20140238 [pii],,"['5U19AI090023-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN272201400005C/PHS HHS/United States', 'U19 AI057266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '1U19AI109946-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '2U19AI082724-06/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '1P01AI097092-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI109946/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '2U19AI057266-11/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,['(c) 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

At the same time, it is an immunogenic type of cancer with spontaneous regressions. Most recently, the tumoricidal effect of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and their capacity to overcome the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment are being investigated. In this respect, we studied the effect of the infectious, but replication-deficient, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) d106S vaccine strain, which lacks essential immediate early genes, in pDC co-cultures with 11 melanoma cell lines. We observed a strong cytotoxic activity, inducing apoptotic and necrotic cell death in most melanoma cell lines. The cytotoxic activity of HSV-1 d106S plus pDC was comparable to the levels of cytotoxicity induced by natural killer cells, but required only a fraction of cells with effector : target ratios of 1 : 20 (P < 0.05). The suppressive activity of cell-free supernatants derived from virus-stimulated pDC was significantly neutralized using antibodies against the interferon-alpha receptor (P < 0.05). In addition to type I interferons, TRAIL and granzyme B contributed to the inhibitory effect of HSV-1 d106S plus pDC to a minor extent. UV-irradiated viral stocks were significantly less active than infectious particles, both in the absence and presence of pDC (P < 0.05), indicating that residual activity of HSV-1 d106S is a major component and sensitizes the tumour cells to interferon-producing pDC. Three leukaemic cell lines were also susceptible to this treatment, suggesting a general anti-tumour effect. In conclusion, the potential of HSV-1 d106S for therapeutic vaccination should be further evaluated in patients suffering from different malignancies.","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.']","['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Interferon Type I)']",PMC4582973,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'cytotoxicity', 'dendritic cells', 'human', 'viral']",['10.1111/imm.12509 [doi]'],10.1111/imm.12509 [doi],,"['R01 AI030612/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI057552/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI057552/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 057552/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) deletion (59 of 142 or 42%) was the most frequent CNA, and it was followed by Ikaros family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) losses (49 of 142 or 35%).

The multivariate analysis showed that advanced age and early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) deletions were associated with chemotherapy resistance in both the whole series (hazard ratios, 0.949 and 0.135, respectively) and the Ph-negative subgroup (hazard ratios, 0.946 and 0.118, respectively). High WBC counts and focal IKZF1 deletions correlated with disease recurrence (hazard ratios, 1.005 and 1.869, respectively), whereas advanced age and CDKN2A/B losses influenced overall survival in both the whole series (hazard ratios, 1.038 and 2.545, respectively) and the Ph-negative subgroup (hazard ratios, 1.044 and 2.105, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Deletions of EBF1, IKZF1, and CDKN2A/B have an independent adverse prognosis for adolescents and adults with B-precursor ALL, and this suggests that these CNAs should be included in the initial risk assessment of ALL.","['Clinical Hematology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology at Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology at Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology at Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, La Fe Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, La Fe Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, August Pi i Sunyer Institute for Biomedical Research, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology at Duran i Reynals Hospital, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology at Josep Trueta Hospital, Girona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinico, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Doce de Octubre Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Institute of Biomedical Investigation of Salamanca, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cancer, Center of Investigation of Cancer, Spanish National Research Council at University of Salamanca, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Virgen del Rocio Hospital, Seville, Spain.', ""Hematology Department, Vall d'Hebron Hospital, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hematology Department, Joan XXIII University Hospital, Tarragona, Spain.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology at Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology at Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology at Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology at Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology at Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Badalona, Spain.']","['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (EBF1 protein, human)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B precursor', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'adult', 'copy number alterations', 'prognosis']",['10.1002/cncr.29579 [doi]'],10.1002/cncr.29579 [doi],20150720,,,['(c) 2015 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,['Spanish PETHEMA Group and the Spanish Society of Hematology'],,,,,,"['Granada I', 'Esteve J', 'Cabezon M', 'Marce S', 'Brunet S', 'Junca J', 'Collado M', 'Martinez-Sanchez P', 'Ruiz-Xiville N', 'Gonzalez M', 'Trujillo P']","['Granada, Isabel', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Cabezon, Marta', 'Marce, Silvia', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Junca, Jordi', 'Collado, Maria', 'Martinez-Sanchez, Pilar', 'Ruiz-Xiville, Neus', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Trujillo, Pablo']",,,

Epub 2015 Jul 14.,"BACKGROUND: The importance of family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients is unclear. We conducted a nationwide study to determine whether family history of VTE is a risk factor for hospitalized VTE in cancer patients. METHODS: The Swedish Multi-Generation Register was linked to the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and the Swedish Cancer Registry. Familial (sibling/parent history of VTE) hazard ratios (HRs) for VTE in 20 cancer types were determined by cause-specific Cox regression for 258877 cancer patients in 1987-2010 without previous VTE. Familial HRs were also determined in 7644203 individuals without cancer or VTE before 1987, with follow-up in 1987-2010. RESULTS: Significant familial HRs for VTE in cancer patients were observed for the following cancer types: cancers of the breast (HR=1.79), lung (HR=1.21), colon (HR=1.30), prostate (HR=1.46), testis (HR=2.02), nervous system (HR=1.31), stomach (HR=1.73), and rectum (HR=1.77), as well as melanoma (HR=1.71), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR=1.32), myeloma (HR=1.69), and leukemia (HR=1.44). In a time-dependent analysis the familial HRs for VTE were significant before diagnosis of cancer (p-values <0.0001). After diagnosis of cancer the familial HRs VTE were weaker, with significant HRs for 12 cancer types. On an additive scale, the joint effect of cancer and family history was significantly increased compared to separate effects in four cancer types. However, for certain cancers the familial VTE cases were limited. CONCLUSIONS: Family history of VTE is a risk factor for VTE in several cancer types. However, familial factors are relatively more important in non-cancer than in cancer patients.","['Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.

These achievements have also provided critical insights regarding potentially targetable lesions for the development of new therapeutic approaches in the era of precision medicine.

Epub 2015 Jul 20.,"BACKGROUND: Ibrutinib is active in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In patients treated with ibrutinib for R/R CLL, del(17p), identified by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), is associated with inferior progression-free survival despite equivalent initial response rates. Del(17p) is frequently associated with a complex metaphase karyotype (CKT); the prognostic significance of CKT in ibrutinib-treated patients has not been reported. METHODS: This study reviewed 88 patients treated for R/R CLL at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center with investigational ibrutinib-based regimens from 2010 to 2013. Pretreatment FISH and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated metaphase cytogenetic analysis were performed on bone marrow. RESULTS: An adequate pretreatment metaphase karyotype was available for 56 of the 88 patients. The karyotype was complex in 21 of the 56 cases; 17 of the 21 had del(17p) according to FISH. The overall response rate, including partial remission with persistent lymphocytosis, was 94%; 18% had complete responses. In a multivariate analysis (MVA), only CKT was significantly associated with event-free survival (EFS; hazard ratio [HR], 6.6 [95% CI 1.7-25.6]; P = .006). Fludarabine-refractory CLL (HR, 6.9 [95% CI 1.8-27.1], P = .005) and CKT (HR 5.9 [95% CI 1.6-22.2], P = .008) were independently associated with inferior overall survival (OS) in MVA. Del(17p) by FISH was not significantly associated with EFS or OS in MVA. CONCLUSIONS: CKT is a powerful predictor of outcomes for ibrutinib-treated patients with R/R CLL and may be a stronger predictor of biological behavior than del(17p) by FISH. Because of their relatively poor outcomes, patients with CKT are ideal candidates for studies of consolidative treatment strategies or novel treatment combinations.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of California, Irvine, California.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",PMC4866653,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'complex karyotype', 'del(17p)', 'ibrutinib', 'relapsed and refractory']",['10.1002/cncr.29566 [doi]'],10.1002/cncr.29566 [doi],20150720,"['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS773424'],['(c) 2015 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 21.,"Reactivation of viral infections is common in patients with solid tumour or haematological malignancy. Incidence and severity depend on the extent of cellular immunosuppression. Antiviral prophylaxis may be effective to prevent viral reactivation. In 2006, the Infectious Diseases Working Party of German Society for Hematology and Medical Oncology (DGHO) published guidelines for antiviral prophylaxis in these patient populations. Here, we present an update of these guidelines for patients with solid and haematological malignancies undergoing antineoplastic treatment but not allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Relevant literature for reactivation of different viruses (herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and respiratory viruses) is discussed to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians taking care of this patient population. We recommend a risk-adapted approach with (val)acyclovir against HSV and VZV in patients treated with alemtuzumab, bortezomib or purine analogues. Seasonal vaccination against influenza is recommended for all patients with solid or haematological malignancies regardless of antineoplastic therapy.

Epub 2015 Jul 20.,"BACKGROUND: During the last five decades, survival of childhood cancer has increased from 25% to 80%. At the same time, however, it has become evident that survivors experience a broad range of therapy-related late adverse health effects. The aim of the Adult Life after Childhood Cancer in Scandinavia (ALiCCS) study is to investigate long-term health consequences of past and current therapies in order to improve follow-up care of survivors and to reduce treatment-related morbidity of future patients. PROCEDURE: Childhood cancer survivors were identified through the five Nordic cancer registries and a comparison cohort was established through random selection of cancer-free individuals from the civil registration systems. A unique personal identification number was used to link between different health registries. Abstraction of treatment information for a subset of survivors allows investigation of the association between the various components of cancer therapy and late occurring comorbidity. RESULTS: The childhood cancer survivor cohort comprises 33,160 1-year survivors and the comparison cohort comprises 212,892 cancer free individuals from the general population. In the childhood cancer survivor cohort, all types of childhood cancer are represented including leukemia (21%), lymphoma (14%), central nervous system tumors (24%), sarcomas (5%), retinoblastoma (3%), and neuroblastoma (4%). Among the survivors, 22% have been followed beyond the age of 40 years. CONCLUSION: The ALiCCS study constitutes a new large resource for research on late effects of childhood cancers that include all types of childhood malignancies and has followed a large proportion of the survivors well into late adulthood.","['Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Children's Hospital Iceland, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."", 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund, Cancer Epidemiology, Lund University, Sweden.', 'Finnish Cancer Registry, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Jorvi Central Hospital, Espoo, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Icelandic Cancer Registry, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Norwegian Cancer Registry, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer therapy', 'childhood cancer', 'late effects', 'survivorship']",['10.1002/pbc.25661 [doi]'],10.1002/pbc.25661 [doi],20150720,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,['ALiCCS Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,

A solid lump measuring 1.0 cm in diameter was detected in the anal verge. Under a diagnosis of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid, thrombectomy was performed under local anesthesia. One week after thrombectomy, the wound had not healed, and grayish-green tissue was seen at the bottom. A biopsy of the wound revealed atypical mononuclear cell infiltration. Myeloperoxidase and lysozyme were positive on immunohistochemical staining. Finally, the diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma (GS) was made. Though it is well known that perianal complications occur quite often in patients with leukemia, it is unusual for a diagnosis of GS of the anus to be definitely established. To our knowledge, there has not been a previous report of GS presenting as a thrombosed external hemorrhoid. The development of GS should be considered during the management of such lesions, especially in patients with bone marrow disorders, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk MDS.","['Second Department of Surgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, 431-3192, Japan. thayashi@hama-med.ac.jp.', 'Second Department of Surgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, 431-3192, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, 431-3192, Japan.', 'Second Department of Surgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, 431-3192, Japan.', 'Second Department of Surgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, 431-3192, Japan.', 'Second Department of Surgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, 431-3192, Japan.', 'Second Department of Surgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, 431-3192, Japan.', 'Second Department of Surgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, 431-3192, Japan.', 'Second Department of Surgery, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, 431-3192, Japan.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'Granulocytic sarcoma (GS)', 'Hemorrhoid', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)']","['10.1007/s12328-008-0025-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12328-008-0025-0 [pii]']",10.1007/s12328-008-0025-0 [doi],20080926,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The onset can occur both inside and outside the lymph nodes, with a quarter of the lymphomas with extranodal onset being located in the head and neck. The purpose of the paper is to conduct a retrospective study over a period of six years on patients diagnosed and admitted to the clinic with malignant lymphomas located in the head and neck, discussing their different histological variations. It emphasizes the importance of the histopathological examination and, in particular, of the immunohistochemical tests, in determining the histological subtype of the lymphoma, as the immunohistochemical and cytogenetic data of the malignant cell play a major role in the evolution and prognosis of patients. The study leads to the conclusion that, in spite of the advancements of the immunological, cytogenetic and molecular techniques, the diagnosis and histological determination of malignant lymphomas continue to be a challenge to clinicians and anatomical pathologists. Of particular importance in the efforts made for the accurate diagnosis and proper treatment of the ENT (ear, nose and throat) malignant lymphomas is the interdisciplinary collaboration between the ENT specialist, the hematologist, the anatomical pathologist, the oncologist and the nutritionist.","['""Prof. Dr. Dorin Hociota"" Institute of Phonoaudiology and Functional ENT Surgery, Bucharest, Romania; mtusaliu@yahoo.com.']",,,,,['560215499504 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 17.,"Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy of mature B lymphocytes which are highly dependent on interactions with the tissue microenvironment for their survival and proliferation. Critical components of the microenvironment are monocyte-derived nurselike cells (NLCs), mesenchymal stromal cells, T cells and NK cells, which communicate with CLL cells through a complex network of adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family members, and soluble factors. (Auto-) antigens and/or autonomous mechanisms activate the B-cell receptor (BCR) and its downstream signaling cascade in secondary lymphatic tissues, playing a central pathogenetic role in CLL. Novel small molecule inhibitors, including the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta) inhibitor idelalisib, target BCR signaling and have become the most successful new therapeutics in this disease. We here review the cellular and molecular characteristics of CLL cells, and discuss the cellular components and key pathways involved in the cross-talk with their microenvironment. We also highlight the relevant novel treatment strategies, focusing on immunomodulatory agents and BCR signaling inhibitors and how these treatments disrupt CLL-microenvironment interactions.

Epub 2015 Jul 17.,"Platelets are increasingly being recognized for promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Many cells derived from solid tumors have the ability to aggregate platelets, and this ability correlates with their metastatic potential. Over the past half century, our understanding of tumor cell-induced platelet aggregation (TCIPA) has grown beyond the simple concept that tumor cell-containing microthrombi mechanically embolize the microvasculature. Tumor cell-activated platelets secrete a multitude of factors that reciprocally act on tumor cells, as well as other cells within the tumor microenvironment; thus, affecting both parenychma and tumor-associated stroma. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of tumor cell-platelet interactions and their influence on the tumor microenvironment, including how these interactions impact neoplastic epithelial cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, immune cells, and early metastatic niches. In addition, we review the current knowledge of platelet-cancer cell interactions within hematological malignancies and speculate on how platelets may influence the leukemic microenvironment.

Epub 2015 Jul 17.,"Epidemiological studies report that arsenic exposure via drinking water adversely impacts cognitive development in children and, in adults, can lead to greater psychiatric disease susceptibility, among other conditions. While it is known that arsenic toxicity has a profound effect on the epigenetic landscape, very few studies have investigated its effects on chromatin architecture in the brain. We have previously demonstrated that exposure to a low level of arsenic (50ppb) during all three trimesters of fetal/neonatal development induces deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG), depressive-like symptoms, and alterations in gene expression in the adult mouse brain. As epigenetic processes control these outcomes, here we assess the impact of our developmental arsenic exposure (DAE) paradigm on global histone posttranslational modifications and associated chromatin-modifying proteins in the dentate gyrus and frontal cortex (FC) of adult male and female mice. DAE influenced histone 3K4 trimethylation with increased levels in the male DG and FC and decreased levels in the female DG (no change in female FC). The histone methyltransferase MLL exhibited a similar sex- and region-specific expression profile as H3K4me3 levels, while histone demethylase KDM5B expression trended in the opposite direction. DAE increased histone 3K9 acetylation levels in the male DG along with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) expression of GCN5 and decreased H3K9ac levels in the male FC along with decreased HAT expression of GCN5 and PCAF. DAE decreased expression of histone deacetylase enzymes HDAC1 and HDAC2, which were concurrent with increased H3K9ac levels but only in the female DG.

Epub 2015 Jul 20.,"Strigolactones (SLs) are a novel class of plant hormones. Previously, we found that analogs of SLs induce growth arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines. These compounds also inhibited the growth of breast cancer stem cell enriched-mammospheres with increased potency. Furthermore, strigolactone analogs inhibited growth and survival of colon, lung, prostate, melanoma, osteosarcoma and leukemia cancer cell lines. To further examine the anti-cancer activity of SLs in vivo, we have examined their effects on growth and viability of MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts model either alone or in combination with paclitaxel. We show that strigolactone act as new anti-cancer agents in inhibition of breast cancer in xenograft model. In addition we show that SLs affect the integrity of the microtubule network and therefore may inhibit the migratory phenotype of the highly invasive breast cancer cell lines that were examined.","['a Institute of Plant Sciences; ARO; Volcani Center ; Bet Dagan , Israel.', 'a Institute of Plant Sciences; ARO; Volcani Center ; Bet Dagan , Israel.', 'b Faculty of Engineering Sciences; The Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren Department of Biotechnology Engineering ; Ben-Gurion University of the Negev ; Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'c Department of Human Science ; SNHS; Georgetown University ; Washington, DC USA.', 'a Institute of Plant Sciences; ARO; Volcani Center ; Bet Dagan , Israel.', 'a Institute of Plant Sciences; ARO; Volcani Center ; Bet Dagan , Israel.', 'b Faculty of Engineering Sciences; The Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren Department of Biotechnology Engineering ; Ben-Gurion University of the Negev ; Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'a Institute of Plant Sciences; ARO; Volcani Center ; Bet Dagan , Israel.', 'b Faculty of Engineering Sciences; The Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren Department of Biotechnology Engineering ; Ben-Gurion University of the Negev ; Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'a Institute of Plant Sciences; ARO; Volcani Center ; Bet Dagan , Israel.', 'd Department of Oncology ; Georgetown University Medical Center ; Washington, DC USA.', 'e The Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center; Georgetown University Medical Center ; Washington, DC USA.', 'f Department of Chemistry ; University of Turin ; Torino , Italy.', 'g Institute of Animal Sciences; Volcani Center ; Bet Dagan , Israel.', 'g Institute of Animal Sciences; Volcani Center ; Bet Dagan , Israel.', 'f Department of Chemistry ; University of Turin ; Torino , Italy.', 'b Faculty of Engineering Sciences; The Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren Department of Biotechnology Engineering ; Ben-Gurion University of the Negev ; Beer-Sheva , Israel.', 'g Institute of Animal Sciences; Volcani Center ; Bet Dagan , Israel.', 'c Department of Human Science ; SNHS; Georgetown University ; Washington, DC USA.', 'e The Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center; Georgetown University Medical Center ; Washington, DC USA.', 'a Institute of Plant Sciences; ARO; Volcani Center ; Bet Dagan , Israel.', 'a Institute of Plant Sciences; ARO; Volcani Center ; Bet Dagan , Israel.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (Lactones)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",PMC4846121,['NOTNLM'],"['SLs, strigolactones.', 'breast cancer', 'cell motility, microtubule', 'plant hormone', 'strigolactone', 'xenograft']",['10.1080/15384047.2015.1070982 [doi]'],10.1080/15384047.2015.1070982 [doi],20150720,"['P30 CA051008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA051008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000101/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 20.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been increasingly used in the setting of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)-mutated AML. However, its role in conferring durable relapse-free intervals remains in question. Herein we sought to investigate FLT3 mutational status on transplant outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 262 consecutive AML patients who underwent first-time allogeneic HCT (2008-2014), of whom 171 had undergone FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutational testing. FLT3-mutated AML was associated with nearly twice the relapse risk (RR) compared with those without FLT3 mutation 3 years post-HCT (63% vs 37%, P<0.001) and with a shorter median time to relapse (100 vs 121 days). FLT3 mutational status remained significantly associated with this outcome after controlling for patient, disease and transplant-related risk factors (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed a significant association of FLT3 mutation with increased 3-year RR (hazard ratio (HR) 3.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.13, 6.19, P<0.001) and inferior disease-free survival (HR 2.05, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.27, P<0.01) and overall survival (HR 1.92, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.24, P<0.05). These data demonstrate high risk of early relapse after allogeneic HCT for FLT3-mutated AML that translates into adverse disease-free and overall survival outcomes. Additional targeted and coordinated interventions are needed to maintain durable remission after allogeneic HCT in this high-risk population.","['University of Michigan Medical School, University of

TBI was carried out in 124 cases; a busulfan-based conditioning was done in 30 patients. Twenty-nine patients developed a MS (17.1%, 95% confidence intervals: 11.7-23.6). The cumulative incidence was 13.4% at 25 years of age and 35.5% at 35 years of age. A higher body mass index (BMI) before transplantation and a growth hormone deficiency were associated with increased MS risk (P=0.002 and 0.01, respectively). MS risk was similar for patients who received TBI or busulfan-based conditioning. The TBI use increased the hyperglycemia risk (odds ratio (OR): 4.7, P=0.02). Women were at the risk of developing increased waist circumference (OR: 7.18, P=0.003) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR: 2.72, P=0.007). The steroid dose was not a risk factor. The MS occurs frequently among transplanted survivors of childhood leukemia. Its incidence increases with age.

Five variant translocations involving PDGFRA have been reported. Here, we report a rare case of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia with PDGFRA rearrangement after chemotherapy for prior B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The patient had a history of BCR-ABL negative, hypodiploid B-ALL in complete remission after chemotherapy. However, 15 months later the patient developed acute myeloid leukemia with rapidly increasing eosinophilia, basophilia and a complex karyotype that included a novel t(4;14)(q12;q24). FIP1L1 was not associated with the PDGFRA rearrangement. The patient had a very aggressive clinical course, and died from the disease shortly after diagnosis.

This CD4+ cell subgroup secretes highly homologous interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F, and also expresses IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) on the cell surface. Our study aims to investigate the relationship of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL23R with disease susceptibility, and clarify the relationship between gene polymorphism variation and serum IL-17 level. 62 acute myeloid leukemia patients and 125 healthy controls were included in this study. Restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RFLP) was applied to analyze IL-17A (rs2275913; G-197A), IL17F (rs763780; A7488G; His161Arg), and IL-23R (rs11209026, G1142A; Arg381Gln) alleles. At the same time, enzyme-linked immunoassay analysis (ELISA) was used to test serum IL-17 level in patients. Acute myeloid leukemia patients presented higher rate of IL-17F G single mutant (RR=4.75, P<0.001) and GG mutation homozygote (RR=23.01, P<0.005). While IL-17A, IL-23R A single mutant and purified AA mutation homozygote showed no correlation with acute myeloid leukemia susceptibility. In addition, ELISA showed that serum IL-17 exhibited no significant difference between acute myeloid leukemia patients and healthy controls had (8.8+/-7.19 pg/ml vs. 1.4+/-0.2 pg/ml, P>0.05). IL-17F G single mutant and GG mutation homozygote were correlated with acute myeloid leukemia susceptibility, while IL-17 gene polymorphism and serum IL-17 level were not.

IV-collagenase was injected to the caudate nucleus of the rats to make ICH models. In the control group, 30 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were mock treated with saline instead of collagenase. Thirty SD rats with successful modeling were designated as the ICH group. Twenty-five SD rats with successful modeling and subsequent minimally invasive hematoma aspiration were designated as the therapy group. Expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in the brain tissues was detected by immunohistochemical assays. The expression of Hsp70, Bcl-2 and Bax in the control group was very low, and significantly increased in the ICH group and the therapy group. At each indicated time point, Hsp70 expression in the therapy group was significantly lower than that of the ICH group, Bax expression in the therapy group was significantly lower than that of the ICH group and Bcl-2 expression in the therapy group was significantly higher than that of the ICH group. These results suggest that ICH led to increased expression of apoptosis-related genes in the brain tissues.

ID1 high-expressed patients showed significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than ID1 low-expressed patients in both whole AML and non-M3 according to Kaplan-Meier analysis (p=0.007 and 0.040). However, multivariate analysis indicated that ID1 overexpression was not an independent risk factor in both whole AML and non-M3 patients. However, the adverse impact of ID1 overexpression on outcome was revealed by both Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate analysis in the non-M3 patients less than 60 years old.

METHODS: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blood plasma concentrations in 35 de novo, 6 relapse, 20 remission leukemia patients and 10 healthy kids were determined via ELISA analyses. Transcription levels of the VEGF receptors (VEGFR) Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1) and kinase-domain insert containing receptor (KDR) were determined in participants' leucocytes with RT-PCR. Apoptosis rates as well as Cyt-C and Caspase-3 expression was determined in Jurkat, Jurkat(Bcl-2), healthy and recurrent leukemia leukocytes with and without VP-16 applications via flow cytometry. Total Akt (t-Akt) expression and its phosphorylation (p-AKT) status in leukocytes of the participants were analyzed with western blots. RESULTS: Healthy children and the remission group had the lowest blood plasma VEGF concentrations (91.16+/-41.34 vs. 135.80+/-111.28 pg/ml), followed by de novo leukemia patients (362.49+/-195.68 pg/ml-494.19+/-186.23 pg/ml) and relapse patients (574.37+/-278.45 pg/ml) (P<0.01). The same trend was statistically significant visible for Flt-1 and KDR expressions in leukocytes of the participants. Stable Bcl-2 overexpression led to reduced apoptosis rates as well as Cyt-C and Caspase-3 expressions in Jurkat cells after VP-16 application, which was similar in leucocytes of remission patients. In contrast to no phosphorylation in healthy children, Akt was phosphorylated in 10% remission samples, 30% de novo leukemia samples and in 67% of recurrent leukemia leucocytes. CONCLUSION: High VEGF plus VEGFR expression and AKT phosphorylation are highest in leukocytes of remission patients, suggesting VEGF signaling as a cause of reduced apoptosis susceptibility upon treatments.","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine 639 Zhizaoju Road, Shanghai 200011, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University 389 Xincun Road, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University 389 Xincun Road, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University 389 Xincun Road, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University 389 Xincun Road, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University 389 Xincun Road, Shanghai 200065, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine 639 Zhizaoju Road, Shanghai 200011, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University 389 Xincun Road, Shanghai 200065, China.']","['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",PMC4503100,['NOTNLM'],"['Flt-1', 'KDR', 'PI3K/AKT', 'VEGF', 'apoptosis', 'leukemia']",,,20150501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTT test was used to detect the effect of GA on TF-1 leukemia cell growth. Wound closure assay and Transwell were adopted to assess the effect of GA on TF-1 migration and invasion. Migration and invasion related proteins including AKT and mTOR were detected by western blot assay. We further used western blot and immunofluorescence assay to evaluate the effect of GA on STAT3 phosphorylation in vitro. We also evaluated the anti-tumor effect of GA in TF-1 tumor bearing BALB/c mice model. The present study showed GA significant inhibit of TF-1 proliferation in a dose and time-dependent manner. GA could remarkably inhibit TF-1 cell migration and invasion; meanwhile effectively suppress AKT, mTOR, and STAT3 phosphorylation in TF-1 cells. GA in 100 mg/kg/ could inhibit the tumor growth in vivo and down-regulated AKT, mTOR, and STAT3 phosphorylation in TF-1 tumor tissues.

However, the mechanism regulating of miR-378 expression remains unknown. This study was aimed to investigate miR-378 methylation and to explore its clinical significance in AML. METHODS: Methylation status of miR-378 5'-flanking region was investigated by real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (RQ-MSP) and bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP). The expression of miR-378 was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). The correlation between expression of miR-378 and 5'-flanking region methylation was analyzed using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) treatment. RESULTS: miR-378 5'-flanking region was significantly hypomethylated in AML patients compared to controls (median 0.109 vs. 0.058) (P=0.048). miR-378 expression was correlated with miR-378 5'-flanking region in leukemic cell line treated with 5-aza-dC, but not in AML patients. The level of miR-378 hypomethylation significantly increased in M2 subtype compared to other subtypes. Moreover, patients with t(8;21) harbored the highest level of miR-378 hypomethylation. However, there was no significant difference in overall survival between patients with high and low miR-378 hypomethylation. The association of miR-378 expression with methylation was not observed in AML patients, but miR-378 expression in THP-1 line was increased while methylation status of miR-378 5-flanking region was decreased after 5-aza-dC treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that miR-378 is reactivated by demethylation after 5-aza-dC treatment. 5'-flanking region of miR-378 is hypomethylated in AML especially in those with t(8;21).","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIRN378 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",PMC4502996,['NOTNLM'],"['5-aza-dC', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'hypomethylation', 'miR-378']",,,20150501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seventy-six under 19-year-old patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with the Grupo Brasileiro de Tratamento de Leucemia da Infancia - acute lymphoblastic leukemia-93 and -99 protocols between September 2007 and December 2009 were analyzed. The diagnosis was based on cytological, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic criteria. Associations between variables, prognostic factors and response to treatment were analyzed using the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. Overall and event-free survival were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: The average age at diagnosis was 6.3+/-0.5 years and males were predominant (65%). The most frequently observed clinical features were hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Central nervous system involvement and mediastinal enlargement occurred in 6.6% and 11.8%, respectively. B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia was more common (89.5%) than T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A DNA index >1.16 was found in 19% of patients and was associated with favorable prognosis. On Day 8 of induction therapy, 95% of the patients had lymphoblast counts <1000/muL and white blood cell counts <5.0x10(9)/L. The remission induction rate was 95%, the induction mortality rate was 2.6% and overall survival was 72%. CONCLUSION: The prognostic factors identified are compatible with the literature.

Epub 2015 Jul 17.,"Salvia miltiorrhiza is a very important herbal drug of traditional Chinese medicine. Bioactive constituents are represented by two main groups of secondary metabolites, the lipophilic diterpenic quinones known as tanshinones and the hydrophilic depsides known as salvianolic acids. S. miltiorrhiza extracts and single constituents have been shown to have positive effects in central nervous system neuronal injury and degeneration in several animal models by various biological mechanisms. Both tanshinones and depsides protect against beta-amyloid-induced toxicity, but their mechanisms are complementary due to their different structure, the lipophilic tanshinones and the hydrophilic depsides. A number of anti-inflammatory mechanisms is also reported for both tanshinones and depsides. Common mechanisms are the effects on cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. In addition, depsides are inhibitors of nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase-2, while tanshinones inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and nuclear factor kappa beta. Both constituents can also modulate the protection of the central nervous system from oxidative stress with different but complementary mechanisms: tanshinones can enhance the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, while depsides can decrease reactive oxygen species.Furthermore, neuronal death underlies the symptoms of many human neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, stroke, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Both classes of constituents can enhance the antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia protein-2 family members and decrease the translocation of cytochrome c, and, in addition, depsides decrease caspase-3 and intracellular Ca(2+). Again, both classes of constituents have an activity on vascular endothelial growth factor but it is opposite, whereas tanshinones are inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase.Besides the extensive studies reporting on the biological mechanisms of depsides and tanshinones, pharmacokinetics studies are still very limited and not conclusive, especially for brain distribution. Further research is warranted to address the mechanisms of the multitarget actions of S. miltiorrhiza constituents and to translate this knowledge into clinical practice.","['Department of Chemistry University of Florence, Sesto Fiorentino, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Division of Pharmocognosy-Pharmacology, University Campus, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Chemistry University of Florence, Sesto Fiorentino, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry University of Florence, Sesto Fiorentino, Florence, Italy.']","['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Alkenes)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Depsides)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (salvianolic acid)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)']",,,,['10.1055/s-0035-1546196 [doi]'],10.1055/s-0035-1546196 [doi],20150717,['R01 DK078602/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Epub 2015 Jul 21.,"INTRODUCTION: Oral mucositis (OM) is a common and debilitating side effect of chemoradiotherapy in patients awaiting allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT). PURPOSE: The aim of this pilot RCT was to compare an oral care self-management support protocol (OrCaSS) to usual pre-aHSCT care. Feasibility was tested, effect sizes calculated for OM (primary outcome), and patient adherence was measured (secondary outcome). METHODS: Eighteen AML patients awaiting aHSCT and hospitalized between August 2012 and April 2013 were randomized 1:1 to usual care (UCG) and intervention (IG) groups. The OrCaSS protocol consisted of two sessions of educational and behavioral interventions, the first delivered 1 week pre-admission (T1), the second on admission day (T2). Via field notes, practicability and acceptability were evaluated to explore the feasibility of intervention and study procedures. OM data were collected at T1, T2, and daily for 28 days using the WHO scale. The effect size r was calculated (r less than -0.1 wedge small and greater than or equal to -0.3 wedge medium). Patients' adherence to the protocol was assessed at T1, T2, and 8-10 days post-HSCT (T3). RESULTS: Research and intervention procedures were feasible. OM incidence was 100 %. The IG's median highest OM grade was 2.0 (IQR = 2); the UCGs was 3.0 (IQR = 2; r = -0.1). Median OM durations were 12 days in the IG and 14 days in the UCG (r = -0.1). OM onset was 2 days later in the IG than in the UCG (r = -0.1). Over the course of the study, patient adherence decreased in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: OrCaSS is a promising intervention to delay and reduce OM. These results can serve to plan a larger RCT.","['Institute of Nursing Science, University of Basel, Bernoullistrasse 28, CH-4056, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Freiburg, Hugstetterstrasse 55, Freiburg, 79106, Germany.', 'Institute of Nursing Science, University of Basel, Bernoullistrasse 28, CH-4056, Basel, Switzerland.

LSC differentiation is associated with reversal of these broad epigenetic profiles, with concomitant downregulation of crucial MLL target genes and the LSC maintenance transcriptional program that is driven by the loss of H3K4me3, but not H3K79me2.

Epub 2015 Jul 14.,"The routine use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has improved patient outcomes in CD20-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Despite the clinical success achieved with rituximab, relapses are still common with further improvements in anti-CD20 mAb efficacy required. Many novel anti-CD20 antibodies are in development, but obinutuzumab is currently the only type II glycoengineered anti-CD20 mAb in clinical testing. Obinutuzumab has increased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, reduced complement-dependent cytotoxicity and enhanced direct non-apoptotic cell death. In preclinical models, obinutuzumab induced superior tumor remission compared with rituximab at the equivalent dose levels, and was active in rituximab-refractory tumors. Obinutuzumab exhibits encouraging efficacy as monotherapy in NHL, and combined with chemotherapy in relapsed/refractory NHL and treatment-naive symptomatic CLL. In a recent randomized, phase III trial in patients with untreated comorbid CLL, overall response rate was significantly greater (78% vs. 65%, P<0.0001) and median progression-free survival was significantly prolonged (26.7 vs. 15.2months, P<0.0001) for obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil vs. rituximab plus chlorambucil. Obinutuzumab is a type II anti-CD20 antibody that utilizes distinct mechanisms of action relative to type I antibodies like rituximab and has led to significant clinical improvement over rituximab in a phase III trial in CLL. Further trials are ongoing to determine whether such improvements in outcome will be seen in CD20-positive B-cell malignancies.","['Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.

However, molecular alterations that lead to EMD have not been well defined. We developed bone marrow (BM)- and EMD-prone MM syngeneic cell lines; identified that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcriptional patterns were significantly enriched in both clones compared to parental cells, together with higher levels of CXCR4 protein; and demonstrated that CXCR4 enhanced the acquisition of an EMT-like phenotype in MM cells with a phenotypic conversion for invasion, leading to higher bone metastasis and EMD dissemination in vivo. In contrast, CXCR4 silencing led to inhibited tumor growth and reduced survival. Ulocuplumab, a monoclonal anti-CXCR4 antibody, inhibited MM cell dissemination, supported by suppression of the CXCR4-driven EMT-like phenotype. These results suggest that targeting CXCR4 may act as a regulator of EMD through EMT-like transcriptional modulation, thus representing a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent MM disease progression.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo 135-8550, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

These inhibitors have serious side effects during the chemotherapy e.g. cardiotoxicity and secondary malignancies. In this study we show that sulfonoquinovosyl diacylglyceride (SQDG) isolated from Azadirachta indica exerts potent anti-ALL activity both in vitro and in vivo in nude mice and it synergizes with doxorubicin and etoposide. SQDG selectively targets ALL MOLT-4 cells by inhibiting catalytic activity of topoisomerase I enzyme and inducing p53 dependent apoptotic pathway. SQDG treatment induces recruitment of ATR at chromatin and arrests the cells in S-phase. Down-regulation of topoisomerase I or p53 renders the cells less sensitive for SQDG, while ectopic expression of wild type p53 protein in p53 deficient K562 cells results in chemosensitization of the cells for SQDG. We also show that constant ratio combinations of SQDG and etoposide or SDQG and doxorubicin exert synergistic effects on MOLT-4 cell killing. This study suggests that doses of etoposide/doxorubicin can be substantially reduced by combining SQDG with these agents during ALL chemotherapy and side effects caused can be minimized. Thus dual targeting of topoisomerase I and II enzymes is a promising strategy for improving ALL chemotherapy.","['1] Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4, Raja S.C.

In a landmark study published almost 50 years ago, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) was the first disease to be associated with HLA variation. It is now clear that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive and -negative HL are strongly associated with specific HLA polymorphisms but these differ by EBV status of the tumours. HLA class I alleles are consistently associated with EBV-positive HL while a polymorphism in HLA class II is the strongest predictor of risk of EBV-negative HL. Recent investigations, particularly genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have also revealed associations between HLA and common types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Follicular lymphoma is strongly associated with two distinct haplotypes in HLA class II whereas diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is most strongly associated with HLA-B*08. Although chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is associated with variation in HLA class II, the strongest signals in GWAS are from non-HLA polymorphisms, suggesting that inherited susceptibility is explained by co-inheritance of multiple low risk variants. Associations between B-cell derived lymphoma and HLA variation suggest that antigen presentation, or lack of, plays an important role in disease pathogenesis but the precise mechanisms have yet to be elucidated.","['MRC - University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'MRC - University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.']","['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'Hodgkin lymphoma', 'human leukocyte antigen']",['10.1111/tan.12604 [doi]'],10.1111/tan.12604 [doi],,,,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The World Health Organization classified therapy-related (t-) myeloid neoplasm (MN) as another category. It is known that t-MNs tend to have a worse prognosis than de novo (dn-) MN (dn-MN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previous exposure to chemotherapy (CT), radiotherapy (RT), or both were defined as t-CMML and lack of both as dn-CMML. RESULTS: Of 265 CMML patients, 30 (11%) had t-CMML. Seventeen (57%) patients had previous exposure to CT, 6 (20%) to RT, and 7 (23%) to CT and RT. Leukemic transformation (LT) was seen in 5 (17%). In comparison, only lower platelet count was found to be statistically significant compared with dn-CMML. Median overall survival (OS) was 20 months in the dn-CMML group versus 11 months in the t-CMML group (P = .02). Median OS was 9 months in the CT group versus 4.4 months in the RT group versus 13 months in the CT and RT group (P = .7). CONCLUSION: t-CMML comprises a small portion of all CMML cases (11%). Median OS in the dn-CMML group was longer than in the t-CMML group but LT seemed to be similar in terms of incidence and time to occurrence. Additional studies are needed to confirm our results.","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

Epub 2015 Jul 19.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose was to describe the development of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN) among a population-based cohort of pediatric cancer patients, with a focus on SMNs that occurred within the first 5 years from diagnosis. METHODS: The cohort was identified from POGONIS, an active provincial registry. Cohort members were Ontario residents ages 0 to 14.9 years at primary diagnosis between January 1985 and December 2008. SMNs that developed <18 years were captured by POGONIS, whereas SMNs diagnosed later were identified through linkage. Cumulative incidence and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated, and proportional hazards models were estimated to examine factors associated with SMN development. RESULTS: A total of 7,920 patients were eligible. 2.4% (188/7,920) developed 197 SMNs. Mean follow-up time was 10.7 years (SD = 7.6 years; range, 0.0-26.4 years) with mean time to SMN of 8.5 years (SD = 6.3 years; range, 0.0-24.9 years). The SIR for the development of a SMN was 9.9 [95% confidence interval (CI), 8.6-11.4]. 40.6% of SMNs (80/197) developed within 5 years. Early SMNs were more likely to be leukemia and lymphoma. Factors associated with early SMN were primary diagnosis of a bone tumor (OR, 4.88; 95% CI, 1.52-15.60), exposure to radiotherapy (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.02-3.22), and the highest dose of epipodophyllotoxin (OR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.88-7.42). CONCLUSIONS: Over 40% of SMNs diagnosed in childhood cancer patients occurred in the first 5 years after diagnosis, suggesting a need for early and ongoing surveillance. IMPACT: The early development of certain SMNs reinforces the need for early and continued surveillance at all stages for pediatric cancer patients.","['Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

In overwhelming majority of research studies bone marrow is used to detect minimal residual disease. The comparative characteristic of detection of minimal residual disease in peripheral blood and bone marrow was carried out. The prognostic role of occurrence of minimal residual disease in peripheral blood and bone marrow under therapy according protocol MLL-Baby was evaluated. The analysis embraced 142 pair samples from 53 patients with acute lymphoblastic leucosis and various displacements of gene MLL younger than 365 days. The minimal residual disease was detected by force of identification of chimeric transcripts using polymerase chain reaction in real-time mode in 7 sequential points of observation established by protocol of therapy. The comparability of results of qualitative detection of minimal residual disease in bone marrow and peripheral blood amounted to 84.5%. At that, in all 22 (15.5%) discordant samples minimal residual disease was detected only in bone marrow. Despite of high level of comparability of results of detection of minimal residual disease in peripheral blood and bone marrow the occurrence of minimal residual disease in peripheral blood at various stages of therapy demonstrated no independent prognostic significance. The established differences had no relationship with sensitivity of method determined by value of absolute expression of gene ABL. Most likely, these differences reflected real distribution of tumor cells. The results of study demonstrated that application of peripheral blood instead of bone marrow for monitoring of minimal residual disease under acute lymphoblastic leucosis in children of first year of life is inappropriate.

Epub 2015 Jun 6.,"BACKGROUND: The frequencies of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and IDH2 mutations among patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are different among different ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to determine the frequencies of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations among Egyptian AML patients and its effect on patient outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in 211 adult patients (104 men; 107 women; age range, 18-68 years) with cytogenetically normal AML. DNA was extracted from bone marrow samples at the time of diagnosis. The exon 4 of IDH1 and IDH2 were amplified using polymerase chain reaction and sequenced for detection of mutations. RESULTS: IDH1 mutations were detected in 18 of 211 AML patients (8.5%) in the form of 8 cases, R132H; 6 cases, R132C; 2 cases, R132S; 1 case, R132G; and 1 case, R132V mutations). IDH2 mutations were detected in 22 of 211 AML patients (10.4%) in the form of 20 cases, R140Q; and 2 cases, R172K mutations. The overall survival after correction for nucleophosmin 1 and fims- related tyrosine kinase internal tandem duplication was significantly shorter in AML patients with the IDH mutation compared with those with wild type (P = .02). CONCLUSION: IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are negative prognostic markers in AML patients. A novel mutation (R132V) was detected in IDH1 in our cohort of AML patients. We recommend molecular testing for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations for proper risk stratification of AML patients before the start of therapy.","['Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.

Here, we analyzed the genetic landscape of five patients at relapse, who developed recurrent disease without prior high-risk indication using whole-exome- and whole-genome-sequencing. Oncogenic mutations of RAS pathway genes (NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, n=4) and deactivating mutations of major epigenetic regulators (CREBBP, EP300, each n=2 and ARID4B, EZH2, MACROD2, MLL2, each n=1) were prominent in these cases and virtually absent in non-recurrent cases (n=6) or other pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases (n=18). In relapse nucleotide variations were detected in cell fate determining transcription factors (GLIS1, AKNA). Structural genomic alterations affected genes regulating B-cell development (IKZF1, PBX1, RUNX1). Eleven novel translocations involved the genes ART4, C12orf60, MACROD2, TBL1XR1, LRRN4, KIAA1467, and ELMO1/MIR1200. Typically, patients harbored only single structural variations, except for one patient who displayed massive rearrangements in the context of a germline tumor suppressor TP53 mutation and a Li-Fraumeni syndrome-like family history. Another patient harbored a germline mutation in the DNA repair factor ATM. In summary, the relapse patients of our cohort were characterized by somatic mutations affecting the RAS pathway, epigenetic and developmental programs and germline mutations in DNA repair pathways.","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany; Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China."", 'Institute of Medical Informatics, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany."", 'Oncogenetic Laboratory, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.', 'Oncogenetic Laboratory, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.', 'Oncogenetic Laboratory, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.', 'Oncogenetic Laboratory, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany; Department of Computer Science, Bonn-Rhine-Sieg University of Applied Sciences, Sankt Augustin, Germany."", 'Department of Computer Science, Bonn-Rhine-Sieg University of Applied Sciences, Sankt Augustin, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany."", 'Institute of Medical Informatics, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.

Human AML cell lines KG-1 and HL-60 expressed receptors also found on endothelial cells (ECs) such as VEGFRs, PDGFRs, and cKit. When human AML cells were co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and primary bone marrow endothelial cell (BMECs), the AML cells were more resistant to cytarabine chemotherapy, even in transwell co-culture suggesting angiocrine regulation. Primary BMECs secreted significantly increased levels of VEGF-A and PDGF-AB after exposure to cytarabine. Pazopanib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) of VEGFRs, PDGFRs, and cKit, removed EC protection of AML cells and enhanced AML cell sensitivity to cytarabine. Xenograft modeling showed significant regression of AML cells and abrogation of BM hypervascularity in RTKI treated cohorts. Together, these results show direct cytotoxicity of RTKIs on AML cells and reversal of EC protection. Combining RTKIs with chemotherapy may serve as promising therapeutic strategy for patients with AML.","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Program in Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.

The aim of this study was to investigate the absorption and distribution kinetics of imatinib in healthy Iranian volunteers using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NLMEM) to assess the overall, intra- and inter-subject variabilities in pharmacokinetic parameters after oral administration. METHODS: This analysis was based on data from 24 healthy subjects who participated in a bioequivalence study after administering a single dose of 200 mg of each formulation. Imatinib concentrations were quantified using a validated liquid chromatography method. To simultaneously describe the imatinib pharmacokinetic profiles obtained with both formulations, a population pharmacokinetic model was applied to data using SAEM algorithm implemented in MONOLIX, whilst simulations were used by numerical solving of ordinary differential equations to calculate secondary parameters in individuals for bioequivalence studies. RESULTS: According to goodness-of-fit criteria, a two-compartment open model with sequential zero- then first-order absorption and first-order elimination was used as the structural pharmacokinetic model. Inter-individual variability (IIV) was considered for all parameters. Typical population estimates (% IIV) were fraction of the drug absorbed with a zero-order kinetic (Fr) of 0.153 (47.9 %) in period (Tk0) of 0.714 h (47.4 %), first-order absorption rate constant (k a) of 0.94 h(-1)(31.2 %), oral clearance of 19 L/h (27.9 %), central volume of distribution (V c/F) of 139 L (21.5 %), apparent peripheral volume of distribution (V p/F) of 130 L (29.7 %) and the apparent inter-compartment clearance (Q/F) of 29.6 L/h (41.8 %). Body mass index (BMI) was the only covariate found to significantly affect V p /F. The coefficient of variation for intra-individual plasma exposure (AUC0-infinity) was 27.8 %. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses using NLMEM for imatinib exhibited absorption complexities such as two input rates and medium to high intra-individual variability in drug exposure.","['Biopharmaceutics and Pharmacokinetic Division, Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 14155-651, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.', 'Biopharmaceutics and Pharmacokinetic Division, Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 14155-651, Iran.', 'Department of Toxicology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Biopharmaceutics and Pharmacokinetic Division, Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 14155-651, Iran. rouini@tums.ac.ir.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,"['10.1007/s13318-015-0292-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s13318-015-0292-3 [pii]']",10.1007/s13318-015-0292-3 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 15.,"MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in infants is the most difficult-to-treat type of childhood ALL, displaying a chemotherapy-resistant phenotype, and unique histone modifications, gene expression signatures and DNA methylation patterns. MLL-rearranged infant ALL responds remarkably well to nucleoside analogue drugs in vitro, such as cytarabine and cladribine, and to the demethylating agents decitabine and zebularine as measured by cytotoxicity assays. These observations led to the inclusion of cytarabine into the treatment regimens currently used for infants with ALL. However, survival chances for infants with MLL-rearranged ALL do still not exceed 30-40%. Here we explored the in vitro potential of the novel nucleoside analogue clofarabine for MLL-rearranged infant ALL. Therefore we used both cell line models as well as primary patient cells. Compared with other nucleoside analogues, clofarabine effectively targeted primary MLL-rearranged infant ALL cells at the lowest concentrations, with median LC50 values of approximately 25 nM. Interestingly, clofarabine displayed synergistic cytotoxic effects in combination with cytarabine. Furthermore, at concentrations of 5-10nM clofarabine induced demethylation of the promoter region of the tumour suppressor gene FHIT (Fragile Histidine Triad), a gene typically hypermethylated in MLL-rearranged ALL. Demethylation of the FHIT promoter region was accompanied by subtle re-expression of this gene both at the mRNA and protein level. We conclude that clofarabine is an interesting candidate for further studies in MLL-rearranged ALL in infants.","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC - Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam, Wytemaweg 80, P.O.

Epub 2015 Jul 15.,"PURPOSE: Posaconazole is effective for the prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome during remission induction chemotherapy. However, a cost-benefit analysis of posaconazole versus fluconazole or itraconazole has not been conducted in Korea. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data for all consecutive patients who received primary antifungal prophylaxis during remission induction chemotherapy in our acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome cohort from December 2010 to November 2013. Patient characteristics and factors known as a risk of IFI were matched with propensity score analysis. We evaluated the medical cost according to the prophylactic antifungal agents (posaconazole vs fluconazole/itraconazole), the development of breakthrough IFIs, and survival status after propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio. FINDINGS: Of the 419 baseline patients, 100 patients in each group were analyzed after matching. A significant decrease was found in the development of breakthrough proven or probable IFIs (3.0% vs 14.0%; P = 0.009) and the rate of empirical antifungal therapy (EAFT) (12.0% vs 46.0%; P < 0.001) in the posaconazole group. Total in-hospital medical costs per patient were not statistically different between posaconazole and fluconazole/itraconazole prophylaxis. However, the daily medical cost was lower for posaconazole prophylaxis, resulting in a total daily cost savings of $72 (79,458) per patient (P = 0.002). In the cases of breakthrough proven/probable IFIs, EAFT, and in-hospital deaths, the total medical costs per patient were significantly higher than in nonproven/probable IFIs, non-EAFT, and in-hospital survivors, as much as $7,916 (8,700,758), $4605 (5,062,529), and $11,134 (12,238,422), respectively. Costs for the antifungal agent used in targeted or empirical therapy were lower in the posaconazole group, resulting in a savings of $697 (766,347) per patient (P < 0.001). IMPLICATIONS: Posaconazole appears to be cost beneficial for primary antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk patients with hematologic malignancy, at a single center, in Korea. Cost-benefit is closely related with clinical outcomes, including breakthrough IFI development, EAFT, and survival status.","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Vaccine Bio Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Vaccine Bio Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea; The Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

In contrast, chlorambucil, a drug in clinical use for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia reacts with nucleophiles within the major groove of DNA, leading to apoptosis. We hypothesized that hybrid molecules that combine apoptosis-dependent and apoptosis-independent mode of actions in a single molecule may lead to enhanced antitumor activity. Here, we describe the antitumor activities of chlorambucil-linked glucosamine-derived glycerolipid hybrids and investigate the role of the chlorambucil moiety and the effect of cationic charge on the hybrid molecule. Three hybrids and two control GAELs were synthesized and their activities against breast (JIMT1, MDA-MB-231, BT474), pancreas (MiaPaCa2) and prostate (DU145, PC3) cancer cell lines were determined using MTS assay. Hybrid 3 displayed the most potent activity on DU145 at CC50 of 6.0 muM while hybrid 4 displayed the best activity on JIMT1 at 7.5 muM. Hybrid 5 exhibited no activity at the highest concentration tested (CC50 >20 muM), underscoring the significance of the cationic charge at C-2 position as previously reported. Although chlorambucil (2) itself showed very little activity against all the six cell lines (CC50 >150 muM), GAELs 6 and 7 which lack the chlorambucil moiety were consistently less active than 3 and 4, suggesting that the chlorambucil moiety contributes to the overall activity. The hybrids were however not as active as the parent GAEL 1 against MiaPaCa2 whereas 6 restored activity comparable to 1.","['Department of Chemistry, University of Manitoba, 144 Dysart Rd, Winnipeg MB, R3T 2N2, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, 745 Bannatyne Avenue, Winnipeg MB, R3E 0J9, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, 745 Bannatyne Avenue, Winnipeg MB, R3E 0J9, Canada.

In this study, we investigated the role of ELL during the HTLV-1 Tax oncogene induced transactivation. We show that ectopic expression of Tax enhances ELL incorporation into p300 and P-TEFb containing transcriptional complexes and the subsequent recruitment of these complexes to target genes in vivo. Depletion of ELL abrogates Tax induced transactivation of the immediate early genes Fos, Egr2 and NF-kB, suggesting that ELL is an essential cellular cofactor of the Tax oncogene. Thus, our study identifies a novel mechanism of ELL-dependent transactivation of immediate early genes by Tax and provides the rational for further defining the genome-wide targets of Tax and ELL.","['National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

Epub 2015 Jul 15.,"Leukemia cells produce acidic metabolites due to their high metabolic condition. An alkaline pHi (intracellular pH) shift, caused by activation of the Na+/H+ exchange, is an important event in the mechanism of growth factor activity. However, the role of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger in the survival of erythroleukemia TF-1 cells has not yet been studied in detail. The aim of this study was to identify the effects of 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), a highly specific blocker of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, on the survival of SCF-dependent TF-1 cells. The effects of EIPA on survival and mitochondrial membrane potential were studied when exposing wild type TF-1 cells and TF-1 cells expressing bcl-2 to EIPA for 48h. Ectopic expression of the bcl-2 gene maintained a mildly alkaline pH and prevented the simultaneous appearance of apoptosis and autophagy (typically displayed by TF-1 cells) in the presence of EIPA. Consistent with Stem Cell Factor (SCF) function, we found that this molecule rescued TF-1 cells during autophagy but not apoptosis, allowing these cells to subsequently respond to GM-CSF. Serum deprivation or SCF withdrawal induced cell death at 36h in TF-1 and TF-1 neo cells, whereas TF-1/bcl-2 cells tended to undergo apoptosis and show acidic vacuoles after 96h, pointing to a transient anti-apoptotic effect. The present study shows the suppressive effect of EIPA on the proliferation of leukemia cell line stimulated with SCF, apparently by decreasing the mitochondria membrane potential and averting alkalinization. Through the constitutive expression of bcl-2, TF-1 cells were survival factor independent. Proliferation in these cells was not affected by EIPA at the concentrations used against parental TF-1 cells, indicating that the inhibitory effect in SCF-stimulated cells can be attributed to specific blocking of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger.","['Laboratorio de Cancer y Hematopoyesis, Seccion de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigacion, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, 11340, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Cancer y Hematopoyesis, Seccion de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigacion, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, 11340, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Cancer y Hematopoyesis, Seccion de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigacion, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, 11340, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Cancer y Hematopoyesis, Seccion de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigacion, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, 11340, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Cancer y Hematopoyesis, Seccion de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigacion, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, 11340, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Cancer y Hematopoyesis, Seccion de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigacion, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, 11340, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Cancer y Hematopoyesis, Seccion de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigacion, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, 11340, Mexico.

Despite the success of targeted therapy, the development of drug resistance remains a challenging problem. Identifying drug resistance mechanisms for targeted therapy is an area of intense investigation, and recent evidence indicates that cellular polyploidy may be involved. Here, we demonstrate that the cell cycle kinase inhibitor, Oxindole-1 (Ox-1), induces mitotic slippage, causing resistant polyploidy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Indeed, Ox-1 decreases the kinase activity of CDK1 (CDC2)/cyclin B1, leading to inhibition of Bcl-xL phosphorylation and subsequent resistance to apoptosis. Addition of ABT-263, a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, to Ox-1, or the other polyploidy-inducer, ZM447439 (ZM), produces a synergistic loss of cell viability with greater sustained tumor growth inhibition in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts. Furthermore, genetic knockdown of Bcl-xL, but not Bcl-2, exhibited synergistic inhibition of cell growth in combination with Ox-1 or ZM. These data demonstrate that Bcl-xL is a key factor in polyploidization resistance in AML, and that suppression of Bcl-xL by ABT-263, or siRNAs, may hold therapeutic utility in drug-resistant polyploid AML cells.","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Oncology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Oncology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science and Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Ultrasound, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical Collage of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematological Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Oncology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.']","['0', '(4-(4-(N-benzoylamino)anilino)-6-methoxy-7-(3-(1-morpholino)propoxy)quinazoline)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oxindoles)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0S9338U62H (2-oxindole)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",PMC4673286,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-xL', 'mitotic slippage', 'polyploidy', 'resistance', 'targeted therapy']","['4306 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4306 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 15.,"Hesx1, a homeobox gene expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), has been implicated in the core transcription factors governing the pluripotent state. However, data about the underlying mechanism of how Hesx1 is involved in maintaining pluripotency is still scarce. In this study, we find Hesx1 responds to multiple pluripotency-related pathway inhibitors as well as LIF stimulation. Particularly, the expression of Hesx1 can be readily induced by dual inhibition (2i) of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Forced expression of Hesx1 can partially compensate for the withdrawal of either LIF or each component of 2i. We also demonstrate that LIF and each inhibitor of 2i can induce Hesx1 independent of one another. We tentatively put forward that Hesx1 is a common downstream target of LIF- and 2i-mediated self-renewal signaling pathways and plays an important role in maintaining ESC identity. Our study extends the methods of identifying the missing crucial factors in establishing ESC pluripotency.","['College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, PR China; Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, PR China.', 'School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, PR China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, PR China; Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, PR China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, PR China; Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, PR China.', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200240 Shanghai, PR China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, PR China; Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, PR China.

Donor T cells are critical for the graft-versus-tumor effect but carry the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). CD34 selection with immunomagnetic beads has been an effective method of depleting alloreactive donor T cells from the peripheral blood graft and has been shown to result in significant reduction in acute and chronic GVHD. We analyzed the outcomes of 102 adults (median age, 57.6 years) with advanced MDS who received a CD34-selected allo-HSCT between January 1997 and April 2012 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The cumulative incidences of grades II to IV acute GVHD were 9.8% at day 100 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.0% to 16.5%) and 15.7% at day 180 (95% CI, 9.4% to 23.4%). The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year was 3.9% (95% CI, 1.3% to 9.0%). The cumulative incidences of relapse were 11.8% at 1 year (95% CI, 6.4% to 18.9%) and 15.7% at 2 years (95% CI, 9.4% to 23.4%). Forty-eight patients were alive with a median follow-up of 71.7 months. Rates of overall survival (OS) were 56.9% at 2 years (95% CI, 48% to 67.3%) and 49.3% at 5 years (95% CI, 40.4% to 60.2%). Rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) were 52.0% at 2 years (95% CI, 41.9% to 61.1%) and 47.6% at 5 years (95% CI, 37.5% to 56.9%). The cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality were 7.8% at day 100 (95% CI, 3.7% to 14.1%), 22.5% at 1 year (95% CI, 15.0% to 31.1%), and 33.4% at 5 years (95% CI, 24.2% to 42.6%) post-transplant. The incidence of chronic GVHD/RFS overlapped with RFS. These findings demonstrate that ex vivo T cell-depleted allo-HSCT by CD34 selection offers long-term OS and RFS with low incidences of acute and chronic GVHD and without an increased risk of relapse.","['Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York; Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.

Epub 2015 Jul 4.,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is the most pleiotropic member of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines. It utilises a receptor that consists of the LIF receptor beta and gp130 and this receptor complex is also used by ciliary neurotrophic growth factor (CNTF), oncostatin M, cardiotrophin1 (CT1) and cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC). Despite common signal transduction mechanisms (JAK/STAT, MAPK and PI3K) LIF can have paradoxically opposite effects in different cell types including stimulating or inhibiting each of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. While LIF can act on a wide range of cell types, LIF knockout mice have revealed that many of these actions are not apparent during ordinary development and that they may be the result of induced LIF expression during tissue damage or injury. Nevertheless LIF does appear to have non-redundant actions in maternal receptivity to blastocyst implantation, placental formation and in the development of the nervous system. LIF has also found practical use in the maintenance of self-renewal and totipotency of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells.","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Pde, Parkville, Melbourne 3052, VIC, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Royal Pde, Melbourne 3050, VIC, Australia.

However, one study has reported a less favorable treatment outcome with TKIs in adolescents and young adults (AYA) when compared with older patients. In the present study, we retrospectively reviewed the response to TKIs in a Japanese population of 133 CML-CP patients divided into an AYA group (n = 19) and an older group (n = 114). At diagnosis, AYA patients presented with higher white blood cell counts and lower percentage of basophils, and with lower Hasford scores, but no difference was observed in EUTOS score. Probability of achieving complete cytogenetic response was not statistically different between the groups. However, the probabilities of achieving major and complete molecular responses were significantly lower in the AYA group compared to the older group (61 vs 87 % and 17 vs. 33 % at 24 months, respectively; P < 0.05). In addition, a 7-year event-free survival was significantly lower in the AYA compared to the older adults (58 vs. 80 %, P < 0.05). These results suggest that AYA Japanese patients with CML-CP tend to have an unfavorable outcome on treatment with TKI.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan, sakurai@z5.keio.jp.']",['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],,,,['10.1007/s12185-015-1840-y [doi]'],10.1007/s12185-015-1840-y [doi],20150718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polycythemia vera requires, in the majority of cases (95%), the negativity of Breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 rearrangement and the presence of the Janus kinase 2 mutation. We report a case of erythrocytosis as the primary manifestation of a chronic myeloid leukemia, with the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome and the Breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 fusion gene, and in the absence of any Janus kinase 2 mutation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old Caucasian woman, with a history of cigarette consumption and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (undergoing continuous positive airway pressure treatment) had presented to our institution with fatigue and a hemoglobin level of 18.6g/L, with slight leukocytosis at 16G/L, and no other anomalies on her complete blood cell count. Examination of her arterial blood gases found only a slight hypoxemia; erythropoietin and ferritin levels were very low and could not explain a secondary erythrocytosis. Further analyses revealed the absence of any Janus kinase 2 mutation, thus excluding polycythemia vera. Taken together with a high vitamin B12 level, we conducted a Breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 gene analysis and bone marrow cytogenetic analysis, both of which returned positive, leading to the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: To date, this case is the first description of a Breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, presenting with erythrocytosis as the initial manifestation, and mimicking a Janus kinase 2 V617F-negative polycythemia vera. Her impressive response to imatinib therapy underscores the importance of not missing this diagnosis.","['Hopital Cantonal Fribourg, Chemin des Pensionnats 2, 1708, Fribourg, Switzerland.

Epub 2015 Jul 18.,"HLA-G is a non-classical MHC class I molecule whose suppressive activity on immune effector cells is exerted due to interactions with receptors ILT2, ILT4 and KIR2DL4. These receptors are expressed mainly on NK cells and monocytes, and their intensity of expression changes depending on HLA-G level. HLA-G plays an important role in the development of tolerance following organ transplantations and bone marrow stem cell transplantations. HLA-G also participates in the modulation of the immune response during cancerogenesis. The aim of this study was to assess HLA-G level in blood serum, the percentage of NK cells and monocytes with expression of receptors for HLA-G (ILT2, ILT4, KIR2DL4 and NKG2D) in patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantations, and their influence on the occurrence of graft-versus-host reaction. The study included 32 patients with bone marrow diseases (acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria) who received allogeneic stem cell transplantations. We assessed the expression of receptors ILT2, ILT4, KIR2DL4 and NKG2D on monocytes and NK cells, as well as the level of HLA-G in blood serum in patients before conditioning, in the transplant hematopoietic reconstitution period following allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplantation. The percentage of NK cells with expression of KIR2DL4, ILT2 and ILT4 receptors was higher in patients with 0-I grade GVHD than in patients with II-IV grade GVHD. The percentage of monocytes with expression of ILT4 and ILT2 receptors was higher in patients with 0-I grade GVHD than in patients with II-IV grade GVHD.

Underlying or associated disorders have been reported in some patients with HS. We herein report a very rare case of HS combined with acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL). CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old man presented with systemic lymph node enlargement and pancytopenia in August 2012. Bone marrow (BM) aspirate showed abnormal hematopoiesis with 3% blast, but no obvious abnormalities on flow cytometric immunophenotyping. A BM cytogenetic study and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed a 46, XY karyotype and no myelodysplastic syndrome-associated features, respectively. A right cervical node biopsy showed disrupted node structure with diffuse pleomorphic neoplastic cells that were positive for cluster of differentiation (CD) 68, MAC387 and lysozyme, but negative for CD1a, CD21, CD30, S100, and T-cell, B-cell, and myeloid lineage markers. The patient was diagnosed with HS and treated with 8 courses of CHOP chemotherapy. After 4 courses, total-body FDG-PET imaging showed partial remission and disappearance of abnormal hematopoiesis in the BM, but 2% blasts remained. Lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia recurred 1 month after the his last chemotherapy dose. He became resistant to second-line chemotherapy, with gradually increasing leukocytes, up to 50% blasts in BM in December 2013, and abnormal cells positive for CD117, CD13, CD33, HLA-DR, CD34, CD11c, CD38, and myeloperoxidase. He was diagnosed with acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL-M5), and treated by CAG regimen + decitabine, but died of severe pneumonia and hepatic failure. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case of HS combined with AMoL. The coexistence of these two neoplasms was shown by the lymph node biopsy findings and BM myeloid markers. The patient had a transient response to chemotherapy and a poor prognosis. Whether these two neoplasms were related is unclear; however, if so, we suspect the combination might be caused by a malignant transformation of a promonocyte or stem cell, upstream of histiocytes and monocytes.","['Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361004, Fujian, China. ezhuevy@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361004, Fujian, China. nxq_0988@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361004, Fujian, China. wangzhao2001@126.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361004, Fujian, China. 13606913781@139.com.', 'Clinical Laboratories, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361004, Fujian, China. 13666076913@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361004, Fujian, China. quanyilu@hotmail.com.']",,PMC4506588,,,"['10.1186/s13000-015-0350-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13000-015-0350-9 [pii]']",10.1186/s13000-015-0350-9 [doi],20150719,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 15.,"The human DMTF1 (DMP1) transcription factor, a DNA binding protein that interacts with cyclin D, is a positive regulator of the p14ARF (ARF) tumor suppressor. Our earlier studies have shown that three differentially spliced human DMP1 mRNAs, alpha, beta and gamma, arise from the human gene. We now show that DMP1alpha, beta and gamma isoforms differentially regulate ARF expression and promote distinct cellular functions. In contrast to DMP1alpha, DMP1beta and gamma did not activate the ARF promoter, whereas only beta resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of DMP1alpha-induced transactivation of the ARF promoter. Ectopic expression of DMP1beta reduced endogenous ARF mRNA levels in human fibroblasts. The DMP1beta- and gamma-isoforms share domains necessary for the inhibitory function of the beta-isoform. That DMP1beta may interact with DMP1alpha to antagonize its function was shown in DNA binding assays and in cells by the close proximity of DMP1alpha/beta in the nucleus. Cells stably expressing DMP1beta, as well as shRNA targeting all DMP1 isoforms, disrupted cellular growth arrest induced by serum deprivation or in PMA-derived macrophages in the presence or absence of cellular p53. DMP1 mRNA levels in acute myeloid leukemia samples, as compared to granulocytes, were reduced. Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia patient samples with all-trans retinoic acid promoted differentiation to granulocytes and restored DMP1 transcripts to normal granulocyte levels. Our findings imply that DMP1alpha- and beta-ratios are tightly regulated in hematopoietic cells and DMP1beta antagonizes DMP1alpha transcriptional regulation of ARF resulting in the alteration of cellular control with a gain in proliferation.","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA; Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Bern CH-3010, Switzerland.', 'Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Bern CH-3010, Switzerland.', 'Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Bern CH-3010, Switzerland.', 'Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.

In approximately 1% of CML cases, the Philadelphia chromosome associated with the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is not present, and the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is generated by cryptic insertion or sequential translocations. In this study, we describe the cytogenetic and molecular features of five CML patients with cryptic BCR-ABL1 fusion genes using karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism array techniques. Two cases of CML in the chronic phase (CP) had a normal karyotype, and three cases of CML in the blast phase (BP) had an abnormal karyotype with neither a typical nor variant t(9;22). By BCR-ABL1 metaphase FISH analysis, we found that fusion signals were localized on chromosomes 9 (3 cases), 22 (1 case), and both 9 and 22 (1 case). In two cases of CML-BP, duplication of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene occurred as a result of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes. Copy number losses involving the IKZF1 gene were observed in two patients with CML-BP. This study demonstrates for the first time the acquisition of additional BCR-ABL1 fusion genes through mitotic recombination in CML with cryptic BCR-ABL1.","['Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

Epub 2015 Jul 17.,"Cancer cells require glutamine to adapt to increased biosynthetic activity. The limiting step in intracellular glutamine catabolism involves its conversion to glutamate by glutaminase (GA). Different GA isoforms are encoded by the genes GLS1 and GLS2 in humans. Herein, we show that glutamine levels control mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Glutaminase C (GAC) is the GA isoform that is most abundantly expressed in AML. Both knockdown of GLS1 expression and pharmacologic GLS1 inhibition by the drug CB-839 can reduce OXPHOS, leading to leukemic cell proliferation arrest and apoptosis without causing cytotoxic activity against normal human CD34(+) progenitors. Strikingly, GLS1 knockdown dramatically inhibited AML development in NSG mice. The antileukemic activity of CB-839 was abrogated by both the expression of a hyperactive GAC(K320A) allele and the addition of the tricarboxyclic acid cycle product alpha-ketoglutarate, indicating the critical function of GLS1 in AML cell survival. Finally, glutaminolysis inhibition activated mitochondrial apoptosis and synergistically sensitized leukemic cells to priming with the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199. These findings show that targeting glutamine addiction via GLS1 inhibition offers a potential novel therapeutic strategy for AML.","['Institut Cochin, Departement Developpement Reproduction Cancer, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixtes de Recherche 8104, INSERM U1016, Paris, France;

CBFA2T3-GLIS2 is the most frequent chimeric oncogene identified to date in this subset of patients and confers a poor prognosis.","[""Department of Oncology and Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",,PMC4551356,,,"['S0006-4971(20)31328-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-05-567859 [doi]']",10.1182/blood-2015-05-567859 [doi],20150717,,,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 17.,"Cytopenias resulting from the impaired generation of normal blood cells from hematopoietic precursors are important contributors to morbidity and mortality in patients with leukemia. However, the process by which normal hematopoietic cells are overtaken by emerging leukemia cells and how different subsets of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) are distinctly influenced during leukemic cell infiltration is poorly understood. To investigate these important questions, we used a robust nonirradiated mouse model of human MLL-AF9 leukemia to examine the suppression of HSCs and HPCs during leukemia cell expansion in vivo. Among all the hematopoietic subsets, long-term repopulating HSCs were the least reduced, whereas megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitors were the most significantly suppressed. Notably, nearly all of the HSCs were forced into a noncycling state in leukemic marrow at late stages, but their reconstitution potential appeared to be intact upon transplantation into nonleukemic hosts. Gene expression profiling and further functional validation revealed that Egr3 was a strong limiting factor for the proliferative potential of HSCs. Therefore, this study provides not only a molecular basis for the more tightened quiescence of HSCs in leukemia, but also a novel approach for defining functional regulators of HSCs in disease.","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China;', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Tianjin, China; Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']","['0 (Egr3 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '144516-98-3 (Early Growth Response Protein 3)']",PMC4574014,,,"['S0006-4971(20)30931-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-01-623645 [doi]']",10.1182/blood-2015-01-623645 [doi],20150717,['R01 CA176179/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['Blood. 2015 Sep 10;126(11):1264-5.

Thienopyrimidine derivatives were designed to discover potent IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) inhibitors based on a known IKKbeta inhibitor library. Most of the thienopyrimidine derivatives inhibited nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which are downstream of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, but not IKKbeta. To identify the appropriate targets of thienopyrimidine analogues, chemical biology approaches, including text mining and a subsequent kinase panel assay from the kinome profiling were used. Based on the results, Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 was found to be the target for thienopyrimidine derivatives, and was confirmed to be a potent inhibitor for acute myeloid leukemia.","['Translational Research Center for Protein Function Control, Department of Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Republic of Korea.', 'Translational Research Center for Protein Function Control, Department of Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Republic of Korea.', 'Translational Research Center for Protein Function Control, Department of Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Republic of Korea. gyoonhee@yonsei.ac.kr.', 'Department of Integrated OMICS for Biomedical Sciences (WCU Program), Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Republic of Korea. gyoonhee@yonsei.ac.kr.']","['0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (thienopyrimidine)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemical biology', 'FLT3', 'Fragment-based drug design', 'Kinome', 'Text mining', 'Thienopyrimidine']","['10.1007/s12272-015-0634-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s12272-015-0634-3 [pii]']",10.1007/s12272-015-0634-3 [doi],20150718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), in particular, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, can lead to potentially severe complications in children with Noonan syndrome (NS). We studied 27 children with NS or other RASopathies and 35 age-matched children as control subjects. Peripheral blood (PB) cells from these patients were studied for in vitro colony-forming units (CFUs) activity, as well as for intracellular phosphosignaling. Higher spontaneous growth of both burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) and CFU-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) colonies from RAS-mutated patients were observed as compared with control subjects. We also observed a significantly higher amount of GM-colony-stimulating factor-induced p-ERK in children with RASopathies. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that PB cells isolated from children suffering from NS or other RASopathies without MPD display enhanced BFU-E and CFU-GM colony formation in vitro. The biological significance of these findings clearly awaits further studies. Collectively, our data provide a basis for further investigating of only partially characterized hematological alterations present in children suffering from RASopathies, and may provide new markers for progression toward malignant MPD in these patients.","['M.

It is alpha subunit of interleukin-3 (multi-CSF, IL3) receptor. Lidamycin(LDM) is a novel antibiotic composed of an apoprotein (LDP) and a chromophore (AE). We cloned, expressed and isolated IL3LDP fusion protein first then assembled with AE in vitro. We found that131/132 amino acids of IL3 were the key factors for IL3 fusion protein stability and I131L/F132L mutation effectively improved the IL3 fusion protein stability. The toxicity of IL3LDM to CD123+ tumor cells was 2-10 times compared to LDM alone and 10000 times compared to ADR. Meanwhile, IL3LDM impaired the colony-forming ability of CD123+ stem-like cells but not to CD123 negative normal cord blood cells. Three drug delivery methods in vivo were adopted: prophylactic treatment and single/multiple-dosing administration. The tumor-free survival extended to 120 d and cancer cell invasion significantly decreased after IL3LDM continuous multiple treated. Moreover, IL3LDM had been shown to modulate apoptosis by arrested cell cycle in G2/M phase. Therefore, IL3LDM is expected to be a new drug for leukemia target therapy.","['a State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology ; Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases ; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College ; Tianjin , China.', 'b Department of biochemistry ; Microbiology and Immunology ; Faculty of Medicine ; University of Ottawa ; Ottawa , ON Canada.', 'a State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology ; Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases ; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College ; Tianjin , China.', 'c Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College ; Beijing , China.', 'a State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology ; Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases ; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College ; Tianjin , China.', 'd Department of Pharmacology ; Shanxi Medical University ; Taiyuan, Shanxi , PR China.', ""e Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University ; Zhenjiang, Jiangsu , PR China."", ""e Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University ; Zhenjiang, Jiangsu , PR China."", 'd Department of Pharmacology ; Shanxi Medical University ; Taiyuan, Shanxi , PR China.', 'a State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology ; Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases ; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College ; Tianjin , China.', 'a State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology ; Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases ; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College ; Tianjin , China.']","['0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",PMC4846095,['NOTNLM'],"['CD123', 'LDM', 'interleukin 3', 'leukemia stem cells', 'target therapy']",['10.1080/15384047.2015.1071733 [doi]'],10.1080/15384047.2015.1071733 [doi],20150717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative IgE binding to rBet v 1a depends on its native protein conformation, which might be compromised upon heterologous expression, purification, or mutational engineering of rBet v 1a. OBJECTIVE: To correlate experimental/theoretical comparisons of IgE binding of defined molar ratios of folded/misfolded recombinant Bet v 1a variants and to determine accuracy and precision of immuno- and physicochemical assays routinely used to assess the quality of recombinant allergen preparations. METHODS: rBet v 1a and its misfolded variant rBet v 1aS112P/R145P were heterologously expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Structural integrities and oligomerisation of the recombinant allergens were evaluated by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). IgE binding of defined combinations of rBet v 1a and rBet v 1aS112P/R145P was assessed using immunoblotting (IB), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and mediator release (MR) of humanized rat basophilic leukemia cells sensitized with serum IgE of subjects allergic to birch pollen. Experimental and theoretically expected results of the analyses were compared. RESULTS: 1H-NMR spectra of rBet v 1a and rBet v 1aS112P/R145P demonstrate a native and highly disordered protein conformations, respectively. The CD spectra suggested typical alpha-helical and beta-sheet secondary structure content of rBet v 1a and random coil for rBet v 1aS112P/R145P. The hydrodynamic radii (RH) of 2.49 +/- 0.39 nm (rBet v 1a) and 3.1 +/- 0.56 nm (rBet v 1aS112P/R145P) showed monomeric dispersion of both allergens in solution. Serum IgE of birch pollen allergic subjects bound to 0.1% rBet v 1a in the presence of 99.9% of non-IgE binding rBet v 1aS112P/R145P. Immunoblot analysis overestimated, whereas ELISA and mediator release assay underestimated the actual quantity of IgE-reactive rBet v 1a in mixtures of rBet v 1a/rBet v 1aS112P/R145P with a molar ratio of rBet v 1a </= 10%. CONCLUSION: Valid conclusions on quantitative IgE binding of recombinant Bet v 1a preparations depend on the accuracy and precision of physico- and immunochemical assays with which natively folded allergen is detected.","['Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Hesse, Germany.', 'Division of EU Cooperation/Microbiology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Section Biostatistics, Langen, Hesse, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Hesse, Germany.', 'Department of Biopolymers, University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Bavaria, Germany.', 'Department of Biopolymers, University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Bavaria, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center, Mainz, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Saxony, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Saxony, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Hesse, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Hesse, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Hesse, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Hesse, Germany.', 'Department of Biopolymers, University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Bavaria, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Hesse, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Hesse, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Hesse, Germany.']","['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Immobilized Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '126161-14-6 (Bet v 1 allergen, Betula)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",PMC4506129,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0132956 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-13376 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0132956 [doi],20150717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 17.,"BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukaemia not responsive to first induction chemotherapy (PIF-AML) still remains a challenge, and there are only few recent epidemiological data regarding the outcome of these patients. In this multicentre survey, we evaluate the prognosis and outcome of patients with PIF-AML, who were diagnosed and treated in the last 5 yrs in four Italian institutions. RESULTS: One hundred PIF-AML were recorded, 57 males and 43 females, with a median age of 63 yrs (19-79), 42% were younger than 60 yrs; 42% had a secondary AML and 40% had an adverse karyotype. According to cytogenetic/molecular risk stratification at diagnosis, 33% of patients were classified as favourable/intermediate-1 risk and 56% as intermediate-2/adverse risk. After a median follow-up of 11 months (1-49), 77% of patients died, while 23% were alive (with 12/23 in cCR). Thirty-six patients underwent allogeneic SCT, and of these, 11 of 36 (31%) were alive at last follow-up. The 12- and 24-month OS probability of the whole population was 45% and 21%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the probability of OS of the whole population was significantly improved by Allo-SCT procedure (12-month OS probability 60% vs. 35%; P < 0.0001) and was better in patients with favourable/intermediate-1 risk at diagnosis (12-month OS probability 58% vs. 40%; P = 0.028). In transplanted cases, a pretransplant responsive disease was the only significant factor to predict a favourable outcome after Allo-SCT (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Treatment options of PIF-AML still are limited and the prognosis, even recently, remains extremely poor. This survey shows that PIF-AML is still rarely cured without Allo-SCT and confirms the importance of initiating an urgent unrelated donor search in cases without a matched sibling donor. Moreover, the outcome of Allo-SCT is better in patients who achieve a good AML debulking before transplant. To reach this goal, new predictive scores and new protocols of salvage therapy (with target drugs or combinations) need to be explored urgently in PIF-AML.","['Division of Hematology and SCT, University Hospital of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and SCT, University Hospital of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Hospital of Treviso, Treviso, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and SCT, University Hospital of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and SCT, University Hospital of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Hospital of Treviso, Treviso, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and SCT, University Hospital of Udine, Udine, Italy.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukaemia', 'primary induction failure']",['10.1111/ejh.12635 [doi]'],10.1111/ejh.12635 [doi],20150817,,,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Our current studies have shown that metformin suppresses cell viability, induces apoptosis, and downregulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway both in the Ph+ALL cell line and primary blasts from Ph+ ALL patients, as well as the CML cell lines K562 (imatinib-sensitive) and K562R (imatinib-resistance). We have also shown that metformin activates the ERK pathway in Ph+ALL cells, SUP-B15, a side effect that can be overcome by U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor) or imatinib. Moreover, this activation of ERK signaling in SUP-B15 induces autophagy. Inhibition of the autophagic process by 3-MA, promoting the death of these cells, suggests that autophagy may be a cytoprotective factor in cell survival after metformin treatment. Finally, metformin is shown to potentiate the anticancer efficacy of imatinib in Ph+ALL and CML cells, resensitizing the CML imatinib-resistance cells to imatinib. Overall, our data suggest that metformin represents a promising and attractive agent for Ph+ALL or CML therapy.","['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)']",,,,['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000266 [doi]'],10.1097/CAD.0000000000000266 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some recipients develop EBVD relatively late after haploHSCT, and most of these patients suffer a poor outcome. This retrospective cohort study characterized the early adaptive immune recovery of patients with acute leukemia presenting with EBVD more than 100 d after haploHSCT. Patients with acute leukemia who received haploHSCT and developed EBVD 100 d later (n = 8) were compared with a matched control group without EBVD (n = 24) with regard to peripheral WBC, lymphocytes, and neutrophils (at 30, 60, and 90 d) and recoveries of B and T lymphocytes (at 30 and 90 d, via immunophenotyping/flow cytometry). Ninety days after haploHSCT, the median values of WBCs and lymphocytes, and the recoveries of CD19(+) B cells and CD4(+) , CD8(+) , and CD4(+) CD45RO(+) T cells, were significantly lower in patients who developed EBVD, relative to the control group. These results suggest a significant association between deficient early recovery of B and T lymphocytes and the development of late-onset EBVD after haploHSCT. Our observation could facilitate clinical intervention and the improvement of overall survival of patients undergoing haploHSCT.","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China.""]",,,['NOTNLM'],"['EBV-related disease', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'acute leukemia', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'immune reconstitution']",['10.1111/ctr.12593 [doi]'],10.1111/ctr.12593 [doi],20150820,,,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

MTX clearance status was independently related to CCR decrease, with the risk of 8.07 to develop renal impairment in patients with delayed MTX elimination. Serum creatinine concentration, serum creatinine ratio, CCR, and CCR ratio at 24 hours were all related to MTX elimination delay. Patients with serum creatinine level >35.0 mumol/L, creatinine ratio >1.129, or CCR <100.0 mL/min were more likely to undergo MTX elimination delay.

Epub 2014 May 14.,"BACKGROUND: Parainfluenza virus (PIV), a common pediatric pathogen, is associated with significant morbidity in immunocompromised (IC) hosts. DAS181, a novel sialidase fusion protein inhibitor, seems to be effective against PIV in vitro and in vivo; its use in IC children has not been evaluated. METHODS: Patients were diagnosed with PIV infection using a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. DAS181 was obtained under emergency investigational new drug applications and was administered via aerosol chamber or nebulizer. Patients were assessed daily for their clinical condition and adverse outcomes. RESULTS: Four pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients with PIV detected in respiratory specimens were identified and treated with DAS 181. Patients 1 and 2 were diagnosed with PIV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) by bronchoalveolar lavage at 9 months and 2 days after allogeneic transplantation, respectively. Patient 3 was on chemotherapy prior to planned autologous HCT at time of PIV diagnosis from a nasal swab. Patient 4 was diagnosed with PIV via nasal wash 2 days after HCT. Patients 1-3 had clinical symptoms and chest imaging consistent with LRTI. Inhaled DAS181 was administered for 5-10 days. All 4 patients tolerated therapy well. Clinical improvement in oxygen requirement and respiratory rate was observed in all patients who required oxygen at therapy initiation. Viral load decreased in all patients within 1 week of therapy and became undetectable by day 3 of therapy in patient 3. CONCLUSION: DAS181 was used to treat 4 severely IC pediatric patients with PIV disease. The drug was well tolerated. Improvement in both viral loads and symptoms after initiation of therapy was observed in all cases. This report supports prospective, randomized studies in IC patients with PIV infection.","[""Seattle Children's Hospital , Washington ; University of Washington , Seattle ; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle, Washington."", ""Seattle Children's Hospital , Washington ; University of Washington , Seattle."", ""Seattle Children's Hospital , Washington ; University of Washington , Seattle ; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle, Washington."", ""Seattle Children's Hospital , Washington ; University of Washington , Seattle."", 'University of Washington , Seattle.', 'University of Washington , Seattle ; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle, Washington.', 'Ansun BioPharma, San Diego, California.', ""Seattle Children's Hospital , Washington ; University of Washington , Seattle.""]","['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '227R1C272Q (oplunofusp)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",PMC4501511,['NOTNLM'],"['*antiviral therapy', '*hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*parainfluenza virus']","['10.1093/jpids/piu039 [doi]', 'piu039 [pii]']",10.1093/jpids/piu039 [doi],20140514,['T32 HD007233/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jun 21.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients suffer from chronic airway inflammation with excessive neutrophil infiltration. Migration of neutrophils to the lung requires chemokine and cytokine signaling as well as cell adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which plays an important role in mediating adhesive interactions between effector and target cells in the immune system. In this study, we investigated the relationship between ICAM-1 and epithelium-specific ETS-like transcription factor 1 (ESE-1) and found that ICAM-1 expression is upregulated in cell lines of CF (IB3-1) as well as non-CF (BEAS-2B and A549) epithelial origin in response to inflammatory cytokine stimulation. Since ESE-1 is highly expressed in A549 cells without stimulation, we examined the effect of ESE-1 knockdown on ICAM-1 expression in these cells. We found that ICAM-1 expression was downregulated when ESE-1 was knocked down in A549 cells. We also tested the effect of ESE-1 knockdown on cell-cell interactions and demonstrate that the knocking down ESE-1 in A549 cells reduce their interactions with HL-60 cells (human promyelocytic leukemia cell line). These results suggest that ESE-1 may play a role in regulating airway inflammation by regulating ICAM-1 expression.","['State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease and Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China.', 'State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease and Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, China.', 'Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Department of Pathophysiology, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangdong, China.', 'Physiology & Experimental Medicine Program, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1X8.', 'Physiology & Experimental Medicine Program, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1X8 ; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 1A8.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Affiliated to Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510180, China."", 'Physiology & Experimental Medicine Program, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1X8 ; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 1A8.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELF3 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",PMC4491396,,,['10.1155/2015/547928 [doi]'],10.1155/2015/547928 [doi],20150621,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In the present case, at initial diagnosis, the hallmark phenotype of APML was found (strong CD33 and cytoplasmic MPO expression, absence of HLA-DR expression). RESULTS: Both CD34 and CD56 antigen expression was considered negative. The patient relapsed 3 years after reaching complete remission, and the hallmark surface antigen combination for APML was again found. In contrast, the leukemic cells now clearly coexpressed CD34 and CD56. Retrospective analysis revealed the presence of small CD34+ and CD56+ populations at initial diagnosis (<20%). CONCLUSIONS: This case report suggests that the presence of a clone with minimal coexpression of CD34/CD56 in APML at initial diagnosis should not be neglected since it may be associated with earlier relapse.","['From the Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.

METHODS: We describe four patients with CLL and concurrent or subsequent B-LBL diagnosed by morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular analysis and reviewed the literature. RESULTS: In three patients, B-LBL followed CLL by 5 to 15 years, and in one patient, B-LBL was diagnosed simultaneously with CLL. In all cases, the CLL had a typical immunophenotype, and the B-LBL blasts showed an immature B-cell immunophenotype with expression of CD10, CD19, and TdT and absence of surface immunoglobulin. In two patients, B-LBL blasts harbored t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)/BCR-ABL1. We sequenced the IGHV genes in both CLL and B-LBL in two patients and showed that IGHV usage differed.

A detailed comparison between the two regarding clinicopathologic features with genetic analysis has not been performed previously. This parallel study assessed how different RUNX1 abnormalities affect the clinicopathology of B-ALL. METHODS: We compared clinicopathologic factors, including age, sex, WBC count, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) involvement, immunophenotype, and blast proliferation rate between B-ALL with RUNX1 amplification (10 cases) and B-ALL with ETV6-RUNX1 translocation (67 cases) in childhood B-ALL. RESULTS: CD7 was often expressed in RUNX1 amplification but not in ETV6-RUNX1 (44% vs 0%, P = .0001) and appeared to correlate with CSF involvement in the former group (3/4 [75%]). CD13 was often detected in ETV6-RUNX1 with additional RUNX1 gain (38%) with an even higher frequency in double ETV6-RUNX1 translocation (77%), but was not detected in RUNX1 amplification (0%, P < .05). Children with RUNX1 amplification were older and more often CSF positive, while those with ETV6-RUNX1 were younger, more frequently had hyperleukocytosis, and had higher blast proliferation rates. CONCLUSIONS: RUNX1 copy numbers seem to be proportional to the age of B-ALL onset and the frequency of CSF involvement, while RUNX1 amplification vs translocation causes aberrant expression of CD7 and CD13, respectively.","['From the Department of Pathology and.', 'From the Department of Pathology and Colorado Genetics Laboratory, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora and.', 'From the Department of Pathology and Colorado Genetics Laboratory, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora and.', ""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora."", ""From the Department of Pathology and Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora. liang.xiayuan@childrenscolorado.org.""]","['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'ETV6-RUNX1', 'Precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia', 'RUNX1', 'TEL-AML1', 'iAMP21']","['144/2/305 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPVY5E5OMMYBFJ [doi]']",10.1309/AJCPVY5E5OMMYBFJ [doi],,,,['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Low hypodiploidy and near-haploidy are thought to be confined to pediatric B-ALL and associated with a poor prognosis. Doubling of either a low-hypodiploid or a near-haploid clone results in an apparently high-hyperdiploid karyotype, which is often misclassified for risk. METHODS: We studied four patients with B-ALL who had chromosome genomic array testing (CGAT), along with fluorescence in situ hybridization and mutation testing. RESULTS: We identified a unique case of adult B-ALL with masked low hypodiploidy (mLH) by genomic duplication, along with a somatic deletion of the IKZF3 gene and a somatic TP53 mutation. Three cases of pediatric B-ALL with mLH, two with TP53 mutations and one untested, were also identified and compared with the adult patient. CONCLUSIONS: CGAT was critical in the genotype clarification of these cases through detection of copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity and should be considered performing for B-ALL with apparent hyperdiploidy for accurate prognostic risk stratification and treatment planning.","['From the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; University of Washington, Seattle; Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA; mfang@fhcrc.org.', 'From the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; University of Washington, Seattle;', 'From the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; University of Washington, Seattle;', 'From the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; University of Washington, Seattle; Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA;', 'From the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; University of Washington, Seattle; Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA;', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers and Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston;"", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers and Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston;"", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers and Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston;"", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers and Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston;"", 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers and Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston;"", 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']","['0 (IKZF3 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia', 'IKZF', 'TP53', 'chromosome genomic array testing', 'copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity', 'single-nucleotide polymorphism array']","['144/2/263 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPW83OXPYKPEEN [doi]']",10.1309/AJCPW83OXPYKPEEN [doi],,,,['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Establishing a diagnosis of isolated MS requires a high index of suspicion and use of immunophenotypic methods. Recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities or gene mutations that occur in MS mirror those known to occur in AML. CONCLUSIONS: In the era of targeted therapy and sophisticated risk stratification, every attempt must be made to perform a complete workup on MS cases (or concurrent AML) since the diagnosis of MS, in itself, is no longer adequate for patient management.

This concept, however, is not universally accepted since there are confounding variables in attributing myeloid neoplasms to earlier therapies. METHODS: Cases in session 6 of the 2013 Workshop of the Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology illustrated myeloid neoplasms thought likely to be TR-MNs, and discussed the differences and biologic similarities with de novo myeloid neoplasms. RESULTS: We reviewed data showing that diagnosis of TR-MN alters patient outcome only in specific subsets. The session also included examples of therapy-related AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, such as t(15;17), inv(16), and t(8;21), and reports were highlighted showing that patients with these neoplasms have clinical outcomes similar to patients with their de novo counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The study of TR-MNs will likely provide insight into the pathogenesis of de novo myeloid disease and may explain why some patients with cancer develop TR-MN and evidently have a higher genetic susceptibility, whereas most patients treated with the same agents do not. These studies will also result in critical reappraisal of current concepts related to TR-MNs.","['From the Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, and cbuesora@mdanderson.org cahanson@mayo.edu.', 'From the Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, and.', 'From the Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, and.', 'The Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. cbuesora@mdanderson.org cahanson@mayo.edu.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ionizing radiation therapy', 'Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia', 'Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome', 'Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms', 'Topoisomerase II inhibitors', 'alkylating agents']","['144/2/207 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPU1JO2LYTWUAV [doi]']",10.1309/AJCPU1JO2LYTWUAV [doi],,,,['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 16.,"OBJECTIVE: To review and summarize data on idelalisib, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2014 for use in combination with rituximab for relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). DATA SOURCES: A literature search using PubMed was conducted from January 2011 through May 2015 using the terms idelalisib, GS-101, CAL-101, PI3Kdelta, and CLL. Data were also obtained through the FDA briefing documents, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and American Society of Hematology abstracts. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: The literature search was limited to human studies published in English. Priority was placed on trials of idelalisib in CLL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Idelalisib is a potent, first-in-class selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinasedelta (PI3Kdelta) approved by the FDA in July 2014 for the treatment of relapsed CLL, in combination with rituximab, in patients for whom rituximab monotherapy would be considered appropriate due to other comorbidities. PI3Kdelta is hyperactivated in B-cell malignancies and plays a vital role in the B-cell receptor pathway, a key oncogenic driver in various B-cell malignancies, including CLL. Several phase I/II studies have demonstrated clinical activity of idelalisib in CLL, particularly in the setting of relapsed/refractory disease, with overall response rate ranging from 70% to 82%. The FDA approval was based on a phase III, randomized trial of rituximab monotherapy (n = 110) or idelalisib in combination with rituximab (n = 110) in heavily, pre-treated patients (median of 3 prior therapies) with relapsed CLL. Idelalisib was administered as 150 mg orally twice daily. Idelalisib plus rituximab was associated with an overall response rate of 81% and overall survival of 91% at 12 months. The median progression-free survival was not reached in the idelalisib arm at the time of the first interim analysis. The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events in the idelalisib plus rituximab arm was as follows: neutropenia (34%), thrombocytopenia (10%), anemia (5%), elevation in transaminases (5%), and diarrhea (4%). CONCLUSION: Idelalisib in combination with rituximab is a safe and effective new treatment option for patients with relapsed CLL, including those with poor prognostic factors. As the results from various ongoing studies become available, the role of idelalisib will likely continue to expand.","['Georgia Regents Medical Center, Augusta, GA, USA arshah@gru.edu.', 'Georgia Regents Medical Center, Augusta, GA, USA.']","['0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CAL-101', 'GS-101', 'PI3Kdelta and relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'idelalisib']","['1060028015594813 [pii]', '10.1177/1060028015594813 [doi]']",10.1177/1060028015594813 [doi],20150716,,,['(c) The Author(s) 2015.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 16.,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is an important infectious agent of cats. Clinical syndromes resulting from FIV infection include immunodeficiency, opportunistic infections, and neoplasia. In our study, a 5' long terminal repeat/gag region-based reverse transcription insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction (RT-iiPCR) was developed to amplify all known FIV strains to facilitate point-of-need FIV diagnosis. The RT-iiPCR method was applied in a point-of-need PCR detection platform--a field-deployable device capable of generating automatically interpreted RT-iiPCR results from nucleic acids within 1 hr. Limit of detection 95% of FIV RT-iiPCR was calculated to be 95 copies standard in vitro transcription RNA per reaction. Endpoint dilution studies with serial dilutions of an ATCC FIV type strain showed that the sensitivity of lyophilized FIV RT-iiPCR reagent was comparable to that of a reference nested PCR. The established reaction did not amplify any nontargeted feline pathogens, including Felid herpesvirus 1, feline coronavirus, Feline calicivirus, Feline leukemia virus, Mycoplasma haemofelis, and Chlamydophila felis. Based on analysis of 76 clinical samples (including blood and bone marrow) with the FIV RT-iiPCR, test sensitivity was 97.78% (44/45), specificity was 100.00% (31/31), and agreement was 98.65% (75/76), determined against a reference nested-PCR assay.

However, the expression pattern of miR-328 and the impact on prognosis has not yet been studied in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The purpose of this study is to investigate the expression status of miR-328 and its clinical significance in AML patients. METHODS: RNA was extracted from plasma of 176 patients with newly diagnosed AML and 70 healthy volunteers. The miR-328 expression was examined by Realtime quantitative PCR. The association of circulating miR-328 expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis of AML patients was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of miR-328 was significantly downregulated in AML patients (median value 22.99, range: 3.63-242.0) compared with those of healthy controls (median value 89.17, range: 12.05-397.7; P < 0.001), and miR-328 expression was markedly increased in patients after treatment than before (23.40 +/- 1.76 vs. 46.61 +/- 3.83, P < 0.001). Moreover, low levels of miR-328 were associated with a higher white blood cell count and BM blast count (P = 0.026 and P = 0.003, respectively), and lower hemoglobin and platelet count (P = 0.004 and P = 0.022, respectively). Patients with low miR-328 expression had a relatively poor overall survival (P = 0.022) and shorter relapse-free survival (P = 0.008) than those with high miR-328 expression. In addition, low miR-328 expression was an independent prognostic factors for both OS (P = 0.017) and RFS (P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating miR-328 downregulation is a common event and is associated with poor clinical outcome in AML patients.","[""Department of Haematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, No.1, Xinsi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710038, People's Republic of China. lliu6699@126.com."", ""Department of Haematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, No.1, Xinsi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Haematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, No.1, Xinsi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Haematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, No.1, Xinsi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Haematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, No.1, Xinsi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710038, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Haematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, No.1, Xinsi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710038, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (MIRN328 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",PMC4504459,,,"['10.1186/s13000-015-0345-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s13000-015-0345-6 [pii]']",10.1186/s13000-015-0345-6 [doi],20150717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 17.,"Bone marrow necrosis (BMN) is a rare phenomenon in children with malignancies, occurring most commonly in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The pathophysiology of this phenomenon has not been identified. We analyzed seven BMN cases with ALL in order to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Serum high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), cytochrome C, cytokines, and chemokines were measured, and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-RT-PCR) and immunochemistry of death-related molecules were analyzed using bone marrow samples. The serum levels of 17 of 27 cytokines and chemokines were found to be significantly elevated in patients with BMN in comparison to those in healthy volunteers; however, IFN-gamma and IL-10 were not elevated. The cytokine pattern was different to that reported in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The HMGB1 and cytochrome C levels in patients with BMN were not elevated. RQ-RT-PCR revealed significant overexpression of Fas-ligand, perforin, and granzyme B in the bone marrow of patients with ALL complicated with BMN compared with that in healthy volunteers and in patients with ALL without BMN. On immunohistochemistry, we identified leukemic cell-eliciting Fas-ligand and macrophage-eliciting TNF-alpha. Thus, no close relationship with massive necrosis or the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis was identified in the occurrence of BMN. These results suggest that the massive cell death phenomenon called BMN is partially induced by the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.","['Division of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan, hiroshi_moritake@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.']","['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (HMGB1 protein, human)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",,,,['10.1007/s12185-015-1843-8 [doi]'],10.1007/s12185-015-1843-8 [doi],20150717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that the cytotoxic activity of AG490 correlated with the reduction of HSP70 and its master regulator HSF1 that, based on knocking-down experiments, was found to play a pro-survival role in PEL cells. To counteract the pro-death effect mediated by HSF1/HSP70 down-regulation, AG490 induced a complete autophagy, whose inhibition potentiated its cytotoxic effect against PEL cells. AG490 as well as HSF1 siRNA reduced the expression of Mcl-1, a Bcl-2 family member that negatively regulates apoptosis and autophagy. These results suggest that STAT3 inhibition, by down-regulating the expression of HSF1/HSP70, reduces Mcl-1 and leads to both apoptosis and autophagy induction in PEL cells.","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Rome, Italy.

Alternative or additional targeting of signalling pathways deregulated in Bcr-Abl-driven chronic myeloid leukemia may provide a feasible option for improving clinical response and overcoming resistance. RESULTS: In this study, we investigate ability of CR8 isomers (R-CR8 and S-CR8) and MR4, three derivatives of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) inhibitor Roscovitine, to exert anti-leukemic activities against chronic myeloid leukemia in vitro and then, we decipher their mechanisms of action. We show that these CDKs inhibitors are potent inducers of growth arrest and apoptosis of both Imatinib-sensitive and -resistant chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines.

Epub 2015 Jul 17.,"BACKGROUND: Confirming diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is often challenging. Standard diagnostic methods are cytomorphology (CM) and cytogenetics. Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) is upcoming in MDS diagnostic work up, comparability and investigator experiences are critical. Myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) in myelomonocytic cells might be expressed more weakly in patients with MDS. The analysis of MNDA may thus improve diagnostic capabilities of MFC in MDS. METHODS: Staining methods and antibody combinations for MFC in MDS are outlined, giving details for interpretation of results in regard to dyspoiesis. MFC results are correlated with CM and CG and with survival data. Use of MNDA in MDS diagnostics was evaluated in 239 patients with MDS, AML, other cytopenic conditions, and in 30 negative controls. RESULTS: Strong correlation between findings in CM and MFC was found; MFC results correlated well with those of CG. Patients with higher grades of dysplasia in MFC had shorter overall survival. Percentages of granulocytes and monocytes with diminished MNDA expression (%dimG, %dimM) were higher in patients with MDS and AML. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of MNDA in monocytes was lower in MDS and AML. Cut-off values for %dimG (12%) and %dimM (22%) as well as for MFI in monocytes (72) were defined discriminating between MDS and non-MDS. CONCLUSION: MFC adds significant information on dyspoiesis in the diagnostic work up for MDS and provides prognostic information. MNDA expression can be assessed by MFC and may facilitate evaluation of dyspoiesis when added to MDS MFC panels.

Low-intensity treatments (low-dose cytarabine, hypomethylating agents) have the potential to reduce transfusion dependence, and improve health-related quality of life. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of treatment types regarding blood product transfusions in a cohort of 214 AML patients aged >/= 70 years. RESULTS: Analyzes did not indicate any significant overall survival (OS) advantage of intensive chemotherapy comparatively to low-intensity treatment. The difference was significant when compared to best supportive care (BSC) (P<0.0001). Blood products transfusion cost per patient was 1.3 times lower with low-intensity therapy and 2.7 times lower with BSC than with intensive chemotherapy. Mean transfusion cost per patient according to OS varied from 2.4 to 1.3 times less with low-intensity treatment comparatively to intensive chemotherapy for patients having OS </= 13.3 months. Costs varied from 3.5 to 2.6 times less with BSC comparatively to intensive chemotherapy. In contrast, mean transfusion costs were comparable among treatments for patients with OS>13.3 months. CONCLUSION: Low-intensity treatments represent a cost-effective alternative to BSC and require a reduced number of transfused blood products comparatively to intensive chemotherapy, while OS was not significantly different.","['Hospices civils de Lyon, Edouard-Herriot Hospital, Lyon, France; Croix-Rousse Hospital, Lyon, France.', 'Hospices civils de Lyon, Edouard-Herriot Hospital, Lyon, France.', 'Hospices civils de Lyon, Edouard-Herriot Hospital, Lyon, France.', 'Hematology, hospices civils de Lyon, Lyon-Sud Hospital, pavillon Marcel-Berard, batiment 1G, 69495 Pierre-Benite, France.

We aimed to determine the incidence of CNSC and its impact on survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with hematologic disorders who received allo-HSCT between 2002 and 2011 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. RESULTS: Of the 351 patients identified, 45 developed CNSC (12.8%). The 100-day cumulative incidence of CNSC was 8% (95% confidence interval, 8-15). The most common CNSC included posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (40%), stroke or transient ischemic attack (24%), seizures (20%), and infection (9%). The 5-year overall survival was significantly lower among patients with versus without CNSC (14% vs. 44%, P = .0004). In multivariate analysis, the risk of mortality for patients with versus without CNSC was significantly higher (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.36; P = .04). CONCLUSION: The occurrence of CNSC after allo-HSCT was associated with reduced survival. Identifying patients at risk, monitoring, early detection, and management of CNSC after allo-HSCT are needed to improve outcomes.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Department of Neurology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Department of Neurology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Department of Neurology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.

Herein, we described, for the first time, the intranuclear distribution patterns of viral DNA replication events, preceding those that occur in the cytoplasmic compartment. Using BrdU pulse-labelling experiments, newly synthesized ASFV genomes were exclusively detected inside the host cell nucleus at the early phase of infection, both in swine monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and Vero cells. From 8hpi onwards, BrdU labelling was only observed in ASFV cytoplasmic factories. Our results also show that ASFV specifically activates the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Rad-3 related (ATR) pathway in ASFV-infected swine MDMs from the early phase of infection, most probably because ASFV genome is recognized as foreign DNA. Morphological changes of promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), nuclear speckles and Cajal bodies were also found in ASFV-infected swine MDMs, strongly suggesting the viral modulation of cellular antiviral responses and cellular transcription, respectively. As described for other viral infections, the nuclear reorganization that takes place during ASFV infection may also provide an environment that favours its intranuclear replication events. Altogether, our results contribute for a better understanding of ASFV replication strategies, starting with an essential intranuclear DNA replication phase which induces host nucleus changes towards a successful viral infection.","['CIISA, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidade de Lisboa, Avenida da Universidade Tecnica, 1300-477 Lisboa, Portugal.', 'CIISA, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidade de Lisboa, Avenida da Universidade Tecnica, 1300-477 Lisboa, Portugal.', 'CIISA, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidade de Lisboa, Avenida da Universidade Tecnica, 1300-477 Lisboa, Portugal.

Several reports have suggested clinical activity of hypomethylating agents in these patients. We conducted a retrospective study of 21 patients with MPN-AML, 13 with MPN-AP and 11 with DIPSS-plus high-risk PMF treated with decitabine at our institution over the last 7 years and evaluated their clinical outcomes. Six patients (29%) with MPN-AML responded to decitabine (3 CR, 2 CRi, and 1 PR); median response duration was 7 months. The median overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in those who responded (10.5 vs 4 months). Among patients with MPN-AP, 8 patients (62%) benefited; the median response duration was 6.5 months. The median OS was 11.8 months in responders vs 4.7 months in non-responders. Among patients with DIPSS-plus high-risk PMF, 9 (82%) benefited; the median response duration was 9 months. The median OS was 32 months in responders vs 16.3 months in non-responders.

Interestingly, there was no meaningful association between 3-year RFS and initial white blood cell count, FLT3-ITD status, or type of PML-RARA isoforms. In multivariable analysis, the CD56 expression was the only independent risk factor in terms of RFS (hazard ratio, 4.70; P=0.005). These results suggested that ATO-based therapy may ameliorate the unfavorable influence of previously known high-risk features; moreover, CD56 expression remains to be a potentially unfavorable prognostic factor in APL patients.","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China.

Epub 2015 Jul 9.,"OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) plays multiple roles in cell growth and proliferation. Deletion/insertion mutations in exon 12 of NPM1 (NPM1-DIM), commonly found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), alter the C-terminal amino acids and disrupt the normal nucleocytoplasmic shuttling function of the protein, which in turn leads to disease pathogenesis. However, this altered function as a result of NPM1-DIM positivity is actually associated with a significantly better response to therapy and overall survival, and thus it is of clinical relevance to investigate the mutation status at diagnosis. Our objective was to design a reliable flow cytometry assay to detect mutated NPM1 in peripheral blood (PB) samples from AML patients, using a polyclonal mutation-specific antibody. METHODS: A commercially available NPM1 mutation-specific polyclonal antibody in combination with a secondary goat antirabbit antibody was used to detect the C-terminal-mutated NPM1 by flow cytometry. OCI/AML3 (+) cell line and clinical PB controls were used to optimize the assay and determine sensitivity, reliability, and reproducibility parameters. The assay was then tested on a small cohort of 12 AML patients at diagnosis and compared with NPM1-DIM testing on a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform. RESULTS: Flow cytometry using the polyclonal antibody was able to reliably detect mutated NPM1 populations of at least 10%. Using an objective analysis of the mean fluorescent intensity, clear positive and negative mutated cell populations could be distinguished using the clinical AML samples. From the analysis of 12 patients, 2 were found to be positive using this assay, which corresponded with conventional PCR methodology. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry may be used to detect NPM1 C-terminal mutations in AML patients using a polyclonal anti-NPM1 antibody, allowing rapid mutation status determination at diagnosis.","['Division of Haematology, Department of Clinical laboratory Sciences, University of Cape Town, South Africa; National Health Laboratory Services/Groote Schuur Hospital, Haematology, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Clinical laboratory Sciences, University of Cape Town, South Africa; National Health Laboratory Services/Groote Schuur Hospital, Haematology, Cape Town, South Africa.

Relative survival improved over time among AML (up to age 70 years) and APL patients. In the period 2007-2012, 5-year relative survival rates were 54%, 38%, 14% and 2% for AML patients and 84%, 75%, 54% and 37% for APL patients in the four age groups, respectively. As survival remained poor for older AML patients over the last two decades, clinical trials and active participation in those trials, are warranted that explore innovative treatment strategies for this elderly population.","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Clinical Trial Center-HOVON Data Center, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],,,,"['leu2015188 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.188 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.188 [doi],20150717,,,,,['Leukemia. 2016 Aug;30(8):1797-9.

We report a case of LBL arising from the pancreas that was diagnosed using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). The patient was a 57-year-old female who had suffered from abdominal pain for 2 weeks. A physical examination revealed an upper abdominal mass, but did not detect peripheral lymphadenopathy. Imaging studies including computed tomography (CT) and (18)F-fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography-CT revealed an enlarged pancreatic body, which was positive for FDG uptake. EUS-FNA detected medium-sized proliferating atypical lymphocytes, and immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that these cells were positive for CD20, CD10, PAX5, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. A bone marrow examination was negative for lymphoma infiltration, and a diagnosis of LBL arising from the pancreas was made. The patient was successfully treated with a combination of chemotherapy and pancreatic irradiation.","['Department of Gastroenterology, Kameda Medical Center, 929 Higashi-cho, Kamogawa, Chiba, Japan, nakajisou1978@yahoo.co.jp.']",,,,,['10.1007/s12328-014-0462-x [doi]'],10.1007/s12328-014-0462-x [doi],20140315,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we studied the clinical significance of early switching to nilotinib in CML-CP patients with BCR-ABL1 >10% at 3 months. METHODS: We investigated 495 first-line imatinib-treated patients with CML-CP and identified 117 (23.6%) patients with BCR-ABL1 >10% at 3 months, including 46 patients with warning response defined according to ELN-2013 recommendations. In 46 patients with warning response, 26 of them continued imatinib therapy and 20 patients early switched to nilotinib therapy. RESULTS: Compared to continued imatinib group, nilotinib group showed significantly higher percentage achieving BCR-ABL1 <1% at 6 months (85.0% vs. 19.2%, P = 0.0004), better cumulative rates of MR3.0 and MR4.0 of 4 years (82.1% vs. 41.2%, P = 0.0091; 61.5% vs. 18.6%, P = 0.035). CONCLUSION: In summary, early switching to nilotinib enabled more CML-CP patients with warning molecular response at 3 months to achieve early and deeper molecular response vs. remaining on imatinib.","['a Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'c Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology , Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'b Department of Pathology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health , The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.']","['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase', 'Imatinib', 'Nilotinib']",['10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000034 [doi]'],10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000034 [doi],20150717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 13.,"Beta-glucan (beta-glucan) including zymosan has been known as a super food because of its multifunctional activities, such as the enhancement of immune responses. To study the functional mechanism of beta-glucan in immune stimulation, the effect of zymosan on dendritic cell (DC) was investigated by monitoring the production of TNF-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. DC was differentiated from Mutz-3, a human acute myeloid leukemia cell line, by cytokine treatment and characterized. DC-specific cell surface markers were increased during the differentiation. Especially, Dectin-1, a beta-glucan receptor, was upregulated during DC differentiation, and mediated zymosan-induced TNF-alpha production, which was inhibited by silencing of dectin-1. Zymosan exhibited synergistic effect with other immune stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a well-known PKC activator. Simultaneous treatment of zymosan and PMA enhanced the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB subunits, p50 and p65, mediating the increase of TNF-alpha production. Bay 11-7082, an NF-kappaB inhibitor, blocked morphological changes and TNF-alpha production induced by zymosan and/or PMA treatment. Western blot analysis has showed zymosan-Dectin-1 pathway mediated destructive phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) kinase alpha subunit (IKKalpha) in IKK complexes, while PMA-PKC pathway regulated selective phosphorylation and degradation of IKKbeta. Simultaneous phosphorylation of separate IKK subunits by co-treatment of zymosan and PMA resulted in cooperative activation of NF-kappaB and TNF-alpha production.","['Biomedical Translational Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon 305-333, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Translational Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon 305-333, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Han Nam University, Daejeon 306-791, Republic of Korea.', 'Bioindustrial Process Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Jeongeup 580-185, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Translational Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon 305-333, Republic of Korea.

Epub 2015 Jun 19.,"Among the three classic Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms, primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is the most severe in terms of disease biology, survival and quality of life. Abnormalities in the process of differentiation of PMF megakaryocytes (MKs) are a hallmark of the disease. Nevertheless, the molecular events that lead to aberrant megakaryocytopoiesis have yet to be clarified. Protein kinase Cvarepsilon (PKCvarepsilon) is a novel serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, promoting aggressive phenotype, invasiveness and drug resistance. Our previous findings on the role of PKCvarepsilon in normal (erythroid and megakaryocytic commitment) and malignant (acute myeloid leukemia) hematopoiesis prompted us to investigate whether it could be involved in the pathogenesis of PMF MK-impaired differentiation. We demonstrate that PMF megakaryocytic cultures express higher levels of PKCvarepsilon than healthy donors, which correlate with higher disease burden but not with JAK2V617F mutation. Inhibition of PKCvarepsilon function (by a negative regulator of PKCvarepsilon translocation) or translation (by target small hairpin RNA) leads to reduction in PMF cell growth, restoration of PMF MK differentiation and inhibition of PKCvarepsilon-related anti-apoptotic signaling (Bcl-xL). Our data suggest that targeting PKCvarepsilon directly affects the PMF neoplastic clone and represent a proof-of-concept for PKCvarepsilon inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy in PMF.","['Hematology and BMT Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Unit of Human Anatomy and Histology, Department of Biomedical, Biotechnological and Translational Sciences (S.Bi.Bi.T.), University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Unit of Human Anatomy and Histology, Department of Biomedical, Biotechnological and Translational Sciences (S.Bi.Bi.T.), University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Unit of Human Anatomy and Histology, Department of Biomedical, Biotechnological and Translational Sciences (S.Bi.Bi.T.), University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Unit of Human Anatomy and Histology, Department of Biomedical, Biotechnological and Translational Sciences (S.Bi.Bi.T.), University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Unit of Human Anatomy and Histology, Department of Biomedical, Biotechnological and Translational Sciences (S.Bi.Bi.T.), University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Unit of Human Anatomy and Histology, Department of Biomedical, Biotechnological and Translational Sciences (S.Bi.Bi.T.), University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Hematology and BMT Unit, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Hematology and BMT Unit, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Unit of Human Anatomy and Histology, Department of Biomedical, Biotechnological and Translational Sciences (S.Bi.Bi.T.), University of Parma, Parma, Italy.']","['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-epsilon)']",,,,"['leu2015150 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.150 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.150 [doi],20150619,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jun 19.,"AC133 is a prominent surface marker of CD34+ and CD34- hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) subsets. AC133+ HSPCs contain high progenitor cell activity and are capable of hematopoietic reconstitution. Furthermore, AC133 is used for prospective isolation of tumor-initiating cells in several hematological malignancies. Nucleolin is a multifunctional factor of growing and cancer cells, which is aberrantly active in certain hematological neoplasms, and serves as a candidate molecular target for cancer therapy. Nucleolin is involved in gene transcription and RNA metabolism and is prevalently expressed in HSPCs, as opposed to differentiated hematopoietic tissue. The present study dissects nucleolin-mediated activation of surface AC133 and its cognate gene CD133, via specific interaction of nucleolin with the tissue-dependent CD133 promoter P1, as a mechanism that crucially contributes to AC133 expression in CD34+ HSPCs. In mobilized peripheral blood (MPB)-derived HSPCs, nucleolin elevates colony-forming unit (CFU) frequencies and enriches granulocyte-macrophage CFUs. Furthermore, nucleolin amplifies long-term culture-initiating cells and also promotes long-term, cytokine-dependent maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Active beta-catenin, active Akt and Bcl-2 levels in MPB-derived HSPCs are nucleolin-dependent, and effects of nucleolin on these cells partially rely on beta-catenin activity. The study provides new insights into molecular network relevant to stem/progenitor cells in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']","['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (nucleolin)']",,,,"['leu2015146 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.146 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.146 [doi],20150619,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5230-0628', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6121-4737']",,

METHODS: We established a leukemia therapy model with a non-irradiated T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia mouse model combined with cytarabine and cyclophosphamide. Dynamic kinetics and functional status of both primitive hematopoietic cells and leukemic cells in a leukemia host under the chemotherapy stress were comprehensively investigated. RESULTS: We successfully established the leukemia therapy model with T lymphoblastic phenotype. After treatment with cytarabine and cyclophosphamide, the frequency of L(-)K(+)S(+) hematopoietic cells tides with the therapy, and stabled when the disease remission, then reduced when relapsed, while leukemic cells showed a delayed but consistent regeneration. Combination of chemotherapy significantly promote an early and transient entrance of L(-)K(+)S(+) hematopoietic cells into active proliferation and induction of apoptosis on L(-)K(+)S(+) cells in vivo. Moreover, in the competitive bone marrow transplantation assays, hematopoietic cells showed gradually diminished regenerative capacity. Testing of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta gal) status showed higher levels in L(-)K(+)S(+) hematopoietic cells post therapy when compared with the control. Gene expression analysis of hematopoietic primitive cells revealed up-regulated p16, p21, and down-regulated egr1 and fos. CONCLUSION: We conclude that primitive hematopoietic cells in bone marrow enter proliferation earlier than leukemic cells after chemotherapy, and gradually lost their regenerative capacity partly by senescence due to accelerated cycling.","['Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, 168 Changhai Road, Shanghai, 200433, China. smmujch121611@163.com.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, 168 Changhai Road, Shanghai, 200433, China. hu-xiaoxia@126.com.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, 168 Changhai Road, Shanghai, 200433, China. doctorwanglibing@126.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China. chenghui19831103@163.com.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. chenghui19831103@163.com.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, 168 Changhai Road, Shanghai, 200433, China. thelma-linyan@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China. pangyakunb@163.com.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. pangyakunb@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China. weiping.yuan@gmail.com.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. weiping.yuan@gmail.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China. chengt@pumc.edu.cn.', 'Center for Stem Cell Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China. chengt@pumc.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, 168 Changhai Road, Shanghai, 200433, China. jmwang@medmail.com.cn.']",,PMC4504405,,,"['10.1186/s12967-015-0543-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-015-0543-8 [pii]']",10.1186/s12967-015-0543-8 [doi],20150717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 6.,"By controlling ion fluxes at multiple time scales, ion channels shape rapid cell signals, such as action potential and synaptic transmission, as well as much slower processes, such as mitosis and cell migration. As is currently increasingly recognized, a variety of channel types are involved in cancer hallmarks, and regulate specific stages of neoplastic progression. Long-term in vitro work has established that inhibition of these ion channels impairs the growth of cancer cells. Recently, these studies have been followed up in vivo, hence revealing that ion channels constitute promising pharmacological targets in oncology. The channel proteins can be often accessed from the extracellular milieu, which allows use of lower drug doses and decrease untoward toxicity. However, because of the central physiological roles exerted by ion channels in excitable cells, other types of side effects may arise, the gravest of which is cardiac arrhythmia. A paradigmatic case is offered by Kv11.1 (hERG1) channels. HERG1 blockers attenuate the progression of both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, but may also lead to the lengthening of the electrocardiographic QT interval, thus predisposing the patient to ventricular arrhythmias. These side effects can be avoided by specifically inhibiting the channel isoforms which are highly expressed in certain tumors, such as Kv11.1B and the neonatal forms of voltage-gated Na(+) channels. Preclinical studies are also being explored in breast and prostate cancer (targeting voltage-gated Na(+) channels), and gliomas (targeting CLC-3). Overall, the possible approaches to improve the efficacy and safety of ion channel targeting in oncology include: (1) the development of specific inhibitors for the channel subtypes expressed in specific tumors; (2) drug delivery into the tumor by using antibodies or nanotechnology-based approaches; (3) combination regimen therapy and (4) blocking specific conformational states of the ion channel. We believe that expanding this relatively neglected field of oncology research might lead to unforeseen therapeutic benefits for cancer patients.","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Viale Morgagni 50, Florence, 50134, Italy.

Preemptive bone marrow transplantation (PE-BMT) has been proposed to avoid the development of leukemia, but empirical study of PE-BMT is unlikely because of the rarity of these children and the unknown benefit of PE-BMT. We used survival analysis to estimate the risks of leukemia and the expected survival if leukemia could be eliminated by curative PE-BMT. We used the results in a decision analysis model to explore the plausibility of PE-BMT for children with variable ages at diagnosis and risks of transplantation-related mortality. For example, PE-BMT at 1 year of age with a 10% risk of transplantation-related mortality increased the mean survival by 1.7 years. The greatest benefit was for patients diagnosed between 1 and 3 years of age, after which the benefit of PE-BMT decreased with age at diagnosis, and the risk of death from solid tumors constituted a relatively greater burden of mortality. Our methods may be used to model survival for other hematologic disorders with limited empirical data and a pressing need for clinical guidance.","['Clinical Genetics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Biostatistics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Health Sciences Informatics, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Clinical Genetics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.

Epub 2015 Jul 14.,"Chimerism testing after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represents a promising tool for predicting disease relapse, although its precise role in this setting remains unclear. We investigated the predictive value of T lymphocyte chimerism analysis at 90 to 120 days after allo-HSCT in 378 patients with AML/MDS who underwent busulfan/fludarabine-based myeloablative preparative regimens. Of 265 (70%) patients with available T lymphocyte chimerism data, 43% of patients in first or second complete remission (CR1/CR2) at the time of transplantation had complete (100%) donor T lymphocytes at day +90 to +120 compared with 60% of patients in the non-CR1/CR2 cohort (P = .005). In CR1/CR2 patients, donor T lymphocyte chimerism </= 85% at day +90 to +120 was associated with a higher frequency of 3-year disease progression (29%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 18% to 46% versus 15%; 95% CI, 9% to 23%; hazard ratio [HR], 2.1; P = .04). However, in the more advanced, non-CR1/CR2 cohort, mixed T lymphocyte chimerism was not associated with relapse (37%; 95% CI, 20% to 66% versus 34%; 95% CI, 25% to 47%; HR, 1.3; P = .60). These findings demonstrate that early T lymphocyte chimerism testing at day +90 to +120 is a useful approach for predicting AML/MDS disease recurrence in patients in CR1/CR2 at the time of transplantation.","['Division of Cancer Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

Epub 2015 Jul 17.,"The ability to genetically modify T cells is a critical component to many immunotherapeutic strategies and research studies. However, the success of these approaches is often limited by transduction efficiency. As retroviral vectors require cell division for integration, transduction efficiency is dependent on the appropriate activation and culture conditions for T cells. Naive CD8(+) T cells, which are quiescent, must be first activated to induce cell division to allow genetic modification. To optimize this process, we activated mouse T cells with a panel of different cytokines, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12, IL-15 and IL-23, known to act on T cells. After activation, cytokines were removed, and activated T cells were retrovirally transduced. We found that IL-12 preconditioning of mouse T cells greatly enhanced transduction efficiency, while preserving function and expansion potential. We also observed a similar transduction-enhancing effect of IL-12 preconditioning on human T cells. These findings provide a simple method to improve the transduction efficiencies of CD8(+) T cells.","['Department of Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, USA.', 'Immunology and Biotechnology Division, Faculty of Science, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', '1] Department of Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA [2] Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', '1] Department of Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA [2] Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch , National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '1] Department of Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA [2] Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', '1] Department of Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA [2] Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.']","['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",PMC4807400,,,"['cgt201528 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2015.28 [doi]']",10.1038/cgt.2015.28 [doi],20150717,"['P01 CA154778/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA138313/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA138313/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA54778-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS693406'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted to determine, on, the basis of bone marrow (BM) trephine biopsy, the frequency of various underlying conditions causing a dry tap, among different age groups. METHODS: It was a descriptive study carried out at PAF hospital Mianwali, Pakistan from 1"" Jan 2009 to 31 Dec 2012. Record of all BM aspirations and trephine biopsies performed during 4 years was retrieved from hospital's laboratory. Total number of BM aspirations and trephines were counted and the subject's ages and genders recorded. Frequencies and percentages of patients with dry tap, in paediatric group (<15 years of age), young to middle-aged group (15-59 years) and the elderly (> or = 60 years) were calculated. Diagnoses of patients with dry tap made on BM biopsy were noted for each group and their frequencies calculated. RESULTS: Of 548 BM aspirations, dry tap was encountered in 52 (9.5%) cases. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was the commonest cause of dry tap in paediatric age, seen in 6 (60%) of 10 children. In young to middle-aged group, non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was the commonest cause, found in 6 (30%) of 20 cases. NHL and metastatic tumours, seen in 8 (36.4%) and 6 (27.3%) of 22 patients respectively, were the most frequent causes of dry tap in the elderly. CONCLUSION: Dry tap, in most of the cases, is like a diagnostic alert for the presence of an underlying BM pathology, nature of which depends upon age group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her disease was accompanied by the development of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in December 2003. Remission of her CML has been maintained up to the present with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Clinical and endoscopic remission of the patient's CD was maintained with salazosulfapyridine (3000 mg/day) and occasional prednisolone (</=20 mg/day) from 2001 to 2010. However, in December 2010 the patient complained of abdominal pain and diarrhea more than 10 times a day. Endoscopy showed serpiginous (snake-like) ulcers in the transverse colon and aphthous ulcers in the sigmoid colon. Intensive granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) (two sessions per week, total of ten sessions) was performed, and the CD activity index (CDAI) decreased from 259 to 175. Six adalimumab injections were administered to improve the remaining inflammatory mucosa. Two months after induction therapy with adalimumab, the CDAI decreased from 175 to 107 without side effects.

These mutations might be accompanied by other mutations that are less specific to myeloproliferative neoplasms but are prognostically relevant, such as additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1). Characteristic bone marrow morphology is required for World Health Organization-compliant diagnosis, especially in distinguishing ET from prefibrotic PMF and masked PV. Survival is the longest in ET, although still inferior to that of the age- and sex-matched control population; median survivals for patients younger than 60 years are approximately 33 years for ET, 24 for PV, and 15 for PMF. Major disease complications include thrombosis and leukemic or fibrotic transformation. In PV and ET, risk factors for survival include older age, leukocytosis, and thrombosis, whereas JAK2 mutation in ET is associated with increased risk of thrombosis. In PMF, type 1 or type 1-like CALR mutations are associated with superior and ASXL1 with inferior survival. Prevention of thrombosis in PV is secured by phlebotomy (hematocrit target &lt;45%) and in both PV and ET by low-dose aspirin therapy; high-risk patients derive additional antithrombotic benefit from cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea as first-line and interferon-alfa and busulfan as second-line drugs of choice. Although the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib was recently approved for use in hydroxyurea-resistant PV, its role in routine clinical practice remains debatable. In myelofibrosis, stem cell transplant is the current treatment of choice for genetically or clinically high-risk disease; for all other patients requiring treatment, participation in clinical trials may be preferred because currently available drugs, including JAK inhibitors, are palliative and not shown to be disease modifying.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,"['2194736 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.89 [doi]']",10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.89 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reasons for discontinuing therapy with this drug and outcomes following discontinuation have not been evaluated outside of clinical trials with relatively short follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To determine features associated with discontinuation of ibrutinib therapy and outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 308 patients participating in 4 sequential trials of ibrutinib at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center were included. These clinical trials accrued patients included in this analysis from May 2010 until April 2014, and data were locked in June 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients were evaluated for time to therapy discontinuation, reasons for discontinuation, and survival following discontinuation. For patients who discontinued therapy because of disease progression, targeted deep sequencing was performed in samples at baseline and time of relapse. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 20 months, 232 patients remained on therapy, 31 had discontinued because of disease progression, and 45 had discontinued for other reasons. Disease progression includes Richter's transformation (RT) or progressive CLL. Richter's transformation appeared to occur early and CLL progressions later (cumulative incidence at 12 months, 4.5% [95% CI, 2.0%-7.0%] and 0.3% [95% CI, 0%-1.0%], respectively). Median survival following RT was 3.5 months (95% CI, 0.3-6.0 months) and 17.6 months (95% CI, 4.7 months-""not reached"") following CLL progression. Sequencing on peripheral blood from 8 patients with RT revealed 2 with mutations in BTK, and a lymph node sample showed no mutations in BTK or PLCG2. Deep sequencing on 11 patients with CLL progression revealed BTK or PLCG2 mutations in all. These mutations were not identified before treatment in any patient. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This single-institution experience with ibrutinib confirms it to be an effective therapy and identifies, for the first time, baseline factors associated with ibrutinib therapy discontinuation. Outcomes data show poor prognosis after discontinuation, especially for those patients with RT. Finally, sequencing data confirm initial reports associating mutations in BTK and PLCG2 with progression and clearly show that CLL progressions are associated with these mutations, while RT is likely not.

Epub 2011 Dec 22.,"Spontaneous splenic rupture is a life-threatening disease and an important differential diagnosis of acute abdomen. Early clinical diagnosis and rapid intervention is required to ensure patient survival. Spontaneous splenic rupture may be induced by hematological, inflammatory or infiltrative diseases affecting the spleen. Splenomegaly may also significantly increase the risk of rupture. Other contributory factors include male, adulthood, rapid growth of the spleen and splenic abscess. Here, we present the case of a 69-year-old man who was undergoing chemotherapy for B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia. He was admitted to our hospital after he suddenly developed persistent upper abdominal pain. Computed tomography and ultrasonography revealed accumulation of free fluid in and around the spleen. He was diagnosed as having spontaneous splenic rupture and an emergency operation was performed. During the operation, we found a massively enlarged spleen with several capsular tears, and performed a splenectomy. The patient made a good recovery.

These studies were mainly carried out in Western populations and little was known about associations in East Asians. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between PD and risk of cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, the data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, which contained information on approximately 24.7 million insured individuals. The cohort included individuals with newly diagnosed as having PD between 2004 and 2010. An age- and sex-matched systematic random-sampling method was used for subject selection in the reference non-PD cohort. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to determine the effects of PD on the risks of cancer, as shown by hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The Taiwan Population Census and National Cancer Registry Databases were used to identify patients with cancer. The last follow-up date was December 31, 2012. RESULTS: In 62023 patients with PD, the HR for all subsequent cancers combined was 1.58 (95% CI, 1.50-1.65). Of the 19 types of cancer, Parkinson disease was not associated with breast, ovarian, or thyroid cancers. Increased HRs were found in the remaining 16 cancers, including malignant brain tumors (HR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.84-6.38), gastrointestinal tract cancers (esophageal [HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.28-2.57], stomach [HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.30-1.94], colorectal [HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.31-1.65], liver [HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.67-2.14]; gallbladder [HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.16-2.57], and pancreas [HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.09-2.02]) (P < .05 for all comparisons), lung cancers (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.38-1.76), some hormone-related cancers (uterine [HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.12-3.01], cervical [HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05-1.76], and prostate [HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.52-2.13; P < .05 for all comparisons), urinary tract cancers (kidney and bladder cancers; HRs, 1.59 and 1.99, respectively; P < .001 for both comparisons), lymphoma and/or leukemia (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.31-2.01), melanoma (HR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.35-5.59), and other skin cancers (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.46-2.23). For hepatocellular carcinoma, the highest HR resided in the 50- to 59-year-old group (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.7-3.89). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our study concludes that PD is is associated with most cancers in Taiwan. Further studies are needed to clarify whether our findings can be applied to other East Asian populations. The differences between our study and most previous cohorts suggest the importance of ethnicity and environmental exposures in disease pathogenesis.","['Taiwan International Graduate Program in Molecular Medicine, Academia Sinica and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan2Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan3Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National Yang.', 'Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan6PhD Program for Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan4Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan4Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,,,,"['2330619 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.1752 [doi]']",10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.1752 [doi],,,,,,"['JAMA Oncol. 2015 Aug;1(5):641-2.

Understanding the significance of these prognostic indicators and recognizing their potential impact on treatment selection and patients' outcomes is critical for clinicians and investigators. OBJECTIVE: To review novel prognostic factors at CLL diagnosis that have shown an impact on the prognosis and outcomes of this disease. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Literature from January 2004 through December 2014 was searched in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus to identify English-language, peer-reviewed articles on clinical and prognostic factors for CLL (TP53, ATM, NOTCH1, SF3B1, BIRC3, and MYD88). Reference lists were subsequently reviewed for additional articles. A total of 450 articles was identified, and 48 articles meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed. FINDINGS: Among prognostic markers reviewed, chromosomal aberrations have been validated and are currently used clinically to predict prognosis. Patients with 17p13.1 deletion have poor response to chemoimmunotherapy and are treated differently, with some undergoing allogeneic transplantation in first remission. CD38 and ZAP-70 status of malignant cells and unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy chain gene have similarly been validated to predict adverse prognosis, but their implications on treatment selection have not been proven. The presence of TP53 and ATM mutations predicts worse prognosis, which has been corroborated in various studies. Patients with TP53 mutations have lower responses to chemoimmunotherapy. Furthermore, patients with TP53 and ATM mutations have inferior progression-free survival and overall survival, independent of other factors. Patients carrying the NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations have worse prognosis; patients with the NOTCH1 mutation have lower response rates to standard chemoimmunotherapy. The impact of BIRC3 on prognosis and survival requires further confirmation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The heterogeneous clinical course of CLL is likely explained by underlying molecular prognostic factors. Moving forward, analyzing these factors at diagnosis is recommended for better prognostication.","['Section of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois2Section of Hematology/Oncology, Cancer Cytogenetics Laboratory, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,"['2288667 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.0779 [doi]']",10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.0779 [doi],,,,,,"['JAMA Oncol. 2015 Oct;1(7):988.

Recently, we demonstrated that p53 directly regulates Sall2 expression under genotoxic stress. Here, we investigated the role of Sall2 in the context of cellular response to genotoxic stress. In addition, we further examined the Sall2-p53 relationship during genotoxic stress in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), which are derived from Sall2 knockout mice separately, or in combination with the p53ERTAM knock-in mice. We found that the levels of Sall2 mRNA and protein are dynamically modulated in response to doxorubicin. At early times of stress, Sall2 is downregulated, but increases under extension of the stress in a p53-independent manner. Based on caspase-3/7 activities, expression of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, expression of cleaved caspase-3 and induction of proapoptotic proteins, Sall2 expression was correlated with cellular apoptosis. Consequently, Sall2-/- MEFs have decreased apoptosis, which relates with increased cell viability in response to doxorubicin. Importantly, Sall2 was required for apoptosis even in the presence of fully activated p53. Searching for putative Sall2 targets that could mediate its role in apoptosis, we identified proapoptotic NOXA/PMAIP1 (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1). We demonstrated that Sall2 positively regulates Noxa promoter activity. Conserved putative Sall2-binding sites at the NOXA promoter were validated in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and in vivo by ChIP experiments, identifying NOXA as a novel Sall2 target. In agreement, induction of Noxa protein and mRNA in response to doxorubicin was significantly decreased in Sall2-/- MEFs. In addition, studies in leukemia Jurkat T cells support the existence of the Sall2/Noxa axis, and the significance of this axis on the apoptotic response to doxorubicin in cancer cells. Our study highlights the relevance of Sall2 in the apoptotic response to extended genotoxic stress, which is important for understanding its role in normal physiology and disease.","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94115, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Department of Kidney Development, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sall2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",PMC4650718,,,"['cddis2015165 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2015.165 [doi]']",10.1038/cddis.2015.165 [doi],20150716,['12077/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect on relapse risk of this variability is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of high intra-individual variability of 6MP systemic exposure on relapse risk in children with ALL. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used a prospective longitudinal design (Children's Oncology Group study [COG-AALL03N1]) to monitor 6MP and disease relapse in 742 children with ALL in ambulatory care settings of 94 participating institutions from May 30, 2005, to September 9, 2011. All participants met the following eligibility criteria: (1) diagnosis of ALL at 21 years or younger; (2) first continuous remission in progress at the time of study entry; (3) receiving self-, parent-, or caregiver-administered oral 6MP during maintenance therapy; and (4) completion of at least 6 months of maintenance therapy at the time of study enrollment. The median patient age at diagnosis was 5 years; 68% were boys; and 43% had National Cancer Institute-based high-risk disease. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Daily 6MP regimen adherence was measured over 68716 person-days using an electronic system that recorded the date and time of each 6MP bottle opening; adherence rate was defined as the ratio of days that a 6MP bottle was opened to days thata 6MP bottle was prescribed. Average monthly 6MP dose intensity was measured over 120439 person-days by dividing the number of 6MP doses actually prescribed by the number of planned protocol doses (75 mg/m2/d). Monthly erythrocyte TGN levels (pmol/8 x 108 erythrocytes) were measured over 6 consecutive months per patient (n = 3944 measurements). Using intra-individual coefficients of variation (CV%), patients were classified as having stable (CV% <85th percentile) vs varying (CV% >/=85th percentile) indices. Median follow-up time was 6.7 years from the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: Adjusting for clinical prognosticators, we found that patients with 6MP nonadherence (mean adherence rate <95%) were at a 2.7-fold increased risk of relapse (95% CI, 1.3-5.6; P = .01) compared with patients with a mean adherence rate of 95% or greater. Among adherers, high intra-individual variability in TGN levels contributed to increased relapse risk (hazard ratio, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.2-15.7; P = .02). Furthermore, adherers with varying TGN levels had varying 6MP dose intensity (odds ratio [OR], 4.5; 95% CI, 1.5-13.4; P = .01) and 6MP drug interruptions (OR, 10.2; 95% CI, 2.2-48.3; P = .003). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings emphasize the need to maximize 6MP regimen adherence and maintain steady thiopurine exposure to minimize relapse in children with ALL.","['City of Hope, Duarte, California2University of Alabama, Birmingham.', 'City of Hope, Duarte, California2University of Alabama, Birmingham.', 'City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'City of Hope, Duarte, California.', ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Children's National Medical Center, The George Washington School of Medicine, Washington, DC."", ""Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis."", 'David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.', ""Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora.', ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California,Los Angeles."", ""Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."", 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California,Los Angeles.', 'New York University Cancer Institute, New York, New York.', 'City of Hope, Duarte, California.', ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",PMC4561178,,,"['2203830 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.0245 [doi]']",10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.0245 [doi],,"['GM92666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA156449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA095861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC4 CA156449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR000043/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01-RR00043/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM092666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS719527'],,,['JAMA Oncol. 2015 Jun;1(3):281-2.

Newer therapies are being developed to address the pathophysiology within these individual AML subsets.

This species has already been evaluated for the antifungal activities. However, based on its potential antitumor activity, the present study further aimed to examine the antitumor, as well as chelation, activity of X. sagittifolium leaf extract. Results showed that hydroethanolic extract of X. sagittifolium leaves (HEXs-L) exhibits cytotoxic effects against the immortalized line of human T-lymphocytic (Jurkat) and myelogenous (K562) leukemia cells, but not nontumor RAW 264.7 macrophages or NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. HEXs-L inhibited 50.3% of Jurkat cell proliferation, reducing by 20% cells in G2/M phase, but increasing cells in sub-G1 phase, thereby inducing apoptosis by 54%. In addition, HEXs-L inhibited NO production by 59%, as determined by Griess reaction, and chelated 93.8% of free Fe(II), as demonstrated by ferrozine assay. Phytochemical studies were carried out by ESI-MS, identifying apigenin di-C-glycosides as major compounds. Overall, this work revealed that leaf extract of Xanthosoma sagittifolium presented chelating activity and in vitro antitumor activity, arresting cell cycle and inducing apoptosis of leukemia cells, thus providing evidence that taioba leaves may have practical application in cancer therapy.","['Departamento de Bioquimica, IBRAG, Centro Biomedico, Instituto de Biologia Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Avenida Professor Manoel de Abreu 44, PAPC, 4 degrees Andar, 20550-170 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil ; Nucleo de Pesquisas de Produtos Naturais, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, IBRAG, Centro Biomedico, Instituto de Biologia Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Avenida Professor Manoel de Abreu 44, PAPC, 4 degrees Andar, 20550-170 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Nucleo de Pesquisas de Produtos Naturais, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, IBRAG, Centro Biomedico, Instituto de Biologia Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Avenida Professor Manoel de Abreu 44, PAPC, 4 degrees Andar, 20550-170 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, IBRAG, Centro Biomedico, Instituto de Biologia Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Avenida Professor Manoel de Abreu 44, PAPC, 4 degrees Andar, 20550-170 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Nucleo de Pesquisas de Produtos Naturais, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, IBRAG, Centro Biomedico, Instituto de Biologia Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Avenida Professor Manoel de Abreu 44, PAPC, 4 degrees Andar, 20550-170 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",,PMC4477105,,,['10.1155/2015/384267 [doi]'],10.1155/2015/384267 [doi],20150609,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Islet-enriched transcription factors regulate beta-cell formation and function, yet little is known about the molecules recruited to mediate control. An unbiased in-cell biochemical and mass spectrometry strategy was used to isolate MafA transcription factor-binding proteins. Among the many coregulators identified were all of the subunits of the mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (Mll3) and 4 (Mll4) complexes, with histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferases strongly associated with gene activation. MafA was bound to the approximately 1.5 MDa Mll3 and Mll4 complexes in size-fractionated beta-cell extracts. Likewise, closely related human MAFB, which is important to beta-cell formation and coproduced with MAFA in adult human islet beta-cells, bound MLL3 and MLL4 complexes. Knockdown of NCOA6, a core subunit of these methyltransferases, reduced expression of a subset of MAFA and MAFB target genes in mouse and human beta-cell lines. In contrast, a broader effect on MafA/MafB gene activation was observed in mice lacking NCoA6 in islet beta-cells. We propose that MLL3 and MLL4 are broadly required for controlling MAFA and MAFB transactivation during development and postnatally.","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN roland.stein@vanderbilt.edu.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2C protein, human)', '0 (MAFA protein, human)', '0 (Maf Transcription Factors, Large)', '0 (MafB Transcription Factor)', '0 (NCOA6 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivators)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL4 protein, human)']",PMC4613979,,,"['db15-0281 [pii]', '10.2337/db15-0281 [doi]']",10.2337/db15-0281 [doi],20150715,"['CA-68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-58404/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-058242/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007061/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA193455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK090570/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-090570/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P60 DK020593/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK058404/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-20593/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 HD015052/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK059820/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-15052/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'F32-DK-102283-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-112403/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 DK102283/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY008126/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK020593/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA112403/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-59637/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK058242/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'EY-08126/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-DK-007061/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 DK059637/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,"['(c) 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

Histone arginine methylation is important for regulating gene activation and silencing in cells. Although the process commonly exists in mammalian cells, its roles in B cells are unknown. To explore the effects of aberrant histone arginine methylation on B cells, we generated mice with a B cell-specific knockout of PRMT7, a member of the methyltransferases that mediate arginine methylation of histones. In this article, we showed that the loss of PRMT7 led to decreased mature marginal zone B cells and increased follicular B cells and promoted germinal center formation after immunization. Furthermore, mice lacking PRMT7 expression in B cells secreted low levels of IgG1 and IgA. Abnormal expression of germinal center genes (i.e., Bcl6, Prdm1, and Irf4) was detected in conditional knockout mice. By overexpressing PRMT7 in the Raji and A20 cell lines derived from B cell lymphomas, we validated the fact that PRMT7 negatively regulated Bcl6 expression. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR, we found that PRMT7 could recruit H4R3me1 and symmetric H4R3me2 to the Bcl6 promoter. These results provide evidence for the important roles played by PRMT7 in germinal center formation.","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100039, China; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China;', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100039, China; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100039, China; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100039, China; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; slbao@genetics.ac.cn.']","['0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT7 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",,,,"['jimmunol.1500224 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1500224 [doi]']",10.4049/jimmunol.1500224 [doi],20150715,,,"['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,,,,,,['SRA/UNKNOWN'],,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 15.,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the major complication after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Valproic acid (VPA) was described as a histone deacetylase inhibitor that had anti-inflammatory effects and reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines in experimental autoimmune disease models. Using well-characterized mouse models of MHC-mismatched transplantation, we studied the effects of VPA on GVHD severity and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. Administration of VPA significantly attenuated the clinical severity of GVHD, the histopathology of GVHD-involved organs, and the overall mortality from GVHD. VPA downregulated Th1 and Th17 cell responses and cytokine production in vitro and in vivo, whereas its effect on GVHD was regulatory T cell independent. The effect of VPA was related to its ability to directly reduce the activity of Akt, an important regulator of T cell immune responses. Importantly, when mice received lethal doses of host-type acute leukemia cells, administration of VPA did not impair GVL activity and resulted in significantly improved leukemia-free survival. These findings reveal a unique role for VPA as a histone deacetylase inhibitor in reducing the donor CD4(+) T cells that contribute to GVHD, which may provide a strategy to reduce GVHD while preserving the GVL effect.","['State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China;

This multicenter, two-stage, single-arm, phase II study assessed the efficacy and safety of bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory ATL who received at least one regimen of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the best overall response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints included safety, the best response by lesions, and progression-free survival (PFS). Fifteen patients were enrolled in the first stage of this study. One partial remission (PR) and five stable disease (SD) were observed as the best overall responses, and ORR was 6.7% (95% confidence interval (C.I.) 0.17-31.95%). Responses according to disease sites were one complete remission (CR) in peripheral blood, two PR in measurable targeted lesions, and two PR in skin lesions. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 38 (95% CI; 18-106) days. All patients developed >/=1 adverse events (AEs), and 80% of patients had >/=1 grade 3/4 AEs; however, no new safety findings were obtained.

While previous reviews focused mainly on solid cancer cells, in this review, we summarize the recent findings focusing on acute leukemias. We take into account the impact of the underlying genetic alterations of acute leukemia cells, the leukemia stem cell pool, and provide an outline on the current genetic, clinical, and therapeutic findings. Furthermore, we shed light on the important oncogene-specific regulation of individual UPR signaling branches and the therapeutic relevance of this information to answer the question if the UPR could be an attractive novel target in acute leukemias.","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany. bkharabi@ukaachen.de.', 'Universite Rennes 1 - ER_440 ""Oncogenesis, Stress & Signaling"", Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer Eugene Marquis, Rennes, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre (ARC), National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.', 'Department of Medicine, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre (ARC), National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.']",,PMC4504168,,,"['10.1186/s13045-015-0184-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-015-0184-7 [pii]']",10.1186/s13045-015-0184-7 [doi],20150716,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism controlling this tumour metabolic shift remains not fully understood. Here we show that 14-3-3sigma regulates cancer metabolic reprogramming and protects cells from tumorigenic transformation. 14-3-3sigma opposes tumour-promoting metabolic programmes by enhancing c-Myc poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. 14-3-3sigma demonstrates the suppressive impact on cancer glycolysis, glutaminolysis, mitochondrial biogenesis and other major metabolic processes of tumours. Importantly, 14-3-3sigma expression levels predict overall and recurrence-free survival rates, tumour glucose uptake and metabolic gene expression in breast cancer patients. Thus, these results highlight that 14-3-3sigma is an important regulator of tumour metabolism, and loss of 14-3-3sigma expression is critical for cancer metabolic reprogramming. We anticipate that pharmacologically elevating the function of 14-3-3sigma in tumours could be a promising direction for targeted anticancer metabolism therapy development in future.","['1] Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

Both the presence and the levels of BCR/ABL1 expression seem to be critical for CML progression from chronic phase (CP) to blast crisis (BC). After the oncogenic translocation, the BCR/ABL1 gene is under the transcriptional control of BCR promoter but the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of oncogene expression are mostly unknown. METHODS: A region of 1443bp of the functional BCR promoter was studied for transcription factor binding sites through in-silico analysis and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation experiments. BCR and BCR/ABL1 expression levels were analysed in CML cell lines after over-expression or silencing of MYC transcription factor. A luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm its activity on BCR promoter. RESULTS: In the present study we demonstrate that MYC and its partner MAX bind to the BCR promoter, leading to up-regulation of BCR and BCR/ABL1 at both transcriptional and protein levels. Accordingly, silencing of MYC expression in various BCR/ABL1 positive cell lines causes significant downregulation of BCR and BCR/ABL1, which consequently leads to decreased proliferation and induction of cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Here we describe a regulatory pathway modulating BCR and BCR/ABL1 expression, showing that the BCR promoter is under the transcriptional control of the MYC/MAX heterodimer. Since MYC is frequently over-expressed in BC, this phenomenon could play a critical role in BCR/ABL1 up-regulation and blast aggressiveness acquired during CML evolution.","['Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy. niteshsharma700@gmail.com.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy. vera.magistroni@unimib.it.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy. rocco.piazza@unimib.it.', 'Division of Haematology, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. rocco.piazza@unimib.it.', 'Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, University of Milano Bicocca, Milano, Italy. stefania.citterio@unimib.it.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy. kata08@live.it.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy. praveenkhandelwal49@gmail.com.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy. alessandra.pirola@unimib.it.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy. carlo.gambacorti@unimib.it.', 'Division of Haematology, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. carlo.gambacorti@unimib.it.']","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (MNT protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",PMC4504180,,,"['10.1186/s12943-015-0407-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12943-015-0407-0 [pii]']",10.1186/s12943-015-0407-0 [doi],20150716,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the immune system, zbtb16 expression is only found in innate cells. Conventional T cells that ectopically express PLZF spontaneously acquire an activated, effector phenotype. Activation induced expression of lineage defining transcription factors such as T-bet, FoxP3, RORgammat, GATA3 and others is essential for naive T cell differentiation into effector T cells. In this study, we used sensitive genetic-based approaches to assess the induction of PLZF expression in non-innate T cells by T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation. Surprisingly, we found that PLZF was stably repressed in non-innate T cells and that TCR-mediated signaling was not sufficient to induce PLZF in conventional T cells. The inactivated state of PLZF was stably maintained in mature T cells, even under inflammatory conditions imposed by bacterial infection. Collectively, our data show that, in contrast to multiple recent reports, PLZF expression is highly specific to innate T cells and cannot be induced in conventional T cells via TCR-mediated activation or inflammatory challenge.","['1] Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA [2] Child Health Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA.', '1] Department of Surgery, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA [2] Child Health Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA.', '1] Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA [2] Department of Pediatrics, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA [3] Child Health Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA.', '1] Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA [2] Department of Pediatrics, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA [3] Child Health Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA.']","['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",PMC4503983,,,"['srep12113 [pii]', '10.1038/srep12113 [doi]']",10.1038/srep12113 [doi],20150716,"['P30 CA072720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI059739/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI083988/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI059739/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 15.,"For several cancer cell types, the lack of an adequate supply of the amino acidl-glutamine (Gln) triggers apoptosis, a phenomenon termed Gln addiction. In this report, we examined the role of the anti-apoptotic proteins of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein family in the survival of Sp2/0-Ag14 (Sp2/0) mouse hybridoma cells, a cell line that undergoes apoptosis within minutes of Gln deprivation. Western blot analysis revealed that myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (MCL-1) was expressed at much higher levels than BCL-2, B-cell lymphoma extra-large and BCL-2-like protein 2 making it the prominent pro-survival BCL-2 family member in this hybridoma. Gln deprivation triggered a progressive decrease in MCL-1 protein levels, which coincided with the decrease in Sp2/0 cell survival. Moreover, Sp2/0 cells were much more sensitive to the broad Bcl-2 homology domain-3 (BH3) mimetic obatoclax (which targets MCL-1) than to the more selective drug ABT-737 (which does not target MCL-1). Finally, we show that obatoclax sensitizes Sp2/0 cells to apoptosis following Gln starvation. All together, the data presented here reveal that modulation of the pro-survival protein MCL-1 is an important step in the sequence of events leading to the initiation of apoptosis in Gln-starved Sp2/0 cells. Cancer cells require an adequate supply ofl-glutamine for their survival. Using a mouse hybridoma cell line that is exquisitely sensitive to glutamine starvation, we show that the levels of the pro-survival BCL-2 family protein MCL-1 decrease upon glutamine starvation in a manner that correlates with the loss of cell viability. Moreover, inhibiting MCL-1 with the drug obatoclax sensitizes hybridoma cells to glutamine starvation. Thus, in some cancer cells, glutamine starvation triggers the inactivation of pro-survival proteins. Our data suggest that the combined inhibition of glutamine biosynthesis pathways and BCL-2 proteins may prove effective against some cancers.","['Biomolecular Sciences Ph.D. program, Laurentian University, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Ph.D. program, Laurentian University, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Laurentian University, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Ph.D. program, Laurentian University, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Laurentian University, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.', 'Biology Department, Laurentian University, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.']","['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (BCL2L15 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['MCL-1', 'apoptosis', 'glutamine', 'glutamine addiction', 'hybridoma', 'nutrient starvation', 'obatoclax']",['10.1002/cbf.3121 [doi]'],10.1002/cbf.3121 [doi],20150715,,,"['Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 15.,"The present treatment of childhood T-cell leukemias involves the systemic administration of prokaryotic L-asparaginase (ASNase), which depletes plasma Asparagine (Asn) and inhibits protein synthesis. The mechanism of therapeutic action of ASNase is poorly understood, as are the etiologies of the side-effects incurred by treatment. Protein expression from genes bearing Asn homopolymeric coding regions (N-hCR) may be particularly susceptible to Asn level fluctuation. In mammals, N-hCR are rare, short and conserved. In humans, misfunctions of genes encoding N-hCR are associated with a cluster of disorders that mimic ASNase therapy side-effects which include impaired glycemic control, dislipidemia, pancreatitis, compromised vascular integrity, and neurological dysfunction. This paper proposes that dysregulation of Asn homeostasis, potentially even by ASNase produced by the microbiome, may contribute to several clinically important syndromes by altering expression of N-hCR bearing genes. By altering amino acid abundance and modulating ribosome translocation rates at codon repeats, the microbiomic environment may contribute to genome decoding and to shaping the proteome. We suggest that impaired translation at poly Asn codons elevates diabetes risk and severity.","['Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, MGH, Simches Research Center, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Peptides)', '26894-34-8 (polyasparagine)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",PMC4533780,,,['10.3892/ijmm.2015.2285 [doi]'],10.3892/ijmm.2015.2285 [doi],20150715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Sep 19.,"AIM: Inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A, such as ritonavir and efavirenz, may be used as part of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to treat HIV patients. HIV patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumour may need imatinib, a CYP3A4 substrate with known exposure response-relationships. Administration of imatinib to patients on ritonavir or efavirenz may result in altered imatinib exposure leading to increased toxicity or failure of therapy, respectively. We used primary human hepatocyte cultures to evaluate the magnitude of interaction between imatinib and ritonavir/efavirenz. METHODS: Hepatocytes were pre-treated with vehicle, ritonavir, ketoconazole, efavirenz or rifampicin, and the metabolism of imatinib was characterized over time. Concentrations of imatinib and metabolite were quantitated in combined lysate and medium, using LC-MS. RESULTS: The predicted changes in imatinib CLoral (95% CI) with ketoconazole, ritonavir, rifampicin and efavirenz were 4.0-fold (0, 9.2) lower, 2.8-fold (0.04, 5.5) lower, 2.9-fold (2.2, 3.5) higher and 2.0-fold (0.42, 3.5) higher, respectively. These predictions were in good agreement with clinical single dose drug-drug interaction studies, but not with reports of imatinib interactions at steady-state. Alterations in metabolism were similar after acute or chronic imatinib exposure. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro human hepatocytes predicted increased clearance of imatinib with inducers and decreased clearance with inhibitors of CYP enzymes. The impact of HAART on imatinib may depend on whether it is being initiated or has already been dosed chronically in patients.

Digital-PCR (dPCR), able to detect 1 BCR-ABL1 positive cell out of 10(7) , has been recently developed. The ISAV study is a multicentre trial aimed at validating dPCR to predict relapses after imatinib discontinuation in CML patients with undetectable Q-RT-PCR. CML patients under imatinib therapy since more than 2 years and with undetectable PCR for at least 18 months were eligible. Patients were monitored by standard Q-RT-PCR for 36 months. Patients losing molecular remission (two consecutive positive Q-RT-PCR with at least 1 BCR-ABL1/ABL1 value above 0.1%) resumed imatinib. The study enrolled 112 patients, with a median follow-up of 21.6 months. Fifty-two of the 108 evaluable patients (48.1%), relapsed; 73.1% relapsed in the first 9 months but 14 late relapses were observed between 10 and 22 months. Among the 56 not-relapsed patients, 40 (37.0% of total) regained Q-RT-PCR positivity but never lost MMR. dPCR results showed a significant negative predictive value ratio of 1.115 [95% CI: 1.013-1.227]. An inverse relationship between patients age and risk of relapse was evident: 95% of patients <45 years relapsed versus 42% in the class >/=45 to <65 years and 33% of patients >/=65 years [P(chi(2) ) < 0.0001]. Relapse rates ranged between 100% (<45 years, dPCR+) and 36% (>45 years, dPCR-). Imatinib can be safely discontinued in the setting of continued PCR negativity; age and dPCR results can predict relapse.","['Department of Health Sciences, University Of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University Of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Haematology And Oncology, Charite - Humboldt-Universitat, Campus Virchow, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, S.

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed among 70 patients with PV from May 2005 to May 2014, 43 males and 27 females, aged (56.6+/-13.1) to collect the data about characteristics, laboratory data, myelogram chromosome, karyotypes, BCR/ABL and JAK2 V617F genes, as well as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and so on. RESULTS: At diagnosis, there were 42 cases (60.00%) had symptoms, 25 cases (35.71%) had thrombosis and embolism. Hemorrhage occurred in 3 cases (4.29%), splenomegaly in 48 cases (68.57%), hepatomegaly in 7 cases (10.00%). The average hemoglobin at diagnosis was 195.17 g/L, the white blood cells count was 10.12x10(9)/L, the platelet count was 295x10(9)//L. The chromosome karyotypes were all normal. The positive percentage of JAK2 V617F mutation was 87.69% (57/65). The disease outcomes were myelofibrosis for 3 paitents, death from ineffective treatment after transforming to myelofibrosis and then biphenotype acute leukemia for 1 patient, and death from cardiorespiratory failure for 2 patients. The level of erythropoietin in JAK2 V617F mutated group were significantly lower than those in wild-type JAK2 V617F group (P<0.05). The level of hemoglobin and platelet counts in JAK2 V617F mutated group were significantly higher than those in wild-type JAK2 V617F group (both P<0.05). CONCLUSION: PV is one of meyloproliferation neoplasm, characterized by abnormally increasing blood cells, thrombosis and transforming to other myeloproliferative neoplasms.","['Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Hematology, General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300052, China; Email: shaozonghong@sina.com.']","['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 816 patients with a definite diagnosis of PV were enrolled from August 1983 to June 2013 into this study. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated by comparing the cumulative survival of 816 PV patients with age- and sex- and calendar year-matched healthy Chinese population from the national bureau of statistics of the People's Republic of China. The clinical features of diagnosis and prognosis of PV patients were analyzed by Cox regression to identify risk factors for the poor prognosis of PV and to develop a dynamic prognostic model in Chinese patients. The effects of different treatments on the development of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and post-PV myelofibrosis (post-PV MF) were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. JAK2 V617F allele burden (V617F%) was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in 104 patients. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 6 (1-42) years. The 10-, 15- and 20-year overall survival (OS) was 89.50%, 76.70% and 64.70%, respectively. The SMR was 17.40 (95% CI: 13.71-21.78). Cox regression analysis revealed that white blood cell (WBC) count>10x10(9)/L (HR=3.10, 95% CI: 1.47-6.53, P=0.003), age>60 years (HR=2.89, 95% CI: 1.84-4.53, P<0.001) and prior thrombosis (HR=2.66, 95% CI: 1.65-4.29, P<0.001) were significant predictors for the poor prognosis of PV. Based on the hazard radio, 816 patents were allocated into 4 categories with significantly different survival: low (sum of points=0; median survival no reached), intermediate 1 (sum of points=1; median survival 33.10 (28.20-38.00) years), intermediate 2 (sum of points=2; median survival 23.00 (16.08-29.92) years), high (sum of points=3; median survival 13.00 (10.58-15.42) years). The mortality of high risk group was 5.37 fold higher than low risk patients. The 10- and 20-year survival of no post-PV MF were 89.50% and 79.60%, respectively, for interferon alpha (IFN-alpha); 73.80% and 43.50%, respectively, for hydroxyurea treatment; 82.20% and 71.40%, respectively, for alkylating agent treatment; and 80.00% and 38.20%, respectively, for no cytoreductive treatment. The treatment of exposure to IFN-alpha associated with a higher rate of no-post-PV MF survival (Log-rank=9.79, P=0.020). There were more post-PV MF patients with V617F%>/=50% compared with those V617F%<50% (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of PV patients is significantly higher than that of healthy Chinese population. The WBC count>10x10(9)/L, age>60 years, and prior thrombosis are identified as significant predictors for the prognosis of PV. The risk of post-PV MF transformation may be ameliorated by IFN-alpha via decreasing the burden of JAK2 V617F mutation.","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Email: xys670817@sina.com.']",['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Aug 31.,"Autophagy is required for hematopoietic stem cell multilineage differentiation, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Using a conditional mouse model and human leukemia cells, we uncovered a mechanistic link between autophagy and hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. Loss of autophagy in mouse hematopoietic stem cells diminished the bone marrow generation of functional blood cells, in particular lymphocytes, and resulted in a leukemic phenotype and elevated Notch signaling. Physiological autophagy activity in mice was inversely correlated with Notch signaling during adult hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, while pathologically low autophagy was associated with upregulated Notch signaling in dysfunctional hematopoietic stem cells of acute leukemia patients. Furthermore, we show that autophagy directly degraded intracellular Notch, the active form of Notch receptor cleaved from the full-length Notch molecule by gamma-secretase. Finally, we show that hematopoietic multilineage differentiation potential was restored in autophagy defective hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells when their Notch signaling was abrogated either pharmacologically with gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT or genetically with RNA interference of Notch effector RBPJ. Hence, we propose that autophagy sustains hematopoiesis by direct targeting Notch.","[""Hematology Center of Cyrus Tang Medical Institute, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for

Most are diagnosed before birth. Postnatal diagnoses are easily recognisable when characteristic features are present, namely hepatosplenomegaly, leukaemia cutis or infiltrative disease of the extramedullar and central nervous system. However, some children present with vague and non-specific symptoms masquerading as other diseases. We report an unusual presentation of infantile ALL in a 19-day-old infant, who struggled with feeding after a diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease since birth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest case report of neonatal ALL, presenting with vomiting, lethargy and dehydration.

Epub 2015 Jul 16.,"PURPOSE: Two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several new acute leukemia susceptibility loci in populations of European descent. However, the roles of these loci in the development of acute leukemia in other populations are largely unknown. METHODS: We genotyped 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms selected from published GWASs in an independent case-control study with a total of 545 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases and 1034 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the associations between these variants and AML risk. RESULTS: We found that with the similar effect to GWASs, risk alleles of rs2191566, rs9290663, rs11155133, rs2239633, rs10821936, and rs2242041 significantly increased the risk of AML in at least one genetic model [odds ratios (ORs) range from 1.26 to 4.34, P values range from <0.001 to 0.043]. However, the variant T allele of rs10873876 decreased the AML risk, which was in the opposite effect direction (OR 0.62, P < 0.001 in additive model). Besides, we found significant multiplicative interaction between rs9290663 and age (</=45 years old and >45 years old; P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that genetic variants associated with acute leukemia risk in European populations may also play important roles in AML development in Chinese population.","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Jiangsu Key Lab of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Wuxi Peoples's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, No. 299 Qingyang Road, Wuxi, 214194, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Wuxi Peoples's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, No. 299 Qingyang Road, Wuxi, 214194, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Wuxi Peoples's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, No. 299 Qingyang Road, Wuxi, 214194, China."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Jiangsu Key Lab of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China. hongxiama@njmu.edu.cn.', ""Department of Hematology, Wuxi Peoples's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, No. 299 Qingyang Road, Wuxi, 214194, China. greenleafchemical@163.com."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Jiangsu Key Lab of Cancer Biomarkers, Prevention and Treatment, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China. zhibin_hu@njmu.edu.cn.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'Polymorphism', 'Susceptibility']","['10.1007/s00432-015-2010-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-015-2010-6 [pii]']",10.1007/s00432-015-2010-6 [doi],20150716,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prognosis is often dismal given the frequency of disease relapse or treatment refractory disease. Cytotoxic and cytostatic chemotherapy remain mainstream therapeutics for most hematological malignancies. However, improved understanding of tumor immunobiology is providing appealing anti-cancer strategies targeting selected component of immune response. Since approval of rituximab for treating B cell malignancies in 1997, availability of monoclonal antibodies against tumor specific surface molecules has driven the development of the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy. This strategy of modulating the immune response is taking an increasingly prominent role in the treatment of hematological malignancies with several new antibody-based therapeutics becoming available for patients with leukemia/lymphoma. In addition, with an increasingly appreciated role for T cell immunity in cancer pathogenesis, strategies enhancing T cell activation as well as inhibiting T cell suppression mechanisms are under active development. Therapeutic vaccines to improve efficacy of antigen processing and presentation, agonists for co-stimulatory molecules, adoptive transfer of genetically-modified T cells, as well as agents that suppress negative regulatory pathways for T cell function are all under active clinical investigation. Although most of these studies are in early stages, preliminary data are very promising. Availability of additional immune-based therapeutic options for patients with hematological malignancies is anticipated in the near future.","['Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA 17033, USA. hzheng@hmc.psu.edu.']",['0 (Cancer Vaccines)'],,,,"['CMP-EPUB-68911 [pii]', '10.2174/1874467208666150716121253 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to develop an in vivo model of RUNX1-mutated, CN-AML in which the nature of residual disease in this molecular disease subset could be explored. We utilized a well-characterized patient-derived, RUNX1-mutated CN-AML line (CG-SH). Tail vein injection of CG-SH into NOD scid gamma mice led to leukemic engraftment in the bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood within 6 weeks. Treatment of leukemic mice with anthracycline/cytarabine-based chemotherapy resulted in clearance of disease from the spleen and peripheral blood, but persistence of disease in the bone marrow as assessed by flow cytometry and secondary transplantation. Whole exome sequencing of CG-SH revealed mutations in ASXL1, CEBPA, GATA2, and SETBP1, not previously reported. We conclude that CG-SH xenografts are a robust, reproducible in vivo model of CN-AML in which to explore mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance and novel therapeutic approaches.","['Department of Medicine, James P.

It acts as a regulator that controls the expression of several uptake transporter genes such as DUR3 and SAM3 encoding two high-affinity polyamine permeases. agp2Delta mutants display extreme resistance to several cationic compounds including polyamines, the anticancer agent bleomycin, and cationic antifungal peptides. We propose that Agp2 might be involved in regulating the uptake of other cationic anticancer drugs. To date, an uptake transporter has not been reported for anthracyclines, a family of chemotherapeutic agents that are used for treating adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Herein, we develop assay conditions to monitor the uptake of the anthracycline doxorubicin into yeast cells and demonstrate for the first time that Agp2 is required for the drug uptake. Deletion of both the DUR3 and SAM3 genes reduced doxorubicin uptake, but not the deletion of either gene alone, while the agp2Delta mutant was severely compromised, suggesting that Agp2 controls the drug uptake via Dur3 and Sam3 and at least one additional transporter. Overexpression of DUR3 or SAM3 from the endogenous promoter rescued doxorubicin uptake into the sam3Deltadur3Delta double mutant, consistent with a role for these transporters in the uptake of anthracyclines. We further show by cross-species complementation analysis that expression of the Caenorhabditis elegans oct-1 gene encoding an organic cation transporter restored full doxorubicin uptake in the agp2Delta mutant. Four separate variants of CeOCT-1 derived by substituting the amino acid residues Gln15, Cys31, Gln109 and Lys300 with alanine were stably expressed, but did not mediate doxorubicin uptake into the agp2Delta mutant. Moreover, we show that overexpression of CeOCT-1 sensitized parent yeast cells to doxorubicin, suggesting that CeOCT-1 related members might be key transporters to facilitate entry of anthracyclines into human cells.","[""Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Research Center, Universite de Montreal, department of Medicine, 5415 Boul. de l' Assomption, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", ""Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Research Center, Universite de Montreal, department of Medicine, 5415 Boul. de l' Assomption, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", ""Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Research Center, Universite de Montreal, department of Medicine, 5415 Boul. de l' Assomption, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.""]","['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Ions)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Metals)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (OCT-1 protein, C elegans)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",PMC4503637,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0133182 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-11227 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0133182 [doi],20150715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the in vivo toxicity profiles with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) evaluation followed by antitumor efficacy study in leukemia-bearing DBA/2 mice. Glu-Pt showed 6-fold increase in the MTD and was more efficacious against mouse L1210 ascetic leukemia than oxaliplatin at equitoxic doses. To explore the combination effect of Glu-Pt and compare with oxaliplatin-based FOLFOX chemotherapy, we investigated the two-component synergistic antitumor activity of Glu-Pt with folinic acid (FA) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) respectively in five human cancer cell lines followed by a comparison study with oxaliplatin in a fixed three-component in vitro FOFLOX combination. As the result, Glu-Pt exhibited superior synergistic cytotoxicity compared to oxaliplatin. Flow cytometry-based cell cycle and apoptosis study demonstrated that Glu-Pt follows the same mechanistic principles as of oxaliplatin. Glu-Pt monotherapy and its combination with FA and 5-FU may result in improved efficacy over oxaliplatin and FOLFOX regimen.

Shortened telomere length (TL) has been associated with risk of cancers and aging-related diseases. Several studies have explored associations between TL and cancer prognosis, but the results are conflicting. METHODS: Prospective studies on the relationship between TL and cancer survival were identified by a search of PubMed up to May 25, 2015. There were no restrictions on the cancer type or DNA source. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis approaches were conducted to determine pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Thirty-three articles containing forty-five independent studies were ultimately involved in our meta-analysis, of which twenty-seven were about overall cancer survival and eighteen were about cancer progression. Short TL was associated with increased cancer mortality risk (RR = 1.30, 95%CI: 1.06-1.59) and poor cancer progression (RR = 1.44, 95%CI: 1.10-1.88), both with high levels of heterogeneity (I2 = 83.5%, P = 0.012for overall survival and I2 = 75.4%, P = 0.008 for progression). TL was an independent predictor of overall cancer survival and progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Besides, short telomeres were also associated with increased colorectal cancer mortality and decreased overall survival of esophageal cancer, but not in other cancers. Cancer progression was associated with TL in Asian and America populations and short TL predicted poor cancer survival in older populations. Compared with tumor tissue cells, TL in blood lymphocyte cells was better for prediction. In addition, the associations remained significant when restricted to studies with adjustments for age, with larger sample sizes, measuring TL using southern blotting or estimating risk effects by hazard ratios. CONCLUSION: Short TL demonstrated a significant association with poor cancer survival, suggesting the potential prognostic significance of TL. Additional large well-designed studies are needed to confirm our findings.","[""Institute of Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China; Medical School of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, No 161 Hospital of People's Liberation Army, Wuhan, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, Ministry of Education & Ministry of Environmental Protection, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', ""Institute of Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'Department of General Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', ""Institute of Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China; Medical School of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China.""]",,PMC4503690,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0133174 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-06415 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0133174 [doi],20150715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leishmania are transmitted to humans by the bite of sandflies. After weeks to months, unspecific symptoms may occur, accompanied by more specific findings like pancytopenia and organomegaly. We report two children with pancytopenia and hepato-/splenomegaly: a 1-year-old boy was first diagnosed with an Adenovirus-infection, accompanied by fever, pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly who had spent his summer vacation in Spain and a 3-year-old boy of Macedonian origin who was first diagnosed with a Parvovirus B19-infection again accompanied by splenomegaly and pancytopenia. In both children, leukemia was excluded by an initial bone marrow puncture. As fever was still persistent weeks after the children's first hospital stay, both children received antibiotics empirically without sustainable effect. While different autoantibodies were present in both children, an immunosuppressive therapy was initiated in the younger boy without therapeutic success. A second bone marrow puncture was performed and Leishmania were finally detected morphologically and proven serologically. After weight-adjusted treatment with liposomal Amphotericin B for 10 days, both children recovered completely without relapse. Aim of this report is to broaden the spectrum of differential diagnoses in children with pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and fever to visceral leishmaniasis particularly when travel history is positive for the Mediterranean area. The infection may mimic more common diseases, such as leukemia, viral infections, or autoimmune diseases, because polyclonal B cell activation and other mechanisms may lead to multiple positive serologic tests. Both cases illustrate typical pitfalls and shall encourage taking Leishmaniasis into diagnostic consideration.","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Center of Child and Adolescent Health, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf , Dusseldorf , Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Center of Child and Adolescent Health, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf , Dusseldorf , Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Center for Pediatrics, University of Bonn , Bonn , Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Center of Child and Adolescent Health, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf , Dusseldorf , Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Center of Child and Adolescent Health, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf , Dusseldorf , Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Center of Child and Adolescent Health, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf , Dusseldorf , Germany.']",,PMC4483513,['NOTNLM'],"['children', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'pancytopenia', 'recurrent fever', 'visceral leishmaniasis']",['10.3389/fped.2015.00059 [doi]'],10.3389/fped.2015.00059 [doi],20150629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this Swiss population-based matched case-control study on the etiology of childhood leukemia, we selected the cases from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry diagnosed since 1991 and the controls randomly from census. We assigned eight controls per case from the 1990 and 2000 census and matched them by the year of birth and gender. SES information for both cases and controls was obtained from census records by probabilistic record linkage. We investigated the association of SES with childhood leukemia in Switzerland, and explored whether it varied with different definitions of socioeconomic status (parental education, living condition, area-based SES), time period, and age. In conditional logistic regression analyses of 565 leukemia cases and 4433 controls, we found no consistent evidence for an association between SES and childhood leukemia. The odds ratio comparing the highest with the lowest SES category ranged from 0.95 (95% CI: 0.71-1.26; P trend = 0.73) for paternal education to 1.37 (1.00-1.89; P trend = 0.064) for maternal education. No effect modification was found for time period and age at diagnosis. Based on this population-based study, which avoided participation and reporting bias, we assume the potential association of socioeconomic status and childhood leukemia if existing to be small.

GPX3 promoter methylation status in 181 de novo AML patients and 44 normal controls was detected by real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out to assess GPX3 expression. GPX3 promoter was significantly methylated in 181 AML patients compared with normal controls (P=0.022). The patients with GPX3 methylation presented significantly older age than those with GPX3 unmethylation (P=0.011). GPX3 methylated patients had significantly lower frequency of C/EBPA mutation and higher incidence of FLT3-ITD mutation (P=0.037 and 0.030).

Epub 2015 Jun 30.,"Acute myeloid leukemia is a well characterized blood cancer in which the unnatural growth of immature white blood cell takes place, where several genes transcription is regulated by the micro RNAs (miRNAs). Argonaute (AGO) protein is a protein family that binds to the miRNAs and mRNA complex where a strong binding affinity is crucial for its RNA silencing function. By understanding pattern recognition between the miRNAs-mRNA complex and its binding affinity with AGO protein, one can decipher the regulation of a particular gene and develop suitable siRNA for the same in disease condition. In the current work, HOXA9 gene has been selected from literature, whose deregulation is well-established in acute myeloid leukemia. Four miRNAs (mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, and mir-196b) have been selected to target mRNA of HOXA9 (NCBI accession No. NM_152739.3). The binding interaction between mRNAs and mRNA of HOXA9 gene was studied computationally. From result, it was observed mir-145 has highest affinity for HOXA9 gene. Furthermore, the interaction between miRNAs-mRNA duplex of all chosen miRNAs are docked with AGO protein (PDB ID: 3F73, chain A) to study their interaction at molecular level through an in silico approach. The residual interaction and hydrogen bonding are inspected in Discovery Studio 3.5 suites. The current investigation throws light on understanding of AGO-assisted miRNA based gene silencing mechanism in HOXA9 gene associated in acute myeloid leukemia computationally.","['BIF Centre, Department of Bioinformatics, Orissa University of Agriculture & Technology, Bhubaneswar 751003, India.', 'School of Biological Sciences, National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar 751005, India.', 'BIF Centre, Department of Bioinformatics, Orissa University of Agriculture & Technology, Bhubaneswar 751003, India.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, IMS and SUM Hospital, SOA University, Bhubaneswar 751003, India.', 'BIF Centre, Department of Bioinformatics, Orissa University of Agriculture & Technology, Bhubaneswar 751003, India.']",,PMC4500798,['NOTNLM'],"['Argonaute', 'HOXA9', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'in silico', 'mRNA', 'microRNAs']",['10.5808/GI.2015.13.2.45 [doi]'],10.5808/GI.2015.13.2.45 [doi],20150630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve the efficacy of JAK2 inhibition in B-ALL, we developed the type II inhibitor CHZ868, which stabilizes JAK2 in an inactive conformation. CHZ868 potently suppressed the growth of CRLF2-rearranged human B-ALL cells, abrogated JAK2 signaling, and improved survival in mice with human or murine B-ALL. CHZ868 and dexamethasone synergistically induced apoptosis in JAK2-dependent B-ALLs and further improved in vivo survival compared to CHZ868 alone.

Tumor infiltration by NK-cells is associated with prolonged survival in cancer patients and high NK-cell cytotoxicity has been linked to decreased cancer risk. Allogeneic adoptive transfer of NK-cells from healthy donors to cancer patients has shown promise as a means of controlling or reversing the spread of multiple human malignancies including multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. However, multiple issues remain that undermine the efficacy of long-term cancer treatment using adoptive transfer of NK-cells including loss of activating receptors and cytotoxic potential in transferred NK-cells. Moreover, chronic exercise has been linked to improved NK-cell cytotoxicity, prognosis, and survival in cancer patients, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation is associated with enhanced NK-cell function after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and decreased relapse risk in AML patients. In this work, we explore the potential of exercise- and CMV-driven alterations in NK-cell phenotype and function to increase the efficacy of NK-cells for cancer immunotherapy and prolong survival in cancer patients. We conclude that acute exercise and CMV are both capable of enhancing NK-cell cytotoxicity through distinct mechanisms; however, these effects are not additive as CMV infection is associated with an impaired acute exercise response.

Epub 2015 Jul 14.,"BACKGROUND: Childhood thrombocytopenias include immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and inherited thrombocytopenia; the former is caused by autoantibodies to platelets, whereas the latter can be distinguished by platelet size and underlying genetic mutations. Due to limited methods for the definite diagnosis of ITP, genetic and clinical parameters are required for diagnosing inherited thrombocytopenias with small or normal-sized platelets. PROCEDURE: In total, 32 Japanese patients with thrombocytopenia with small or normal-sized platelets from 29 families were enrolled. All the patients were under 20 years of age, with family histories of early-onset thrombocytopenia and/or poor response to conventional therapies for ITP. Genotypes and clinical parameters were retrospectively evaluated according to the disease type. RESULTS: Twelve cases of inherited thrombocytopenia were observed. We identified chromosomal deletions within the WASP gene in two patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome; a missense mutation in a patient with X-linked thrombocytopenia; and mutations in the RUNX1 gene of five patients with familial platelet disorder with propensity to acute myelogenous leukemia, and in the ANKRD26 gene of four patients with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia-2. All 12 carried germline mutations, three of which were de novo. Furthermore, we observed significantly elevated serum thrombopoietin (TPO) levels and dysplasia of megakaryocytes in patients carrying the RUNX1 and ANKRD26 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic analyses and detection of TPO levels and dysmegakaryopoiesis were clinically useful for screening patients with inherited thrombocytopenias, irrespective of the family history. We hypothesize that the WASP, RUNX1, and ANKRD26 genes are important for normal TPO signaling and the network underlying thrombopoiesis.","['Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Miyagi, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Miyagi Children's Hospital, Miyagi, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Japanese Red Cross Narita Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization, Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Anjoh Kosei Hospital, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nishi-Kobe Medical Center, Hyogo, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Miyagi Children's Hospital, Miyagi, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Miyagi, Japan.']","['0 (ANKRD26 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (WAS protein, human)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ITP', 'molecular genetics', 'platelet disorders', 'thrombocytopenia']",['10.1002/pbc.25668 [doi]'],10.1002/pbc.25668 [doi],20150714,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our recent work using transcriptional data to predict metabolite levels in cancer cells led to preliminary evidence of the antiproliferative role of menaquinone (vitamin K2) in the Jurkat cell line model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, nothing is known about the direct metabolic impacts of menaquinone in cancer, which could provide insights into its mechanism of action. Here, we used metabolomics to investigate the process by which menaquinone exerts antiproliferative activity on Jurkat cells. We first validated the dose-dependent, semi-selective, pro-apoptotic activity of menaquinone treatment on Jurkat cells relative to non-cancerous lymphoblasts. We then used mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to identify systems-scale changes in metabolic dynamics that are distinct from changes induced in non-cancerous cells or by other chemotherapeutics. One of the most significantly affected metabolites was phosphoethanolamine, which exhibited a two-fold increase in menaquinone-treated Jurkat cells compared to vehicle-treated cells at 24 h, growing to a five-fold increase at 72 h. Phosphoethanolamine elevation was observed prior to the induction of apoptosis, and was not observed in menaquinone-treated lymphoblasts or chemotherapeutic-treated Jurkat cells. We also validated the link between menaquinone and phosphoethanolamine in an ovarian cancer cell line, suggesting potentially broad applicability of their relationship. This metabolomics-based work is the first detailed characterization of the metabolic impacts of menaquinone treatment and the first identified link between phosphoethanolamine and menaquinone-induced apoptosis.","['School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 311 Ferst Drive NW, Atlanta, GA, USA. mark.styczynski@chbe.gatech.edu.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ethanolamines)', '11032-49-8 (Vitamin K 2)', '78A2BX7AEU (phosphorylethanolamine)']",PMC4534331,,,['10.1039/c5mb00237k [doi]'],10.1039/c5mb00237k [doi],,"['R01 GM048835/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA167500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA167500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS710238'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 14.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the putative intrauterine origins of childhood (0-14 years) leukaemia, it is complex to assess the impact of perinatal factors on disease onset. Results on the association of maternal history of fetal loss (miscarriage/stillbirth) with specific disease subtypes in the subsequent offspring are in conflict. We sought to investigate whether miscarriage and stillbirth may have different impacts on the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and of its main immunophenotypes (B-cell and T-cell ALL), as contrasted to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). METHODS: One thousand ninety-nine ALL incidents (957 B-ALL) and 131 AML cases along with 1:1 age and gender-matched controls derived from the Nationwide Registry for Childhood Hematological Malignancies and Brain Tumors (1996-2013) were studied. Multivariable regression models were used to assess the roles of previous miscarriage(s) and stillbirth(s) on ALL (overall, B-, T-ALL) and AML, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Statistically significant exposure and disease subtype-specific associations of previous miscarriage(s) exclusively with AML [odds ratio (OR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00, 2.81] and stillbirth(s) with ALL [OR 4.82, 95% CI 1.63, 14.24] and B-ALL particularly, emerged. CONCLUSION: Differential pathophysiological pathways pertaining to genetic polymorphisms or cytogenetic aberrations are likely to create hostile environments leading either to fetal loss or the development of specific leukaemia subtypes in subsequent offspring, notably distinct associations of maternal miscarriage history confined to AML and stillbirth history confined to ALL (specifically B-ALL). If confirmed and further supported by studies revealing underlying mechanisms, these results may shed light on the divergent leukemogenesis processes.","['Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, 'Pan. & Agl.

METHODS: A descriptive case-series demonstrating the use of a novel real-time PCR protocol targeting 529 bp repeat element, a multicopy and highly conserved fragment, in Toxoplasma gondii genome. This was designed and established by our microbiology service following independent, external validation. RESULTS: Three immunosuppressed patients presenting to a tertiary uveitis referral centre with unilateral, severe, sight-threatening uveitis are described. One patient presented with a large focus of sight-threatening retinitis and occlusive vasculitis while on systemic immunosuppression with azathioprine and adalimumab for Crohn's disease. One patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia presented with severe posterior uveitis and total retinal detachment. Finally, the third patient presented with severe retinitis adjacent to the optic nerve and vitritis causing acute vision loss. HIV infection was subsequently identified. In all three cases, the cause of inflammation was not clear from clinical examination alone and prompt treatment was required to prevent permanent vision loss. Intraocular sampling and PCR testing was performed including testing for toxoplasmosis, herpesviruses and syphilis. CONCLUSIONS: The novel real-time PCR assay described is more sensitive than those targeting the Toxoplasma B1 gene owing to the higher number of repeats and highly conserved sequence level. This technique can be applied in clinical practice and provides a valuable tool for the rapid diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis.","['Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, Manchester, UK.', 'Public Health England, Public Health Laboratory, Manchester Medical Microbiology Partnership, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, Manchester, UK.']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Protozoan)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', '83905-01-5 (Azithromycin)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Diagnostic tests/Investigation', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Microbiology']","['bjophthalmol-2015-306801 [pii]', '10.1136/bjophthalmol-2015-306801 [doi]']",10.1136/bjophthalmol-2015-306801 [doi],20150714,,,"['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Epub 2015 Jul 14.,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Identification of biomarkers that could predict high-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) efficacy and toxicity is a key issue in individualized therapy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of cytidine deaminase (CDA) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) -451G>A (rs532545), 435C>T (rs1048977) and -33delC (rs3215400) on treatment outcome in patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) after high-dose Ara-C chemotherapy. METHODS: In total, 173 patients with relapsed AML, treated with high-dose Ara-C chemotherapy, were genotyped for three polymorphisms in CDA gene using the allele-specific matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry assays. Binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the influence of selected polymorphisms on tumour response and occurrence of treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The CC genotype at -33delC, a promoter polymorphism, increased the odds of overall response rate (odds ratio [OR] = 5.125; 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 2.446-10.74; P = 0.0008) and grade >/=3 infection toxicity incidence rate (OR = 3.572; 95% CI = 1.68-7.594; P = 0.003).

Two other polymorphisms, -451G>A and 435C>T, did not influence treatment outcome, including overall response rate, infection toxicity and nausea/vomiting, in patients with relapsed AML (P > 0.05).

In a previous study, we performed a large functional screen using a retroviral barcoded miRNA expression library. Here, we report that overexpression of miR-9/9* in myeloid 32D cell line (32D-miR-9/9*) had profound impact on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced differentiation. Further in vitro studies showed that enforced expression of miR-9/9* blocked normal neutrophil development in 32D and in primary murine lineage-negative bone marrow cells. We examined the expression of miR-9/9* in a cohort of 647 primary human AMLs. In most cases, miR-9 and miR-9* were significantly upregulated and their expression levels varied according to AML subtype, with the highest expression in MLL-related leukemias harboring 11q23 abnormalities and the lowest expression in AML cases with t(8;21) and biallelic mutations in CEBPA. Gene expression profiling of AMLs with high expression of miR-9/9* and 32D-miR-9/9* identified ETS-related gene (Erg) as the only common potential target. Upregulation of ERG in 32D cells rescued miR-9/9*-induced block in neutrophil differentiation. Taken together, this study demonstrates that miR-9/9* are aberrantly expressed in most of AML cases and interfere with normal neutrophil differentiation by downregulation of ERG.","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",,,,"['leu2015183 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.183 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.183 [doi],20150715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effects of PD0332991 and ON123300 on cell cycle progression, modulation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) and PI3K/AKT pathways, and the induction of apoptosis in MCL cell lines and patient-derived samples. When Granta 519 and Z138C cells were incubated with PD0332991 and ON123300, both compounds were equally efficient in their ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb family proteins. However, only ON123300 inhibited the phosphorylation of proteins associated with the PI3K/AKT pathway. Cells treated with PD0332991 rapidly accumulated in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle as a function of increasing concentration. Although ON123300-treated cells arrested similarly at lower concentrations, higher concentrations resulted in the induction of apoptosis, which was not observed in PD0332991-treated samples. Mouse xenograft assays also showed a strong inhibition of MCL tumor growth in ON123300-treated animals. Finally, treatment of ibrutinib-sensitive and -resistant patient-derived MCLs with ON123300 also triggered apoptosis and inhibition of the Rb and PI3K/AKT pathways, suggesting that this compound might be an effective agent in MCL, including ibrutinib-resistant forms of the disease.","['Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Structural Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.']","['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (ON123300)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)']",PMC4703501,,,"['leu2015185 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.185 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.185 [doi],20150715,"['P01 CA130821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA158209/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA-130821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-158209/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS704414'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the severe infections occurring in these patients before or during any treatment suggest an intrinsic alteration of the immune system. In this respect, IL-17-producing T helper (Th17) besides playing a key role in regulating inflammatory response, tumor growth and autoimmune diseases, have been shown to protect against bacterial and fungal pathogens. However, the role of Th17 cells in AML has not yet been clarified. METHODS: T cell frequencies were assessed by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 30 newly diagnosed AML patients and 30 age-matched healthy volunteers. Cytokine production was determined before and after culture of T cells with either Candida Albicans or AML blasts. Statistical analyses were carried out using the paired and unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests and confirmed with the non parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: A strong increase of Th17 cells producing immunosuppressive IL-10 was observed in AML patients compared with healthy donors. In addition, stimulation of AML-derived T cells with a Candida albicans antigen induced significantly lower IFN-gamma production than that observed in healthy donors; intriguingly, depletion of patient Th17 cells restored IFN-gamma production after stimulation. To address the role of AML blasts in inducing Th17 alterations, CD4+ cells from healthy donors were co-cultured with CD33+ blasts: data obtained showed that AML blasts induce in healthy donors levels of IL-10-producing Th17 cells similar to those observed in patients. CONCLUSIONS: In AML patients altered Th17 cells actively cause an immunosuppressive state that may promote infections and probably tumor escape. Th17 cells could thus represent a new target to improve AML immunotherapy.","['Hematology Unit, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy. gerardo.musuraca@irst.emr.it.', 'Biosciences Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy. serena.dematteis@irst.emr.it.', 'Biosciences Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy. roberta.napolitano@irst.emr.it.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncological Sciences 'L. and A.

METHODS: From January 2003 to December 2012, 74 consecutive patients aged </= 15 years with newly diagnosed T-ALL were treated with BCH-2003 protocol or CCLG-2008 protocol in the Department of Pediatric, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital in China. Predictive values of early treatment responses, including prednisone response, bone marrow morphology at day 15 and day 33 during induction chemotherapy, and minimal residual disease (MRD) monitored by flow cytometry after induction therapy (time point 1, TP1) and before consolidation therapy (time point 2, TP2), were analyzed. RESULTS: The 5-year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for these patients were 62.5% (SE, 6.4) and 62.7% (SE, 6.6), respectively. Prednisone poor responder was strongly associated with increased chance of induction failure (14.8%) and decreased survival rate (5 year EFS rate, 51.1 % (SE, 10.5)). Patients with >/= 25% blast cells in bone marrow at day 15 were more likely to have an inferior outcome. 93.2% of the T-ALL patients achieved complete remission at day 33 while patients with resistant disease all died of disease progression. MRD >/= 10(-2) at TP1 or MRD >/= 10(-3) at TP2 was significantly related to dismal prognosis. Risk groups classified by MRD at two time points could stratify patients into different groups: 29.0% of the patients were MRD standard risk (MRD < 10(-4) at both time points) with 3-year EFS rate of 100%, 29.0% were MRD high risk (MRD >/= 10(-2) at TP1 or MRD >/= 10(-2) at TP2) with 3-year EFS rate of 55.6% (SE, 16.6) , and the rest of patients were defined as MRD intermediate risk with 3-year EFS rate of 85.7% (SE, 13.2). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that MRD was the most powerful predictor of treatment outcome in childhood T-ALL patients and conventional morphological assessments of treatment response still played important roles in predicting treatment outcome and tailoring treatment intensity especially in countries with inadequate skills or financial resources for MRD monitoring.","['Department of Pediatric, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, Peoples Republic of China. weiwei2013pumc@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pediatric, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, Peoples Republic of China. chenxj76@163.com.', 'Department of Pediatric, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, Peoples Republic of China. zy300020@medmail.com.cn.', 'Department of Pediatric, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, Peoples Republic of China. clx.886@163.com.', 'Department of Pediatric, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, Peoples Republic of China. annwenbin@163.com.', 'Department of Pediatric, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, Peoples Republic of China. wanyang1988pumc@126.com.', 'Department of Pediatric, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, Peoples Republic of China. tianfeng0112@sohu.com.', 'Department of Pediatric, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, Peoples Republic of China. ywy_73@163.com.', 'Department of Pediatric, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, Peoples Republic of China. chenyum@medmail.com.cn.', 'Department of Pediatric, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, Peoples Republic of China. guoyanr@126.com.', 'Department of Pediatric, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, Peoples Republic of China. xfzhu1981@126.com.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",PMC4502910,,,"['10.1186/s12887-015-0390-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12887-015-0390-z [pii]']",10.1186/s12887-015-0390-z [doi],20150715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 15.,"PURPOSE: Second malignant neoplasms (SMN) or second cancers may occur in 2-5 % of childhood cancer survivors within 5-25 years after diagnosis and treatment of a bone sarcoma. The most common are leukemia and breast cancer; salivary gland SMN are exceptional. To enhance the literature, we reviewed our patients with bone sarcomas and evaluated the incidence and outcome of salivary gland SMN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied all patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma treated at the Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli with chemotherapy from January 1983 to December 2012. There were 883 osteosarcoma and 543 Ewing's sarcoma patients. We evaluated the date of diagnosis and histology of bone sarcoma, chemotherapy administered, date of diagnosis and histology of SMN, and survival of patients. RESULTS: The 10-year incidence of SMN was 3.6 %; the most common were breast cancer, leukemia, sarcomas, and salivary gland neoplasms. The incidence of salivary gland SMN was 0.5 %; there were five male and two female patients with a mean age of 19 years (range 13-28 years) who experienced a salivary gland SMN within a mean interval of 79 months (range 51-97 months). The most common salivary gland involved was the parotid followed by the submandibular gland. One of the seven patients with salivary gland SMN died from his SMN. CONCLUSIONS: Treating physicians should be aware of the risk of salivary gland SMN after chemotherapy for bone sarcomas in children and adolescents. Close follow-up of childhood bone sarcoma survivors for SMN is important.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy. alessandra.longhi@ior.it.', 'Fourth Department of Orthopaedics, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.', 'Fourth Department of Orthopaedics, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.', 'First Department of Orthopaedics, Attikon University Hospital, Athens University Medical School, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Orthopaedics, Attikon University Hospital, Athens University Medical School, Athens, Greece. afm@otenet.gr.', 'Fourth Department of Orthopaedics, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', ""Ewing's sarcoma"", 'Osteosarcoma', 'Salivary gland neoplasms', 'Second cancer']","['10.1007/s00590-015-1662-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00590-015-1662-x [pii]']",10.1007/s00590-015-1662-x [doi],20150715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Urinary symptoms and sensory disturbances with lower back pain were reduced, though not to a statistically significant degree. Although signs and symptoms of spasticity were improved, frequent urination and urinary incontinence were not significantly affected by the triple therapy.

However, there is no available information to show that alpha-PA induced cell apoptosis in cancer cells, thus, we investigated the effects of alpha-PA on the cell morphology, viability, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis in mice leukemia WEHI-3 cells in vitro. Results indicated that alpha-PA induced cell morphological changes and decreased viability, induced G0/G1 arrest and sub-G1 phase (apoptosis) in WEHI-3 cells. alpha-PA increased the productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca(2+) and decreased the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim ) in dose- and time-dependent manners in WEHI-3 cells that were analyzed by flow cytometer. Results from confocal laser microscopic system examinations show that alpha-PA promoted the release of cytochrome c, AIF, and Endo G from mitochondria in WEHI-3 cells. These results are the first findings to provide new information for understanding the mechanisms by which alpha-PA induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in WEHI-3 cells in vitro.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether male and female patients differ with regard to acute treatment-related toxicities. PROCEDURES: We reviewed data collected on the Children's cancer group (CCG) high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-HR) study (CCG-1961), and compared male and female patients' toxicity incidence and related variables in the first four phases of treatment. Similar analyses were performed with standard-risk ALL (ALL-SR) patients enrolled in CCG-1991. RESULTS: Among ALL-HR patients, females had significantly more hospital days, delays in therapy, grade 3 or 4 toxicities (e.g., gastrointestinal, liver), and supportive care interventions (e.g., transfusions, intravenous antibiotics) than males. Females were significantly more likely to have died of treatment-related causes than males (Hazard ratio = 2.8, 95%CI = 1.5-5.3, P = 0.002). Five months after beginning the treatment, the cumulative incidence of treatment-related deaths was 2.6% for females and 1.2% for males. Similar disparities were found among ALL-SR patients, with females experiencing significantly more hospital days and treatment-related toxicities than males. CONCLUSIONS: This study complements cancer survivorship studies that also report an increase in treatment-related late effects among females. Risk profiles appear to be different for male and female patients, with females having greater risk of developing both acute and long-term treatment-related toxicities. The underlying biological mechanisms for these sex differences are poorly understood and warrant further study in order to determine how sex-based outcome disparities can be addressed in future clinical trials and practice.","[""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Agensys, Inc., Santa Monica, California.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio."", 'Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.']",,PMC4624005,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute toxicities', 'disparities', 'pediatric oncology', 'sex']",['10.1002/pbc.25628 [doi]'],10.1002/pbc.25628 [doi],20150714,"['U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS716935'],"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the TBI/CY/TT group, 164 of patients (96 %) received HCT during the previous year (2000-2005). Multivariate analysis revealed that the TBI/CY/TT group demonstrated a trend of poorer survival rate than the TBI/CY group, [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.49, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.99-2.24, P = 0.055] with a higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) (HR = 2.34, 95 % CI 1.35-4.06, P = 0.002) rates, while TBI/CY/CA group demonstrated similar outcomes. Even in the subgroup analyses of disease type or disease risk, the outcomes with intensified conditioning regimens were not superior to those with TBI/CY. In conclusion, although the significant bias has to be carefully considered, the clinical benefit of adding CA or TT to the TBI/CY regimen was not demonstrated.","['Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan. tcbnt@yokohama-cu.ac.jp.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-9 Fukuura, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, 236-0004, Japan. tcbnt@yokohama-cu.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-9 Fukuura, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, 236-0004, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shizuoka Red Cross Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Shizuoka Red Cross Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-9 Fukuura, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, 236-0004, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-9 Fukuura, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, 236-0004, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-9 Fukuura, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, 236-0004, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.']","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Conditioning regimen', 'Cytarabine', 'Stem cell transplantation', 'TBI/CY', 'Thiotepa']","['10.1007/s12185-015-1836-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-015-1836-7 [pii]']",10.1007/s12185-015-1836-7 [doi],20150715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ALL trial enrolls both adult and pediatric patient populations. Dose escalation and the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) are performed separately for each population, but to increase efficiency, information about the dose-toxicity curve is shared. Dose escalation rules allow pediatric patients to skip dose levels provided safety has been shown in adults and the dose level is estimated to be safe for pediatric patients. Trial objectives are to efficiently determine the MTD for each population and to minimize the number of pediatric patients required for dose escalation.","['Berry Consultants, LLC, 4301 Westbank Drive Suite 140 Bldg B, Austin, TX 78746, United States.

Epub 2015 Jul 8.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We undertook the present study to ascertain the contributing risk factors and explore the epidemiological and mycological characteristics of opportunistic candidemia among patients with hematological malignancies. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Observational cross-sectional study in a tertiary care center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with hematological malignancies reporting to the collaborating medical and pediatric units with a febrile episode were recruited and screened for candidemia by blood culture. Recovered Candida isolates were speciated and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed as per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guideline (CLSI) guidelines M44-A. Further analysis was done for potential risk factors and compared between culture positive and negative patients. RESULTS: Of 150 patients recruited, the majority (n=27) were between 51 and 60 years and the male to female ratio was 1.63:1. Fifteen patients (10%) were culture positive. The culture positivity was significantly higher in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) than in non-ALL patients (p=0.03). There was significant association of candidaemia with leucopenia, chemotherapeutic drugs, corticosteroids and presence of indwelling devices. Duration of disease (p=0.032) and duration of hospitalization (p=0.003) were significantly prolonged in culture positive patients. C. tropicalis was the commonest isolate (46.67%), with non- Candida albicans outnumbering C. albicans in all categories of hematological malignancies (2.75:1). All isolates of C. albicans were uniformly sensitive to all the azoles, but only 50% were sensitive to amphotericin B and none to nystatin and flucytosine. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study identifies ALL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as the forms of hematological malignancy predominantly associated with candidemia; specifies risk factors and chemotherapeutic agents predisposing patients towards its occurrence; reports a preponderance of C. tropicalis among the causative agents and finds voriconazole to be the most effective antifungal agent against the recovered isolates. This information could assist in tailoring prophylactic and therapeutic antifungal practices for this infection, according to local epidemiological and mycological characteristics.","['Department of Microbiology, Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India; Department of Microbiology, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.

Epub 2015 Jul 11.,"Reliable, noninvasive methods for diagnosing and prognosing sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) early after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are needed. We used a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify candidate biomarkers of SOS by comparing plasma pooled from 20 patients with and 20 patients without SOS. Of 494 proteins quantified, we selected 6 proteins (L-Ficolin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM1], tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, von Willebrand factor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and CD97) based on a differential heavy/light isotope ratio of at least 2 fold, information from the literature, and immunoassay availability. Next, we evaluated the diagnostic potential of these 6 proteins and 5 selected from the literature (suppression of tumorigenicity-2 [ST2], angiopoietin-2 (ANG2), hyaluronic acid [HA], thrombomodulin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) in samples from 80 patients. The results demonstrate that together ST2, ANG2, L-Ficolin, HA, and VCAM1 compose a biomarker panel for diagnosis of SOS. L-Ficolin, HA, and VCAM1 also stratified patients at risk for SOS as early as the day of HCT. Prognostic Bayesian modeling for SOS onset based on L-Ficolin, HA, and VCAM1 levels on the day of HCT and clinical characteristics showed >80% correct prognosis of SOS onset. These biomarkers may provide opportunities for preemptive intervention to minimize SOS incidence and/or severity.","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Department of Genomics, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Department of Cellular and Integrative Physiology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain; Jose Carreras Foundation & Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Red and Charline McCombs Institute for the Early Detection and Treatment of Cancer, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.

Epub 2015 Jun 19.,"In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), about 25-30% of patients harbor a constitutively active receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) FLT3 encoded by a FLT3 allele harboring internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation. The presence of FLT3-ITD correlates with poor prognosis in AML and it makes FLT3 an attractive therapeutic target in AML. Unfortunately, to date small-molecule inhibitors of FLT3 have resulted in only partial and transient clinical responses with residual leukemic blasts resistant to FLT3 inhibitors detected in blood or bone marrow. In this study, we investigated whether the RTK Axl is responsible for resistance of FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells to PKC412 and AC220, FLT3 inhibitors currently under clinical trials for FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients. Upon treatment with PKC412 or AC220, phosphorylation of Axl was significantly enhanced in the FLT3-ITD(+) MV4-11 AML cell line and in primary blasts from a FLT3-ITD(+) AML patient. Consistently, a PKC412-resistant AML cell line and PKC412-resistant primary blasts from FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients had significantly higher levels of constitutively phosphorylated Axl and total Axl when compared with a PKC412-sensitive AML cell line and PKC412-sensitive primary blasts from FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients. We also found that resistance of AML cells against the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 and AC220 was substantially diminished by the inhibition of Axl via a small-molecule inhibitor TP-0903, a soluble receptor Axl fusion protein Axl-Fc or knockdown of Axl gene expression by shRNA. Collectively, our study suggests that Axl is required for resistance of FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells against the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 and AC220, and that inhibition of Axl activation may overcome resistance to FLT3-targeted therapy in FLT3-ITD(+) AML.","['Comprehensive Cancer Center and The James Cancer Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center and The James Cancer Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center and The James Cancer Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lehi, UT, USA.', 'Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lehi, UT, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center and The James Cancer Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center and The James Cancer Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center and The James Cancer Hospital, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.']","['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",PMC8145983,,,"['leu2015147 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.147 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.147 [doi],20150619,"['CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA933835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS1680298'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 14.,"For treatment planning in radioimmunotherapy (RIT), the accurate estimation of time-integrated activity coefficients (TIACs) is essential. To estimate the TIACs in RIT using (90)Y-labeled anti-CD66 antibodies, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are advantageous. Further optimization in predicting therapeutic TIACs may be achieved by including population-specific parameters. Therefore, the aims of this work were (1) to estimate population parameters and (2) to show the effect of these parameters on prediction accuracy of therapeutic biodistributions. To estimate population values, a PBPK model was fitted to pretherapeutic (gamma camera and serum) and therapeutic (serum) measurements simultaneously using the standard two-stage (STS) and iterated two-stage (ITS) algorithms. Including the estimated population values as Bayesian information, the model parameters of each patient were fitted to pretherapeutic data only (simulating therapeutic TIACs). To validate the prediction accuracy of the therapeutic serum curve, the simulated and fitted TIACs were compared. Prediction accuracy expressed as relative deviation (RD) improved from RD=8%+/-16% to RD=0%+/-10% for STS and ITS, respectively. The authors demonstrated a method to estimate and apply population values for RIT using a PBPK model and population fitting. For (90)Y-labeled anti-CD66 antibodies, the prediction accuracy was substantially improved.","['1 Medical Radiation Physics/Radiation Protection, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University , Mannheim, Germany .', '2 Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ulm University , Ulm, Germany .', '3 Department of Internal Medicine, Ulm University , Ulm, Germany .', '2 Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ulm University , Ulm, Germany .', '2 Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ulm University , Ulm, Germany .', '1 Medical Radiation Physics/Radiation Protection, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University , Mannheim, Germany .']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD66 antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Yttrium Radioisotopes)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bayes', 'PBPK modeling', 'anti-CD66', 'leukemia', 'population kinetics', 'radioimmunotherapy']",['10.1089/cbr.2015.1878 [doi]'],10.1089/cbr.2015.1878 [doi],20150714,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional chemotherapy is not fully effective for this subtype of leukemia; therefore, potential therapeutic targets need to be explored. Analysis of the gene expression patterns of the transcription factors in pediatric T-ALL revealed that MEF2C and FLT3 were expressed at higher levels in ETP-ALL than typical T-ALL. Using human T-ALL and BaF3 cell lines with high expression levels of MEF2C, the present study tested whether the BCL2 inhibitor (ABT-737) restores the sensitivity to prednisolone (PSL), because MEF2C causes PSL resistance, possibly by augmenting the anti-apoptotic activity of BCL2. Treatment with PSL and ABT-737 caused a significant reduction in the IC50 of PSL in the MEF2C-expressing LOUCY cells, in addition to the MEF2C-transduced BaF3 cells, but not in the non-MEF2C-expressing Jurkat cells. The combination treatment significantly accelerated the killing of primary leukemic blast cells of ETP-ALL with high expression levels of MEF2C, which were co-cultured with murine stromal cells. These findings suggest that BCL2 inhibitors may be a therapeutic candidate in vivo for patients with ETP-ALL with high expression levels of MEF2C.","['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Matsushita Memorial Hospital, Moriguchi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto City Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan; Department of Pediatrics, Matsushita Memorial Hospital, Moriguchi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Jichi Medical University School of Medicine, Shimotuke, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto City Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.']","['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (MEF2C protein, human)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",PMC4501565,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0132926 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-04635 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0132926 [doi],20150714,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study is to identify clinical manifestations preceding the diagnosis of childhood ALL from the maternal perspective and to establish the time elapsed from the first manifestation to the diagnosis. CASE STUDY: Six hospitals located in Bogota and Bucaramanga (Colombia) participated. Cases consisted of children under 15 years old with incidental diagnosis of ALL between January 2000 and March 2005. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, pre diagnostic clinical manifestations, first symptom, and time to diagnosis were collected during interviews with mothers. Medians, ranges and proportions were estimated. P values below 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight cases were analyzed. Pallor (83.6%), loss of appetite (72.6%), weight loss (62.5%), andbleeding into the skin (39.1%) were the most common symptoms preceding diagnosis. The delay between the occurrence of the first symptom and the diagnosis of ALL depends on what the first manifestation is, and it maybe shorter when there is evidence of hemorrhage (median= 14 days). The presence of palpable lymph nodes in the armpits was more significant in girls than in boys (p= 0.04). CONCLUSION: Childhood ALL symptomatology in the prediagnostic stage is not specific to this disease; however, the clinical sign and time since its occurrence may serve as a guide in the early stage of this disease.","['Grupo Colombiano de Estudios Alfa en Epidemiologia, Salud Poblacional, Estadistica Aplicada y Ciencias Aliadas, Magna Science Corporation.', 'Departamento de Pediatria, Hospital Universitario de Santander, Universidad Industrial de Santander, Santander.', 'Unidad de Cuidado Intensivo Neonatal, Clinica Metropolitana de Bucaramanga, Bucaramanga, SA, Colombia.']",,,,,"['S0325-00752015000400009 [pii]', '10.5546/aap.2015.331 [doi]']",10.5546/aap.2015.331 [doi] S0325-00752015000400009 [pii],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 14.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article was to determine the incidence and predictors of vertebral fractures (VF) during the 4 years after diagnosis in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children were enrolled within 30 days of chemotherapy initiation, with incident VF assessed annually on lateral spine radiographs according to the Genant method. Extended Cox models were used to assess the association between incident VF and clinical predictors. RESULTS: A total of 186 children with ALL completed the baseline evaluation (median age, 5.3 years; interquartile range, 3.4-9.7 years; 58% boys). The VF incidence rate was 8.7 per 100 person-years, with a 4-year cumulative incidence of 26.4%. The highest annual incidence occurred at 12 months (16.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.2-22.7), falling to 2.9% at 4 years (95% CI, 1.1-7.3). Half of the children with incident VF had a moderate or severe VF, and 39% of those with incident VF were asymptomatic. Every 10 mg/m(2) increase in average daily glucocorticoid dose (prednisone equivalents) was associated with a 5.9-fold increased VF risk (95% CI, 3.0-11.8; P < .01). Other predictors of increased VF risk included VF at diagnosis, younger age, and lower spine bone mineral density Z-scores at baseline and each annual assessment. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of children with ALL developed incident VF in the 4 years after diagnosis; most of the VF burden was in the first year. Over one third of children with incident VF were asymptomatic. Discrete clinical predictors of a VF were evident early in the patient's clinical course, including a VF at diagnosis.","['Dalhousie University (E.A.C., C.V.F., B.La.), Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H 4R2, Canada;

Such information includes patient age and white blood cell count at diagnosis, leukemia immunophenotype, presence or absence of extramedullary disease, and blast cytogenetic abnormalities. After therapy is initiated, the response of the disease to treatment is key for predicting outcomes. Altogether, this information is used to guide overall treatment intensity.

Nonetheless, metabolic emergencies in cancer patients can often times be life-threatening. Type B lactic acidosis is a rare but potentially fatal paraneoplastic phenomenon that has been described in association with hematologic and solid malignancies and portends a poor prognosis if not rapidly recognized and treated. It is believed that this occurs as a result of cancer cells switching their glucose metabolism from an oxidative oxygen- dependent pathway towards a glycolytic phenotype, also known as the ""Warburg effect"". Though rare, it is important to consider this entity in the differential diagnosis of type B lactic acidosis since prompt identification and treatment may help improve outcomes in this otherwise fatal process. We present a case of type B lactic acidosis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia along with a brief review of the literature.","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville Health Sciences Center Louisville, Kentucky, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville Health Sciences Center Louisville, Kentucky, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville Health Sciences Center Louisville, Kentucky, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville Health Sciences Center Louisville, Kentucky, USA.']",,PMC4497494,['NOTNLM'],"['Lactic acidosis', 'hematologic emergency', 'malignancy']",,,20150615,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correlations between the BAALC gene expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis were analyzed. A total of 15 studies were examined. The pooled results suggest that high BAALC expression had an unfavorable outcome in AML. The combined hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) was 1.53 and the summary HR for the disease-free survival rate was 1.64. In addition, subgroup analyses considering cytogenetic and survival analysis were also conducted. High BAALC gene expression appeared to be an adverse prognostic indicator in patients with cytogenetically normal AML (HR for OS, 1.43) and in subgroups of survival analysis with multivariate analysis (HR for OS, 2.35). These results indicate that high BAALC gene expression served as an independent poor prognostic indicator in adult patients with AML.","['Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian 350001, P.R.

A literature search was performed through PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the selected studies. The I(2) index was used to evaluate heterogeneity and the outcome was measured as the odds ratio (OR) by the random-effects model. A total of 16 case-control studies were included. All the studies were of high quality. The OR for ALL was 0.90 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-1.19; P=0.45; I(2)=79%]. The OR for AML was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.08; P=0.19; I(2)=8%).

It has been suggested that leukemia stem cells (LSCs), a small pool of self-renewing leukemic cells, play important roles in development of chemotherapy resistance. The expression of cluster of differentiation 96 (CD96), a potential marker for LSCs, was investigated in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells of 105 acute leukemia (AL) patients by flow cytometry. The data showed that all the CD34(+), CD34(+)CD38(-) and CD34(+)CD38(-)CD96(+) proportions were much higher in AL compared to the normal control (P<0.01), while a clear difference was identified in the CD34(+)CD38(-) and CD34(+)CD38(-)CD96(+) proportions between acute lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, all the AML patients with >15% CD34(+)CD38(-) cells achieved complete remission (CR), suggesting that as an LSC-rich population, the amount of CD34(+)CD38(-) cells may not be positively associated with the proportion of refractory LSCs. The mean percentage of the co-presence of CD96 expression itself was similar in AML patients with CR and non-CR (P>0.05). However, the CR rate was significantly higher in the AML population with <10% CD96 expressed, which indicated that a distinct sub-group of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD96(+) cells may still contribute to the drug resistance or poor prognosis.","['Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, P.R.

In the present study, the signaling of the cytotoxic effects induced by As4S4 on retinoic acid-resistant APL NB4-R1 cells was investigated. A time-dependent increase in cell death and DNA cleavage was observed following As4S4 treatment. Changes in B-cell lymphoma 2 and Bax accompanied by the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase were observed as actions of As4S4. As4S4 induced an accumulation of NB4-R1 cells in the S and G2/M phases, as detected by flow cytometry.

Monoclonal proteins are seen in a significant proportion of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is a clonal disorder of mature B cells. The use of more sensitive laboratory methods has enabled the detection of monoclonal proteins or light chains in the serum and/or urine in the majority of these patients. The presence of some of these monoclonal proteins may explain the different autoimmune phenomena that are associated with this disease. Some reports indicate that the finding of monoclonal proteins has a negative impact on patients' survival. The presence of two different monoclonal proteins (i.e. biclonal gammopathy) is on the other hand rare. Most of the reported cases in the literature are of patients with plasma cell disorders. In this report, we describe a rare occurrence of biclonal gammopathy in a patient with CLL. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, which were negative at the time of initial diagnosis, showed biclonal immunoglobin A (IgA) kappa and IgA lambda during the course of the disease. The patient's disease showed steady progression, despite multiple treatments. Although this could just be the result of using more sensitive laboratory techniques, biclonal gammopathy in this patient likely reflects the evolution of another clone, which would explain the encountered resistance to therapy. Because of paucity of reports, the impact of biclonal gammopathies in such patients is not known and an effort to collectively report the presentation and outcome of these patients is needed to further understand the pathophysiology and clinical significance of such a finding.","['Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.']",,PMC4459156,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Leukemia, Chronic Lymphocytic', 'Paraproteinemias']","['10.5001/omj.2015.45 [doi]', 'OMJ-D-14-00125 [pii]']",10.5001/omj.2015.45 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of MDS with myelofibrosis remains problematic and the prognosis is poor in these patients, particularly following transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The current study presents the case of a 28-year-old male diagnosed with MDS associated with myelofibrosis, together with hypocellular bone marrow features. Following induction chemotherapy consisting of mitoxantrone and cytarabine, the patient achieved complete remission, but developed severe myelofibrosis. The patient relapsed and the disease transformed into AML 12 months later. However, the extent of the myelofibrosis was markedly alleviated upon administration of a FLAG regimen that consisted of fludarabine, cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor during the AML transformation. After one course of the FLAG regimen, the patient achieved a second complete remission. As there was no suitable donor for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the patient relapsed and succumbed shortly after. In conclusion, MDS with fibrosis is an aggressive disease, but the degree of myelofibrosis may not be associated with the progression of hypocellular MDS, and allogeneic HSCT remains a potentially curative option for affected patients.","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhongshan, Guangdong 528403, P.R.

The levels of serum VEGF in patients with hematological disorders were significantly increased compared with the levels in the healthy controls. The levels of BM VEGF and BM-MVD in AML patients were significantly higher compared with the levels in the patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or anemia. Following chemotherapy, the levels of serum VEGF significantly increased and the levels of BM VEGF decreased in the AML patients, regardless of their therapeutic responses, compared with the levels prior to treatment. By contrast, the levels of BM-MVD in the AML patients were significantly reduced in the patients that completely recovered from AML (AML-DFS group), compared with those in other groups. The present data indicate that the levels of BM-MVD are valuable for evaluating the status of AML.","['Cancer Center, The First Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130021, P.R.

The present study therefore aimed to evaluate whether the expression levels of CD44 and the associated pathway components are associated with the survival rate of elderly patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A total of 20 elderly patients diagnosed with refractory AML were divided into two groups, following induction chemotherapy: Complete remission (CR, n=9) and non-remission (NR. n=11). Bone marrow biopsy specimens were collected, expression levels of CD44, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and the captured images were analyzed in a blinded manner using Image Pro Plus software, version 6.0. The overall survival rates (OS) of the patients were then analyzed with log rank, and the correlation between CD44, PTEN, mTOR and NF-kappaB expression levels and patients survival rates were statistically analyzed using Pearson's method. Significant differences were observed between the CR and NR groups for PTEN (P=0.025) and CD44 (P=0.020) expression levels. Positive CD44 expression was significantly correlated with poor overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 6.281 (95% CI, 1.78-22.12; P=0.0042). The mean OS was 4.00 months for patients that demonstrated positive CD44 expression, compared with 9.27 months for patients that demonstrated negative CD44 expression. A tendency towards reduced survival rates was also observed in patients negative for PTEN expression, when compared with that of PTEN-positive patients. The mean OS was 4.81 months in PTEN-negative patients vs. 8.8 months in PTEN-positive patients, with a hazard ratio of 2.689 (95%CI, 0.89-8.08; P=0.078). Patients that exhibited PTEN-positive and CD44-negative expression, survived significantly longer than patients that demonstrated PTEN-negative and CD44-positive expression (mean OS, 9.86 vs 2.67 months; hazard ratio=0.037; 95% CI, 0.006-0.222, P=0.0006). The expression levels of NF-kappaB and mTOR were slightly increased in the NR group compared with those of the CR group, although no significant differences were identified. PTEN and CD44 expression levels demonstrated trends towards negative correlation. In conclusion, the expression levels of CD44 and PTEN may be useful markers to predict the prognosis of elderly patients with refractory AML.","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100700, P.R.

Epub 2015 May 6.,"Src is a tyrosine kinase that is of significance in tumor biology. The present review focuses on Src, its molecular structure, and role in cancer, in addition to its expression and function in sarcoma. In addition, the feasibility of Src as a potential drug target for the treatment of sarcoma is also discussed. Previous studies have suggested that Src has essential functions in cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, metastasis and the tumor microenvironment. Thus, it may be a potential target for cancer therapy. Src has been found to enhance proliferation, reduce apoptosis and promote metastasis in certain subtypes of sarcoma, including osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. Furthermore, a number of novel effective therapeutic agents, such as SI-83, which target Src have been investigated in vitro and in vivo. Bosutinib and dasatinib, which inhibit Src, have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. In addition, vandetanib is approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer. Furthermore, the Src inhibitor, saracatinib, is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors, including breast and lung cancers. Thus, Src is considered to be an important factor in sarcoma progression and may present a novel clinical therapeutic target. This review demonstrates the importance and clinical relevance of Src in sarcoma, and discusses a number of small molecular inhibitors of src kinase, such as dasatinib and sarcatinib, which are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of sarcoma patients.","[""Department of Orthopedics, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200072, P.R.

Epub 2015 Jun 10.,"Tumor suppressor functions are essential to control cellular proliferation, to activate the apoptosis or senescence pathway to eliminate unwanted cells, to link DNA damage signals to cell cycle arrest checkpoints, to activate appropriate DNA repair pathways, and to prevent the loss of adhesion to inhibit initiation of metastases. Therefore, tumor suppressor genes are indispensable to maintaining genetic and genomic integrity. Consequently, inactivation of tumor suppressors by somatic mutations or epigenetic mechanisms is frequently associated with tumor initiation and development. In contrast, reactivation of tumor suppressor functions can effectively reverse the transformed phenotype and lead to cell cycle arrest or death of cancerous cells and be used as a therapeutic strategy. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is an aggressive lymphoproliferative disease associated with infection of CD4 T cells by the Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 (HTLV-I). HTLV-I-associated T-cell transformation is the result of a multistep oncogenic process in which the virus initially induces chronic T-cell proliferation and alters cellular pathways resulting in the accumulation of genetic defects and the deregulated growth of virally infected cells. This review will focus on the current knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms regulating the inactivation of tumor suppressors in the pathogenesis of HTLV-I.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']",,PMC4478360,,,['10.1155/2015/183590 [doi]'],10.1155/2015/183590 [doi],20150610,['R01 CA106258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous in vitro studies in human hematopoietic progenitor cells have suggested that arsenic may inhibit erythroid differentiation. However, these effects were all observed in the presence of arsenic compounds, while the concomitant cytostatic and cytotoxic actions of arsenic might mask a prodifferentiating activity. To eliminate the potential impacts of the cytostatic and cytotoxic actions of arsenic, we adopted a novel protocol by pretreating human bone marrow CD34+ cells with a low, noncytotoxic concentration of arsenic trioxide, followed by assaying the colony forming activities in the absence of the arsenic compound. Bone marrow specimens were obtained from chronic myeloid leukemia patients who achieved complete cytogenetic remission. CD34+ cells were isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting. We discovered that arsenic trioxide enhanced the erythroid colony forming activity, which was accompanied by a decrease in the granulomonocytic differentiation function. Moreover, in erythroleukemic K562 cells, we showed that arsenic trioxide inhibited erythrocyte maturation, suggesting that arsenic might have biphasic effects on erythropoiesis. In conclusion, our data provided the first evidence showing that arsenic trioxide could prime human hematopoietic progenitor cells for enhanced erythroid differentiation.","['Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China ; Department of Oncology and Pathology (CCK), R8:03, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, 17176 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.']",,PMC4480244,,,['10.1155/2015/751013 [doi]'],10.1155/2015/751013 [doi],20150611,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reconstitution of RhoH expression limits HCL pathogenesis in a mouse model, indicating this could represent a new therapeutic strategy. However, while RhoH reconstitution is theoretically possible as a therapy, it is technically immensely challenging as an appropriately functional RhoH protein needs to be specifically targeted. Because of this problem, we sought to identify druggable proteins on the HCL surface that were dependent upon RhoH underexpression. One such protein was identified as CD38. Analysis of 51 HCL patients demonstrated that 18 were CD38-positive. Interrogation of the clinical record of 23 relapsed HCL patients demonstrated those that were CD38-positive had a mean time to salvage therapy 71 months shorter than patients who were CD38-negative. Knockout of the CD38 gene in HCL cells increased apoptosis, inhibited adherence to endothelial monolayers, and compromised ability to produce tumors in vivo. Furthermore, an anti-CD38 antibody proved effective against pre-existing HCL tumors. Taken together, our data indicate that CD38 expression in HCL drives poor prognosis by promoting survival and heterotypic adhesion. Our data also indicate that CD38-positive HCL patients might benefit from treatments based on CD38 targeting.","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale UMR-S1172, Centre Jean-Pierre Aubert, Institut pour la Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille and Universite de Lille, Lille, France.', 'Kabara Cancer Research Institute, Gundersen Medical Foundation, La Crosse, Wisconsin.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale UMR-S1172, Centre Jean-Pierre Aubert, Institut pour la Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille and Universite de Lille, Lille, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale UMR-S1172, Centre Jean-Pierre Aubert, Institut pour la Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille and Universite de Lille, Lille, France.', ""Department of Biology, Saint Mary's University of Minnesota, Winona, Minnesota."", 'Department of Pathology, Gundersen Health System, La Crosse, Wisconsin.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale UMR-S1172, Centre Jean-Pierre Aubert, Institut pour la Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille and Universite de Lille, Lille, France.

Aggressive chemoimmunotherapy regimens recommended to achieve remission and improve survival in young, fit patients are often poorly tolerated in elderly and/or less physiologically fit (""unfit"") patients, necessitating alternative treatment options. Although patient age, fitness, and comorbidities are key considerations in the selection of a treatment regimen, historically, clinical trials have been limited to young, fit patients by virtue of the ethical concerns associated with potential end organ toxic effects that could worsen comorbidities. However, the availability of new therapies promises a shift to a research paradigm that encompasses the identification of optimal treatments for elderly and unfit patients. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy, which overall has improved response rates and survival in patients with CLL, has only recently been evaluated elderly and unfit patients. B cell-targeted agents such as the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor idelalisib are the first of a new generation of oral agents for CLL. Available clinical data suggest that these therapies have the potential to address the unmet need in elderly and unfit patients with CLL and result in clinical remission, and not merely symptom palliation and improved quality of life, which, by themselves, are also a reasonable goal.","['Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine and the North Shore-LIJ Cancer Institute, Lake Success, NY, USA. krai@nshs.edu.', 'CLL Research & Treatment Program, NSLIJ Health System, Suite 212, 410 Lakeville Road, New Hyde Park, NY, 11042, USA. krai@nshs.edu.']",,PMC4522086,,,"['10.1186/s13045-015-0165-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-015-0165-x [pii]']",10.1186/s13045-015-0165-x [doi],20150714,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently identified p21-activated kinase (PAK1) as a downstream effector molecule of H2.0-like homeobox (HLX), a gene functionally relevant for AML pathogenesis. In this study, we find that inhibition of PAK1 activity by small molecule inhibitors or by RNA interference leads to profound leukemia inhibitory effects both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of PAK1 induces differentiation and apoptosis of AML cells through downregulation of the MYC oncogene and a core network of MYC target genes. Importantly, we find that inhibition of PAK1 inhibits primary human leukemic cells including immature leukemic stem cell-enriched populations. Moreover, we find that PAK1 upregulation occurs during disease progression and is relevant for patient survival in MDS. Our studies highlight PAK1 as a novel target in AML and MDS and support the use of PAK1 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy in these diseases.","['Departments of Cell Biology and of Medicine, Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Departments of Cell Biology and of Medicine, Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Departments of Cell Biology and of Medicine, Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Departments of Cell Biology and of Medicine, Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Departments of Cell Biology and of Medicine, Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Departments of Cell Biology and of Medicine, Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; and.', 'Cancer Biology Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Departments of Cell Biology and of Medicine, Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Departments of Cell Biology and of Medicine, Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;']","['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)']",PMC4551362,,,"['S0006-4971(20)30979-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-12-618801 [doi]']",10.1182/blood-2014-12-618801 [doi],20150713,"['C029154/PHS HHS/United States', 'P30CA013330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30HL122085/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142928/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA142928/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA166429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM007491/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F30HL117545/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 HL117545/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 HL122085/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007491/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM007288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

F14512 is currently in a phase I/II clinical trial in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The aim of this study was to investigate F14512 potential in a new clinical indication. Because of the many similarities between human and dog lymphomas, we sought to determine the tolerance, efficacy, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship of F14512 in this indication, and potential biomarkers that could be translated into human trials. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-three dogs with stage III-IV naturally occurring lymphomas were enrolled in the phase I dose-escalation trial, which consisted of three cycles of F14512 i.v. injections. Endpoints included safety and therapeutic efficacy. Serial blood samples and tumor biopsies were obtained for PK/PD and biomarker studies. RESULTS: Five dose levels were evaluated to determine the recommended dose. F14512 was well tolerated, with the expected dose-dependent hematologic toxicity. F14512 induced an early decrease of tumoral lymph node cells, and a high response rate of 91% (21/23) with 10 complete responses, 11 partial responses, 1 stable disease, and 1 progressive disease. Phosphorylation of histone H2AX was studied as a potential PD biomarker of F14512. CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrated that F14512 can be safely administered to dogs with lymphoma resulting in strong therapeutic efficacy. Additional evaluation of F14512 is needed to compare its efficacy with standards of care in dogs, and to translate biomarker and efficacy findings into clinical trials in humans.","[""Oncovet Clinical Research, SIRIC ONCOLille, Avenue Paul Langevin, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France."", ""Oncovet Clinical Research, SIRIC ONCOLille, Avenue Paul Langevin, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France."", ""Oncovet Clinical Research, SIRIC ONCOLille, Avenue Paul Langevin, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France.

Epub 2015 Jul 11.,"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is caused by human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1 infection and is one of the most refractory malignant T-cell lymphomas. Improvement of ATL therapy options requires the establishment of appropriate ATL animal models. In this study, we successfully generated an ATL mouse model by xenotransplantation of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from ATL patients (ATL cells) into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency/Jak3-null mice (NOJ mice). To generate the model, the ATL S1T cell line was subcutaneously injected into mice. Primary ATL cells were then transplanted subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, or intravenously. ATL cells infiltrated multiple organs, and elevated human soluble interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) levels were detected in peripheral blood. Injection of one million primary ATL cells was needed for successful engraftment into host mice. Thawed cells, frozen long-term in liquid nitrogen, could also be transplanted; however, more cells were required to achieve similar results. The median mouse survival time was proportional to the number of cells injected. Successful secondary transplantation of ATL cells from one NOJ mouse into another was achieved and confirmed by T-cell receptor analysis. Finally, we examined the effects of the antioxide pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) as an antitumor agent in vivo. PDTC administration inhibited the increase of soluble IL-2R and improved mouse survival, suggesting that this compound has potential as an anti-ATL agent.

Epub 2015 Jul 13.,"The transcription factor STAT3 is constitutively active in many cancers, where it mediates important biological effects, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and angiogenesis. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of STAT3 performs multiple functions, such as cooperative DNA binding, nuclear translocation, and protein-protein interactions. However, it is unclear which subsets of STAT3 target genes depend on the NTD for transcriptional regulation. To identify such genes, we compared gene expression in STAT3-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) stably expressing wild-type STAT3 or STAT3 from which NTD was deleted. NTD deletion reduced the cytokine-induced expression of specific STAT3 target genes by decreasing STAT3 binding to their regulatory regions. To better understand the potential mechanisms of this effect, we determined the crystal structure of the STAT3 NTD and identified a dimer interface responsible for cooperative DNA binding in vitro. We also observed an Ni(2+)-mediated oligomer with an as yet unknown biological function. Mutations on both dimer and Ni(2+)-mediated interfaces affected the cytokine induction of STAT3 target genes. These studies shed light on the role of the NTD in transcriptional regulation by STAT3 and provide a structural template with which to design STAT3 NTD inhibitors with potential therapeutic value.","['Center for Proteomic Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA Postdoctoral Program, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Center for Proteomic Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Biophysical Collaborative Access Team/Illinois Institute of Technology, Sector 18ID (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory), Lemont, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Center for Proteomic Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA rajiv.chopra@novartis.com david_frank@dfci.harvard.edu.', ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Biophysical Collaborative Access Team/Illinois Institute of Technology, Sector 18ID (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory), Lemont, Illinois, USA Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA rajiv.chopra@novartis.com david_frank@dfci.harvard.edu.""]","['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",PMC4561728,,,"['MCB.00060-15 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00060-15 [doi]']",10.1128/MCB.00060-15 [doi],20150713,"['R01-CA160979/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007226/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 GM103622/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA160979/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA180340-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM007226/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA180340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Epub 2015 Jul 13.,"PURPOSE: There are limited data on health care use among survivors of young adult cancers. We aimed to describe patterns of hospitalization among a cohort of long-term survivors compared with noncancer controls. METHODS: Persons diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 44 years with malignancies in Ontario, Canada, from 1992 to 1999, who lived at least 5 years recurrence free, were identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry and matched to noncancer controls. Hospitalizations were determined using hospital discharges, and rates were compared between survivors and controls. The absolute excess rate of hospitalizations was determined for each type of malignancy in survivors per 100 person-years of follow-up. RESULTS: The cohort included 20,275 survivors and 101,344 noncancer controls. During the study period, 6,948 (34.3%) survivors were admitted to the hospital and the adjusted relative rate (ARR) of hospitalizations in survivors compared with controls was 1.51 (95% CI, 1.48 to 1.54). The rate of hospitalization was highest for survivors of upper GI, leukemia, and urologic malignancies. The hospitalization rate (per person) for survivors significantly decreased from 0.22 in the first time period examined (5 to 8 years after diagnosis) to 0.15 in the last time period examined (18 to 20 years after diagnosis, P < .0001). However, at all time periods, survivors were more likely to be hospitalized than controls (ARR at 5 to 8 years, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.57 to 1.81]; ARR at 18 to 20 years, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.08 to 1.37]). CONCLUSION: Survivors of young adult cancers have an increased rate of hospitalization compared with controls. The rate of hospitalization for 20-year survivors did not return to baseline, indicating a substantial and persistent burden of late effects among this generally young population.","[""Devon P.

Epub 2015 Jul 13.,"PURPOSE: To update the 2006 American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline on the use of hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). METHODS: The American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an Update Committee and conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews from October 2005 through September 2014. Guideline recommendations were based on the review of the evidence by the Update Committee. RESULTS: Changes to previous recommendations include the addition of tbo-filgrastim and filgrastim-sndz, moderation of the recommendation regarding routine use of CSFs in older patients with diffuse aggressive lymphoma, and addition of recommendations against routine dose-dense chemotherapy in lymphoma and in favor of high-dose-intensity chemotherapy in urothelial cancer. The Update Committee did not address recommendations regarding use of CSFs in acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes in adults. RECOMMENDATIONS: Prophylactic use of CSFs to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia is warranted when the risk of febrile neutropenia is approximately 20% or higher and no other equally effective and safe regimen that does not require CSFs is available. Primary prophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of febrile neutropenia in patients who are at high risk on the basis of age, medical history, disease characteristics, and myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy regimen. Dose-dense regimens that require CSFs should only be used within an appropriately designed clinical trial or if supported by convincing efficacy data. Current recommendations for the management of patients exposed to lethal doses of total-body radiotherapy, but not doses high enough to lead to certain death as a result of injury to other organs, include the prompt administration of CSFs.","['Thomas J.

This study addresses the associations between residential UV exposure at diagnosis and the incidence of types and subtypes of CHM, by age and gender, in France, over a long period, on the fine scale of the 36,326 Communes that constitute mainland France. METHODS: The 9,082 cases of acute leukemia and 3,563 cases of lymphoma diagnosed before the age of 15 years from 1990 to 2009 were provided by the French National Registry of Childhood Hematological Malignancies. The incidence of CHM was calculated by Commune, year, age and gender and expressed as the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). UV data from 1988 to 2007 were extracted from the EUROSUN database. RESULTS: The annual daily average UV exposure of the children ranged from 85.5 to 137.8 J/cm(2). For each additional 25 J/cm(2), there was a significant increase in precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PBC-ALL) in children aged less than 5 years (SIR 1.18; 95% CI 1.10-1.27). Further analysis of PBC-ALL in the young children suggested a better fit of models with a threshold, with the risk increasing above 100 J/cm(2), for which the SIR was 1.24 (95% CI 1.14-1.36) for a 25 J/cm(2) increase. The results remained stable in analyses stratifying by deprivation index or degree of urbanization of the Communes. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that higher residential UV exposure may be positively associated with a higher incidence of PBC-ALL in early childhood.","['INSERM, UMR1153 Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Research Center (CRESS), Epidemiology of Chilhood and Adolescent Cancers Team (EPICEA), Paris Descartes University, 94007, Villejuif, France, astrid.coste@inserm.fr.']",,,,,['10.1007/s10552-015-0629-x [doi]'],10.1007/s10552-015-0629-x [doi],20150714,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A common modification of sialic acids is 9-O-acetylation, which has been implicated in sialoglycan recognition, ganglioside biology, and the survival and drug resistance of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. Despite many functional implications, the molecular basis of 9-O-acetylation has remained elusive thus far. Following cellular approaches, including selective gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas genome editing, we here show that CASD1--a previously identified human candidate gene--is essential for sialic acid 9-O-acetylation. In vitro assays with the purified N-terminal luminal domain of CASD1 demonstrate transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-coenzyme A to CMP-activated sialic acid and formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate. Our study provides direct evidence that CASD1 is a sialate O-acetyltransferase and serves as key enzyme in the biosynthesis of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans.","['Institute of Cellular Chemistry, Hannover Medical School, D-30623 Hannover, Germany.', 'Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Institute of Cellular Chemistry, Hannover Medical School, D-30623 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Cellular Chemistry, Hannover Medical School, D-30623 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Cellular Chemistry, Hannover Medical School, D-30623 Hannover, Germany.', 'Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Virology Division, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Institute of Cellular Chemistry, Hannover Medical School, D-30623 Hannover, Germany.']","['0 (Sialic Acids)', '55717-54-9 (9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.45 (CasD1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.8 (alpha-N-acetylneuraminate alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase)']",PMC4510713,,,"['ncomms8673 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms8673 [doi]']",10.1038/ncomms8673 [doi],20150714,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, development of effective MDR reversing agents is an important approach in the clinic. The present study revealed that BME, a novel compound of anthraquinone, elevated intracellular accumulation of the P-gp substrates and reduced concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of cell growth (IC50) values for doxorubicin (DOX) in doxorubicin-resistant human myelogenous leukemia (K562/DOX) cells. Further more, BME was also reported to down regulated P-gp expression accompanying with generation of nontoxic low level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS) and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 as well as c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK). However, treatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), U0216 and SP600125 almost abolished actions of the BME mentioned above. These results indicated that the effect of the BME on the P-gp may be involved in generation of nontoxic low level of iROS and activation of ERK1/2 or JNK, which suggested valuable clues to screen and develop P-gp reversing agents.","['Key Laboratory of Natural Medicine and Immune Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng 475001, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Natural Medicine and Immune Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng 475001, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Natural Medicine and Immune Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng 475001, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Natural Medicine and Immune Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng 475001, China.

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins associate with the p16 locus in a long non-coding RNA, ANRIL-dependent manner, leading to repression of p16 transcription. YB1, a transcription factor, also represses the p16 transcription through direct association with its promoter region. Conversely, the transcription factors Ets1/2 and histone H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 directly bind to the p16 locus and mediate p16 induction during replicative and premature senescence. In the present review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms by which these factors regulate p16 transcription.","['Department of Biological and Environmental Chemistry, Faculty of Humanity-Oriented Science and Engineering, Kinki University, Fukuoka, Japan ykotake@fuk.kindai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Biological and Environmental Chemistry, Faculty of Humanity-Oriented Science and Engineering, Kinki University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Biological and Environmental Chemistry, Faculty of Humanity-Oriented Science and Engineering, Kinki University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Biological and Environmental Chemistry, Faculty of Humanity-Oriented Science and Engineering, Kinki University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Biological and Environmental Chemistry, Faculty of Humanity-Oriented Science and Engineering, Kinki University, Fukuoka, Japan.']","['0 (CDKN2B antisense RNA, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (ETS2 protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Y-Box-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (YBX1 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ANRIL', 'CDK inhibitor', 'Cell cycle', 'MLL', 'p16', 'polycomb', 'review', 'transcription']",['35/8/4397 [pii]'],,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prospective studies of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) have revealed that chemosensitivity at allo-SCT is the most reliable predictor of outcome; however, limited data are available for progressive/refractory disease. We report here a retrospective analysis of RIC allo-SCT for patients with FL. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of allo-SCT for patients with relapsed/refractory FL. We analyzed 46 patients-11 (24%) transplanted in CR, 6 (13%) transplanted in PR and 29 (63%) with progressive/refractory disease. The estimated 5-year overall survival rate was 71.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 51.5-84.5%). According to the disease status at transplantation, the 5-year survival rate was 80.7% (95% CI, 37.7-95.4%) in the patients with CR or PR and 66.1% (95% CI, 41.5-82.3%) in those with progressive/refractory disease (P=0.29). There were no differences in relapse/progression and non-relapse mortality between the patients with chemosensitive disease and progressive/refractory disease. Allo-SCT may be a valuable treatment option, even for patients with progressive/refractory FL.","['Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Clinical Cell Biology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba Aoba Municipal Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Narita Red Cross Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,"['bmt2015158 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2015.158 [doi]']",10.1038/bmt.2015.158 [doi],20150713,,,,,,,,,,['Kanto Study Group for Cell Therapy (KSGCT)'],,,,,,,,,,

This single-center retrospective study investigated the influence of pre-transplant characteristics on outcomes of 387 patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for AML in CR1 and CR2. The multivariable analysis model for overall survival (OS) included age (hazard ratio (HR)=2.24 for ages 31-64 years and HR=3.23 for age 65 years compared with age 30 years, P=0.003), remission status (HR=1.49 for CR2 compared with CR1, P=0.005) and HCT-CI score (HR=1.47 for 3 compared with <3, P=0.005). Transplant year was significantly associated with OS (P=0.001) but this did not influence the model. A weighted score was developed with age 30, CR1 and HCT-CI score <3 receiving 0 points each, and CR2 and HCT-CI score 3 receiving 1 point each. Ages 31-64 received 2 points, age 65 received 3 points. Scores were grouped as follows: scores 0-1 (low risk, n=36), score 2 (intermediate-low risk, n=147), score 3 (intermediate-high risk, n=141) and scores 4-5 (high risk, n=63) with 3-year OS of 71%, 55%, 42% and 29% for scores 0-1, 2, 3 and 4-5, respectively (P<0.0001). The score predicted nonrelapse mortality (P=0.03) but not cumulative incidence of relapse (P=0.18). This model should be validated for the pre-HCT assessment of AML patients in CR1 and CR2.","['Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,,,,"['bmt2015165 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2015.165 [doi]']",10.1038/bmt.2015.165 [doi],20150713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selective expression of a short (30-kDa) CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha) translational isoform, termed p30, represents the most common type of CEBPA mutation in AML. The molecular mechanisms underlying p30-mediated transformation remain incompletely understood. We show that C/EBPalpha p30, but not the normal p42 isoform, preferentially interacts with Wdr5, a key component of SET/MLL (SET-domain/mixed-lineage leukemia) histone-methyltransferase complexes. Accordingly, p30-bound genomic regions were enriched for MLL-dependent H3K4me3 marks. The p30-dependent increase in self-renewal and inhibition of myeloid differentiation required Wdr5, as downregulation of the latter inhibited proliferation and restored differentiation in p30-dependent AML models. OICR-9429 is a new small-molecule antagonist of the Wdr5-MLL interaction. This compound selectively inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation in p30-expressing human AML cells. Our data reveal the mechanism of p30-dependent transformation and establish the essential p30 cofactor Wdr5 as a therapeutic target in CEBPA-mutant AML.","['CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Drug Discovery Program, Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, ON, M5G 0A3, Canada.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'MRC Molecular Hematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford OX3 9DS, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam 3015 GE, The Netherlands.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Drug Discovery Program, Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, ON, M5G 0A3, Canada.', 'Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5S 3M2, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'Drug Discovery Program, Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, ON, M5G 0A3, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Core Facility Genomics, Core Facilities, Medical University Vienna, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), Vienna 1030, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1090, Austria.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Drug Discovery Program, Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, ON, M5G 0A3, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam 3015 GE, The Netherlands.', 'MRC Molecular Hematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford OX3 9DS, United Kingdom.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna 1090, Austria.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Dihydropyridines)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (OICR-9429)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (WDR5 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",PMC4511833,,,['10.1038/nchembio.1859 [doi]'],10.1038/nchembio.1859 [doi],20150713,"['092809/Z/10/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0701761/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '106169/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '11-0724/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/7/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900892/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['EMS63643'],,,['Nat Chem Biol. 2015 Aug;11(8):552-4.

However, Pneumocystis jirovecii colonization can also be detected in healthy individuals and in patients with various underlying lung diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunocompetent and iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients in terms of PCP and P.jirovecii colonization. A total of 92 patients (66 male, 26 female; age range: 18-93 years, median: 58.5) who underwent bronchoscopy due to various pulmonary symptoms between January 2011-April 2014, were included in the study. Of these patients, 65 were under immunosuppressive therapy (38 were treated with anti-cancer drugs, 15 with anti-rejection/immunomodulatory drugs and 12 with corticosteroids), while 27 were immunocompetent. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were evaluated for the presence of P.jirovecii mitochondrial gene coding ribosomal large subunit (mtLSUrRNA) with nested PCR (nPCR) method. All of the samples were also examined by Giemsa and Gomori's methenamine silver (GMG) staining methods. P.jirovecii DNA was detected in 31 (33.7%) out of 92 BAL samples by nPCR. Although six immunosuppressed patients were positive in the first round of amplification, 26 of 65 (40%) immunosuppressed and five of 27 (18.5%) immunocompetent patients were positive with nPCR. P.jirovecii cysts and trophozoites were detected in only five (16.1%) of the 31 nPCR positive samples. The probability of being immunosuppressive among nPCR positive cases was statistically higher than nPCR negative cases (chi(2)= 3.940; p= 0.047). This difference was more significant in organ transplant recipients and patients under anti-rejection/immunomodulatory treatment (chi(2)= 6.715, p= 0.01; chi(2)= 5.550, p= 0.018, respectively). When clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of nPCR positive patients were considered, five patients (2 kidney transplant, 1 bone marrow transplant, 1 interstitial lung disease and 1 lung cancer case) in immunosuppressed group were interpreted as ""definite PCP"" and eight patients (2 kidney transplant, 1 leukemia, 1 connective tissue disease, 1 Wegener's granulomatosus, 2 rheumatoid arthritis and 1 lung cancer case) were interpreted as ""probable PCP"". Other 18 (19.6%) nPCR positive patients, of them 13 were immunosuppressive and five were immunocompetent, were considered as ""P.jirovecii colonization"". The colonization rate was determined as 50% (13/26) in immunosuppressive patients, and was mostly detected in patients with hematological malignancies (4/13), followed by patients with solid tumors (3/13) and organ transplantations (3/13). On the other hand, all of the nPCR positive immunocompetent patients (5/5) were evaluated as colonization. In this study significant data was obtained about P.jirovecii epidemiology in our country. Our results also showed that iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients are under risk of PCP and nPCR method is more sensitive than conventional PCR and classical staining methods in the diagnosis of these patients.","['Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Parasitology, Izmir Turkey. soykan.ozkoc@deu.edu.tr.']","['0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",,,,['10.5578/mb.9344 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,Iyatrojenik immunosupresif ve immunokompetan hastalarda Pneumocystis jirovecii pnomonisi ve kolonizasyonunun arastirilmasi.,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 9.,"Oscillating field stimulation (OFS) has been used in attempts to treat spinal cord injury (SCI) and has been shown to improve remyelination after SCI in rats. However, some controversies regarding the effects of OFS have been presented in previous papers. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the main cell for remyelination and are derived from the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). To date, it has been unclear whether the differentiation of OPCs can be regulated by OFS. The goal of this study was to determine if OFS can improve the differentiation of OPCs and promote the recovery of neurological function after SCI in rats. Immature and mature OLs were observed in spinal cord slices through immunofluorescence staining. Levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores and transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials (tcMMEPs) were used to evaluate the locomotor outcomes of rats after SCI. Our results showed a significant improvement in the differentiation of OPCs and the content of ATP and LIF in the injured spinal cord in the OFS group. Furthermore, BBB scores and tcMMEPs were significantly improved in the rats stimulated by OFS. These findings suggest that OFS can improve the differentiation of OPCs and promote the recovery of neurological function following SCI in rats.","['Department of Orthopaedics, The Second Hospital of AnHui Medical University, Furong Road 678, Hefei 230601, Anhui, China.

Epub 2015 Jul 13.,"OBJECTIVES: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have drastically changed the prospects for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommends molecular monitoring of BCR-ABL1 mRNA levels at distinct time points to define an optimal response, warning, or failure of treatment. METHODS: Sixty-four follow-up peripheral blood samples from CML patients on TKI were tested by two methods. Molecular responses based on BCR-ABL1% (IS) from an Xpert((R)) BCR-ABL1 Monitor assay were compared with TaqMan-based qPCR. RESULTS: Seven samples showed 'molecularly undetectable leukaemia' by both methods (11%). In-house qPCR showed 57 BCR-ABL1+ samples; 45/57 samples (79%) were concordant for 'major molecular response' (MMR, n = 32) and 'no MMR' (n = 13) by both assays, whereas nine were BCR-ABL1 negative by Xpert((R)). Identical molecular responses (i.e. 'optimal') were defined in 41 samples. Discordances seen in patients < 10 months on TKI (n = 2) had no impact on clinical management, whereas for patients >12 months on TKI, a different molecular response was defined ('warning' versus 'optimal'). Thirteen samples had 'no MMR' by both methods. 10/13 showed identical intervals (>10%(IS), 1-10%(IS) or 0.1-1%(IS)), corresponding to seven 'failures' and three 'warnings'. Discordant intervals were seen in 3/13 samples (all defined as 'failures'). Deep molecular responses (MR(4.0) or MR(5.0)) with detectable BCR-ABL1 showed some fluctuations between both methods, nevertheless, all had 'optimal' responses. 'Molecularly undetectable leukaemia' was observed more frequently by Xpert((R)) (n = 16) as by our in-house assay (n = 7).

The tumour NK cells usually express brightly the CD56 adhesion molecule and CD94 lectin type killer receptor, and have an activation-related (cytoplasmic CD3epsilon, CD7, CD45RO, HLA-DR) phenotype; in contrast, CD16 and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors are frequently negative, and CD57 expression is almost never observed.

Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) belongs to transforming growth factor beta(TGF-beta) superfamily. The fate determinations of stem cells require complex regulatory networks that involve BMP6 signaling pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that BMP6 plays crucial roles in controlling the self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells. In this review, we address the expression, function and regulation of BMP6 in various kinds of stem cells, with focus on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), germline stem cells (GSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and neural stem cells (NSCs). Notably, there are distinct effects of BMP6 on promoting self-renewal and differentiation of these stem cells. We also discuss the involement of BMP6 in diseases, including leukemia, astrocytic glioma, and Alzheimer's disease, and the therapy of these diseases via gene targeting. We further highlight certain issues for further investigation on the regulation and function of BMP6 in stem cells. Significantly, a thorough understanding of BMP6 regulation on a variety of adult stem cells could make them feasible for applications in both regenerative and reproductive medicine, and it would shed novel insights into the etiology of the diseases and offer new targets for drug design to treat these disorders.","['Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. zupinghe@sjtu.edu.cn.']",['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6)'],,,,"['CPD-EPUB-68758 [pii]', '10.2174/1381612821666150710150218 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors are more likely than healthy peers or siblings to experience academic underachievement, yet little is known about neurocognitive predictors of academic outcomes. OBJECTIVES: Objectives were to compare neurocognitive abilities to age-adjusted standardized norms, examine change over time in neurocognitive abilities, and establish neurocognitive predictors of academic outcomes. METHODS: Seventy-one children were followed over the course of therapy. Cognitive abilities were assessed during induction when the child was in remission (baseline) and annually for 3 years (years 1, 2, and 3). Reading and mathematics abilities were assessed at year 3. RESULTS: Fine motor dexterity was significantly below age-adjusted norms at all data points but showed improvement over time. Baseline visual-motor integration was within the reference range but significantly declined by year 3, and mean scores at years 2 and 3 were significantly below age-adjusted norms. Verbal short-term memory was significantly below age-adjusted norms at all assessments. Visual-motor integration predicted reading and mathematics abilities. Verbal short-term memory predicted reading abilities, and visual short-term memory predicted mathematics abilities. CONCLUSIONS: Central nervous system-directed therapy is associated with specific neurocognitive problems. Visual-spatial skills and verbal and visual short-term memory predict academic outcomes.

These virus/host integrations are detectable using paired-end next generation sequencing. However, the low number of expected true virus integrations may be difficult to distinguish from the noise of many false positive candidates. Here, we propose a novel filtering approach that increases specificity without compromising sensitivity for virus/host chimera detection. Our detection pipeline termed Vy-PER (Virus integration detection bY Paired End Reads) outperforms existing similar tools in speed and accuracy. We analysed whole genome data from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is characterised by genomic rearrangements and usually associated with radiation exposure. This analysis was motivated by the recently reported virus integrations at genomic rearrangement sites and association with chromosomal instability in liver cancer. However, as expected, our analysis of 20 tumour and matched germline genomes from ALL patients finds no significant evidence for integrations by known viruses. Nevertheless, our method eliminates 12,800 false positives per genome (80x coverage) and only our method detects singleton human-phiX174-chimeras caused by optical errors of the Illumina HiSeq platform. This high accuracy is useful for detecting low virus integration levels as well as non-integrated viruses.","['Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Computer Science, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Haematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Lower Saxony, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.']",,PMC4499804,,,"['srep11534 [pii]', '10.1038/srep11534 [doi]']",10.1038/srep11534 [doi],20150713,,,,,,,,,,['UFO Sequencing Consortium within I-BFM Study Group'],,,,,,"['Borkhardt A', 'Fischer U', 'Bourquin JP', 'Rinaldi A', 'Eckert C', 'Forster M', 'Franke A', 'Hornhardt S', 'Korbel JO', 'Sungalee S', 'Lehrach H', 'Risch T', 'Warnatz HJ', 'Yaspo ML', 'Stanulla M']","['Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Fischer, Ute', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Rinaldi, Anna', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Forster, Michael', 'Franke, Andre', 'Hornhardt, Sabine', 'Korbel, Jan O', 'Sungalee, Stephanie', 'Lehrach, Hans', 'Risch, Thomas', 'Warnatz, Hans-Jorg', 'Yaspo, Marie-Laure', 'Stanulla, Martin']",,,

The previous study shows that GLM-7 is a poorly water-soluble drug with low oral bioavailability. In this study, we employed the self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) to improve the oral bioavailability of GLM-7. The GLM-7 SEDDS formulation was prepared using MCT as oil, ovolecithin as surfactant and Transcutol as co-surfactant, and the formulation parameters were optimized by the response surface methodology. The optimized GLM-7 SEDDS formulation showed a stable liquid state, and can automatically emulsify to form the isotropic emulsion once exposure to the water phase. The generated emulsion showed the spherical shape, and had an average size of about 399 nm and a zeta potential of about -42 mV. Compared to the GLM-7 dissolution less than 1.4% from pure GLM-7 powder (reference), the GLM-7 SEDDS formulation could remarkably enhance the in vitro dissolution to 83% in the medium of 0.1N HCL. The in vivo oral bioavailability of GLM-7 SEDDS formulation was investigated in beagle dogs. The results demonstrated that the GLM-7 SEDDS formulation significantly enhanced the plasma concentrations of GLM-7, and the Cmax reached to 878 ng/ml and was 9.2 folds as high as the Cmax 95.85 ng/ml of reference. Moreover, the area under the curve (AUC) of GLM-7 SEDDS formulation was 13.6 times higher than that of reference, which suggested that the SEDDS formulation remarkably increased the oral bioavailability of GLM-7.","['State key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Department of Pharmaceutics, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing 100850, China. gaocs@bmi.ac.cn.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Emulsifying Agents)', '0 (Emulsions)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)']",,,,"['CDD-EPUB-68776 [pii]', '10.2174/1570159x13666150713173838 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These polymorphisms have been related to the risk of suffering different cancers, for example leukemia, breast or gastric cancer, and response to different drugs, among which are methotrexate glutamates, stavudine, and specifically 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), as TYMS is its direct target. A vast literature has been published in relation to 5-FU, even suggesting the sole use of these polymorphisms to effectively manage 5-FU dosage. Estimates of the extent to which these polymorphisms influence in TYMS expression have in the past been based on functional analysis by luciferase assays and quantification of TYMS mRNA, but both these studies, as the association studies with cancer risk or with toxicity or response to 5-FU, are very contradictory. Regarding functional assays, the artificial genetic environment created in luciferase assay and the problems derived from quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs), for example the use of a reference gene, may have distorted the results. To avoid these sources of interference, we have analyzed the allelic imbalance of TYMS by allelic-specific analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients.Allelic imbalance in PBMCs, taken from 40 patients with suspected myeloproliferative haematological diseases, was determined by fluorescent fragment analysis (for the 3'-UTR polymorphism), Sanger sequencing and allelic-specific qPCR in multiplex (for the 5'-UTR polymorphisms).For neither the 3'- nor the 5'-UTR polymorphisms did the observed allelic imbalance exceed 1.5 fold. None of the TYMS polymorphisms is statistically associated with allelic imbalance.The results acquired allow us to deny the previously established assertion of an influence of 2 to 4 fold of the rs45445694 and rs2853542 polymorphisms in the expression of TYMS and narrow its allelic imbalance to 1.5 fold, in our population. These data circumscribe the influence of these polymorphisms in the clinical outcome of 5-FU and question their use for establishing 5-FU dosage, above all when additional genetic factors are not considered.","['From the Grupo de Medicina Xenomica (EB-B, RC, AC), CIBERER, Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, Spain; Fundacion Publica Galega de Medicina Xenomica (AC, FB), SERGAS, Santiago de Compostela, Spain; and Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research (CEGMR) (AC), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, KSA.']","[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", ""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",PMC4504634,,,"['10.1097/MD.0000000000001091 [doi]', '00005792-201507020-00030 [pii]']",10.1097/MD.0000000000001091 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While invasive CXPAs are tumors with a prominent and easily recognizable malignant component, the identification of early carcinomatous changes in PA remains a diagnostic challenge due to the lack of objective morphological criteria. The immunohistochemical expression of Bmi-1 was assessed in both adenomatous and carcinomatous components of 9 CXPA cases at an early phase of histological progression (6 intracapsular and 3 minimally invasive) grouped according to the cellular differentiation as luminal (7 cases) or myoepithelial (2 cases). A selective nuclear expression of Bmi-1 was found exclusively in the malignant component of 8 cases (6 luminal type and 2 myoepithelial type), including intraductal carcinoma areas, except for 1 case in which scarce cells of the remnant PA were positive. Thus, Bmi-1 is expressed from the earliest morphologically detectable stages of PA malignant transformation.

RUNX1 mutations can be early events, creating preleukemic stem cells that expand in the bone marrow. Here we show, counterintuitively, that Runx1-deficient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have a slow growth, low biosynthetic, small cell phenotype and markedly reduced ribosome biogenesis (Ribi). The reduced Ribi involved decreased levels of rRNA and many mRNAs encoding ribosome proteins. Runx1 appears to directly regulate Ribi; Runx1 is enriched on the promoters of genes encoding ribosome proteins and binds the rDNA repeats. Runx1-deficient HSPCs have lower p53 levels, reduced apoptosis, an attenuated unfolded protein response, and accordingly are resistant to genotoxic and ER stress. The low biosynthetic activity and corresponding stress resistance provides a selective advantage to Runx1-deficient HSPCs, allowing them to expand in the bone marrow and outcompete normal HSPCs.","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute for Regenerative Medicine and Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."", 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute for Regenerative Medicine and Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', ""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute for Regenerative Medicine and Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute and Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute for Regenerative Medicine and Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

Epub 2015 Jul 13.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial components of homeostatic and developmental gene regulation. In turn, dysregulation of miRNA expression is a common feature of different types of cancer, which can be harnessed therapeutically. Here we identify miR-139-5p suppression across several cytogenetically defined acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subgroups. The promoter of mir-139 was transcriptionally silenced and could be reactivated by histone deacetylase inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. Restoration of mir-139 expression in cell lines representing the major AML subgroups (t[8;21], inv[16], mixed lineage leukemia-rearranged and complex karyotype AML) caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and in xenograft mouse models in vivo. During normal hematopoiesis, mir-139 is exclusively expressed in terminally differentiated neutrophils and macrophages. Ectopic expression of mir-139 repressed proliferation of normal CD34(+)-hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and perturbed myelomonocytic in vitro differentiation. Mechanistically, mir-139 exerts its effects by repressing the translation initiation factor EIF4G2, thereby reducing overall protein synthesis while specifically inducing the translation of cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1). Knockdown of EIF4G2 recapitulated the effects of mir-139, whereas restoring EIF4G2 expression rescued the mir-139 phenotype. Moreover, elevated miR-139-5p expression is associated with a favorable outcome in a cohort of 165 pediatric patients with AML. Thus, mir-139 acts as a global tumor suppressor-miR in AML by controlling protein translation. As AML cells are dependent on high protein synthesis rates controlling the expression of mir-139 constitutes a novel path for the treatment of AML.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Institute for Toxicology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopitaux universitaires Saint-Louis, St Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), Stichting Kinderoncologie Nederland (SKION), Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Clinic for Pediatrics III, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Biochemistry, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']","['0 (EIF4G2 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G)', '0 (MIRN139 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,,,"['onc2015247 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.247 [doi]']",10.1038/onc.2015.247 [doi],20150713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we attempted to assess whether this drug has a synergistic effect with fludarabine on the apoptosis of CLL cells. Annexin V/PI staining, mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were examined by flow cytometry in short-term cell culture of blood cells from untreated newly diagnosed patients ex vivo. Expression of active caspase-3 and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio for determination of apoptosis were also investigated by flow cytometry and western blot analysis. Our results revealed that the ZGDHu-1 may induce the apoptosis of CLL cells through the mitochondrial pathway and its pro-apoptotic effect is CLL-specific, not affecting normal lymphocytes. Most importantly, a combination of ZGDHu-1 and a non-cytotoxic dose of fludarabine had a synergistic apoptotic effect. To some extent, caspase-3 activation may be involved in the mechanism of the ZGDHu-1 synergistic cytotoxic effect with fludarabine, as well as the cleavage of PARP, consequently leading to apoptosis. Notably, the rate of apoptosis caused by ZGDHu-1 alone or in combination with fludarabine was independent of prognostic markers of CLL disease such as ZAP-70 and CD38 expression or clinical Rai classification stage. In conclusion, ZGDHu-1 exhibited a significant synergistic effect with fludarabine to induce the apoptosis of CLL cells, which implies a possible clinical application.","[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310004, P.R.

Essentially based on a pathognomonic endoscopic appearance, its diagnosis may be unrecognised because mistaken with portal hypertensive gastropathy, while treatment of these two entities is different. Its etiopathogeny remains still unclear, even if it is frequently associated with different systemic illnesses as hepatic cirrhosis, autoimmune disorders and chronic renal failure. The mechanism inducing these vascular ectasia may be linked with mechanical stress on submucosal vessels due to antropyloric peristaltic motility dysfunction modulated by neurohormonal vasoactive alterations. Because medical therapies are not very satisfactory, among the endoscopic modalities, argon plasma coagulation seems to be actually the first-line treatment because the most effective and safe. However, surgical antrectomy may be sometimes necessary. Recently GAVE syndrome appeared as a new adverse reaction of imatinib mesylate, one of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors used in chronic myeloid leukemia, and we report here the observation of such a pathology in one patient treated at the same time by haemodialysis and by imatinib mesylate for chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Service de nephrologie hemodialyse, centre hospitalier de Troyes, 101, avenue Anatole-France, 10003 Troyes cedex, France.

The role of SPARC in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of SPARC protein overproduction in the proliferation and apoptosis of SKM-1 cells, an acute myeloid leukemia cell line transformed from MDS. SKM-1 cells were infected with the pGC-GV-SPARC vector. The cells were then assessed for proliferation and cell death following treatment with low-dose cytosine arabinoside (AraC). The microarray analysis results revealed that samples from SPARCoverexpressed cells compared to SPARC protein, in SKM-1 cells led to proliferation inhibition and promoted programmed cell death and these effects were greater when treated with Ara-C. The mRNA and protein expression levels of SPARC were detected by SPARC overexpression in cells treated with Ara-C resulting in a significant upregulation of the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) gene expression and five other genes. The results showed that the necrotic signaling pathway may play a role when the two conditions were combined via the upregulation of the MLKL protein. MLKL upregulation in SPARC overexpressed cells treated with Ara-C, indicates necrosis as a possible cell death process for the SKM-1 cells under these stringent conditions.","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, P.R.

Indolent B cell lymphomas, most commonly follicular lymphoma but including Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and mantle cell lymphoma, as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are incurable with standard therapy. New treatments are needed. Survival of normal and many abnormal B cells depends on signals through the B-cell receptor, and a key element of this pathway is Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). The oral BTK inhibitor ibrutinib is already US FDA approved in four different indications based on marked treatment benefit in indolent B cell lymphoma/leukemia. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the clinical pharmacology of ibrutinib, its efficacy in clinical trials in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, as well as safety and toxicity. Future directions are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Ibrutinib is a well-tolerated once-daily oral BTK inhibitor with impressive activity in treating indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorders. As a single agent, it is already altering treatment paradigms in its approved indications. Ongoing studies will determine its movement to the front-line setting in these and other B cell disorders, as well as combination approaches.","['Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic , 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH , USA +1 216 444 4366 ; +1 216 444 9464 ; smithm14@ccf.org.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell receptor', ""bruton's tyrosine kinase"", 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma']",['10.1517/14656566.2015.1067302 [doi]'],10.1517/14656566.2015.1067302 [doi],20150713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 9.,"Bcr/Abl fusion protein is a hallmark of human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The protein can activate various signaling pathways to make normal cells transform malignantly and thus to facilitate tumorigenesis. It has been reported that heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) can be served as an anti-apoptotic protein that suppresses Bax and Apo-2L/TRAIL. But it is unclear whether HSP-70 affects AIF-initiated apoptosis in Bcr/Abl expressing cells considering that HSP-70 is coincidentally over-regulated in these cells. Our findings supported that abundant HSP-70 in Bcr/Abl cells neutralizes AIF by segregating it from nucleus via direct interaction, leading to the failure of AIF initiating cell death and the silence of caspase-independent apoptotic pathway upon apoptotic induction. Moderate inhibition of HSP-70 expression by siRNA leads to Vp-16 triggered re-distribution of AIF in nucleus. In addition, AIF bears a HSP-70 binding domain allowing association with HSP-70. Therefore, disruption of the association using an AIF mutant lacking this domain can restore the potential of AIF importing into nucleus, and finally triggers cell death in a time dependent manner.","[""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing 400016, People's Republic of China.

Epub 2015 Jul 3.,"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and the pattern of ocular involvement in children with leukemia at the time of diagnosis. METHODS: The data of patients with leukemia who underwent complete ophthalmic examination at the time of diagnosis between January 2005 and December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, type of leukemia, ocular findings, blood parameters, and duration of follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients (111 male and 74 female) were included in the study, with a median age of 6.0 years (range 0.5-18.0 years) and a median follow-up time of 36.0 months (range 0.5-108.0 months). Ocular signs were present in 24.3% of the patients at the time of diagnosis and 37.8% of them were symptomatic. The prevalence of ocular involvement was 20.4% in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 36.4% in patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) (p = 0.051). Fatality rate was significantly higher in subjects with AML compared with ALL (p = 0.019), but was not significantly different between patients with and without ocular involvement (p = 0.166). There were no significant differences in hemoglobin levels, white blood cell counts, or platelet counts between patients with ALL and AML. Platelet counts were significantly lower in patients with ocular signs compared with subjects without ocular involvement (p = 0.012), while hemoglobin levels and white blood cell counts did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Various ocular signs may be present at the time of diagnosis in childhood leukemia, even in patients without any symptoms. Routine ophthalmic examination should be performed in recently diagnosed children with leukemia.","['Department of Ophthalmology, Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Faculty of Medicine, Konya - Turkey.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Karaman State Hospital, Karaman - Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Faculty of Medicine, Konya - Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Faculty of Medicine, Konya - Turkey.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Faculty of Medicine, Konya - Turkey.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Faculty of Medicine, Konya - Turkey.']",,,,,"['4195794F-95F4-4AD3-AEC6-4F23D21E449C [pii]', '10.5301/ejo.5000647 [doi]']",10.5301/ejo.5000647 [doi],20150703,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 13.,"RUNX1 and CBFB are among the most frequently mutated genes in human leukemias. Genetic alterations such as chromosomal translocations, copy number variations and point mutations have been widely reported to result in the malfunction of RUNX transcription factors. Leukemias arising from such alterations in RUNX family genes are collectively termed core binding factor (CBF) leukemias. Although adult CBF leukemias generally are considered a favorable risk group as compared with other forms of acute myeloid leukemia, the 5-year survival rate remains low. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanism for CBF leukemia is imperative to uncover novel treatment options. Over the years, retroviral transduction-transplantation assays and transgenic, knockin and knockout mouse models alone or in combination with mutagenesis have been used to study the roles of RUNX alterations in leukemogenesis. Although successful in inducing leukemia, the existing assays and models possess many inherent limitations. A CBF leukemia model which induces leukemia with complete penetrance and short latency would be ideal as a platform for drug discovery. Here, we summarize the currently available mouse models which have been utilized to study CBF leukemias, discuss the advantages and limitations of individual experimental systems, and propose suggestions for improvements of mouse models.","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, A*STAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, A*STAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, A*STAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Paediatrics, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['0 (Core Binding Factors)'],,,,"['leu2015181 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.181 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.181 [doi],20150713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 13.,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) kinase is a member of the TEC kinase family and is a key regulator of the B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signaling pathway. It is important for B-cell maturation, proliferation, survival and metastasis. Pharmacological inhibition of BTK is clinically effective against a variety of B-cell malignances, such as mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and activated B-cell-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. MNK kinase is one of the key downstream regulators in the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway and controls protein synthesis via regulating the activity of eIF4E. Inhibition of MNK activity has been observed to moderately inhibit the proliferation of AML cells. Through a structure-based drug-design approach, we have discovered a selective and potent BTK/MNK dual kinase inhibitor (QL-X-138), which exhibits covalent binding to BTK and noncovalent binding to MNK. Compared with the BTK kinase inhibitor (PCI-32765) and the MNK kinase inhibitor (cercosporamide), QL-X-138 enhanced the antiproliferative efficacies in vitro against a variety of B-cell cancer cell lines, as well as AML and CLL primary patient cells, which respond moderately to BTK inhibitor in vitro. The agent can effectively arrest the growth of lymphoma and leukemia cells at the G0-G1 stage and can induce strong apoptotic cell death. These primary results demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of BTK and MNK kinase activity might be a new therapeutic strategy for B-cell malignances.","['High Magnetic Field laboratory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'University of Science and Technology of China, Anhui, Hefei, P.

Epub 2015 Jul 13.,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), NOTCH1 mutations have been associated with clinical resistance to the anti-CD20 rituximab, although the mechanisms behind this peculiar behavior remain to be clarified. In a wide CLL series (n=692), we demonstrated that CLL cells from NOTCH1-mutated cases (87/692) were characterized by lower CD20 expression and lower relative lysis induced by anti-CD20 exposure in vitro. Consistently, CD20 expression by CLL cells was upregulated in vitro by gamma-secretase inhibitors or NOTCH1-specific small interfering RNA and the stable transfection of a mutated (c.7541-7542delCT) NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD-mut) into CLL-like cells resulted in a strong downregulation of both CD20 protein and transcript. By using these NICD-mut transfectants, we investigated protein interactions of RBPJ, a transcription factor acting either as activator or repressor of NOTCH1 pathway when respectively bound to NICD or histone deacetylases (HDACs). Compared with controls, NICD-mut transfectants had RBPJ preferentially complexed to NICD and showed higher levels of HDACs interacting with the promoter of the CD20 gene. Finally, treatment with the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid upregulated CD20 in both NICD-mut transfectants and primary CLL cells. In conclusion, NOTCH1 mutations are associated with low CD20 levels in CLL and are responsible for a dysregulation of HDAC-mediated epigenetic repression of CD20 expression.","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Immunogenetics Unit, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), Torino, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Immunogenetics Unit, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), Torino, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Onco-Hematology Department, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico della Basilicata, I.R.C.C.S., Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Ferrarotto Hospital, Catania, Italy.', ""Clinica Ematologica, Centro Trapianti e Terapie Cellulari 'Carlo Melzi' DISM, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria S.

METHOD: The clinical features of an infant with CML, who was treated with imatinib in the Norman Bethune International Peace Hospital at June 2009, were retrospectively analyzed and the reports in literature were reviewed. The 1-year-old boy suffered from recurrent low-degree fever and pallor. He had a moderate anemia, distended abdomen and marked splenomegaly. Bone marrow aspiration revealed CML in chronic phase)CP). The t (9; 22))q34; q11) could be detected and BCR-ABL (p210) was positive. The boy was diagnosed as CML-CP and treated with imatinib 100 mg per day. There were 10 related papers and more than 100 child CML patients were reported as retrieved from CNKI)from its establishment to August 2014) and Wanfang Database)from its establishment to August 2014) when ""Child"", "" Chronic"" and ""Leukemia"" were used as keywords. And there were 30 related papers including 400 cases from PubMed Database (from its establishment to August 2014) and one detailed report of an infant with CML was retrieved when ""childhood"" and ""chronic myeloid leukemia"" ""imatinib"" were used as keywords. The clinical effects of imatinib in infant CML cases were analyzed and summarized based on the literature. RESULT: The boy obtained a complete hematologic response (CHR) at the 6th week of diagnosis, a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at the 3rd month and a complete molecular response)CMR) at the 12th month without side effect. This boy grows very well and after a 62-month follow-up, his disease was stable. According to the domestic literature, 5 children CML cases aged 6 -12 years were treated with imatinib without side effects and got complete hematologic response (CHR) after 2-month-therapy. The dose, metabolic characteristics and clinical observation of imatinib can be found in foreign literature and imatinib showed good response with good tolerance in children with CML. Imatinib is regarded as the first line drug for children CML. But it may affect the development of the children. CONCLUSION: The children with CML-CP had a good response to imatinib, but more experience in the treatment of children with CML with iniatinib is needed.",,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tungsten production for industrial and military applications has almost doubled over the past decade and continues to increase. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate tungsten's ability to induce carcinogenic related endpoints including cell transformation, increased migration, xenograft growth in nude mice, and the activation of multiple cancer-related pathways in transformed clones as determined by RNA sequencing. Human bronchial epithelial cell line (Beas-2B) exposed to tungsten developed carcinogenic properties. In a soft agar assay, tungsten-treated cells formed more colonies than controls and the tungsten-transformed clones formed tumors in nude mice. RNA-sequencing data revealed that the tungsten-transformed clones altered the expression of many cancer-associated genes when compared to control clones. Genes involved in lung cancer, leukemia, and general cancer genes were deregulated by tungsten. Taken together, our data show the carcinogenic potential of tungsten. Further tests are needed, including in vivo and human studies, in order to validate tungsten as a carcinogen to humans.","['Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University Langone Medical Center, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University Langone Medical Center, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University Langone Medical Center, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University Langone Medical Center, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University Langone Medical Center, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University Langone Medical Center, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University Langone Medical Center, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.', 'Genome Technology Center, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Center for Health Informatics and Bioinformatics, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University Langone Medical Center, Tuxedo, NY 10987, USA.

Epub 2015 Jul 9.,"Study of the mechanisms of apoptosis in tumor cells is an important field of tumor therapy and cancer molecular biology. We recently established that III-10, a new flavonoid with a pyrrolidinyl and a benzyl group substitution, exerted its anti-tumor effect via inducing differentiation of human U937 leukemia cells. In this study, we demonstrated that III-10 induced cell apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The activation of caspase-3, caspase-9, and the increased expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 were detected in III-10-induced apoptosis. Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, partly attenuated the apoptotic induction of III-10 on both HepG2 and BEL-7402 cells. Furthermore, the increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and the reduction of mitochondria DeltaPsim were also observed in BEL-7402 and HepG2 cells after the treatment of III-10. Pretreatment with NAC, a reactive oxygen species production inhibitor, partly attenuated the apoptosis induced by III-10 via blocking the reactive oxygen species generation. Our data also showed that III-10 induced the release of cytochrome c and AIF to cytosol followed after the reactive oxygen species accumulation. Moreover, the GSH levels and ATP generation were both inhibited after III-10 treatment. Besides, the MAPK, the downstream effect of reactive oxygen species accumulation including JNK could be activated by III-10, as well as the inactivation of ERK. Collectively, the generation of reactive oxygen species might play an crucial role in III-10-induced mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, provided more stubborn evidence for III-10 as a potent anticancer therapeutic candidate.","[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""Xi'an Middle School of Shaanxi Province, Xi'an 710021, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China.

The molecular pathogenesis of BPDCN has been studied in only a limited number of cases, and specific chromosomal aberrations are lacking thus far. KMT2A (MLL) rearrangements are observed in various types of pediatric and adult leukemia, but only one adult case report has so far showed KMT2A (MLL)-MLLT1 gene rearrangements in BPDCN. We present the first pediatric case of BPDCN with a KMT2A (MLL)-MLLT1 rearrangement confirmed by molecular study. The karyotype demonstrated a t(11;19)(q23;p13.3), trisomy 8, and trisomy 19 in all 20 metaphase cells analyzed: 48,XX,+8,t(11;19)(q23;p13.3),+19[20]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangement in 83% of interphase cells. The KMT2A (MLL)-MLLT1 gene rearrangement was confirmed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We suggest that the pathogenesis of BPDCN could be associated with KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement (especially with KMT2A (MLL)-MLLT1) and further study on a larger number of cases is needed.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

Epub 2015 Jul 8.,"To avoid contamination of adventitious gammaretroviruses in biological products such as vaccines, it is necessary to check the master seed cells for manufacturing. There are several assays to detect infectious gammaretroviruses. Among these, sarcoma-positive, leukemia-negative (S+L-) assay is a classical infectivity assay, which is often recommended in governmental guidelines. The S+L- cells used in S+L- assay generate unique focus upon the infection of replication-competent gammaretroviruses. Although S+L- assay is well recognized for the detection, their applicability is questionable in some cases. On the other hand, LacZ marker rescue (LMR) assay detects infectious gammaretroviruses by transducing LacZ marker gene to the target cells, which shows lacZ-positive foci if the infectious virus is present. In this study, we compared LMR and S+L- assays for detection of a variety of endogenous and exogenous gammaretroviruses. As results, LMR assay could detect all gammaretroviruses examined. On the other hand, S+L- assay using feline S+L- cells, termed QN10S, could not detect porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) subgroups A/B. Further, S+L- mink cells could not detect feline leukemia virus subgroups B in addition to PERV-A/B. These data indicate that LMR assay is better suited to detect wider range of gammaretroviruses.","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Department of Cell Biology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Department of Cell Biology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Department of Cell Biology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.

Epub 2015 Jul 9.,"Acoustic cavitation of microbubbles has been described as inducing tumor cell apoptosis that is partly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction; however, the exact mechanisms have not been fully characterized. Here, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (1 MHz, 0.3-MPa peak negative pressure, 10% duty cycle and 1-kHz pulse repetition frequency) was applied to K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells for 1 min with 10% (v/v) SonoVue microbubbles. After ultrasound exposure, the apoptotic index was determined by flow cytometry with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide. In addition, mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) was determined with the JC-1 assay. Translocation of apoptosis-associated protein cytochrome c was evaluated by Western blotting. We found that microbubble-assisted acoustic cavitation can increase the cellular apoptotic index, mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release in K562 cells, compared with ultrasound treatment alone. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis were significantly inhibited by cyclosporin A, a classic inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore; however, the inhibitor of Bax protein, Bax-inhibiting peptide, could not suppress these effects. Our results suggest that mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening is involved in mitochondrial dysfunction after exposure to microbubble-assisted acoustic cavitation. Moreover, the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria is dependent on cyclosporin A-sensitive mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, but not formation of the Bax-voltage dependent anion channel complex or Bax oligomeric pores. These data provide more insight into the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction induced by acoustic cavitation and can be used as a basis for therapy.","[""Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi' an Jiaotong University, Xi' an, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi' an Jiaotong University, Xi' an, China.

ARS induced a loss of mitochondrial transmemberane potential (DeltaPsim), phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, as well as activations of Bax/Bak and caspases indicative of apoptosis induction. Silencing Bax but not Bak significantly inhibited ARS-induced apoptosis, demonstrating the key role of the Bax-mediated intrinsic pathway. Although ARS increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), ARS-induced apoptosis was neither prevented by pretreatment with ROS scavengers nor potentiated by pretreatment with l-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) that enhanced the ARS-induced intracellular ROS generation, demonstrating that ROS was not involved in ARS-induced apoptosis. In addition, ARS did not induce Bid translocation to mitochondria, and the cytotoxicity of ARS was not prevented by silencing Bim, Puma or Mcl-1, but was significantly enhanced by HA14-1 pretreatment, demonstrating that Bcl-2/-xl instead of Bid and Bim as well as Puma may be the upstream factor to regulate the Bax-mediated intrinsic pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ARS induces ROS-independent apoptosis via the Bax-mediated intrinsic pathway in HepG2 cells.","['MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science & Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, PR China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science & Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, PR China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science & Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, PR China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science & Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, PR China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science & Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, PR China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science & Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, PR China.', 'Department of Pain Management, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, PR China.

Epub 2015 Jul 9.,"The last few years have seen the identification of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins as critical mediators of transcription with effects on its direct control and cisregulation. This discovery is important in furthering our understanding of the mechanisms of normal transcriptional control. Subsequent work has shed light on the multiple roles of BET proteins in various aberrant transcriptional pathways that have significant implications across many malignant cell types and other disease processes. Accordingly, considerable effort has been made to assess the utility of targeting BET proteins with specific small molecules in acute leukemia and across other types of cancer. In this review, we will discuss the most recent advances in our understanding of the mechanistic actions of BET proteins in normal transcriptional control, both at the gene body and cisregulatory elements; how this is subverted; and its aberrant downstream effects, specifically in the context of acute leukemia and other hematologic cancers. In particular, we will focus on altered epigenetic programs that have been shown to be central to the development and maintenance of acute myeloid leukemia in preclinical models. Finally, we will explore how the use of small-molecule BET inhibitors in leukemias has demonstrated significant promise in numerous single-agent and combination therapy preclinical models and will highlight efforts to translate this promise to the therapeutic arena through various clinical trials attempting to validate efficacy and safety. The considerable opportunities in epigenetically targeting leukemias through BET inhibition will undoubtedly play an important role in improving the management of these conditions in the future.","[""Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."", ""Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

Epub 2015 Jul 8.,"A precise understanding of the role of miR-223 in human hematopoiesis and in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still lacking. By measuring miR-223 expression in blasts from 115 AML patients, we found significantly higher miR-223 levels in patients with favorable prognosis, whereas patients with low miR-223 expression levels were associated with worse outcome. Furthermore, miR-223 was hierarchically expressed in AML subpopulations, with lower expression in leukemic stem cell-containing fractions. Genetic depletion of miR-223 decreased the leukemia initiating cell (LIC) frequency in a myelomonocytic AML mouse model, but it was not mandatory for rapid-onset AML. To relate these observations to physiologic myeloid differentiation, we knocked down or ectopically expressed miR-223 in cord-blood CD34(+) cells using lentiviral vectors. Although miR-223 knockdown delayed myeloerythroid precursor differentiation in vitro, it increased myeloid progenitors in vivo following serial xenotransplantation. Ectopic miR-223 expression increased erythropoiesis, T lymphopoiesis, and early B lymphopoiesis in vivo. These findings broaden the role of miR-223 as a regulator of the expansion/differentiation equilibrium in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells where its impact is dose- and differentiation-stage-dependent. This also explains the complex yet minor role of miR-223 in AML, a heterogeneous disease with variable degree of myeloid differentiation.","['San Raffaele Hospital, Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy and Vita-Salute University, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'San Raffaele Hospital, Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy and Vita-Salute University, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Hospital, Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy and Vita-Salute University, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine II, Center for Internal Medicine at the Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Gene Center and Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Ludwig Maximilians University Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Pharmakology and Toxicology, Technical University, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.', ""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Center for Internal Medicine at the Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', ""The Stem Cell Program, Department of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Institute for Pharmakology and Toxicology, Technical University, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'San Raffaele Hospital, Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy and Vita-Salute University, Milan, Italy.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.

Epub 2015 Jun 27.,"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) give rise to all of the cells that make up the hematopoietic system in the human body, making their stability and resilience especially important. Damage to these cells can severely impact cell development and has the potential to cause diseases, such as leukemia. Leukemia-causing chromosomal rearrangements have largely been studied in the context of radiation exposure and are formed by a multi-step process, including an initial DNA breakage and fusion of the free DNA ends. However, the mechanism for DNA breakage in patients without previous radiation exposure is unclear. Here, we investigate the role of non-cytotoxic levels of environmental factors, benzene, and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and chemotherapeutic agents, etoposide, and doxorubicin, in generating DNA breakage at the patient breakpoint hotspots of the MLL and CBFB genes in human HSPCs. These conditions represent exposure to chemicals encountered daily or residual doses from chemotherapeutic drugs. Exposure of HSPCs to non-cytotoxic levels of environmental chemicals or chemotherapeutic agents causes DNA breakage at preferential sites in the human genome, including the leukemia-related genes MLL and CBFB. Though benzene, etoposide, and doxorubicin have previously been linked to leukemia formation, this is the first study to demonstrate a role for DEN in the generation of DNA breakage at leukemia-specific sites. These chemical-induced DNA breakpoints coincide with sites of predicted topoisomerase II cleavage. The distribution of breakpoints by exposure to non-cytotoxic levels of chemicals showed a similar pattern to fusion breakpoints in leukemia patients. Our findings demonstrate that HSPCs exposed to non-cytotoxic levels of environmental chemicals and chemotherapeutic agents are prone to topoisomerase II-mediated DNA damage at the leukemia-associated genes MLL and CBFB. These data suggest a role for long-term environmental chemical or residual chemotherapeutic drug exposure in generation of DNA breakage at sites with a propensity to form leukemia-causing gene rearrangements.","['Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1016, USA.

There are several influences which are involved in such resistance to chemotherapy, including oxidative stress as a result of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and presence of hypodiploid cells. Cluster of differentiation 26 (CD26), also known as dipeptidyl peptidase-4, is a 110 kDa, multifunctional, membrane-bound glycoprotein. AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of serum CD26 in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients in the post remission induction phase, as well as the relationship between CD26 activity and the oxidative stress status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD26, total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and oxidative stress index (OSI), in addition to activity of related enzymes myeloperoxidase, glutathione- s-transferase and xanthine oxidase, were analysed in sixty children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the post remission induction phase. RESULTS: The study showed significant elevation in CD26, TOS and OSI levels in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the post remission induction phase in comparison to healthy control samples. In contrast, myeloperoxidase, glutathione-s-transferase and xanthine oxidase activities were decreased significantly. A significant correlation between CD26 concentration and some oxidative stress parameters was evident in ALL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of CD26 appear to be useful as a new biomarker of oxidative stress in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the post remission induction phase, and levels of antioxidants must be regularly estimated during the treatment of children with ALL.","['Department of Biotechnology , College of Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia E-mail : waadmwa@yahoo.com.']","['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (DPP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",,,,['10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.12.5059 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are classical Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative MPN that have a Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation, especially JAK2V617F in the majority of patients. The major complications of Ph-negative MPNs are thrombosis, hemorrhage, and leukemic transformation. OBJECTIVE: To study clinical manifestations including symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, and JAK2V617F mutations of Ph-negative MPN (PV, ET and PMF) as well as their complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All Ph-negative MPN (PV, ET and PMF) patients who attended the Hematology Clinic at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital from January, 1 2003 through December, 31 2013 were retrospectively reviewed for demographic data, clinical characteristics, complete blood count, JAK2V617F mutation analysis, treatment, and complications. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty seven patients were included in the study. They were classified as PV, ET and PMF for 68, 83 and 6 with median ages of 60, 61, and 68 years, respectively. JAK2V617F mutations were detected in 88%, 69%, and 100% of PV, ET and PMF patients. PV had the highest incidence of thrombosis (PV 29%, ET 14%, and PMF 0%) that occurred in both arterial and venous sites whereas PMF had the highest incidence of bleeding (PMF 17%, ET 11%, and PV 7%). During follow up, there was one ET patient that transformed to acute leukemia and five cases that developed thrombosis (three ET and two PV patients). No secondary myelofibrosis and death cases were encountered. CONCLUSIONS: Ph-negative MPNs have various clinical manifestations. JAK2V617F mutations are present in the majority of PV, ET, and PMF patients. This study confirmed that thrombosis and bleeding are the most significant complications in patients with Ph-negative MPN.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand E-mail : ekarat.r@cmu.ac.th, ekarat_r@hotmail.com.']","['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,['10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.12.5013 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed mutational analysis of exons 14-15 and 20 of the FLT3 gene in 54 AML patients using PCR-CSGE (conformational sensitive gel electrophoresis) followed by sequencing analysis to characterise FLT3 mutations in adult patients diagnosed with AML at Hospital USM, Kelantan, Northeast Peninsular Malaysia. RESULTS: FLT3 exon 14-15 mutations were identified in 7 of 54 patients (13%) whereas no mutation was found in FLT3 exon 20. Six ITDs and one non-ITD mutation were found in exon 14 of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain of FLT3. FLT3-ITD mutations were associated with a significantly higher blast percentage (p-value=0.008) and white blood cell count (p-value=0.023) but there was no significant difference in median overall survival time for FLT3-ITD+/FLT3-ITD- within 2 years (p-value=0.374).

The suboptimal survival and toxicities observed with conventional approaches warrant exploration of novel therapeutic strategies such as targeted therapies. Although targeting EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) with cetuximab demonstrated clinical promise, HER (human epidermal growth factor receptor) or ERBB (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog) targeted therapy in HNC has overall been suboptimal to date in clinical settings. Overcoming the resistance as well as identifying new strategies therefore remains a significant challenge. In this review, we will discuss the emerging roles of HER members besides EGFR.

An increasing number of research groups use multiple platforms and software packages to detect and analyze CNAs. However, different platforms have experimental and analysis-specific biases that may yield different results. We sought to estimate the concordance of CNAs in children with de novo acute myeloid leukemia between two experimental platforms: Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array and Illumina OmniQuad 2.5 BeadChip. Forty-five paired tumor-remission samples were genotyped on both platforms, and CNAs were estimated from total signal intensity and allelic contrast values using the allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors (ASCAT) algorithm. The two platforms were comparable in detection of CNAs, each missing only two segments from a total of 42 CNAs (4.6%). Overall, there was an interplatform agreement of 96% for allele-specific tumor profiles. However, poor quality samples with low signal/noise ratios showed a high rate of false-positive segments independent of the genotyping platform.

Epub 2015 Jul 8.,"Calreticulin (CALR) is a highly conserved, multifunctional protein involved in a variety of cellular processes including the maintenance of intracellular calcium homeostasis, proper protein folding, differentiation and immunogenic cell death. More recently, a crucial role for CALR in the pathogenesis of certain hematologic malignancies was discovered: in clinical subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia, CALR overexpression mediates a block in differentiation, while somatic mutations have been found in the majority of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms with nonmutated Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2) or thrombopoietin receptor gene (MPL). However, the mechanisms underlying CALR promoter activation have insufficiently been investigated so far. By dissecting the core promoter region, we could identify a functional TATA-box relevant for transcriptional activation. In addition, we characterized two evolutionary highly conserved cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) within the proximal promoter each composed of one binding site for the transcription factors SP1 and SP3 as well as for the nuclear transcription factor Y (NFY) and we verified binding of these factors to their cognate sites in vitro and in vivo.","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital and University of Bern, 3010 Bern, Switzerland.

Epub 2015 Jul 8.,"CONTEXT: Factors influencing pediatric cancer patients' place of death may have evolved with advances in medical and hospice care since earlier studies were done. OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively analyze factors associated with hospital death in an unbiased population of pediatric cancer patients in Taiwan. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using administrative data for 1603 Taiwanese pediatric cancer patients who died in 2001-2010. Place of death was hypothesized to be associated with 1) patient sociodemographics and disease characteristics, 2) primary physician's specialty, 3) characteristics and health care resources at both the hospital and regional levels, and 4) historical trends. RESULTS: Most Taiwanese pediatric cancer patients (87.4%) died in an acute care hospital. The probability of dying in hospital increased slightly over time, reaching significance only in 2009 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 95% CI: 2.84 [1.32-6.11]). Children were more likely to die in an acute care hospital if they resided in the most urbanized area, were diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma (2.32 [1.39-3.87]), and received care from a pediatrician (1.58 [1.01-2.47]) in a nonprofit proprietary hospital (1.50 [1.01-2.24]) or large hospital, reaching significance for the third quartile (2.57 [1.28-5.18]) of acute care hospital beds. CONCLUSION: Taiwanese pediatric cancer patients predominantly died in an acute care hospital with a slightly increasing trend of shifting place of death from home to hospital. Propensity for hospital death was determined by residential urbanization level, diagnosis, primary physician's specialty, and the primary hospital's characteristics and health care resources. Clinical interventions and health policies should ensure that resources are allocated to allow pediatric cancer patients to die in the place they and their parents prefer to achieve a good death and promote their parents' bereavement adjustment.","['School of Gerontology Health Management, College of Nursing, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'School of Nursing, Chang Gung University, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.

Epub 2015 Jul 10.,"In-depth molecular investigation of familial leukemia has been limited by the rarity of recognized cases. This study examines the genetic events initiating leukemia and details the clinical progression of disease across multiple families harboring germ-line CEBPA mutations. Clinical data were collected from 10 CEBPA-mutated families, representing 24 members with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Whole-exome (WES) and deep sequencing were performed to genetically profile tumors and define patterns of clonal evolution. Germline CEBPA mutations clustered within the N-terminal and were highly penetrant, with AML presenting at a median age of 24.5 years (range, 1.75-46 years). In all diagnostic tumors tested (n = 18), double CEBPA mutations (CEBPAdm) were detected, with acquired (somatic) mutations preferentially targeting the C-terminal. Somatic CEBPA mutations were unstable throughout the disease course, with different mutations identified at recurrence. Deep sequencing of diagnostic and relapse paired samples confirmed that relapse-associated CEBPA mutations were absent at diagnosis, suggesting recurrence was triggered by novel, independent clones. Integrated WES and deep sequencing subsequently revealed an entirely new complement of mutations at relapse, verifying the presentation of a de novo leukemic episode. The cumulative incidence of relapse in familial AML was 56% at 10 years (n = 11), and 3 patients experienced >/=3 disease episodes over a period of 17 to 20 years. Durable responses to secondary therapies were observed, with prolonged median survival after relapse (8 years) and long-term overall survival (10-year overall survival, 67%). Our data reveal that familial CEBPA-mutated AML exhibits a unique model of disease progression, associated with favorable long-term outcomes.","['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom;', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Biology and Pathology Center, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire of Lille, Lille, France;

Epub 2015 Jul 10.,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults. Lymph nodes (LNs) are sites of malignant proliferation and LN enlargement is associated with poor prognosis in the clinics. The LN microenvironment is believed to favor disease progression by promoting CLL cell growth and drug resistance. A better understanding of the mechanisms regulating trafficking of CLL cells to LNs is thus urgently needed. Here, we studied the first step of CLL cell migration to LNs, their interaction with high endothelial venules (HEVs), specialized blood vessels for lymphocyte extravasation in lymphoid organs. We observed that the density of HEV blood vessels was increased in CLL LNs and that CD20(+) CLL cells accumulated within HEV pockets, suggesting intense trafficking. We used intravital imaging to visualize the behavior of human CLL cells within the mouse LN microcirculation, and discovered that CLL cells bind to HEVs in vivo via a multistep adhesion cascade, which involves rolling, sticking, and crawling of the leukemic cells on the endothelium. Functional analyses revealed that the lymphocyte homing receptor L-selectin (CD62L) is the key factor controlling the binding of CLL cells to HEV walls in vivo. Interestingly, L-selectin expression was decreased on CLL cells from patients treated with idelalisib, a phosphoinositide-3-kinase delta inhibitor recently approved for CLL therapy. Interference with L-selectin-mediated trafficking in HEVs could represent a novel strategy to block dissemination of CLL cells to LNs and increase the efficacy of conventional therapy.","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Toulouse, France; Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France;', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Toulouse, France; Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France;', ""Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM U1037, Toulouse, France; Centre de Physiopathologie de Toulouse Purpan, INSERM U563, Toulouse, France; and Laboratoire d'Anatomie et Cytologie Pathologiques, and."", 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Toulouse, France; Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France;', 'Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France; Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM U1037, Toulouse, France;', ""Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM U1037, Toulouse, France; Service d'Hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Toulouse, France; Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France;']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",,,,"['S0006-4971(20)30934-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-02-626291 [doi]']",10.1182/blood-2015-02-626291 [doi],20150710,,,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['Blood. 2015 Sep 10;126(11):1267-8.

OBJECTIVES: To explore nurses' blame attributions towards patients with different types of cancer and to identify associated factors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: A tertiary cancer-specialized hospital in Beijing. PARTICIPANTS: 317 Chinese oncology nurses working in the cancer hospital. METHODS: Participant nurses completed a self-administrated anonymous questionnaire and rated how much they would blame someone with a diagnosis of breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, as well as leukaemia and obesity. RESULTS: More than half of the oncology nurses (57.1%) attributed at least some blame to patients with leukaemia, following with breast cancer (67.5%), cervical cancer (79.2%), liver cancer (79.2%), and colon cancer (78.5%). Lung cancer patients attracted at least some blame by 82.0% of participating nurses. Attributions of blame for patients with lung, cervical, colon and liver cancer were most common among nurses with shorter working experience. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that a high proportion of Chinese nurses attributed at least some blame to patients with different cancers despite being working in a cancer-specialized hospital. Future education and support for nurses are essential to avoid negative attitudes and blame attributions to cancer patients in order to enhance the quality of care.","[""School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong, 5/F William Mong Block, 21 Sassoon Road, Hong Kong; Department of Anesthesiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 268 College Road, Lucheng District, Wenzhou City, Zhejiang, China.

Epub 2015 Jul 10.,"OBJECT: Although chondrosarcomas rarely arise in the skull base, chondrosarcomas and chordomas are the 2 major malignant bone neoplasms occurring at this location. The distinction of these 2 tumors is important, but this distinction is occasionally problematic because of radiological and histological overlap. Unlike chordoma and extracranial chondrosarcoma, no case series presenting a whole-genome analysis of skull base chondrosarcomas (SBCSs) has been reported. The goal of this study is to clarify the genetic characteristics of SBCSs and contrast them with those of chordomas. METHODS: The authors analyzed 7 SBCS specimens for chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). They also examined IDH1 and IDH2 mutations and brachyury expression. RESULTS: In CGH analyses, the authors detected CNAs in 6 of the 7 cases, including chromosomal gains of 8q21.1, 19, 2q22-q32, 5qcen-q14, 8q21-q22, and 15qcen-q14. Mutation of IDH1 was found with a high frequency (5 of 7 cases, 71.4%), of which R132S was most frequently mutated. No IDH2 mutations were found, and immunohistochemical staining for brachyury was negative in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first whole-genome study of an SBSC case series. Their findings suggest that these tumors are molecularly consistent with a subset of conventional central chondrosarcomas and different from skull base chordomas.","['Departments of 1 Neurosurgery and.', 'Departments of 1 Neurosurgery and.', 'Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Departments of 1 Neurosurgery and.', 'Departments of 1 Neurosurgery and.']","['0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

LMO2 is widely expressed within haematopoiesis with the exception of T-cells. Failure to downregulate LMO2 during T-cell maturation leads to leukaemia, thus underlining the critical nature of context-dependent regulation of LMO2 expression. We previously identified a distal regulatory element of LMO2 (element -25) that cooperates with the proximal promoter in directing haematopoietic expression. Here we dissected the functional activity of element -25 and showed it to consist of two modules that conferred independent and cell-type specific activities: a 3' myeloid enhancer and a 5' T-cell repressor. The myeloid enhancer was bound by GATA2 in progenitors and its activity depended on a highly conserved GATA motif, whereas the T-cell repressor moiety of element -25 was bound by the Core Binding Factor in T-cells and its repressive activity depended on a highly conserved RUNT motif. Since the myeloid enhancer and nearby downstream region is recurrently involved in oncogenic translocations, our data suggest that the -25 enhancer region provides an open chromatin environment prone to translocations, which in turn cause aberrant LMO2 expression in T-cells due to the removal of the adjacent T-cell repressor.","['Department of Haematology, Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",PMC4498896,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0131577 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-03947 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0131577 [doi],20150710,"['12765/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '097922/Z/11/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/M008975/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '100140/Z/12/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we found that LIF is an important negative regulator of p53 in human colorectal cancer cells. LIF negatively regulates p53 protein levels and functions by activation of the Stat3 signaling pathway, which in turn induces the expression of ID1, the helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein inhibitor of differentiation and DNA binding. ID1 increases MDM2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels to accelerate p53 protein degradation. Overexpression of LIF increases chemoresistance of cultured colorectal cancer cells and colorectal xenograft tumors in a largely p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, LIF is overexpressed in a large percentage of human colorectal cancer specimens and LIF overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Our study revealed a new role of LIF in tumorigenesis through regulation of the p53 signaling pathway.","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.']",,PMC4493903,['NOTNLM'],"['ID1', 'LIF', 'MDM2', 'Stat3', 'chemoresistance', 'p53']",,,,['R01 CA160558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS699976'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Later on, clinical patient data and cell-based studies addressing a wider spectrum of stimuli identified cellular stress signaling pathways, which create secondary DNA structures, provide chromatin accessibility, and activate nucleases other than topoisomerase II at the MLL. The MLL destabilizing signaling pathways under discussion, namely early apoptotic DNA fragmentation, transcription stalling, and replication stalling, may all act in concert upon infection-, transplantation-, or therapy-induced cell cycle entry of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), to permit misguided cleavage and error-prone DNA repair in the cell-of-leukemia-origin.","['Division of Gynecological Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ulm University Ulm, Germany.', 'Division of Gynecological Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ulm University Ulm, Germany.']",,PMC4479792,['NOTNLM'],"['MLL breakpoint cluster region', 'apoptosis', 'error-prone DNA repair', 'infant acute leukemia', 'replication stress', 'therapy-related leukemia']",['10.3389/fcell.2015.00041 [doi]'],10.3389/fcell.2015.00041 [doi],20150625,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the high intensity of chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), CSF as a crucial component of supportive care has played a significant role in the therapy. However, the effectiveness of CSF in treatment has not been identified by large clinical trials until now. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of CSF on the long-term outcome of adult ALL patients. A comprehensive search strategy has been conducted, which covered the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed and Web of Science. The result includes seven randomized controlled trials containing a total of 753 patients. The administration of CSF significantly reduced the mortality at the end of the follow-up (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.95), the mortality at day 30 (RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23-0.74) and the number of patients with infection or severe infections (RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9 and RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.3-0.75). The addition of CSF also marginally increased the number of patients achieving CR (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05-1.23). The use of CSF also shortened the duration of neutropenia (median days, 8-17 to 12.5-24).

The purpose of this observational study is to better understand patient/institution factors that may contribute to participation in the pharmacogenomic component of prospective cancer clinical trials. METHODS: Patient demographic information (age, sex, self-reported race) and institutional characteristics (CALGB/CTSU site, ""diversity,"" and accrual) were evaluated for 8456 patients enrolled in seven CALGB phase III studies with a pharmacogenomic component. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The majority of patients (81%) consented to participate in the pharmacogenomic component. However, in a multivariable analysis, site (CALGB vs CTSU) and ""institutional diversity"" (percent minority cancer patients on national trials) were statistically significantly associated with participation. For both whites and nonwhites, patients from CALGB sites were more likely to participate compared with patients from CTSU sites (whites: odds ratio [OR] = 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.68 to 3.04, P < .001; nonwhites: OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.52 to 2.11, P < .001). However, as ""institutional diversity"" increased, the likelihood of participation in the pharmacogenomics component decreased for both white (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91 to 0.97, P < .001) and nonwhite patients (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.81 to 1.00, P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Most clinical trial cancer patients across geographical, racial, and practice settings are willing to participate in pharmacogenomic studies. However, to promote equitable benefit to the larger cancer community, optimization of both patient and institutional participation are needed. Institutional factors may be even more compelling than patient demographics. Prospective studies are needed to identify and address barriers/incentives to participation in pharmacogenomic research at the patient, clinician, and institutional levels.","['Personalized Medicine, Mission Cancer Care, Mission Health, Asheville, NC (LGD);

Epub 2015 Jul 9.,"This phase Ib/II trial combined the pan-deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat with chemotherapy followed by panobinostat maintenance in elderly patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Patients with prior history of myelodysplastic syndrome were excluded and 38 evaluable patients were included in the study (median age: 71 years; range: 65-83). Study patients received an induction with idarubicin (8 mg/m(2) iv days 1-3) plus cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) iv days 1-7) plus panobinostat po at escalating doses (days 8, 10, 12, 15, 17 and 19) that could be repeated in non-responding patients. Patients achieving complete remission received a consolidation cycle with the same schema, followed by panobinostat maintenance (40 mg po 3 days/week) every other week until progression. Thirty-one patients were treated at the maximum tolerated dose of panobinostat in the combination (10 mg) with good tolerability. Complete remission rate was 64% with a time to relapse of 17.0 months (12.8-21.1). Median overall survival for the whole series was 17 months (5.5-28.4). Moreover, in 4 of 5 patients with persistent minimal residual disease before maintenance, panobinostat monotherapy reduced its levels, with complete negativization in two of them. Maintenance phase was well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events were thrombocytopenia (25% grades 3/4), and gastrointestinal toxicity, asthenia and anorexia (mainly grades 1/2). Five patients required dose reduction during this phase, but only one discontinued therapy due to toxicity. These results suggest that panobinostat is one of the first novel agents with activity in elderly acute myeloid leukemia patients, and suggest further investigation is warranted, particularly in the context of maintenance therapy. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov identifier: 00840346.","['Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca emocio@usal.es.', 'Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid.', 'Hospital Lozano Blesa, Zaragoza.', 'Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS), Seville.', 'Hospital de la Santa Creu y Sant Pau, Barcelona.', 'Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona.', 'Hospital San Carlos, Madrid.', 'Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia.', 'Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid.', 'Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca.', 'Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca (IBSAL), Centro Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigaciones Medicas Aplicadas (CIMA), IDISNA, Pamplona, Spain.']","['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",PMC4591761,,,"['haematol.2015.129577 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.129577 [doi]']",10.3324/haematol.2015.129577 [doi],20150709,,,['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,['PETHEMA Group'],['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00840346'],,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 May 12.,"OBJECTIVES: Understanding the factors associated with child communication during subspecialty encounters may inform interventions promoting shared decision-making in chronic disease management. Objectives were to (1) describe the quantity and quality of child communication during outpatient subspecialty encounters and (2) determine if and how the quantity and quality of child communication vary by demographic and visit characteristics. METHODS: We videotaped subspecialty clinic encounters involving 20 health care providers and 155 children with one of the following conditions: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (consolidation/maintenance), persistent asthma, cystic fibrosis, type 1 diabetes, and obesity. The Roter interaction analysis system was used to code child utterances into one of 10 discrete categories. RESULTS: Children exhibited a mean of 15% of all utterances made during clinical encounters. Children spoke more during obesity encounters. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to the findings of studies in primary care settings, children spoke infrequently during the subspecialty visits, and the most common utterances tended to be replies to questions from adults. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: In this study, there was relatively higher engagement of children during obesity clinic encounters in the area of lifestyle choices. Strategies used to engage children in conversation in obesity clinics may be useful for engaging children in other subspecialty clinics.","['Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE, USA.

In addition, NK cells have been shown to exert a key role in haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation for the therapy of high-risk leukemias. The anti-leukemia effect is mostly related to the presence of ""alloreactive"" NK cells, i.e., mature KIR(+) NK cells that express inhibitory KIR mismatched with HLA class I (KIR-L) of the patient. In addition, an important role is played by certain activating KIR (primarily, but not only, KIR2DS1) upon interaction with their HLA class I ligand (C2 alleles). In general, the presence of activating KIR correlates with a better prognosis. Beside the infusion of ""pure"" CD34(+) cells, a novel protocol has been recently developed in which depletion of alphabeta T cells and CD19(+) B cells makes it possible to infuse into the patient, together with donor CD34(+) HSCs, important effector cells including mature PB NK cells and gammadelta T cells. Recent studies revealed that cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation may induce rapid NK cell maturation and greatly influence the NK receptor repertoire. The remarkable expansion of a subset expressing the activating receptor NKG2C, together with a more efficient virus-specific effector response after rechallenge with CMV (i.e., antigen specificity), and the longevity of the expanded population are all features consistent with an adaptive type of response and support the notion of a memory-like activity of NK cells.","['Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale, Sezione Istologia and Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica, Universita di Genova, Via G.B.

In our research, MSC derived from acute myeloid leukemia patients' bone marrow (AML-MSC) and lung cancer tissues (LC-MSC) as well as normal bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) cultured in conditioned medium of HeLa cells were found to have higher expressions of Toll-like receptor (TLR4) mRNA compared with BM-MSC. The sorted TLR4-positive MSC (TLR4+ MSC) differed in cytokine (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) secretion from those of unsorted MSC. MSC was reported to inhibit natural killer (NK) cell proliferation and function. In this research, we confirmed that TLR4+ MSC aggravate this suppression. Furthermore, when TLR4 in the sorted cells were stimulated by LPS or following blocked by antibody, the suppression on NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were more intensive or recovered respectively. Compared to unsorted MSC, NKG2D receptor expression on NK cells were also inhibited by TLR4+ MSC. These findings suggest that activation of TLR4 pathway is important for TLR4+ MSC and MSC to obstruct anti-tumor immunity by inhibiting NK cell function, which may provide a potential stroma-targeted tumor therapy.","[""No. 307 Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", 'Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China.', ""No. 307 Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""No. 307 Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China.

Epub 2015 Jul 6.,"Growing insight into prognosis of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) survival has led to improved outcome over time and could be further enhanced through investigation using a large number of patients. To characterize the extent of the association of pediatric AML survival with its identified prognostic factors, we analyzed the United States population-based Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) large dataset of 3442 pediatric AML patients diagnosed and followed between 1973 and 2011 using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by year of diagnosis. Patients diagnosed between 10 and 19 years of age were at a higher risk of death compared to those diagnosed before age 10 (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-1.44). African Americans (1.27, 1.09-1.48) and Hispanics (1.15, 1.00-1.32) had an elevated risk of mortality than Caucasians. Compared to the subtype acute promyelocytic leukemia, AML with minimal differentiation (2.44, 1.78-3.35); acute erythroid leukemia (2.34, 1.60-3.40); AML without maturation (1.87, 1.35-2.59); and most other AML subtypes had a higher risk of mortality, whereas AML with inv(16) had a substantially lower risk. Age at diagnosis, race-ethnicity, AML subtype, county level poverty and geographic region appeared as significant prognostic factors of pediatric AML survival in the US. Contrary to previous findings, the subtypes of AML with t(9;11)(p22;q23)MLLT3-MLL, AML without maturation and acute myelomonocytic leukemia emerged to be indicative of poor outcome.","['Nemours Biomedical Research, A I duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE 19803, United States; Department of Applied Economics and Statistics, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, United States.

There is growing evidence that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells exploit the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) to resist antitumor immune reactions and maintain their survival by shaping their own microenvironment. METHODS: We used a quantitative RT-PCR method to analyze PD-L1 gene expression in bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, representing the proliferation and accumulation compartments of CLL. RESULTS: PD-L1 expression was found to be significantly higher in 112 CLL patients than in controls. Levels of PD-L1 expression in bone marrow and peripheral blood were comparable and showed a positive correlation. Furthermore, expression of PDL1 strongly correlated with expression of PD-1 receptor in mononuclear cells from the same compartment, and was not affected by incubation with immunomodulatory drug thalidomide. CONCLUSION: PD-L1 expression is shared between CLL cells localized in distinct disease compartments, demonstrating that PD-1/PD-L1 a universal target for therapy.",,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",,,,"['000430980 [pii]', '10.1159/000430980 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jun 10.,"A20, also known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), has been identified as a key regulator of cell survival in many solid tumors. However, little is known about the protein expression level and function of A20 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this study, we found that A20 is up-regulated in ALL patients and several cell lines. Knockdown of A20 in Jurkat, Nalm-6, and Reh cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation, which was associated with cell cycle arrest. Phospho-ERK (p-ERK) was also down-regulated, while p53 and p21 were up-regulated in A20 knockdown cells. In addition, A20 knockdown induced apoptosis in Jurkat and Reh cells and enhanced the sensitivity of these cell lines to chemotherapeutic drugs. These results indicate that A20 may stimulate cell proliferation by regulating cell cycle progression. A20 inhibited apoptosis in some types of ALL cells, thereby enhancing their resistance to chemotherapy. This effect was abolished through A20 silencing. These findings suggest that A20 may contribute to the pathogenesis of ALL and that it may be used as a new therapeutic target for ALL treatment.","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and a proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL) are key cytokines implicated in MM development. Here, we show that MM cells changed the hematopoietic microenvironment early upon BM infiltration by strongly downregulating hematopoietic precursor cells from all lineages except myeloid precursor cells. Myeloid precursor cells constituted a major source of APRIL in MM-infiltrated BM, and their proliferative response to IL-6 upregulation explained their relative resistance to MM infiltration. The osteolytic molecule receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANK-L) expressed by MM cells started this myeloid proliferation by inducing in a contact-dependent manner IL-6 production by myeloid precursor cells themselves. Taken together, our data demonstrate that MM cells do not simply displace hematopoietic cells upon BM infiltration, but rather selectively modulate the BM microenvironment to preserve a pool of high APRIL-producing myeloid precursor cells. Our data also identify a positive regulation of APRIL by IL-6 in myeloid precursor cells.","['Division of Hematology, University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Analytical Immunology for chronic pathologies, Albert Bonniot Institute, INSERM/University Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Medicine Faculty, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Medicine Faculty, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Institute for Immunology, University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Analytical Immunology for chronic pathologies, Albert Bonniot Institute, INSERM/University Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Medicine Faculty, Geneva, Switzerland.']","['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)']",,,,"['leu2015145 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.145 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.145 [doi],20150619,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of IL21R by CpG-685 also enhanced IL-21-mediated cytotoxicity. The mechanism by which CpG ODNs upregulate IL21R has not been elucidated, although IL21R regulation in T cells has been shown to be linked to T cell receptor-induced Sp1 binding to the IL21R promoter. Here, we demonstrate that luciferase reporter constructs containing the Sp1 binding site have increased basal luciferase activity compared to constructs lacking the Sp1 binding site, but fail to increase luciferase activity with CpG-685 stimulation in CLL B cells. By treating CLL cells with an NF-kappaB inhibitor, we inhibit the CpG ODN-mediated induction of IL21R, thus demonstrating that CpG-685 upregulates IL21R through an NF-kappaB mediated pathway.

To generate analogues, series of phenanthrene alkaloids from D-dicentrine were synthesized by degradation with ethyl chloroformate in pyridine, base hydrolysis, and N-alkylation. In this study, we demonstrated that one of the synthesized D-dicentrine analogues (here after designated as analogue 1) exhibited more potent cytotoxic effects than D-dicentrine in colon adenocarcinoma, hepatoma, leukemia, and epidermoid carcinoma cells. We performed cell cycle and apoptotic analysis by flow cytometry, an apoptotic DNA detection ELISA assay, and topoisomerase II activity by the kinetoplast DNA concatenation assay for studying their cytotoxic mechanisms. We found that both D-dicentrine and analogue 1 induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in HL-60 leukemia cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells induced by analogue 1 was 4.5-fold higher than that induced by D-dicentrine as evident from measuring the amount of histone-bound DNA fragments. Moreover, we found that analogue 1 was 28-fold more potent than D-dicentrine for inhibition of topoisomerase II activity by the kinetoplast DNA concatenation assay.

We recently reported that MLN4924 (pevonedistat), an investigational agent that inhibits the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE), abrogates stromal-mediated NF-kappaB pathway activity and CLL cell survival. However, the NAE pathway also assists degradation of multiple other substrates. MLN4924 has been shown to induce DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, but the importance of this mechanism in primary neoplastic B cells has not been studied. Here we mimicked the lymph node microenvironment using CD40 ligand (CD40L)-expressing stroma and interleukin-21 (IL-21) to find that inducing proliferation of the primary CLL cells conferred enhanced sensitivity to NAE inhibition. Treatment of the CD40-stimulated CLL cells with MLN4924 resulted in deregulation of Cdt1, a DNA replication licensing factor, and cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27. This led to DNA damage, checkpoint activation and G2 arrest. Alkylating agents bendamustine and chlorambucil enhanced MLN4924-mediated DNA damage and apoptosis.

This viral transcript can escape splicing, circumvent the nuclear checkpoint mechanisms and be transported to the cytoplasm by hijacking the host machinery. Once in the cytoplasm, viral unspliced RNA acts as mRNA to be translated and as genomic RNA to be packaged into nascent viruses. The murine leukemia virus (MLV) is among the first retroviruses discovered and is classified as simple Retroviridae due to its minimal encoding capacity. The oncogenic and transduction abilities of MLV are extensively studied, whereas surprisingly the crucial step of its nuclear export has remained unsolved until 2014. Recent work has revealed the recruitment by MLV of the cellular NXF1/Tap-dependent pathway for export. Unconventionally, MLV uses of Tap to export both spliced and unspliced viral RNAs. Unlike other retroviruses, MLV does not harbor a unique RNA signal for export. Indeed, multiple sequences throughout the MLV genome appear to promote export of the unspliced MLV RNA. We review here the current understanding of the export mechanism and highlight the determinants that influence MLV export. As the molecular mechanism of MLV export is elucidated, we will gain insight into the contribution of the export pathway to the cytoplasmic fate of the viral RNA.","['a CNRS, UM; CPBS ; Montpellier , France.', ""b Department of Infectious Diseases ; King's College London ; London , UK."", 'c Inserm U1085-IRSET; Universite de Rennes 1; Structure Federative Recherche Biosit ; Rennes , France.', 'a CNRS, UM; CPBS ; Montpellier , France.', 'a CNRS, UM; CPBS ; Montpellier , France.']","['0 (NXF1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid)']",PMC4615294,['NOTNLM'],"['MLV', 'NXF1/Tap', 'RNA export', 'cis-acting RNA element', 'gammaretrovirus', 'intron retention', 'intron-containing RNA', 'nucleocytoplasmic trafficking', 'post-transcriptional gene regulation', 'virus replication']",['10.1080/15476286.2015.1065375 [doi]'],10.1080/15476286.2015.1065375 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response, stakeholders at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, and the Hospital General de Tijuana (HGT) implemented a transcultural partnership to establish a pediatric oncology program. The aim was to improve clinical outcomes and overall survival for children in Baja California. An initial needs assessment evaluation was performed and a culturally sensitive, comprehensive, 5-year plan was designed and implemented. After six years, healthcare system accomplishments include the establishment of a fully functional pediatric oncology unit with 60 new healthcare providers (vs. five in 2007). Patient outcome improvements include a rise in 5-year survival for leukemia from 10 to 43%, a rise in new cases diagnosed per year from 21 to 70, a reduction in the treatment abandonment rate from 10% to 2%, and a 45% decrease in the infection rate. More than 600 patients have benefited from this program. Knowledge sharing has taken place between teams at the HGT and Rady Children's Hospital San Diego. Further, one of the most significant outcomes is that the HGT has transitioned into a regional referral center and now mentors other hospitals in Mexico. Our results show that collaborative initiatives that implement long-term partnerships along the United States-Mexico border can effectively build local capacity and reduce the survival gap between children with cancer in the two nations. Long-term collaborative partnerships should be encouraged across other disciplines in medicine to further reduce health disparities across the United States-Mexico border.","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Peckham Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, University of California San Diego , San Diego, CA , USA ; Reducing Cancer Disparities Program, University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center , La Jolla, CA , USA."", 'University of California San Diego School of Medicine , La Jolla, CA , USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, General Hospital de Tijuana , Tijuana , Mexico.', 'Global Health Program, University of Arizona College of Medicine , Phoenix, AZ , USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital , Memphis, TN , USA."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Peckham Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, University of California San Diego , San Diego, CA , USA ; University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center , La Jolla, CA , USA.""]",,PMC4476311,['NOTNLM'],"['US-Mexico border', 'border health', 'global health', 'health systems strengthening', 'international oncology', 'pediatric cancer', 'transcultural partnership']",['10.3389/fpubh.2015.00159 [doi]'],10.3389/fpubh.2015.00159 [doi],20150622,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T35 HL007491/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The encoded chimeric proteins consist of the N-terminal PAX5 DNA-binding paired domain, which is fused to the C-terminal domains of a remarkable heterogeneous group of partner proteins. RESULTS: Employing fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular methods PAX5-KIAA1549L was identified as novel fusion gene in a case of pediatric BCP-ALL.

The current investigation was undertaken to examine the effectiveness of the combination treatment of Hsp90 inhibitor and SIRT1 inhibitor in inhibiting the growth of chemo-resistant stem-like cells isolated from human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Inhibition of SIRT1 by use of SIRT1 siRNA or SIRT1 inhibitors (amurensin G and EX527) effectively potentiated sensitivity of Hsp90 inhibitors (17-AAG and AUY922) in CD44(high) K562 stem-like cells expressing high levels of CSC-related molecules including Oct4, CD34, beta-catenin, c-Myc, mutant p53 (mut p53), BCRP and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as well as CD44. SIRT1 depletion caused significant down-regulation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)/heat shock proteins (Hsps) as well as these CSC-related molecules, which led to the sensitization of CD44(high) K562 cells to Hsp90 inhibitor by SIRT1 inhibitor. Moreover, 17-AAG-mediated activation of HSF1/Hsps and P-gp-mediated efflux, major causes of Hsp90 inhibitor resistance, was suppressed by SIRT1 inhibitor in K562-CD44(high) cells. Our data suggest that combined treatment with Hsp90 inhibitor and SIRT1 inhibitor could be an effective therapeutic approach to target CSCs that are resistant to current therapies.","['1.

Epub 2015 Jul 9.,"Many cell types release extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, microvesicles (MVs), and apoptotic bodies, which play a role in physiology and diseases. Presence and phenotype of circulating EVs in hematological malignancies (HMs) remain largely unexplored.The aim of this study was to characterize EVs in peripheral blood of HM patients compared to healthy subjects (controls). We isolated serum EVs from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and controls. EVs were isolated from serum of peripheral blood by ultracentrifuge steps and analyzed by flow cytometry to define count, size, and immunophenotype. MV levels were significantly elevated in WM, HL, MM, AML, and some MPNs and, though at a lesser degree, in CLL and NHL as compared to healthy controls. HL, MM, and MPNs generated a population of MVs characterized by lower size (below 0.3 mum) when compared to controls.

Epub 2015 Jul 11.,"INTRODUCTION: Small molecule inhibitors are currently in various stages of preclinical and clinical trials and are expected to revolutionize the treatment of many neoplastic diseases, including B-cell lymphoid malignancies. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the chemical structure, mechanisms of action, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, as well as clinical applications of small molecules in the treatment of elderly patients with B-cell hematological malignancies. Bibliographic research covering mainly the period from 2010 until February 2015 was conducted on the MEDLINE database for articles in English. Proceedings of the American Society of Hematology, European Hematology Association and American Society of Clinical Oncology conferences held during the last 5 years were also included. EXPERT OPINION: In the last few years, several preclinical and clinical trials have evaluated many small weight organic molecules which downregulate B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and act via inhibition of either BCR-associated kinases or cyclin-dependent kinases, or which are antagonists of members of the B-cell lymphoma 2 protein family. Pharmacokinetic profiles of these agents as well as dosage used and adverse events in patients with lymphoid malignancies have been established. Some of these inhibitors satisfy therapeutic modalities as suitable for the elderly patients, including those with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['a 1 Medical University of Lodz, Department of Hematology , Ciolkowskiego 2, Lodz, 93-510, Poland +48 42 689 5191 ; +48 42 689 5192 ; robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell malignancies', 'clinical efficacy', 'dinaciclib', 'fostamatinib', 'ibrutinib', 'idelalisib', 'navitoclax', 'pharmacokinetics', 'small molecules', 'venetoclax']",['10.1517/17425255.2015.1055246 [doi]'],10.1517/17425255.2015.1055246 [doi],20150711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 9.,"Many molecular, epidemiological studies have been performed to explore the association between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and cancer risk. However, the results were inconsistent or even contradictory. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between cancer risk and MTHFR A1298C (81,040 cases and 114,975 controls from 265 studies) polymorphism. Overall, significant association was observed between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and cancer risk when all eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. In further stratified and sensitivity analyses, significantly increased cervical cancer (dominant model: OR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.13-1.90; AC vs. AA: OR 1.48, 95 % CI 1.13-1.92) and lymphoma (dominant model: OR 1.22, 95 % CI 1.04-1.44; recessive model: OR 1.66, 95 % CI 1.15-2.39; CC vs. AA: OR 1.75, 95 % CI 1.21-2.53) risk were observed in Asians, and significantly decreased colorectal cancer risk was found in Asians (recessive model: OR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.59-0.96; CC vs. AA: OR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.60-1.00). In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is associated with increased cervical cancer and lymphoma risk in Asians, and MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is associated with decreased colorectal cancer risk in Asians. Moreover, this meta-analysis also points out the importance of new studies, such as oral cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia, because they had high heterogeneity in this meta-analysis (I (2) > 75 %).","['Department of Radiotherapy, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China.', ""Department of Gastroenterology, The Second People's Hospital of Zhuhai, Zhuhai, 519000, China."", 'Department of Radiotherapy, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China. yansenxiang@yeah.net.', ""Department of Gastroenterology, The Second People's Hospital of Zhuhai, Zhuhai, 519000, China."", 'Department of Radiotherapy, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China. ruixiachang12@163.com.', 'Department of Obstetric, Peace Hospital of Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi, 046000, China.', 'Department of Obstetric, Peace Hospital of Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi, 046000, China.']","['EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'MTHFR', 'Meta-analysis', 'Polymorphism', 'Susceptibility']","['10.1007/s00438-015-1082-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00438-015-1082-y [pii]']",10.1007/s00438-015-1082-y [doi],20150709,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The microtubule-depolymerizing agent vincristine is widely used in the treatment of acute leukemia. In order to decrease toxicity and chemoresistance of vincristine, this study will investigate the effects of combination vincristine and vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)), a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, on human acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia cells. METHODS: Cell viability experiments were determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and cell cycle distributions as well as mitochondria membrane potential were analyzed by flow cytometry. In vitro tubulin polymerization assay was used to test tubulin assembly, and immunofluorescence analysis was performed to detect microtubule distribution and morphology. In vivo effect of the combination was evaluated by a MOLT-4 xenograft model. Statistical analysis was assessed by Bonferroni's t test. RESULTS: Cell viability showed that the combination of vincristine and SAHA exhibited greater cytotoxicity with an IC50 value of 0.88 nM, compared to each drug alone, 3.3 and 840 nM. This combination synergically induced G2/M arrest, followed by an increase in cell number at the sub-G1 phase and caspase activation. Moreover, the results of vincristine combined with an HDAC6 inhibitor (tubastatin A), which acetylated alpha-tubulin, were consistent with the effects of vincristine/SAHA co-treatment, thus suggesting that SAHA may alter microtubule dynamics through HDAC6 inhibition. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the combination of vincristine and SAHA on T cell leukemic cells resulted in a change in microtubule dynamics contributing to M phase arrest followed by induction of the apoptotic pathway. These data suggest that the combination effect of vincristine/SAHA could have an important preclinical basis for future clinical trial testing.","['Pharmacological Institute, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Jen-Ai Road, Sec. 1, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Center for Translational Medicine, Taipei Medical University, No. 250, Wu-hsing Street, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.', 'School of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, No. 250, Wu-hsing Street, Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.', 'Pharmacological Institute, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Jen-Ai Road, Sec. 1, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'The Ph.D. Program for Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, No. 250, Wu-hsing St., Taipei, 11031, Taiwan.', 'The Ph.D. Program for Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, No. 250, Wu-hsing St., Taipei, 11031, Taiwan. slpan@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Pharmacological Institute, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Jen-Ai Road, Sec. 1, Taipei, Taiwan. cmteng@ntu.edu.tw.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",PMC4504084,,,"['10.1186/s13045-015-0176-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-015-0176-7 [pii]']",10.1186/s13045-015-0176-7 [doi],20150710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with breast cancer, metastasis to distant sites directly determines the survival outcome. However, the molecular mechanism underlying metastasis in breast cancer remains to be defined. In this report, we found that Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1) proto-oncogene was differentially expressed between the aggressive MDA-MB231 and the non-aggressive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Congruently, immunohistochemical staining of clinical samples revealed that FLI1 was overexpressed in breast cancers as compared with the adjacent tissues. The abundance of FLI1 protein was strongly correlated with the advanced stage, poor differentiation, and lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients. Knockdown of FLI1 with small interfering RNAs significantly attenuated the potential of migration and invasion in highly metastatic human breast cancer cells. FLI1 oncoprotein activated the Rho GTPase pathway that is known to play a role in tumor metastasis. This study for the first time identifies FLI1 as a clinically and functionally important target gene of metastasis, providing a rationale for developing FLI1 inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer.","['Cancer Center, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stanford University Medical School, VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Cancer Center, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, National Center of Biomedical Analysis, Beijing, China.', 'Cancer Center, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stanford University Medical School, VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Cancer Center, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.']","['0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",PMC4695150,['NOTNLM'],"['FLI1', 'RhoA pathway', 'breast cancer', 'metastasis', 'oncogene']","['4350 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4350 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 8.,"OBJECTIVES: Home is considered the preferred place of death for many, but patients with haematological malignancies (leukaemias, lymphomas and myeloma) die in hospital more often than those with other cancers and the reasons for this are not wholly understood. We examined preferred and actual place of death among people with these diseases. METHODS: The study is embedded within an established population-based cohort of patients with haematological malignancies. All patients diagnosed at two of the largest hospitals in the study area between May 2005 and April 2008 with acute myeloid leukaemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or myeloma, who died before May 2010 were included. Data were obtained from medical records and routine linkage to national death records. RESULTS: 323 deceased patients were included. A total of 142 (44%) had discussed their preferred place of death; 45.8% wanted to die at home, 28.2% in hospital, 16.9% in a hospice, 5.6% in a nursing home and 3.5% were undecided; 63.4% of these died in their preferred place. Compared to patients with evidence of a discussion, those without were twice as likely to have died within a month of diagnosis (14.8% vs 29.8%). Overall, 240 patients died in hospital; those without a discussion were significantly more likely to die in hospital than those who had (p</=0.0001). Of those dying in hospital, 90% and 75.8% received haematology clinical input in the 30 and 7 days before death, respectively, and 40.8% died in haematology areas. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients discussed their preferred place of death, but a substantial proportion did not and hospital deaths were common in this latter group. There is scope to improve practice, particularly among those dying soon after diagnosis. We found evidence that some people opted to die in hospital; the extent to which this compares with other cancers is of interest.","['Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, UK.', 'Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, UK.', 'Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, UK.', 'Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, UK.', ""Queen's Centre for Oncology and Haematology, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull, UK."", 'Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, Hull, UK.', 'York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, York, UK.', 'York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, York, UK.']",,PMC5502252,['NOTNLM'],"['Actual place of death', 'Haematological malignancy', 'Lymphoma', 'Myeloma', 'Preferred place of death']","['bmjspcare-2014-000793 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjspcare-2014-000793 [doi]']",10.1136/bmjspcare-2014-000793 [doi],20150708,,,"['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

This mechanism is associated with chemoresistance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we measured VLA-4 and CXCR4 expressions in leukemic myeloblasts to determine their prognostic implications. Using multicolor flow cytometry, positive VLA-4 and CXCR4 expressions were measured in leukemic myeloblasts in bone marrow aspirates that were obtained from newly diagnosed adult AML patients (n = 98). VLA-4 expression was higher in patients at favorable or intermediate cytogenetic risk than in patients at poor risk (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively), but CXCR4 expression was not significantly different. Among the 72 non-promyelocytic leukemia patients analyzed who received cytarabine + anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy, high VLA-4 expression was independently associated with a high probability of complete remission (p = 0.019) and superior relapse-free survival (RFS) (p < 0.001). However, high CXCR4 expression independently increased the probability of relapse (p = 0.002) and was associated with a shorter RFS (p = 0.006). When categorizing patients into three groups according to VLA-4 and CXCR4 expression levels, the group of high VLA-4 and low CXCR4 showed longer RFS (p = 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.011) than the group of low VLA-4 or high CXCR4.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, 88, Olympic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, 138-736, Korea.']","['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",,,,['10.1007/s00277-015-2442-8 [doi]'],10.1007/s00277-015-2442-8 [doi],20150710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of LIF on renal fibrosis and its underlying mechanism. Our results showed, first, that LIF inhibited collagen type 1 and collagen type 3 expression induced by ANG II in NRK-49F (rat kidney fibroblast) cells and in mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction. Second, LIF induced Stat3 Tyr(705) phosphorylation and inhibited Stat3 Tyr(705) and Ser(727) phosphorylation induced by ANG II in NRK-49F cells. Third, LIF exerted an antirenal fibrosis effect mainly through activation of Stat3 Tyr(705) phosphorylation in NRK-49F cells. These effects of LIF were not observed in Stat3(-/-) cells. Finally, LIF-Stat3 upregulated microRNA-29c expression, and the latter downregulated collagen type 1 and collagen type 3 expression in NRK-49F cells and in mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction. In conclusion, LIF played a role in antirenal fibrosis by competitively activating Stat3 Tyr(705) phosphorylation, which upregulated microRNA-29c to suppress collagen expression.","['Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Shanghai, China yuchen@tongji.edu.cn.', 'Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and.']","['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Collagen Type III)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MIRN29 microRNA, rat)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['extracellular matrix', 'leukemia inhibitor factor', 'microRNA-29c', 'renal fibrosis', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription 3']","['ajprenal.00634.2014 [pii]', '10.1152/ajprenal.00634.2014 [doi]']",10.1152/ajprenal.00634.2014 [doi],20150708,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 the American Physiological Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These approaches are frequently accompanied by unintended and highly toxic collateral damage to healthy tissues, which are offset by only marginal prognostic improvements in patients with advanced cancers. This unfortunate balance has driven the development of novel therapies that aim to target tumors both safely and efficiently. Over the past decade, mounting evidence has supported the therapeutic utility of T-cell-centered cancer immunotherapy, which, in its various iterations, has been shown capable of eliciting highly precise and robust antitumor responses both in animal models and human trials. The identification of tumor-specific targets has further fueled a growing interest in T-cell therapies given their potential to circumvent the non-specific nature of traditional treatments. Of the several strategies geared toward achieving T-cell recognition of tumor, bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) represent a novel class of biologics that have garnered enthusiasm in recent years due to their versatility, specificity, safety, cost, and ease of production. Bispecific T-cell Engagers (BiTEs) are a subclass of bsAbs that are specific for CD3 on one arm and a tumor antigen on the second. As such, BiTEs function by recruiting and activating polyclonal populations of T-cells at tumor sites, and do so without the need for co-stimulation or conventional MHC recognition. Blinatumomab, a well-characterized BiTE, has emerged as a promising recombinant bscCD19xCD3 construct that has demonstrated remarkable antitumor activity in patients with B-cell malignancies. This clinical success has resulted in the rapid extension of BiTE technology against a greater repertoire of tumor antigens and the recent US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) accelerated approval of blinatumomab for the treatment of a rare form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this review, we dissect the role of T-cell therapeutics in the new era of cancer immunotherapy, appraise the value of CAR T-cells in the context of solid tumors, and discuss why the BiTE platform may rescue several of the apparent deficits and shortcomings of competing immunotherapies to support its widespread clinical application.","['Duke Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program; Division of Neurosurgery; Department of Surgery; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA ; Department of Pathology; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA ; The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program; Division of Neurosurgery; Department of Surgery; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA ; The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA ; Department of Biomedical Engineering; Duke University ; Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program; Division of Neurosurgery; Department of Surgery; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA ; The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program; Division of Neurosurgery; Department of Surgery; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA ; The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery; Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School ; Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery; Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School ; Boston, MA, USA.', 'Duke Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program; Division of Neurosurgery; Department of Surgery; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA ; The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program; Division of Neurosurgery; Department of Surgery; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA ; Department of Pathology; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA ; The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center; Duke University Medical Center ; Durham, NC, USA ; Department of Biomedical Engineering; Duke University ; Durham, NC, USA.']",,PMC4485829,['NOTNLM'],"['ACT, adoptive cell therapy', 'AICD, activation induced cell death', 'ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'APC, antigen presenting cell', 'BiTE, bispecific T-cell engager', 'BsAb, bispecific antibody', 'CAR, chimeric antigen receptors', 'CHO, chinese hamster ovary', 'CML, chronic myeloid leukemia', 'GBM, glioblastoma', 'MAb, monoclonal antibody', 'MHC, major histocompatibility complex', 'OS, overall survival', 'ScFv, single chain variable fragment', 'T lymphocytes', 'TAA, tumor associated antigens', 'TCR, T-cell receptor', 'TIL, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes', 'TREG, regulatory T-cells', 'TSA, tumor specific antigens', 'VV, vaccinia virus', 'bispecific antibodies', 'immunotherapy', 'malignancies']","['10.1080/2162402X.2015.1008339 [doi]', '1008339 [pii]']",,20150430,"['F30 CA196199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS085412/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007171/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds were prepared by modifying two naturally occurring antitumor phenols, 5,7-dihydroxy-3-(1'-hydroxy-1'-phenyl-methyl)-6-methoxy-chroman-4-one (A) and 2',4'-dihydroxy-3',6'-dimethoxychalcone (B), previously isolated from Polygonum limbatum Meisn. (Polygonaceae). The structures were elucidated by spectroscopic means and comparison with published data. The cytotoxicity of compounds was determined by using the resazurin assay in the parental drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM cell line and its multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein-over-expressing subline, CEM/ADR5000. RESULTS: We describe in the present paper four new semi-synthetic derivatives of A and B: 5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-7-O-(3'-methylbut-2'-enyl)chroman-4-one (1), trivially named metapchromone, 5-acetoxy-6-methoxy-7-O-[3'-methylbut-2'enyl]chroman-4-one (2), trivially named sargisin, 2'-hydroxy-3',6'-dimethoxy-4'-O-(3''-methylbut-2''-enyl)chalcone (3) trivially named limbachalcone A, and 2'-acetoxy-3',6'-dimethoxy-4'-O-(3''-methylbut-2''-enyl)chalcone (4) trivially named tsedengchalcone. Their preliminary cytotoxic activities have been determined. We also report herein the isolation of 1-methylhydantoin (C) and betulinic acid (D) from Polygonum limbatum for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: The study clearly suggests that semi-synthesis involving O-prenylation and acetylation of chalcones or other chromanones should be avoided in a search for anticancer drugs. This conclusion should be helpful when selecting substituents for the synthesis of potential anticancer drugs.","['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon ; Centro de Analises Proteomicas e Bioquimicas, Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Genomicas e Biotecnologia, Universidade Catolica de Brasilia, Brasilia, DF Brazil ; Dipartimento di Chimica, Laboratorio di Chimica delle Sostanze Organiche Naturali e Centro di Etnobiofarmacia (CISTRE), Universita degli Studi di Pavia, Via Taramelli, 12-27100 Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany ; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Dipartimento di Chimica, Laboratorio di Chimica delle Sostanze Organiche Naturali e Centro di Etnobiofarmacia (CISTRE), Universita degli Studi di Pavia, Via Taramelli, 12-27100 Pavia, Italy.', 'Centro de Analises Proteomicas e Bioquimicas, Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Genomicas e Biotecnologia, Universidade Catolica de Brasilia, Brasilia, DF Brazil ; S-Inova Biotech, Universidade Catolica Dom Bosco, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Quimica, Universidade de Brasilia, Brasilia, DF Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Dipartimento di Chimica, Laboratorio di Chimica delle Sostanze Organiche Naturali e Centro di Etnobiofarmacia (CISTRE), Universita degli Studi di Pavia, Via Taramelli, 12-27100 Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Centro de Analises Proteomicas e Bioquimicas, Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Genomicas e Biotecnologia, Universidade Catolica de Brasilia, Brasilia, DF Brazil ; S-Inova Biotech, Universidade Catolica Dom Bosco, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.']",,PMC4493792,['NOTNLM'],"['LimbachalconeA', 'Metapchromone', 'Phenolic compounds', 'Sargisin', 'Tsedengchalcone']","['10.1186/s13065-015-0115-2 [doi]', '115 [pii]']",10.1186/s13065-015-0115-2 [doi],20150624,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Apr 22.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is difficult to diagnose because it requires histopathology and tissue culture, as well as due to its rapid progression. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is the primary cause of pulmonary mycosis in China, which can occur in patients with neutrophil deficiency, leukaemia or lymphoma, malignant tumours, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with long-term corticosteroid use or bacterial exacerbations. Such fungal infections can lead to disseminated disease and death within weeks, and the mortality rate for untreated invasive aspergillosis is high. Therefore, increased awareness of invasive aspergillosis in non-traditional hosts is warranted due to the high mortality rate experienced by patients with this disease. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis has become a principal cause of life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. Invasive aspergillosis frequently involves the lung parenchyma and is infrequently accompanied by soft tissue lesions. We present an unusual case of a patient with agranulocytosis that was caused by methimazole that was given to control his hyperthyroidism, and IPA that was accompanied by unusual maxillofacial soft tissue swelling that required treatment with voriconazole.

OBJECTIVE: In the current study, we examined whether this peptide inhibits the proliferation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) or not. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fibroblast-like synoviocytes obtained from five RA patients were cultured in the absence or presence of 1, 5, 10 microg/ml of peptide. We used 29-mer scrambled peptide as a control. RESULTS: The peptide inhibited the proliferation of RA FLS dose-dependently. On the other hand, the scrambled peptide showed no inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The peptide inhibits both human osteoclastogenesis and the proliferation of RA FLS. Thus, the peptide may be used for the therapy of both osteoporosis and synovitis of RA patients. This is the first report of the new peptide we discovered, which inhibits both osteoclastogenesis and synovitis. Thus, this new peptide could be a new drug for patients with both osteoporosis and RA.","[""Institute of Rheumatology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Institute of Rheumatology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Institute of Rheumatology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Institute of Rheumatology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Institute of Rheumatology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Institute of Rheumatology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.""]",,PMC4439957,['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell leukemia', 'arthritis', 'osteoclast', 'synovium', 'translocation-associated gene (TCTA)']","['10.5114/ceji.2014.47730 [doi]', '47730 [pii]']",10.5114/ceji.2014.47730 [doi],20141215,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement with ALL at diagnosis, the use of CRT remains common. Children <5 years of age are a particularly challenging subgroup in whom the consequences of CRT can be devastating. PROCEDURE: This study retrospectively describes the overall (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of young children (1-5 years) who were treated for CNS-positive ALL at the Hospital for Sick Children between 2000 and 2013. RESULTS: Of a total of 19 patients, two were treated with upfront CRT, both as part of the conditioning regimen prior to HSCT. All patients received intensification of CNS-directed chemotherapy by triple intra-thecal chemotherapy (84.2%), use of dexamethasone in induction (57.9%) and maintenance (66.7%), and high-dose methotrexate (77.8%). The OS was 84.2 +/- 8.4% and EFS was 79.0 +/- 9.4% with a median follow-up time of 4.3 years (range, 2.6-8.2). The cumulative incidence of CNS relapse was 5.2 +/- 5.1%. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that omission of CRT from the treatment of young children with ALL involving the CNS is associated with acceptable survival and avoids potentially devastating late effects in this group.","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']","['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'long-term survival', 'pediatric oncology', 'radiation therapy']",['10.1002/pbc.25620 [doi]'],10.1002/pbc.25620 [doi],20150707,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Nov;62(11):1877-8.

BACKGROUND DATA: OM related to high-dose chemotherapy is often associated with increased risk of mortality and impaired QoL in HSCT patients. LLLT has shown promising effects in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced OM. There is a dearth of literature focused on subjective aspects involving OM and QoL in patients receiving LLLT. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients were randomly assigned to two groups: control (n=19) and laser (n=20). LLLT was performed from the 1st day of the conditioning regimen until day 7 post-HSCT (D+7). OM severity was evaluated in all patients [World Health Organization (WHO) scale]. A blinded observer collected subjective outcomes from patients on admission (AD), D+7 and at discharge (DC). QoL was assessed using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT) questionnaires. Statistical analyses included descriptive, bivariate and multivariate (generalized estimating equation) tests. RESULTS: The overall FACT-BMT (p=0.074) and OHIP-14 (p=0.749) scores were not associated with the use of laser therapy. Both instruments showed a deterioration in QoL for the whole sample on D+7. The laser group presented less severe OM than the control group (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LLLT did not influence the oral and general health-related QoL of patients undergoing HSCT, although it was clinically effective in reducing the severity of chemotherapy-induced OM.","['1 Faculty of Dentistry, Federal University of Goias , Goias, Brazil .', '2 Department of Stomatology, Faculty of Dentistry, Federal University of Goias , Goias, Brazil .', '2 Department of Stomatology, Faculty of Dentistry, Federal University of Goias , Goias, Brazil .', '3 Department of Pediatric Dentistry and Orthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Federal University of Goias , Goias, Brazil .', '2 Department of Stomatology, Faculty of Dentistry, Federal University of Goias , Goias, Brazil .', '4 Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Araujo Jorge Hospital , Associacao de Combate ao Cancer de Goias, Goiania, Goias, Brazil .']",,,,,['10.1089/pho.2015.3911 [doi]'],10.1089/pho.2015.3911 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accurate diagnosis of HCL relies on the recognition of hairy cells by morphology and flow cytometry in blood and/or bone marrow. However, there are cases difficult to diagnose, particularly in variants of HCL. Furthermore, some diseases such as splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma are very close to HCL and may be misdiagnosed. Major advances in the management of patients who have HCL have been made following the use of purine nucleoside analogs. However, new treatment options can be available in relapsed/refractory HCL: monoclonal antibody therapy, BRAF inhibitors, or immunotoxins. RECENT FINDINGS: The presence of the BRAFV600E mutation was recently identified in most cases of HCL and its absence in variants of HCL and in other B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. The precise cellular origin of HCL remains elusive but BRAF mutations were detected in hematopoietic stem cells of patients with HCL. Assessment for minimal residual disease is important in clinical trials. Minimal residual disease detection can clearly predict inferior long-term outcomes or early relapses in patients with HCL. Recent reports have shown that inhibition of BRAF kinase by drugs such as vemurafenib is effective in relapsed/refractory HCL. Immunotoxins offer new opportunities even in patients without BRAF mutations. SUMMARY: All these findings have major implications for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of HCL and variant forms of HCL.","['aLaboratoire Hematologie bService Hematologie Clinique, CHU Cote de Nacre, Caen, France.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '207SMY3FQT (Vemurafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'W60KTZ3IZY (purine)']",,,,['10.1097/CCO.0000000000000214 [doi]'],10.1097/CCO.0000000000000214 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 94 patients 66 were >/=60, including 26 patients >/=70, and 28 were <60 years old. Early mortality (30-day) was 14% (4%<60, 18%>/=60 years old). Overall, 27% of patients died during hospitalization or were discharged to hospice (11%<60, 33%>/=60 years old). CR/CRi was achieved in 41% of patients (61%<60, 33%>/=60 years old). Median survival was 6.1 months (15.7<60, 5.2>/=60). Patients >/=60 who achieved a CR/CRi had a median survival of 11.7 months. At 12 months 56% of patients <60 were alive versus 24% of patients >/=60. At 24 months these numbers fell to 40% and 2% respectively. In those <60 years old, 50% went on to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) whereas 14% of patients in the >/=60 cohort did so. In conclusion, HAMA salvage therapy results in a 33% response rate in patients >/=60 years old with acceptable toxicity.","['Internal Medicine, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.', 'Internal Medicine, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.', 'Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.', 'Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.', 'Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.', 'Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.', 'Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.', 'Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.', 'Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.', 'Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.', 'Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, United States; Cancer Biology, Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.

Epub 2015 Aug 10.,"Primordial germ cells (PGCs) share many properties with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and innately express several key pluripotency-controlling factors, including OCT4, NANOG, and LIN28. Therefore, PGCs may provide a simple and efficient model for studying somatic cell reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), especially in determining the regulatory mechanisms that fundamentally define pluripotency. Here, we report a novel model of PGC reprogramming to generate iPSCs via transfection with SOX2 and OCT4 using integrative lentiviral. We also show the feasibility of using nonintegrative approaches for generating iPSC from PGCs using only these two factors. We show that human PGCs express endogenous levels of KLF4 and C-MYC protein at levels similar to embryonic germ cells (EGCs) but lower levels of SOX2 and OCT4. Transfection with both SOX2 and OCT4 together was required to induce PGCs to a pluripotent state at an efficiency of 1.71%, and the further addition of C-MYC increased the efficiency to 2.33%. Immunohistochemical analyses of the SO-derived PGC-iPSCs revealed that these cells were more similar to ESCs than EGCs regarding both colony morphology and molecular characterization. Although leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was not required for the generation of PGC-iPSCs like EGCs, the presence of LIF combined with ectopic exposure to C-MYC yielded higher efficiencies. Additionally, the SO-derived PGC-iPSCs exhibited differentiation into representative cell types from all three germ layers in vitro and successfully formed teratomas in vivo. Several lines were generated that were karyotypically stable for up to 24 subcultures. Their derivation efficiency and survival in culture significantly supersedes that of EGCs, demonstrating their utility as a powerful model for studying factors regulating pluripotency in future studies.","['1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland.', '2 Department of Genecology and Obstetrics, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland.', '3 Institute for Cell Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland.', '4 Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland.', '5 JHMI Deep Sequencing and Microarray Core, High Throughput Biology Center, Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore, Maryland.', '1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland.', ""6 Stem Cell Transplantation Program, Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston , Massachusetts."", '7 Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', '8 Harvard Stem Cell Institute , Cambridge, Massachusetts.', '3 Institute for Cell Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland.', '9 Division of Pediatric Oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland.', '10 Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', '11 Department of Animal Biology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', '2 Department of Genecology and Obstetrics, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland.', '12 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Maryland , Baltimore, Maryland.']","['0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (POU5F1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (SOX2 protein, human)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)']",PMC4652187,,,['10.1089/scd.2015.0100 [doi]'],10.1089/scd.2015.0100 [doi],20150810,"['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY023962/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'NICHD R21HD057487/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the best of our knowledge, no study has simultaneously addressed thyroid function, autoimmunity and nodularity. Therefore, we decided to conduct one. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 82 Caucasian patients (36 women and 46 men), who were treated at our Oncology division for hematological malignancies (multiple myeloma, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphatic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and polycythemia vera) and compared them with a control group of 104 patients. Patients who had received or were receiving external head/neck radiotherapy were excluded. All oncological patients and control individuals underwent thyroid ultrasonography and thyroid function and autoimmunity tests. RESULTS: A lower prevalence of enlarged thyroid and nodules were found in patients with respect to controls. The rate of thyroid nodules was the highest in multiple myeloma and polycythemia vera, and the lowest in chronic lymphatic leukemia. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients had the smallest thyroid nodules while men with multiple myeloma the biggest ones. No patient had hypothyroidism, while 5.6% of patients had subclinical hyperthyroidism. In contrast, within the control group the rates of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, overt and subclinical, were 3.8%, 20.2%, 0% and 0% respectively. Moreover, the overall rate of thyroid autoantibody positiveness in patients was significantly lower than controls. CONCLUSION: In our experience, we found a significantly lower prevalence of thyroid abnormalities in hematologic patients who underwent chemotherapy, but not radiotherapy, with respect to controls.","['Department of Human Pathology, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Morphological and Functional Images, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Human Pathology, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Human Pathology, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Human Pathology, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.']",['0 (Thyroid Hormones)'],,,,"['S2359-39972015000300236 [pii]', '10.1590/2359-3997000000044 [doi]']",10.1590/2359-3997000000044 [doi] S2359-39972015000300236 [pii],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Utilising a variety of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) carrying knockout-, revertant- or conditional-EBV recombinants, it was possible to demonstrate unambiguously that EBNA3A and EBNA3C are both required for transactivation of the oncogenic miR-221/miR-222 cluster that is expressed at high levels in multiple human tumours--including lymphoma/leukemia. ChIP, ChIP-seq, and chromosome conformation capture analyses indicate that this activation results from direct targeting of both EBV proteins to chromatin at the miR-221/miR-222 genomic locus and activation via a long-range interaction between enhancer elements and the transcription start site of a long non-coding pri-miR located 28 kb upstream of the miR sequences. Reduced levels of miR-221/miR-222 produced by inactivation or deletion of EBNA3A or EBNA3C resulted in increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57KIP2, a well-established target of miR-221/miR-222. MiR blocking experiments confirmed that miR-221/miR-222 target p57KIP2 expression in LCLs. In contrast, EBNA3A and EBNA3C are necessary to silence the tumour suppressor cluster miR-143/miR-145, but here ChIP-seq suggests that repression is probably indirect. This miR cluster is frequently down-regulated or deleted in human cancer, however, the targets in B cells are unknown. Together these data indicate that EBNA3A and EBNA3C contribute to B cell transformation by inhibiting multiple tumour suppressor proteins, not only by direct repression of protein-encoding genes, but also by the manipulation of host long non-coding pri-miRs and miRs.","['Molecular Virology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular Virology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular Virology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular Virology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular Virology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular Virology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']","['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57)', '0 (EBNA-3A antigen)', '0 (EBNA-3C, epstein-barr virus)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (MIRN221 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN222 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",PMC4496050,,,"['10.1371/journal.ppat.1005031 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-15-00251 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.ppat.1005031 [doi],20150708,"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '099273/Z/12/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no study has simultaneously investigated the plasma levels of IL1beta, IL6, IL13, CCL23 and clusterin in SM at diagnosis and correlated them with disease outcome. Here we investigated IL1beta, IL6, IL13, CCL23 and clusterin plasma levels in 75 SM patients--66 indolent SM (ISM) and 9 aggressive SM--and analyzed their prognostic impact among ISM cases grouped according to the extent of hematopoietic involvement of the bone marrow cells by the KIT D816V mutation. Although increased IL1beta, IL6 and CCL23 levels were detected in SM patients versus healthy controls, only IL6 and CCL23 levels gradually increased with disease severity. Moreover, increased IL6 plasma levels were associated with ISM progression to more aggressive disease, in particular among ISM patients with multilineal KIT mutation (ISM-ML), these patients also showing a higher frequency of organomegalies, versus other ISM-ML patients. Of note, all ISM patients who progressed had increased IL6 plasma levels already at diagnosis. Our results indicate that SM patients display an altered plasma cytokine profile already at diagnosis, increased IL6 plasma levels emerging as an early marker for disease progression among ISM cases, in particular among high-risk ISM patients who carry multilineage KIT mutation.","['Servicio General de Citometria (NUCLEUS), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL and IBSAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Servicio General de Citometria (NUCLEUS), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL and IBSAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Estudios de Mastocitosis de Castilla La Mancha (CLMast), Hospital Virgen del Valle, Toledo, Spain.', 'Servicio General de Citometria (NUCLEUS), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL and IBSAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Estudios de Mastocitosis de Castilla La Mancha (CLMast), Hospital Virgen del Valle, Toledo, Spain.', 'Servicio General de Citometria (NUCLEUS), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL and IBSAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Red Tematica de Investigacion Cooperativa en Envejecimiento y Fragilidad (RETICEF) Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio General de Citometria (NUCLEUS), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL and IBSAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Estudios de Mastocitosis de Castilla La Mancha (CLMast), Hospital Virgen del Valle, Toledo, Spain.', 'Centro de Estudios de Mastocitosis de Castilla La Mancha (CLMast), Hospital Virgen del Valle, Toledo, Spain.', 'Servicio General de Citometria (NUCLEUS), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL and IBSAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio General de Citometria (NUCLEUS), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL and IBSAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio General de Citometria (NUCLEUS), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL and IBSAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio General de Citometria (NUCLEUS), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL and IBSAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio General de Citometria (NUCLEUS), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL and IBSAL) and Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']","['0 (CCL23 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,"['leu2015176 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.176 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.176 [doi],20150708,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 8.,"Deregulated apoptosis is an identifying feature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Whereas apoptosis is increased in the bone marrow (BM) of low-risk MDS patients, progression to high-risk MDS correlates with an acquired resistance to apoptosis and an aberrant expression of BCL-2 proteins. To overcome the acquired apoptotic resistance in high-risk MDS, we investigated the induction of apoptosis by inhibition of pro-survival BCL-2 proteins using the BCL-2/-XL/-W inhibitor ABT-737 or the BCL-2-selective inhibitor ABT-199. We characterized a cohort of 124 primary human BM samples from MDS/secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) patients and 57 healthy, age-matched controls. Inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins was specifically toxic for BM cells from high-risk MDS and sAML patients, whereas low-risk MDS or healthy controls remained unaffected. Notably, ABT-737 or ABT-199 treatment was capable of targeting the MDS stem/progenitor compartment in high-risk MDS/sAML samples as shown by the reduction in CD34(+) cells and the decreased colony-forming capacity. Elevated expression of MCL-1 conveyed resistance against both compounds. Protection by stromal cells only partially inhibited induction of apoptosis. Collectively, our data show that the apoptotic resistance observed in high-risk MDS/sAML cells can be overcome by the ABT-737 or ABT-199 treatment and implies that BH3 mimetics might delay disease progression in higher-risk MDS or sAML patients.","['III.

Epub 2015 Aug 6.,"We report the second case of cutaneous myelofibrosis with a documented JAK2 activating mutation involving the scalp of a 67-year-old woman with primary myelofibrosis in her marrow. In contrast to the previous case, the biopsy revealed extensive lesional collagen deposition and closely mimicked a fibrohistiocytic proliferation. Similar rare lesions occurring in the setting of myeloproliferative neoplasms have been called sclerosing extramedullary hematopoietic tumors. These entities appear histomorphologically and etiologically distinct from extramedullary hematopoiesis, and their diagnosis should prompt the workup for a myeloproliferative neoplasm in the absence of an antecedent diagnosis. The presence of the JAK2 mutation in our case confirmed that the lesions represented skin involvement by a neoplastic myeloid proliferation and not compensatory extramedullary hematopoiesis. Our patient died of disease several months following the appearance of her lesions, which is in keeping with other reports that suggest that cutaneous myelofibrosis may serve as an independent poor prognostic sign in otherwise advanced primary myelofibrosis. A review of the literature further emphasizes the importance of distinguishing this entity from mesenchymal neoplasms and acute myeloid leukemia involving the skin.","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.']","['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK2', 'cutaneous myelofibrosis', 'extramedullary hematopoiesis', 'myeloproliferative neoplasia', 'sclerosing extramedullary hematopoietic tumor']",['10.1111/cup.12553 [doi]'],10.1111/cup.12553 [doi],20150806,,,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2015 Jul 7.,"In developing lymphocytes, expression and activity of the recombination activation gene protein 1 (RAG1) and RAG2 endonuclease complex is tightly regulated to ensure ordered recombination of the immunoglobulin genes and to avoid genomic instability. Aberrant RAG activity has been implicated in the generation of secondary genetic events in human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs), illustrating the oncogenic potential of the RAG complex. Several layers of regulation prevent collateral genomic DNA damage by restricting RAG activity to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In this study, we show a novel pathway that suppresses RAG expression in cycling-transformed mouse pre-B cells and human pre-B B-ALL cells that involves the negative regulation of FOXO1 by nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Inhibition of NF-kappaB in cycling pre-B cells resulted in upregulation of RAG expression and recombination activity, which provoked RAG-dependent DNA damage. In agreement, we observe a negative correlation between NF-kappaB activity and the expression of RAG1, RAG2, and TdT in B-ALL patients. Our data suggest that targeting NF-kappaB in B-ALL increases the risk of RAG-dependent genomic instability.","['Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxo1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RAG2 protein, human)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",PMC4671331,,,"['S0006-4971(20)30933-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-01-621623 [doi]']",10.1182/blood-2015-01-621623 [doi],20150707,,,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6894-3441'],,

Epub 2015 Jul 11.,"INTRODUCTION: Over the last few years, several new immunological drugs, particularly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), immunomodulatory drugs and B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors have been developed and investigated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This article summarizes recent discoveries regarding their mechanism of action, pharmacological properties, clinical activity and toxicity, as well as the emerging role of these agents in CLL. AREAS COVERED: A literature review of mAbs, BCR pathway inhibitors and immunomodulating drugs was conducted of the MEDLINE database via PubMed for articles in English. Publications from 2000 through February 2015 were scrutinized. The search terms used were alemtuzumab, BI 836826, duvelisib ibrutinib, idelalisib, lenalidomide, monoclonal antibodies, MEDI-551, MOR208, obinutuzumab, ocaratuzumab, ofatumumab, ONO-4059, otlertuzumab, spebrutinib, veltuzumab and XmAb5574 in conjunction with CLL. Conference proceedings from the previous 5 years of the American Society of Hematology, European Hematology Association, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and ACR/ARHP Annual Scientific Meetings were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles. EXPERT OPINION: The use of mAbs, BCR inhibitors and immunomodulating drugs is a promising new strategy for chemotherapy-free treatment of CLL. However, definitive data from ongoing and future clinical trials will aid in better defining the status of immunological drugs in the treatment of this disease.","['a Medical University of Lodz, Departments of Experimental Hematology and Hematology, Copernicus Memorial Hospital , 93-510 Lodz, Ul.

Epub 2015 Jul 6.,"INTRODUCTION: High-dose methotrexate (doses >/=1 g/m(2)) is a key component of several chemotherapy regimens used to treat patients with leukemia or lymphoma. Despite appropriate precautions with hydration, urine alkalinization, and leucovorin, nephrotoxicity remains a risk which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Current reports of risk factors for nephrotoxicity focus on patients with nephrotoxicity with a lack of comparison to those without toxicity. This study aimed to describe the incidence of high-dose methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity at our institution and determined risk factors for high-dose methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity by examining characteristics of patients with and without nephrotoxicity. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, chart review. Adult patients with a diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma who received high-dose methotrexate were included. Serum creatinine values were used to evaluate nephrotoxicity according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria v4.03. Data related to the following proposed risk factors were collected: age, sex, body mass index, methotrexate dose, number of high-dose methotrexate exposures, leucovorin administration route, baseline renal function, albumin, hydration status, Clostridium difficile infection, urine pH, and concomitant interacting and nephrotoxic medications. The primary endpoint was evaluated with exact binomial methods and risk factors were identified using multivariable random-effects logistic regression. RESULTS: Final analyses included 140 patients with 432 high-dose methotrexate exposures. There were no differences in baseline demographical characteristics. Fifty-four patients (38.6%) experienced nephrotoxicity of any grade: 27.9% with grade 1, 5.7% with grade 2, 3.6% grade 3, 0% with grade 4, and 1.4% with grade 5 toxicity. More patients in the toxicity group received doses of methotrexate >/=3 g/m(2) (58.3% versus 57.2%, p < 0.001), had an albumin level <3 g/dL (31.9% versus 15.9%, p = 0.04), and received an interacting medication during high-dose methotrexate clearance (44.4% versus 24.7%, p = 0.003). Male gender (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.27-4.18, p = 0.006), albumin (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.26-0.75, p = 0.002), number of drug interactions (OR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.15-2.21, p = 0.005), and use of furosemide (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.46-4.48, p = 0.001) were all independent risk factors for the development of nephrotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Nephrotoxicity is a possible complication of therapy with high-dose methotrexate with most instances comprising grade 1-2 toxicity. Male gender, low albumin, and administration of interacting drugs or furosemide during high-dose methotrexate clearance may predispose patients to nephrotoxicity.","['Department of Pharmacy, The James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA Tracy.Wiczer@osumc.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, The James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['High-dose methotrexate', 'drug interactions', 'methotrexate toxicity', 'nephrotoxicity', 'renal toxicity', 'risk factors']","['1078155215594417 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155215594417 [doi]']",10.1177/1078155215594417 [doi],20150706,,,['(c) The Author(s) 2015.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present for the first time a retrospective analysis of low-risk MDS with isolated del5q treated with lenalidomide, outside the clinical trials. METHODS: 36 red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients have been included in the study. Patients received lenalidomide 10 mg/day on days 1-21 of 28-day cycles. RESULTS: 91.7 % of patients responded to lenalidomide treatment: 72.2 % achieved erythroid response, 19.4 % achieved minor erythroid response and 8.4 % of patients did not respond to treatment. Response depended on number of previous treatment lines (p = 0.0101), International Prognostic System Score (IPSS; p = 0.0067) and RBC transfusion frequency (p = 0.0139). Median duration of response was 16 months (range 6-60 months). Treatment was well tolerated. We observed hematological toxicity (grade 3 and 4): neutropenia in 16 (44.4 %) patients and thrombocytopenia in 9 (25 %) patients.

This is an area of interest given the high survival rate and, thus, the long disease-free period that these patients face. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a retrospective study following a cohort of patients between 1973 and 2011. Using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Result (SEER) database, we identified patients with an ovarian malignant tumor diagnosed at 19 years of age or younger. RESULTS: Of the 806 patients included in our study, 28 patients developed an SPT after the diagnosis of malignant ovarian tumor. This cohort had higher risk of solid tumors (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 1.85, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.83) and lymphohematologic malignancies (SIR 5.28, 95% CI 2.12 to 10.88) compared with the general population. There is a higher incidence of lymphoma (SIR 4.25, 95% CI 1.16 to 10.89) and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (SIR 19.65, 95% CI 4.05 to 57.42), following initial diagnosis of ovarian malignancy during childhood or adolescence. CONCLUSION: The association between ovarian malignancy during childhood or adolescence and lymphoma has not been previously described. Increased incidence of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia supports previous data, underlying the need for long-term follow-up and surveillance of these patients.","['Department of Gynecology, General Military Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.', 'Department of Science for Woman and Child Health, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.

The incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of PGF have not been well described, especially in the haploidentical SCT setting. We retrospectively reviewed patients who received haploidentical SCT at Peking University Institute of Hematology between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012. PGF was defined as persistent neutropenia (</=0.5 x 10(9) L(-1)), thrombocytopenia (platelets </=20 x 10(9) L(-1)), and/or hemoglobin </=70 g L(-1) after engraftment with hypocellular bone marrow and full donor chimerism, without concurrent graft-versus-host disease or disease relapse. Incidence was calculated from all patients. Of the 464 total patients, 26 (5.6 %) developed primary PGF. The risk factors were analyzed and compared with control patients with good graft function who were selected using the case-pair method. Finally, 104 patients were selected as a control group according to the matching conditions: (1) the type (acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)) and status (standard risk, high risk) of underlying disease, (2) sex, (3) year in which the transplantation was received, and (4) a 1:4 ratio of case-control. No factors were found to be associated with primary PGF. Compared to cases with good graft function, patients with primary PGF experienced poor overall survival (34.6 vs. 82.7 %, p < 0.001). Of the 26 primary PGF patients, only nine achieved hematopoietic recovery and survived. In conclusion, primary PGF is a rare but life-threatening complication after haploidentical SCT, and effective therapies need to be explored.","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for the Treatment of Hematological Diseases, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,['10.1007/s00277-015-2440-x [doi]'],10.1007/s00277-015-2440-x [doi],20150709,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, OCT4 has relationship with poor prognosis in a lot of solid tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, and esophageal cancer. In our study, we investigated the expression status of OCT4 and its clinical significance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using real-time quantitative PCR. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve reveals that the level of OCT4 expression could be available for a potential diagnostic biomarker for differentiating AML from controls with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.915 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.837-0.992; P < 0.001). At the cutoff value of 0.56, the sensitivity and the specificity are 75.9 and 81.2 %, respectively. The amount of white blood cell (WBC) of patients with high OCT4 expression is higher than that of patients with low OCT4 expression (18.2 x 10(9) versus 2.7 x 10(9) L(-1), P = 0.001).

Epub 2015 Jul 7.,"Several variants in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) at the SP140 locus have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), Crohn's disease (CD) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To determine the causal polymorphism, we have integrated high-density data sets of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), using GEUVADIS RNA sequences and 1000 Genomes genotypes, with MS-risk variants of the high-density Immunochip array performed by the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetic Consortium (IMSGC). The variants most associated with MS were also correlated with a decreased expression of the full-length RNA isoform of SP140 and an increase of an isoform lacking exon 7. By exon splicing assay, we have demonstrated that the rs28445040 variant was the causal factor for skipping of exon 7. Western blots of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MS patients showed a significant allele-dependent reduction of the SP140 protein expression. To confirm the association of this functional variant with MS and to compare it with the best-associated variant previously reported by GWAS (rs10201872), a case-control study including 4384 MS patients and 3197 controls was performed. Both variants, in strong LD (r(2) = 0.93), were found similarly associated with MS [P-values, odds ratios: 1.9E-9, OR = 1.35 (1.22-1.49) and 4.9E-10, OR = 1.37 (1.24-1.51), respectively]. In conclusion, our data uncover the causal variant for the SP140 locus and the molecular mechanism associated with MS risk. In addition, this study and others previously reported strongly suggest that this functional variant may be shared with other immune-mediated diseases as CD and CLL.","['Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez Neyra (IPBLN), CSIC, Granada, Spain, lindo@ipb.csic.es pulgoso@ipb.csic.es.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez Neyra (IPBLN), CSIC, Granada, Spain, Department of Computer Languages and Systems-CITIC, Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez Neyra (IPBLN), CSIC, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology and.', 'Department of Computer Languages and Systems-CITIC, Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez Neyra (IPBLN), CSIC, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Immunology, Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez Neyra (IPBLN), CSIC, Granada, Spain.', 'Unidad de Esclerosis Multiple, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Unidad de Esclerosis Multiple, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Unidad de Esclerosis Multiple, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Servicio de Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Hospital Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Unidad de Gestion Clinica de Neurociencias, Instituto de Biomedicina de Malaga (IBIMA), Hospital Regional Universitario de Malaga, Malaga, Spain.', 'Unidad de Gestion Clinica de Neurociencias, Instituto de Biomedicina de Malaga (IBIMA), Hospital Regional Universitario de Malaga, Malaga, Spain.', 'Area de Neurociencias, Inst.

Epub 2015 Jul 7.,"HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of Adult T cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL) and of HTLV-1-Associated Myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). It is mainly detected in CD4+ lymphocytes in vivo, but proviral genomes have also been detected although less frequently, in CD8+ T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and other non-lymphoid cells. Virus spread is highly dependent on cell-cell contact. This mode of transmission is correlated with an increased ability of infected cells to migrate, a property linked to cytoskeleton reorganization induced by the viral Tax protein. Cell-to-cell transmission relies on at least three non-exclusive molecular pathways. First, a specialized area, the ""virological synapse'' (VS) promotes direct transmission of budding HTLV-1 particles into a synaptic cleft formed between infected and uninfected cells. Second, HTLV-1 particles accumulate at the plasma membrane of infected cells in a biofilm-like extracellular viral assembly that resembles a bacterial biofilm. Viral biofilm is rapidly transmitted to uninfected cells when infected cells contact target cells. Finally, membrane extensions called inter-cellular conduits facilitate HTLV-1 proteins transfer from infected to uninfected target cells, and may stabilize cell-cell contacts. The aim of this review is to summarize the molecular mechanisms of these HTLV-1 transmission pathways.","[""Equipe oncogenese retrovirale ; equipe labellisee Ligue nationale contre le cancer ; centre international de recherche en infectiologie, Inserm U1111-CNRS UMR5308, Lyon, France - Ecole normale superieure de Lyon, 46, allee d'Italie, 69007 Lyon, France - Universite Lyon 1, Lyon Cedex 07, 69364, France."", ""Equipe oncogenese retrovirale ; equipe labellisee Ligue nationale contre le cancer ; centre international de recherche en infectiologie, Inserm U1111-CNRS UMR5308, Lyon, France - Ecole normale superieure de Lyon, 46, allee d'Italie, 69007 Lyon, France - Universite Lyon 1, Lyon Cedex 07, 69364, France."", ""Equipe oncogenese retrovirale ; equipe labellisee Ligue nationale contre le cancer ; centre international de recherche en infectiologie, Inserm U1111-CNRS UMR5308, Lyon, France - Ecole normale superieure de Lyon, 46, allee d'Italie, 69007 Lyon, France - Universite Lyon 1, Lyon Cedex 07, 69364, France.""]",,,,,"['10.1051/medsci/20153106016 [doi]', 'medsci2015316-7p629 [pii]']",10.1051/medsci/20153106016 [doi],20150707,,,['(c) 2015 medecine/sciences - Inserm.'],,,,,,,,,Transmission intercellulaire de HTLV-1--Des mecanismes loin d'etre completement elucides.,,,,,,,,

AID accomplishes this task by directly deaminating cytosines within the genomic immunoglobulin locus, thereby triggering a complex mutagenic process eventually leading to improved effector function of antibodies. However, it has long been noticed that AID can be aberrantly expressed in cancer and that its activity is not absolutely restricted to antibody genes, as substantial genome-wide off-target mutations have been observed, which contribute to tumorigenesis and clonal evolution of AID-expressing malignancies. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Montamat-Sicotte et al. [Eur. J.

Replicate RT-qPCR had shown increased sensitivity in tyrosine kinase inhibitor-treated patients and was, therefore, used here to evaluate whether RT-qPCR-negative post-allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) patients harbor detectable disease. Samples from 12 patients were tested at 2 time points using 82 replicates of BCR-ABL RT-qPCR. One patient (38 months after SCT) had detectable transcripts at baseline and none at the follow-up test, done at a median of 107 months after SCT.

Epub 2015 Jul 4.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Polytrichum commune L.ex Hedw (PCLH), a moss of Bryopsida, has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine and shown to possess anticancer activities. Previous studies have indicated its anti-leukemia effect but the potential mechanisms have not been fully explained. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aimed to further investigate the efficacy of PCLH ethyl acetate fraction (PC-EEF) and the associated mechanisms in human leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phytochemical analysis of PC-EEF was performed by spectrophotometry and HPLC. MTT analysis and trypan blue exclusion assay were adopted to examine its cytotoxicity on a panel of leukemia cells (K562, U937, HL-60 and K562/DOX cells) and non-cancerous cells (human PBMCs). Anti-proliferative effect was monitored by colony formation assay and EdU incorporation assay. Ultrastructural alterations on K562 cell membrane surface were observed by scanning electron microscopy. Changes on plasma membrane integrity, cell membrane potential, mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Fluorescence microscope was performed to assess [Ca(2+)]i level, mitochondrial injury and cytochrome c release. Apoptosis-associated protein expression was analyzed by western blot. The role of Ca(2+) in PC-EEF-induced cell death was investigated by Ca(2+) chelating reagent BAPTA-AM. RESULTS: PC-EEF possessed relatively high flavonoid content (about 88.84 +/- 0.89%) and showed significant cytotoxicity to human leukemia cells. PC-EEF could cause obvious cell morphological deformation, membrane integrity loss and membrane depolarization. Meanwhile, PC-EEF treatment could dramatically potentiate perturbations in cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. Subsequently, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse, cytochrome c release and Bcl-2/Bax down-regulation were all observed. Consistent with these results, PC-EEF treatment resulted in significant activation of caspase 3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) degradation and apoptosis. Moreover, PC-EEF-caused cytotoxicity, membrane damage, mitochondrial injury and apoptosis were remarkably reversed by BAPTA-AM. CONCLUSIONS: PC-EEF damaged the membrane system and triggered Ca(2+)-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis, which may provide some new insights into its efficacy against human leukemia cells.","[""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.

The sulforhodamine B (SRB) in vitro cytotoxicity assay, sarcoma-180 (S-180) ascites and solid tumor, and L1210 lymphoid leukemia in vivo models were used to investigate the anticancer activity of root extracts of Aristolochia ringens Vahl. (Aristolochiaceae; ma dou ling). AR-A001 (IC50 values of 20 mug/mL, 22 mug/mL, 3 mug/mL, and 24 mug/mL for A549, HCT-116, PC3, and THP-1 cell lines, respectively), and AR-A004 (IC50 values of 26 mug/mL, 19.5 mug/mL, 12 mug/mL, 28 mug/mL, 30 mug/mL, and 22 mug/mL for A549, HCT-116, PC3, A431, HeLa, and THP-1, respectively), were observed to be significantly active in vitro. Potency was highest with AR-A001 and AR-A004 for PC3 with IC50 values of 3 mug/mL and 12 mug/mL, respectively. AR-A001 and AR-A004 produced significant (p < 0.05-0.001) dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in the S-180 ascites model with peak effects produced at the highest dose of 120 mg/kg. Inhibition values were 79.51% and 89.98% for AR-A001 and AR-A004, respectively. In the S-180 solid tumor model, the inhibition of tumor growth was 29.45% and 50.50% for AR-A001 (120 mg/kg) and AR-A004 (110 mg/kg), respectively, compared to 50.18% for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 20 mg/kg). AR-A001 and AR-A004 were also significantly active in the leukemia model with 211.11% and 155.56% increase in mean survival time (MST) compared to a value of 211.11% for 5-FU.

Ibrutinib is a first-in-class, oral inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, which functions by irreversible inhibition of the downstream signaling pathway of the B-cell receptor, which normally promotes cell survival and proliferation. Early clinical trials have demonstrated excellent tolerability and a modest side-effect profile even in elderly and multiply pretreated patient cohorts. Although the majority of disease responses tend to be partial, efficacy data have also been encouraging with more than two-thirds of patients with CLL and MCL demonstrating a durable response, even in the high-risk disease setting. Resistance mechanisms are only partially understood and appear to be multifactorial, including the binding site mutation C481S, and escape through other common cell-signaling pathways. This article appraises the currently available data on safety and efficacy from clinical trials of ibrutinib in the management of MCL and CLL, both as a single agent and in combination with other therapies, and considers how this drug is likely to be used in future clinical practice.","['Department of Haematology, Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Plymouth, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Plymouth, UK.']",,PMC4484687,['NOTNLM'],"[""Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ibrutinib', 'lymphoproliferative disorders', 'mantle cell lymphoma']","['10.2147/TCRM.S73559 [doi]', 'tcrm-11-979 [pii]']",10.2147/TCRM.S73559 [doi],20150623,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 6.,"PURPOSE: To characterize psychological and neurocognitive function in long-term cancer survivors diagnosed during adolescence and early young adulthood (AeYA). METHODS: Six thousand one hundred ninety-two survivors and 390 siblings in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study completed the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 and a Neurocognitive Questionnaire. Treatment and demographic predictors were examined, and associations with social attainment (employment, education, and living independently) were evaluated. Logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% CIs. RESULTS: Among survivors, 2,589 were diagnosed when AeYA (11 to 21 years old). Adjusted for current age and sex, these survivors, compared with siblings, self-reported higher rates of depression (11.7% v 8.0%, respectively; OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.30) and anxiety (7.4% v 4.4%, respectively; OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.17 to 3.43) and more problems with task efficiency (17.2% v 10.8%, respectively; OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.43), emotional regulation (19.1% v 14.1%, respectively; OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.26 to 2.40), and memory (25.9% v 19.0%, respectively; OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.89). Few differences were noted between survivors diagnosed with leukemia or CNS tumor before 11 years old versus during later adolescence, although those diagnosed with lymphoma or sarcoma during AeYA were at reduced risk for self-reported psychosocial and neurocognitive problems. Unemployment was associated with self-reports of impaired task efficiency (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 2.28 to 3.77), somatization (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.77 to 2.98), and depression (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.43 to 2.63). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that risk for poor functional outcome is not limited to survivors' diagnoses in early childhood. AeYA is a critical period of development, and cancer during this period can impact neurocognitive and emotional function and disrupt vocational attainment.","[""Pinki K.

One year after surgery, he remains free of both thymoma and thymic carcinoma, and T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma remains complete remission under maintenance therapy. Thymoma and T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma can combine in the same mass, although this is quite rare. At the time of the diagnosis of thymoma, additional attention should be directed toward lymphocytes in the background.","['Division of Pathology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Pathology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Pathology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Thoracic Surgery, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Thoracic Surgery, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Pathology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.

The study aimed to compare measures of clinical treatment for patients with AML in CR1 (the first complete remission) with or without being subjected to allo-HSCT. These consisted of leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and non-relapse mortality disease (NRM). Subjects were 622 patients, median age of 44, forming part of the prospective, randomized, and multicenter clinical Polish Adult Leukemia Group trials during 1999-2008. The Mantel-Byar approach was used to assess allo-HSCT on survival endpoints, accounting for a changing transplant status. Undergoing allo-HSCT significantly improved the LFS and OS for the entire group of patients with AML in CR1, along with the DAC induction subgroup and for the group with unfavorable cytogenetics aged 41-60. The CIR demonstrated that allo-HSCT reduced the risk of relapse for patients with AML in CR1 and those with an unfavorable cytogenetic risk. In addition, the NRM analysis showed that allo-HSCT significantly reduced the risk of death unrelated to relapse for the entire group of AML patients in CR1 and aged 41-60.

Epub 2015 Jul 6.,"The Fanconi Anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway is essential for the recognition and repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL). Inefficient repair of these ICL can lead to leukemia and bone marrow failure. A critical step in the pathway is the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 by the RING E3 ligase FANCL. FANCL comprises 3 domains, a RING domain that interacts with E2 conjugating enzymes, a central domain required for substrate interaction, and an N-terminal E2-like fold (ELF) domain. The ELF domain is found in all FANCL homologues, yet the function of the domain remains unknown. We report here that the ELF domain of FANCL is required to mediate a non-covalent interaction between FANCL and ubiquitin. The interaction involves the canonical Ile44 patch on ubiquitin, and a functionally conserved patch on FANCL. We show that the interaction is not necessary for the recognition of the core complex, it does not enhance the interaction between FANCL and Ube2T, and is not required for FANCD2 monoubiquitination in vitro. However, we demonstrate that the ELF domain is required to promote efficient DNA damage-induced FANCD2 monoubiquitination in vertebrate cells, suggesting an important function of ubiquitin binding by FANCL in vivo.","[""Protein Structure and Function Laboratory, Lincoln's Inn Fields Laboratories of the London Research Institute, Cancer Research, United Kingdom, 44 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3LY, United Kingdom."", 'Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dow Street, Dundee DD1 5EH, United Kingdom.', 'Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dow Street, Dundee DD1 5EH, United Kingdom; Scottish Institute for Cell Signalling, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dow Street, Dundee DD1 5EH, United Kingdom.', 'Protein Science Group, School of Biosciences, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent CT2 7NZ, United Kingdom.', 'Protein Science Group, School of Biosciences, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent CT2 7NZ, United Kingdom.', ""Protein Structure and Function Laboratory, Lincoln's Inn Fields Laboratories of the London Research Institute, Cancer Research, United Kingdom, 44 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3LY, United Kingdom."", 'Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dow Street, Dundee DD1 5EH, United Kingdom.', 'Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dow Street, Dundee DD1 5EH, United Kingdom; Scottish Institute for Cell Signalling, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dow Street, Dundee DD1 5EH, United Kingdom.

More than 95 % of BCR-ABL1 transcripts in CML are either e13a2 or e14a2 (major breakpoint cluster region or M-bcr), whereas rare BCR-ABL1 transcripts are occasionally observed, accounting for less than 1 % of CML cases. Among these, a very rare fusion transcript joining the first 6 exons of BCR to exon 2 of ABL1 (e6a2) has been reported in various hematological malignancies characterized by an aggressive clinical course. We report a new case of blast crisis (BC) CML with an e6a2 fusion transcript characterized by many eosinophil precursors with abnormal granules. Moreover, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed genomic deletions of 1.3 megabases and 342 kilobases on der(9) of chromosome 9 and 22 sequences, respectively. The fusion transcript was quantified at diagnosis and during follow-up using digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) technology. The patient was treated with Dasatinib (140 mg/day), resulting in a 3-log reduction of the e6a2 transcript molecular burden from the third month after treatment. In this twentieth e6a2 case, characterized by marked eosinophilic dysplasia, deletions on der(9), and responsive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy, we demonstrate that for molecular response monitoring of rare fusion transcripts associated with CML, ddPCR is a very useful technology.","['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, P.zza G.

ARTD1 has been shown to coregulate the inflammatory response by modulating the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), the principal regulator of interleukin 6 (IL-6), an important inflammatory cytokine implicated in a variety of diseases such as cancer. However, to what extent and how ARTD1 regulates IL-6 transcription has not been clear. Here, we show that ARTD1 suppresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-6 expression in macrophages, without affecting the recruitment of the NF-kappaB subunit RelA to the IL-6 promoter and independent of its enzymatic activity. Interestingly, knockdown of ARTD1 did not alter H3 occupancy but increased LPS-induced trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a hallmark of transcriptionally active genes. We found that ARTD1 mediates its effect through the methyltransferase MLL1, by catalyzing H3K4me3 at the IL-6 promoter and forming a complex with NF-kappaB. These results demonstrate that ARTD1 modulates IL-6 expression by regulating the function of an NF-kappaB enhanceosome complex, which involves MLL1 and does not require ADP-ribosylation.","['Institute of Veterinary Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Veterinary Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland Life Science Zurich Graduate School, Molecular Life Science Program, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Veterinary Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland hottiger@vetbio.uzh.ch.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Rela protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Kdm5b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Parp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",PMC4539373,,,"['MCB.00196-15 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00196-15 [doi]']",10.1128/MCB.00196-15 [doi],20150706,,,"['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Epub 2015 Jul 7.,"Current demand for understanding the behavior of groups of related genes, combined with the greater availability of data, has led to an increased focus on statistical methods in gene set analysis. In this paper, we aim to perform a critical appraisal of the methodology based on graphical models developed in Massa et al. (2010) that uses pathway signaling networks as a starting point to develop statistically sound procedures for gene set analysis. We pay attention to the potential of the methodology with respect to the organizational aspects of dealing with such complex but highly informative starting structures, that is pathways. We focus on three themes: the translation of a biological pathway into a graph suitable for modeling, the role of shrinkage when more genes than samples are obtained, the evaluation of respondence of the statistical models to the biological expectations. To study the impact of shrinkage, two simulation studies will be run. To evaluate the biological expectation we will use data from a network with known behavior that offer the possibility of carrying out a realistic check of respondence of the model to changes in the experimental conditions.","['Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Padua, via Cesare Battisti 241, 35121 Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Padua, via Cesare Battisti 241, 35121 Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, 1 South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3TG, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Biology, University of Padua, Via Ugo Bassi 58/B, 35121 Padova, Italy.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Gene set analysis', 'Graphical modeling', 'Pathways']",['10.1002/bimj.201300287 [doi]'],10.1002/bimj.201300287 [doi],20150707,,,"['(c) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In spite of the well-documented effectiveness of BCR-ABL inhibitors in treating chronic myeloid leukemia, development of resistance is a continuous clinical challenge. Transporters that facilitate drug uptake and efflux have been proposed as one potential source of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Our aim was to determine which carriers are responsible for bosutinib transport. METHODS: K562S cells overexpressing the drug transporters ABCB1, ABCG2, and SLC22A1 were generated, characterized and used in proliferation assay and intracellular uptake and retention assay (IUR). In vivo experiments were performed in nude mice injected with K562S, K562DOX cells (overexpressing ABCB1), and K562DOX silenced for ABCB1 (K562DOX/sh P-GP). RESULTS: The IUR assay using C-14 bosutinib showed that only ABCB1 was responsible for active bosutinib transport. K562DOX cells showed the lowest intracellular level of bosutinib, while K562DOX cells treated with the ABCB1 inhibitor verapamil showed intracellular bosutinib levels comparable with parental K562S. Proliferation assays demonstrated that K562DOX are resistant to bosutinib treatment while verapamil is able to restore the sensitivity to the drug. Nude mice injected with K562DOX and treated with bosutinib showed very limited response and quickly relapsed after stopping treatment while K562S as well as K562DOX/sh P-GP remained tumor-free. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the analysis of ABCB1 expression levels might help determine treatment options for patients exhibiting resistance to bosutinib.","['Department of Health sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, S.Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. sara.redaelli@unimib.it.', 'Department of Health sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, S.Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. perini.pietro@gmail.com.', 'Department of Health sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, S.Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. monica.ceccon@unimib.it.', 'Department of Health sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, S.Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. rocco.piazza@unimib.it.', 'Department of Surgery and Translational Medicine, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy. roberta.rigolio@unimib.it.', 'Department of Health sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, S.Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. mario.mauri@unimib.it.', 'Department of Oncology, Pfizer Research, Pearl River, New City, NY, USA. fboschelli@icloud.com.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.

Therefore, a rapid and sensitive one-step RT-nested PCR was developed that could be performed in a single tube using a droplet-PCR machine. METHODS: The K562 BCR-ABL mRNA-positive cell line as well as bone marrow aspirates from 5 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and 5 controls without CML were used. We evaluated one-step RT-nested PCR using the droplet-PCR machine. RESULTS: One-step RT-nested PCR performed in a single tube using the droplet-PCR machine enabled the detection of BCR-ABL mRNA within 40min, which was 10(3)-fold superior to conventional RT nested PCR using three steps in separate tubes. The sensitivity of the one-step RT-nested PCR was 0.001%, with sample reactivity comparable to that of the conventional assay. CONCLUSIONS: One-step RT-nested PCR was developed using the droplet-PCR machine, which enabled all reactions to be performed in a single tube accurately and rapidly and with high sensitivity. This one-step RT-nested PCR may be applicable to a wide spectrum of genetic tests in clinical laboratories.","['Graduate School of Science and Technology, Shinshu University, Nagano, Japan; Core Technology Development Center, Seiko Epson Corporation, Suwa, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shinshu University Hospital, Matsumoto, Japan.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty young adult (aged over 16 years) with ALL, at the beginning of maintenance course of their chemotherapy, were recruited to the study. The study population was randomized in a double blind manner to receive either taurine or placebo. Life quality and adverse drug reactions were assessed using questionnaire. Blood cell count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), serum bilirubin, transaminases, urea, and creatinine concentrations were evaluated. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. RESULTS: Of total participants, 43.8% were female and 56.3% were male. The mean age was 19.16 +/- 1.95 years (range: 16-23 years). The results indicated that the levels of white blood cells were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in taurine treated group, but other hematological values did not differ significantly in either group. Taurine administration improved liver and kidney functions, indicated by decline of serum bilirubin, transaminases, urea, and creatinine, respectively in comparison to the controls (P < 0.05). Moreover, taurine significantly reduced serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion our results indicated that taurine supplementation could be a protection against chemotherapy-induced toxicities probably by its antioxidant capacity. Present study showed effectiveness of taurineon the chemotherapy-related toxicities and some of the complications during the maintenance period of treatment following coadministration in young adults with ALL.","['Hematology and Oncology Research Center; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '1EQV5MLY3D (Taurine)']",,,,"['JCanResTher_2015_11_2_426_151933 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.151933 [doi]']",10.4103/0973-1482.151933 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, an attempt has been made to determine susceptibility pattern of four antifungal agents against the Candida species isolated from cancer patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were taken from 50 cancer patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis by the physician, and isolation and identification of Candida spp. was done based on standard procedures. Antifungal resistance pattern was carried out according to CLSI guidelines, and 18s ribosomal RNA among Candida spp. was identified using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 18 (36%) were females and 32 (64%) were males; mean age was 38.4 years. Leukemia and lymphoma were the most frequent cancer types in the studied group, accounting for 17 (34%) and 12 (24%), respectively. A total of 29 Candida spp. were isolated from 29 cancer patients, of which 17 were C. albicans and 12 were C. non-albicans. All the Candida spp. were confirmed having 18s ribosomal RNA. Among all the Candida spp., C. non-albicans showed higher resistance pattern to amphotericin B (MIC 07 mug/ml) and ketoconazole (MIC = 05 mug/ml). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, oropharyngeal Candidiasis is a serious infection among cancer patients.

Cytosine Arabinoside (Ara-C) is widely used to treat hematological malignancy in humans, but often becomes ineffective because of increased resistance to the drug which may lead to a worse prognosis. Therefore new strategies are needed to understand the mechanism responsible for drug resistance and to develop new therapies to overcome it. Research evidence based on natural compounds used alone or in combination with current chemotherapeutic agents proved their efficacy to treat and prevent cancer. Hesperidin and Silibinin displayed anti-cancer activity against various types of cancers and cell lines and can be used in combination with Cytarabine with the aim to increase cytotoxicy profile and reduction in drug resistance. Experimental Work: Primary cells obtained from AML patient's bone marrow were used to develop in-vitro model and further exposed to various concentration of Cytarabine (10 nM-5000 nM), Hesperidin (0.5 muM-100 muM) and Silibinin (0.5 muM-100 muM) alone and in combination with Cytarabine (Hesperidin-25 muM, Silibinin10 muM) to check cytotoxicity using MTT assay. Synergistic effect was evaluated by Combination Index method. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: In-vitro study of Hesperidin and Silibinin indicated their cytotoxicity at IC 50 value 50.12 muM and 16.2 muM, respectively. Combination Index study revealed Hesperidin and Silibinin both showed synergistic potential and decreased the IC 50 value of Cytarabine by ~5.9 and ~4.5 folds, respectively. Both natural compounds showed potential anti-leukemic activity hence may be used for AML therapy alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.","['Departments of Cancer Biology and Medical Oncology, The Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Silymarin)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '4RKY41TBTF (Silybin)', 'E750O06Y6O (Hesperidin)']",,,,"['JCanResTher_2015_11_2_352_157330 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.157330 [doi]']",10.4103/0973-1482.157330 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Longitudinal, descriptive. SETTING: Hematology/oncology clinic in the southwestern United States. SAMPLE: 62 child and adolescent ALL survivors receiving treatment and follow-up care from 1999-2013. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of height, weight, and body mass index. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Annual obesity/overweight rates and developmental age groups. FINDINGS: Different trajectories of obesity/overweight rates existed among age groups. Forty-seven percent of adolescents met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for obesity/overweight status at some point following diagnosis, compared to 68% of school-age and 73% of preschool children. Preschool children demonstrated the most rapid rate increase following diagnosis, with a particularly susceptible period in the years immediately following therapy. Obesity/overweight persistence was most characteristic of school-age children. CONCLUSIONS: Important variations in rate and pattern of weight status trajectories exist by age group, demonstrating that children diagnosed with ALL during the preschool and school-age developmental years have the greatest vulnerability of developing obesity/overweight status. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Obesity/overweight prevention efforts are greatly needed in children with ALL, and efforts should occur before ALL treatment completion in preschool and school-age children.","['Duke University in Durham, NC.', 'Duke University in Durham, NC.', 'Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX.', 'School of Nursing at Duke University.']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['adolescent', 'child', 'leukemia', 'pediatric obesity', 'preschool']",['10.1188/15.ONF.E287-E293 [doi]'],10.1188/15.ONF.E287-E293 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 6.,"The ETS transcription factor ERG has been implicated as a major regulator of both normal and aberrant hematopoiesis. In acute myeloid leukemias harboring t(16;21), ERG function is deregulated due to a fusion with FUS/TLS resulting in the expression of a FUS-ERG oncofusion protein. How this oncofusion protein deregulates the normal ERG transcription program is unclear. Here, we show that FUS-ERG acts in the context of a heptad of proteins (ERG, FLI1, GATA2, LYL1, LMO2, RUNX1 and TAL1) central to proper expression of genes involved in maintaining a stem cell hematopoietic phenotype. Moreover, in t(16;21) FUS-ERG co-occupies genomic regions bound by the nuclear receptor heterodimer RXR:RARA inhibiting target gene expression and interfering with hematopoietic differentiation. All-trans retinoic acid treatment of t(16;21) cells as well as FUS-ERG knockdown alleviate the myeloid-differentiation block. Together, the results suggest that FUS-ERG acts as a transcriptional repressor of the retinoic acid signaling pathway.","['Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (TLS-ERG fusion protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",PMC4833872,,,"['onc2015261 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.261 [doi]']",10.1038/onc.2015.261 [doi],20150706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The significance of acquisition of cytogenetic abnormalities (ACA) during the course of CMML, however, is largely unknown. In a cohort of 314 CMML patients, karyotypic abnormalities were detected in 106 (34%) patients at the time of diagnosis; and ACA were detected in 80 (25%) patients after a median interval of 17 months (range, 2-117 months). The most frequently observed ACA were a complex karyotype, followed by +21, -7/del(7q), del(20q), i(17q), and -17/del(17p). ACA appeared to occur more frequently in patients with a normal or lower risk karyotype. Progression to AML was seen in 44 of 80 (55%) patients with ACA versus 67 of 234 (29%) patients without ACA (P < 0.0001). Presence of ACA predicted an inferior leukemia-free survival (LFS) by univariate (P = 0.0435) and multivariate analysis (HR = 1.892, P = 0.006). While acquisition of a complex karyotype was positively correlated with AML progression (P = 0.0086), del(20q) was associated with a stable disease (P = 0.0198). We conclude that ACA occur in approximately 20-30% of CMML patients during the course of disease, and are significantly associated with AML progression and a shorter LFS. Karyotypic abnormalities, either present at diagnosis or acquired during the course of disease, have prognostic implication in CMML patients.","['Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030.']",,,,,['10.1002/ajh.24108 [doi]'],10.1002/ajh.24108 [doi],20150814,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood and dust were collected from participants of the California Childhood Leukemia Study at various intervals from 1999 to 2007 and analyzed for two polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), two polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and two organochlorine pesticides using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Due to small blood sample volumes (100 muL), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and BDE-153 were the only analytes with detection frequencies above 70%. For each analyte, depending on its detection frequency, a multivariable linear or logistic regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between POP levels in blood and dust, adjusting for child's age, ethnicity, and breastfeeding duration; mother's country of origin; household annual income; and blood sampling date.

UHRF1, an epigenetic regulator, has been shown to be overexpressed and to coordinate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) silencing in several cancers. In a previous study, we found that UHRF1 promoted gastric cancer (GC) invasion and metastasis. However, the role and underlying mechanism of UHRF1 in GC carcinogenesis remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated UHRF1 expression and function in GC proliferation and explored its downstream regulatory mechanism. The results demonstrated that UHRF1 overexpression was an independent and significant predictor of GC prognosis. Downregulation of UHRF1 suppressed GC proliferation and growth in vitro and in vivo, and UHRF1 upregulation showed opposite effects. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 reactivated 7 TSGs, including CDX2, CDKN2A, RUNX3, FOXO4, PPARG, BRCA1 and PML, via promoter demethylation. These results provide insight into the GC proliferation process, and suggest that targeting UHRF1 represents a new therapeutic approach to block GC development.","[""a Department of Medical Affairs ; The 88th Hospital of PLA ; Tai'an , China.""]","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (UHRF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",PMC4622020,['NOTNLM'],"['BRCA, breast cancer', 'CDH4, cadherin 4', 'CDKN2A, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A', 'CDX2, caudal type homeobox 2', 'DNA methylation', 'DNMT, DNA methyltransferase', 'FOXO, forkhead box O', 'GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase', 'GC, gastric cancer', 'GO, gene ontology', 'MSP, methylation-specific PCR', 'NC, negative control', 'PBS, phosphate buffered saline', 'PI, propidium iodide', ""PLA, Chinese People's Liberation Army"", 'PML, promyelocytic leukemia', 'PPARG,peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma', 'RB, retinoblastoma protein', 'RUNX3, runt-related transcription factor 3', 'TSG, tumor suppressor gene', 'UHRF1', 'UHRF1, ubiquitin-like containing PHD ring finger 1', 'gastric cancer', 'mRNA, messenger RNA', 'proliferation', 'qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction', 'shRNA, short hairpin RNA', 'tumor suppressor gene']",['10.1080/15384047.2015.1056411 [doi]'],10.1080/15384047.2015.1056411 [doi],20150706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For proper complex regulation the E1-alpha subunit functions as an on/off switch regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. In different cell types one of the four-pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoforms (PDHK1-4) can phosphorylate this subunit leading to PDH inactivation. Our previous results with human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESC), suggested that PDHK could be a key regulator in the metabolic profile of pluripotent cells, as it is upregulated in pluripotent stem cells. Therefore, we wondered if metabolic modulation, via inexpensive pharmacological inhibition of PDHK, could impact metabolism and pluripotency. METHODS/RESULTS: In order to assess the importance of the PDH cycle in mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESC), we incubated cells with the PDHK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) and observed that in its presence ESC started to differentiate. Changes in mitochondrial function and proliferation potential were also found and protein levels for PDH (both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) and PDHK1 were monitored. Interestingly, we were also able to describe a possible pathway that involves Hif-1alpha and p53 during DCA-induced loss of pluripotency. Results with ESCs treated with DCA were comparable to those obtained for cells grown without Leukemia Inhibitor Factor (LIF), used in this case as a positive control for differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: DCA negatively affects ESC pluripotency by changing cell metabolism and elements related to the PDH cycle, suggesting that PDHK could function as a possible metabolic gatekeeper in ESC, and may be a good target to modulate metabolism and differentiation. Although further molecular biology-based experiments are required, our data suggests that inactive PDH favors pluripotency and that ESC have similar strategies as cancer cells to maintain a glycolytic profile, by using some of the signaling pathways found in the latter cells.","['PhD Programme in Experimental Biology and Biomedicine, CNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; CNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'PhD Programme in Experimental Biology and Biomedicine, CNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; CNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Institute for Interdisciplinary Research (IIIUC), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'PhD Programme in Experimental Biology and Biomedicine, CNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Institute for Interdisciplinary Research (IIIUC), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Biocant-Center of Innovation in Biotechnology, Cantanhede, Portugal.', 'CNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'PhD Programme in Experimental Biology and Biomedicine, CNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; CNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Institute for Interdisciplinary Research (IIIUC), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'CNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Department of Life Sciences, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'CNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Department of Life Sciences, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.']","['0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex)', '9LSH52S3LQ (Dichloroacetic Acid)']",PMC4493017,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0131663 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-12826 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0131663 [doi],20150706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 2.,"A blood sample from a 14-year-old dog was submitted to the veterinary diagnostic laboratory of the University of Milan for marked leukocytosis with atypical cells. A diagnosis of chronic T-cell lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was made based on blood smear evaluation and flow cytometric phenotyping. A CBC by Sysmex XT-2000iV revealed a moderate normocytic normochromic anemia. Red blood cells counted by optic flow cytometry (RBC-O) resulted in a higher value than using electrical impedance (RBC-I). The relative reticulocyte count based on RNA content and size was 35.3%, while the manual reticulocyte count was < 1%. The WBC count of 1,562,680 cells/muL was accompanied by a flag. Manual counts for RBC and WBC using the Burker chamber confirmed the Sysmex impedance results. Finally the manual PCV was lower than HCT by Sysmex. While Sysmex XT can differentiate between RBC and WBC by impedance, even in the face of extreme lymphocytosis due to CLL, RBC-O can be affected by bias, resulting in falsely increased RBC and reticulocyte numbers. Overestimation of RBC-O may be due to incorrect Sysmex classification of leukemic cells or their fragments as reticulocytes. This phenomenon is known as pseudoreticulocytosis and can lead to misinterpretation of regenerative anemia. On the other side PCV can be affected by bias in CLL due to the trapping of RBC in the buffy coat, resulting in a pink hue in the separation area. As HGB concentration is not affected by flow cytometric or other cell-related artifacts it may represent the most reliable variable to assess the degree of anemia in cases of CLL.","['Department of Veterinary Sciences and Public Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Sciences and Public Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Clinica Veterinaria Roma Sud, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Sciences and Public Health, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Flow cytometry', 'laboratory error', 'pseudohyperkalemia', 'pseudoreticulocytosis']",['10.1111/vcp.12270 [doi]'],10.1111/vcp.12270 [doi],20150702,,,['(c) 2015 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of available data, we believe MRD provides a meaningful endpoint for regulatory purposes, academic studies, and a valuable prognostic evaluation of individual patients in the clinical setting. Similar to what has been shown in acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, based on emerging data, the prognostic impact of MRD in multiple myeloma appears to be independent of induction therapy received.

METHODS: Cox proportional hazards analyses. RESULTS: Acute myeloid leukemia was unrelated to cumulative exposure. Hodgkin lymphoma relative risk estimates in the highest exposure categories of cumulative and peak exposures were, respectively, 3.76 (Ptrend = 0.05) and 5.13 (Ptrend = 0.003). There were suggestive associations with peak exposure observed for chronic myeloid leukemia, albeit based on very small numbers. No other lymphohematopoietic malignancy was associated with either chronic or peak exposure.

Imatinib, as its first-line therapy, exhibits striking activity in both chronic and accelerated phases of the condition. However, numerous clinical trials have shown that many patients become refractory or experience relapses. Thus, development of new, hopefully effective Imatinib-based treatment strategies, are still needed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effects of recombinant adiponectin protein, in enhancing Imatinib anti-tumour activities, in K562 and MEG-01 CML cells, were examined in vitro and in vivo. Forty-eight consecutive newly diagnosed adult patients with Bcr-Abl-positive CML, in the early chronic phase (ECP), were enrolled in the study. Imatinib efficacy, plasma adiponectin levels and their correlations were analysed. RESULTS: Data presented here indicate that adiponectin enhanced Imatinib efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, this augmented effect was due to inhibition of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity in an AdipoR1-dependent way, while AdipoR2 was not involved. Most importantly, additional clinical data revealed that adiponectin plasma levels in CML ECP patients, correlated with Imatinib efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin enhanced Imatinib anti-tumour activity in human chronic myeloid leukaemia cells and its serum levels were associated with Imatinib efficacy, in early chronic phase patients.","[""Department of Pharmacy, People's Hospital of Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, People's Hospital of Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China."", ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital of Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China."", ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital of Liaocheng, Shandong, 252000, China.""]","['0 (ADIPOR1 protein, human)', '0 (Adiponectin)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Adiponectin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",PMC6495201,,,['10.1111/cpr.12194 [doi]'],10.1111/cpr.12194 [doi],,,,['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These epigenetic modifications are potentially reversible and as a result this class of enzymes has drawn great interest as potential therapeutic targets of small molecule inhibitors. Previous studies have suggested that the histone lysine methyltransferase G9a (EHMT2) is required to perpetuate malignant phenotypes through multiple mechanisms in a variety of cancer types. To further elucidate the enzymatic role of G9a in cancer, we describe herein the biological activities of a novel peptide-competitive histone methyltransferase inhibitor, A-366, that selectively inhibits G9a and the closely related GLP (EHMT1), but not other histone methyltransferases. A-366 has significantly less cytotoxic effects on the growth of tumor cell lines compared to other known G9a/GLP small molecule inhibitors despite equivalent cellular activity on methylation of H3K9me2. Additionally, the selectivity profile of A-366 has aided in the discovery of a potentially important role for G9a/GLP in maintenance of leukemia. Treatment of various leukemia cell lines in vitro resulted in marked differentiation and morphological changes of these tumor cell lines. Furthermore, treatment of a flank xenograft leukemia model with A-366 resulted in growth inhibition in vivo consistent with the profile of H3K9me2 reduction observed. In summary, A-366 is a novel and highly selective inhibitor of G9a/GLP that has enabled the discovery of a role for G9a/GLP enzymatic activity in the growth and differentiation status of leukemia cells.","['Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.', 'Discovery Research, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064 United States of America.']","['0', ""(5'-methoxy-6'-(3-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)propoxy)spiro(cyclobutane-1,3'-indol)-2'-amine"", ')', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (G9a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",PMC4492996,,,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0131716 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-09937 [pii]']",10.1371/journal.pone.0131716 [doi],20150706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is, at least partly, driven by transcriptional events and gene promoter hyper-methylation. Here we demonstrate that it also arises from reduced protein stability upon binding to 14-3-3sigma adapter protein. CBY1/14-3-3sigma interaction in BCR-ABL1+ cells is mediated by the fusion protein TK and AKT phosphorylation of CBY1 at critical serine 20, and encompasses the 14-3-3sigma binding modes I and II involved in the binding with client proteins. Moreover, it is impaired by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation of 14-3-3sigma at serine 186, which promotes dissociation of client proteins. The ubiquitin proteasome system UPS participates in reducing stability of CBY1 bound with 14-3-3sigma through enhanced SUMOylation.

Immune modulation (immunosuppression tapering, rituximab-augmented donor lymphocyte infusions) was guided by minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring and commenced at a median of 91 (22-273) days after alloHCT, resulting in a probability of being event free and MRD-negative 1 year after transplant of 57% (84% in those encountering chronic GvHD). Patients who were event free and MRD-negative at the 12-month landmark had a 4-year PFS of 77% and largely remained durably MRD-negative if MRD clearance had occurred subsequent to immune modulation. Three-year overall survival, PFS, relapse incidence and non-relapse mortality of all 77 patients were 69, 57, 26 and 24%, respectively. Survival was not affected by EBMT risk category but by active disease at alloHCT, which could not be overcome by intensification of conditioning. Twenty-three patients who experienced relapse post alloHCT had a survival of 56% at 2 years after CLL recurrence. In conclusion, MRD-guided immune modulation after alloHCT for high-risk CLL can provide durable MRD clearance in more than half of the patients.","['Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine II, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Praxis fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine II, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Transplantation Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Stadtisches Klinikum and Onkologische Praxis, Bielefeld, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine II, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,"['bmt2015150 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2015.150 [doi]']",10.1038/bmt.2015.150 [doi],20150706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the different mutations identified T315I is of particular concern since it is not effectively targeted by the majority of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors so far available. We developed a novel assay based on peptide nucleic acid (PNA) technology coupled to immunofluorescence microscopy (PNA-FISH) for the specific detection at a single cell level of BCR-ABL (T315I) mutation thus improving both, diagnostic resolution and the study of clonal prevalence. Furthermore we developed an additional method based on PNA directed PCR-clamping for the fast and easy detection of the mutation. RESULTS: The PNA directed PCR clamping allows to detect an amount of mutated template as low as 0.5 %. This method is highly sensitive, specific and cheap and could be applied even in laboratory not equipped for more sophisticated analysis. Furthermore, the PNA FISH method allows to identify a small amount of progenitor cells still present after therapy with specific inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: We present here two different methods based on PNA for the detection of T315I useful for different purposes. PNA-FISH can be used to study clonal evolution. In addition, this method could help in the study of compound mutations being able to identify two different mutations in a single cell. PNA directed PCR clamping although not superior to sequencing can be applied worldwide even in laboratory not equipped to search for mutations.","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology and Stem Cell and Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Institute G.

Our aim was to evaluate the impact of age, comorbidities and disease severity (IPSS and IPSS-R prognostic scores) in a ""real-life"" series of MDS patients. METHODS: 318 patients with available assessment of comorbidities at diagnosis and consecutively registered into the Registro Ligure delle Mielodisplasie were analyzed. Comorbidities were evaluated according to HCT-CI and MDS-CI comorbidity indexes. Overall survival (OS) and the probability of death among patients who did not develop acute myeloid leukemia (NLD cumulative incidence) were analyzed. RESULTS: Comorbidities were seen in 177 (55.7%) patients. An older age (>75 y) had a significant negative impact on OS (p=0.008). HCT-CI was not associated with OS. MDS-CI was of prognostic significance (p=0.001), but the association was limited to pts with IPSS or IPSS-R ""lower-risk"". In multivariate analysis, MDS-CI remained an independent factor associated with OS and with an increased risk of NLD both when controlling for IPSS (p=0.019 and p=0.001, respectively) and for IPSS-R (p=0.048 and p=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of age and comorbidities according to a tailored tool such is MDS-CI helps to predict survival in patients with MDS and should be incorporated to current prognostic scores.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS AOU San Martino - IST, Largo R.

Epub 2015 Jul 2.,"Many human cancers share similar metabolic alterations, including the Warburg effect. However, it remains unclear whether oncogene-specific metabolic alterations are required for tumor development. Here we demonstrate a ""synthetic lethal"" interaction between oncogenic BRAF V600E and a ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGCL). HMGCL expression is upregulated in BRAF V600E-expressing human primary melanoma and hairy cell leukemia cells. Suppression of HMGCL specifically attenuates proliferation and tumor growth potential of human melanoma cells expressing BRAF V600E. Mechanistically, active BRAF upregulates HMGCL through an octamer transcription factor Oct-1, leading to increased intracellular levels of HMGCL product, acetoacetate, which selectively enhances binding of BRAF V600E but not BRAF wild-type to MEK1 in V600E-positive cancer cells to promote activation of MEK-ERK signaling. These findings reveal a mutation-specific mechanism by which oncogenic BRAF V600E ""rewires"" metabolic and cell signaling networks and signals through the Oct-1-HMGCL-acetoacetate axis to selectively promote BRAF V600E-dependent tumor development.","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322,

Epub 2015 Jul 6.,"The objective of the study was to compare executive functioning (EF) profiles across several pediatric medical conditions and explore the influence of age of diagnosis and evaluation. A retrospective, cross-sectional study of 734 children aged 5 to 18 years was conducted across five medical groups (brain tumor, leukemia [ALL], epilepsy [EPI], neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1], and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency [OTC-D]), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) controls, and matched healthy controls. We compared groups across the scales of a parent-completed Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF) using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Separate ANOVAs were conducted to look at age factors. The results showed that the ADHD group differed from all other groups and had the highest level of reported EF problems. The NF1 and OTC-D groups differed significantly from the healthy comparison group for overall EF problems, while the EPI and cancer groups did not. Working memory was the most elevated scale across medical groups, followed by plan/organize. Children with medical disorders were two to four times more likely than healthy controls to have clinically significant problems in several EF domains. There was a main effect for age at diagnosis and age at evaluation. A subset of children with medical disorders were found to have parent-reported EF difficulties, with particular vulnerability noted in working memory and organizational/planning skills. This has relevance for the development of interventions that may be helpful across disorders. Children with particular diagnoses and earlier age of diagnosis and evaluation had greater reported EF problems.","[""a Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , USA."", ""b Children's National Health System , Washington , DC , USA."", 'c The George Washington University Medical Center , Washington , DC , USA.', ""b Children's National Health System , Washington , DC , USA."", ""b Children's National Health System , Washington , DC , USA."", 'c The George Washington University Medical Center , Washington , DC , USA.']",,PMC4703575,['NOTNLM'],"['*Age at diagnosis', '*Executive functions', '*Medical disorders', '*Pediatric', '*Working memory']",['10.1080/09297049.2015.1054272 [doi]'],10.1080/09297049.2015.1054272 [doi],20150706,"['K23 NS065121/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HD090257/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 HD040677/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HD061221/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS044280/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS698832'],,,,,,,,,,,"['Lauren Krivitzky is a consultant with Hyperion Therapeutics.

Epub 2015 Jul 2.,"Systemic therapy with cytotoxic agents provides marginal benefit in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment especially for patients with advanced HCC. Cisplatin is one of the most active cytotoxic agents for HCC treatment. However, acquisition of cisplatin resistance is common, and one important underlying mechanism of such resistance is apoptosis-resistance. In this study, we found that miR-363 levels were significantly decreased in HCC patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. MiR-363 levels were also lower in cisplatin-resistant HepG2 (HepG2-R) cells than in HepG2 cells. Exogenous miR-363 significantly overcame cisplatin resistance in HepG2-R cells, whereas miR-363 knockdown increased the cell viability during cisplatin treatment. We further demonstrated that miR-363 directly targeted to Mcl-1 3'-UTR (3'-Untranslated Regions). Downregulation of miR-363 resulted in upregulation of Mcl-1 which is a key member of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family and increased drug resistance. We finally demonstrated that miR-363 decreased cisplatin resistance of HCC cell, partly by targeting Mcl-1. These data suggest that the combination of miR-363 and cisplatin may represent a novel approach in treatment for HCC, thus offering a new target for chemotherapy of HCC.","['Xiangya Hospital of Central-South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, PR China.', 'Xiangya Hospital of Central-South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, PR China.', 'Xiangya Hospital of Central-South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, PR China.', 'Xiangya Hospital of Central-South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, PR China.

A limited understanding of disease pathogenesis/heterogeneity and lack of effective treatments have hampered overall improvements in patient outcomes. With the recent understanding that the secondary nature of sAML does not by itself incur a poor prognosis and incorporation of cytogenetics and molecular genetics into patient care and the advancement of treatment, including improved supportive care, novel chemotherapeutics agents, and nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens as part of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), modest gains in survival and quality of life are beginning to be seen among patients with s-AML.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA, szeichn@emory.edu.']",,,,,['10.1007/s11864-015-0355-3 [doi]'],10.1007/s11864-015-0355-3 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reported association with pulmonary disease such as bronchiectasis is less certain. METHODS: A retrospective case review of a HTLV-1 seropositive cohort attending a national referral centre. The cohort was categorised into HTLV-1 symptomatic patients (SPs) (ATLL, HAM/TSP, Strongyloidiasis and HTLV associated inflammatory disease (HAID)) and HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (ACs). The cohort was reviewed for diagnosis of bronchiectasis. RESULT: 34/246 ACs and 30/167 SPs had been investigated for respiratory symptoms by computer tomography (CT) with productive cough +/- recurrent chest infections the predominant indications. Bronchiectasis was diagnosed in one AC (1/246) and 13 SPs (2 HAID, 1 ATLL, 10 HAM/TSP) (13/167, RR 19.2 95 % CI 2.5-14.5, p = 0.004) with high resolution CT. In the multivariate analysis ethnicity (p = 0.02) and disease state (p < 0.001) were independent predictors for bronchiectasis. The relative risk of bronchiectasis in SPs was 19.2 (95 % CI 2.5-14.5, p = 0.004) and in HAM/TSP patients compared with all other categories 8.4 (95 % CI 2.7-26.1, p = 0.0002). Subjects not of African/Afro-Caribbean ethnicity had an increased prevalence of bronchiectasis (RR 3.45 95 % 1.2-9.7, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Bronchiectasis was common in the cohort (3.4 %). Risk factors were a prior diagnosis of HAM/TSP and ethnicity but not HTLV-1 viral load, age and gender. The spectrum of HTLV-associated disease should now include bronchiectasis and HTLV serology should be considered in patients with unexplained bronchiectasis.","[""National Centre for Human Retrovirology, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Praed St, W2 1NY, London, UK. sherry0508@doctors.org.uk."", ""National Centre for Human Retrovirology, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Praed St, W2 1NY, London, UK. g.p.taylor@imperial.ac.uk."", 'Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK. g.p.taylor@imperial.ac.uk.']",,PMC4491414,,,"['10.1186/s12879-015-1002-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-015-1002-0 [pii]']",10.1186/s12879-015-1002-0 [doi],20150706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jun 14.,"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is the leading form of cancer in infancy, and compelling evidences suggest an involvement of altered immune competence on this malignancy pathogenesis. Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine designated as an immunosuppressive molecule, but may act as an immunostimulant factor in cancer development and progression. An IL-10 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1800896 has been associated with disease progression to ALL, and might influence cytokine expression. This study analyzed the IL-10 rs1800896 polymorphism and performed a case-control study to determine the significant associations with ALL susceptibility and prognosis. IL-10 plasma levels were determined and associated with genotypes and disease phase. The study consisted of 67 childhood ALL patients and 75 age-related healthy controls. The rs1800896 was not associated with ALL susceptibility or risk of relapse. No significant association was observed between different genotypes of the rs1800896 and plasma levels of IL-10. Cytokine plasma levels were significantly higher in the diagnosis group (9.71 pg/mL +/- 3.7), comparing to the treatment (3.48 pg/mL +/- 1.3; p=0.01) and remission phase (0.12 pg/mL +/- 0.1; p=0.0001) groups. This work indicates that the IL-10 plasma expression is altered from ALL disease diagnosis and remission. Moreover, prospective studies will establish the functional role of IL-10 in immune modulation in childhood ALL.","['Laboratory of Study and Application of DNA Polymorphisms, Department of Pathological Sciences, State University of Londrina, Londrina, PR, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Study and Application of DNA Polymorphisms, Department of Pathological Sciences, State University of Londrina, Londrina, PR, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Study and Application of DNA Polymorphisms, Department of Pathological Sciences, State University of Londrina, Londrina, PR, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Study and Application of DNA Polymorphisms, Department of Pathological Sciences, State University of Londrina, Londrina, PR, Brazil.', 'Londrina Cancer Hospital and University Hospital of State University of Londrina, Medical Clinic Department, Londrina, PR, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Study and Application of DNA Polymorphisms, Department of Pathological Sciences, State University of Londrina, Londrina, PR, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Study and Application of DNA Polymorphisms, Department of Pathological Sciences, State University of Londrina, Londrina, PR, Brazil.

The aim was to evaluate the use of CD49d and CD26 as independent prognostic markers in CLL patients. The present study measured surface expression of CD49d and CD26 by three-color flow cytometry in a series of 103 untreated CLL patients. We evaluated the prognostic role of CD49d and CD26 to predict the risk of lymphocyte doubling, disease progression and overall survival. We confirmed that CD49d and CD26 were significant predictors of lymphocyte doubling(P<0.001 for both markers) and disease progression (P<0.001 for both markers) but insignificant for overall survival(P=0.303 and 0.519 respectively. Multivariate analysis between clinical parameters and flow cytometry markers revealed that CD49d and CD26 are independent prognostic markers for lymphocyte doubling (HR=1.487 P=007 and HR=2.248, P=0.014 respectively) and progression to a more advanced stage (HR=3.191, P=0.049 and HR=7.887, P=0.003). Also, concordant expression of both markers was found to improve their predictive power. Many studies reported that CD49d and CD26 combined analysis was found to improve their power to predict the risk of lymphocyte doubling and disease progression. CD49d and CD26 have independent prognostic value and we suggest its use as a part of routine panel for prognostic stratification of CLL.","['Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt.

Epub 2015 Jun 19.,"FLT3 inhibitors have been explored as a viable therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the clinical outcomes of these FLT3 inhibitors were underwhelming except AC220. Therefore, the development of novel FLT3 inhibitors with high potency against both FLT3-WT and FLT3-ITD mutants are strongly demanded at the present time. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of novel N-(5-(tert-butyl)isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-phenylurea derivatives as FLT3 inhibitors. SAR studies focused on the fused rings led to the discovery of a series of compounds with high potency against FLT3-ITD-bearing MV4-11 cells and significantly inhibitory activity toward FLT3. Among these compounds, N-(5-(tert-butyl)isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-(4-(7-methoxyimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-2-yl)phenyl )urea (16i), displayed acceptable aqueous solubility, desirable pharmacokinetic profile and high cytotoxicity selectivity against MV4-11 cells. This compound can inhibit phosphorylation of FLT3 and induce apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Further in vivo antitumor studies showed that 16i led to complete tumor regression in the MV4-11 xenograft model at a dose of 60 mg/kg/d while without observable body weight loss. This study had provided us a new chemotype of FLT3 inhibitors as novel therapic candidates for AML.","['State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China; College of Chemical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610065, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China; College of Chemical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610065, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.

Posaconazole emerged as an excellent alternative for fungal prophylaxis in high-risk patients. There is limited data about pharmacokinetics and plasma concentrations of posaconazole when given as prophylaxis in patients with hematologic malignancies. We recruited 20 adult patients for prospective, open label trial of posaconazole given as a prophylaxis in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing induction chemotherapy or first salvage therapy. The median age of all patients was 65 years and received prophylaxis for a median of 38 days (range: 5-42 days).Ten patients (50%) completed 42 days on posaconazole prophylaxis. Median plasma posaconazole levels showed no statistical difference across gender, body surface area, patients developing IFI, and patients acquiring grade 3 or 4 elevation of liver enzymes. However, there was an overall trend for higher trough concentrations among patients with no IFI than those with IFI. Pharmacokinetics of posaconazole varies from patient to patient, and AML patients receiving induction chemotherapy who never develop IFI tend to have higher plasma concentrations after oral administration of posaconazole.","['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

METHODS: In the present study, we assessed the cytotoxicity of two naturally occurring flavonoids dorsmanin F (1, a flavanone) and poinsettifolin B (2, a chalcone) against 9 drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cell lines. The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of these compounds, whilst caspase-Glo assay was used to detect caspase activation. Cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were all analysed via flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compounds 1 and 2 displayed cytotoxic effects with IC50 values below 34 microM in all the 9 tested cancer cell lines. The IC50 values for flavanone 1 and chalcone 2 ranged from 5.34 microM and 1.94 microM (towards leukaemia CCRF-CEM cells) to 33.30 microM and 28.92 microM (towards MDA-MB-231-BCRP cells), respectively, and from 0.20 microM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 195.12 microM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin. The compounds induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM leukaemia cells, mediated by MMP disruption and increased ROS production. CONCLUSIONS: Dorsmain F and poinsettifolin B are potential cytotoxic natural products that deserve more investigations to develop novel antineoplastic drugs against multifactorial drug-resistant cancers.","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany ; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon.', ""Department of Chemistry, Higher Teachers' Training College, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon."", ""Department of Chemistry, Higher Teachers' Training College, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon."", 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany .

ANKL is rare and is characterized by a systemic neoplastic proliferation of NK-cells, usually with a leukemic presentation. ENKTL is a predominantly extranodal lymphoma, occurring mainly in the upper aerodigestive tract. Both are aggressive neoplasms strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Here we report two patients with aggressive NK-cells neoplasms localized in the bone marrow (BM) who presented as prolonged fever, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Both were treated initially as infectious disease. Imaging studies revealed splenomegaly without any nodular lesion or lymphadenopathy. BM examination revealed extensive involvement by EBV-positive NK-cells in both cases. Staging workup including nasal examination/biopsy was negative. Both patients passed away in a month. One case showed gains of chromosomes 4q and 9p by array comparative genomic hybridization. Both tumors were diagnostically challenging due to the unusual clinical presentation and absence of leukemic change, tumor mass or lymphadenopathy.

Epub 2015 Jul 2.,"The miR-196 miRNA gene family located within the Hox gene clusters has been shown to function during embryogenesis and to be aberrantly expressed in various malignancies, including leukaemia, melanoma, and colorectal cancer. Despite its involvement in numerous biological processes, the control of miR-196 expression is still poorly defined. We identified the miR-196b promoter and found that the mature miR-196b originates from a large, non-coding primary transcript, which starts within an autonomous TATA box promoter and is not in physical continuity with either the Hoxa10 or Hoxa9 main primary transcripts. A ~680bp genomic fragment, spanning the pri-miR-196b transcription start site, is sufficient to recapitulate the neural tube expression pattern of miR-196 during embryogenesis. This region contains potential binding sites for Cdx and 5'Hox transcription factors. Two of these sites revealed to be necessary for neural tube expression and were bound in vivo by Cdx2 and Hoxd13. We show that Cdx2 is required for miR-196 expression and that both Cdx2 and 5'Hox, but not 3'Hox, are able to activate the miR-196b promoter. The possible role of Cdx2- and 5'Hox-mediated regulation of miR-196 expression in vertebrate anterior-posterior (AP) axis formation during embryogenesis is discussed.","['Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via G.

Epub 2015 Jul 5.,"PURPOSE: The problem of drug sensitivity and predicting the outcome of chemotherapy seems to be of great importance in hemato-oncological disorders. There are some factors that can help to predict effects of chemotherapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), such as presence of del17p, del11q, or TP53 gene mutations, which result in resistance to purine analogues and alkylating drugs. Despite the new therapeutic options introduced recently, purine analogues in combination with cyclophosphamide and the monoclonal antibody rituximab is still the gold standard for the first-line treatment of fit patients with CLL. The aim of this study was to assess whether the rate of apoptosis caused by one of purine analogues-fludarabine in cell cultures differs between patients who clinically respond to fludarabine-based chemotherapy and those who do not respond. METHODS: CLL leukemic cells, obtained from peripheral blood and bone marrow of 23 patients, were cultured in the presence of fludarabine. After 24 h of incubation, the rate of apoptosis, indicated by the expression of active caspase-3, was assessed with flow cytometry and then analyzed regarding clinical response to fludarabine-based regimens. RESULTS: The percentage of apoptotic cells induced by fludarabine was significantly higher in the group of patients who achieved remission in comparison to the group with no response to purine analogues therapy. Interestingly, we observed that among the patients who did not respond to chemotherapy, the presence of del17p and del11q was detected only once. Other non-responders had no detectable genetic abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, it can be presumed that in vitro drug sensitivity test, which is easy to perform, may predict the outcome of fludarabine-based chemotherapy in CLL patients.","['Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Staszica 11, 20-081, Lublin, Poland, monika.podhorecka@onet.pl.']","['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",PMC4532719,,,['10.1007/s00228-015-1893-0 [doi]'],10.1007/s00228-015-1893-0 [doi],20150705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jun 6.,"BACKGROUND: Jumping translocations (JT) are uncommon cytogenetic abnormalities involving nonreciprocal translocations of a single donor chromosome onto 2 or more chromosomes. The clinical characteristics and prognosis of JTs in patients with myeloid malignancies are not well described. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched our cytogenetic database from 2003 to 2014 to identify cases of myeloid malignancies associated with a JT. These cases were cross-referenced with our clinical databases to determine patient characteristics, response to treatment and overall survival. RESULTS: We identified 10 patients with myeloid malignancies and a JT: 4 cases of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplastic syndrome-related changes, 4 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, and 2 cases of postpolycythemia myelofibrosis. The donor segment was derived from chromosome 1 in every case. The acquisition of a JT was a late occurrence, with a median time to JT development of 24.9 months (range, 0-248 months) from diagnosis. The overall response to treatment was poor, with no patients experiencing a response to conventional chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents. The median overall survival for the group was 9 months (95% confidence interval, 2.5-15.5) after identification of a JT. CONCLUSION: The acquisition of a JT in patients with myeloid malignancies appears to be a late event and is associated with myelodysplasia. In our series, this was associated with a poor prognosis with a poor response to treatment, disease transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, and short overall survival.","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

It is widely accepted that the viral transactivator Tax-1 is the major viral product involved in the onset, but not in the maintenance, of neoplastic phenotype, as only 30-40% of ATL cells express Tax-1. It has been recently demonstrated that HBZ (HTLV-1 bZIP factor), a protein encoded by the minus strand of HTLV-1 genome, constantly expressed in infected cells and in ATL tumor cells, is also involved in the pathogenesis of leukaemia. The full role played by HBZ in oncogenesis is not clarified in detail also because of the limited availability of tools to assess quantitative expression, subcellular location and interaction of HBZ with host factors in ATL. RESULTS: By the use of the first reported monoclonal antibody against HBZ, 4D4-F3, generated in our laboratory it has been possible to carefully assess for the first time the above parameters in HTLV-1 chronically infected cells and, most importantly, in fresh leukemic cells from patients. Endogenous HBZ is expressed in speckle-like structures localized in the nucleus. The calculated number of endogenous HBZ molecules varies between 17.461 and 39.615 molecules per cell, 20- to 50-fold less than the amount expressed in HBZ transfected cells used by most investigators to assess the expression, function and subcellular localization of the viral protein.

Epub 2015 Jul 3.,"INTRODUCTION: Recent studies in a mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) demonstrated that inhibition of the programmed death receptor 1 (PD1)-PDL1 axis resulted in correction of leukemiainduced CD8+ T cellrelated immune dysfunction and protected mice against CLL development. However, it remains unclear whether CLL development and progression can be also associated with CD4+ T cells expressing PD1. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze whether a quantitative assessment of CD4+PD1+ T cells performed at the time of diagnosis can have prognostic significance in patients with CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 56 patients with newly diagnosed CLL at different stages of the disease. The quantitative assessment of PD1expressing CD4+ T cells was performed in all patients, using multicolor flow cytometry. RESULTS: We demonstrated that CLL patients with an advanced (high and intermediate risk) stage had a significantly higher number of CD4+PD1+ T cells compared with subjects with lowgrade disease. Importantly, we showed that the number of PD1expressing CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood of patients referred for immediate treatment due to the advanced stage of the disease was significantly higher compared with subjects on watchful waiting. Finally, we found that treatmentnaive patients with higher numbers of CD4+PD1+ T cells at baseline showed a significantly shortened time to the first treatment compared with patients with a low number of CD4+PD1+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the quantative assessment of CD4+PD1+ T cells in peripheral blood using flow cytometry can facilitate prognostication of patients with newly diagnosed CLL.",,"['0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",,,,"['AOP_15_060 [pii]', '10.20452/pamw.2967 [doi]']",AOP_15_060 [pii],20150703,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The cohort included 44 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis treated monthly with natalizumab for 18 months. Peripheral blood was collected before treatment initiation and on a monthly basis during the treatment course. Complete blood cell count was performed using automated hematology systems. Blood smears were prepared and analyzed when abnormal values were detected. RESULTS: Mean total white blood cell, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts were significantly higher 1 month after treatment initiation and remained stable during the 18 months of follow-up. Monocyte counts increased progressively during the 18-month treatment with natalizumab. Erythroblasts and neutrophil precursors were absent before treatment initiation but were present in 16% and 6.8% of patients, respectively, 1 month after the first natalizumab infusion. The proportion of patients with erythroblasts and neutrophil precursors remained stable throughout the 18-month follow-up period. On an individual patient basis, a fluctuating level of erythroblasts and neutrophil precursors was observed. No difference in mean erythrocyte, hemoglobin, hematocrit, thrombocyte, and neutrophil levels was observed before and after 18 months of natalizumab treatment. No cases of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia were observed. CONCLUSION: Chronic treatment with natalizumab is associated with significant modifications in complete blood cell count, including emergence of hematopoietic precursors that are not present in peripheral blood under normal conditions. None of these modifications were associated with malignancy.","['Department of Clinical Neurosciences (C.B., P.H.L.), Division of Neurology, Unit of Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis; Department of Hematology (Y.B., K.S.); and Department of Genetics and Laboratory Medicine (P.H.L.), Laboratory Medicine Service, University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences (C.B., P.H.L.), Division of Neurology, Unit of Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis; Department of Hematology (Y.B., K.S.); and Department of Genetics and Laboratory Medicine (P.H.L.), Laboratory Medicine Service, University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences (C.B., P.H.L.), Division of Neurology, Unit of Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis; Department of Hematology (Y.B., K.S.); and Department of Genetics and Laboratory Medicine (P.H.L.), Laboratory Medicine Service, University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences (C.B., P.H.L.), Division of Neurology, Unit of Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis; Department of Hematology (Y.B., K.S.); and Department of Genetics and Laboratory Medicine (P.H.L.), Laboratory Medicine Service, University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland.']",,PMC4476051,,,"['10.1212/NXI.0000000000000123 [doi]', 'NEURIMMINFL2014003939 [pii]']",10.1212/NXI.0000000000000123 [doi],20150618,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported a cytokine-based culture method for the generation of NK cell products with high cell number and purity. In this system, CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) were expanded and differentiated into NK cells under stroma-free conditions in the presence of IL-15 and IL-2. We show that combining IL-15 with IL-12 drives the generation of more mature and highly functional NK cells. In particular, replacement of IL-2 by IL-12 enhanced the cytolytic activity and IFNgamma production of HPC-NK cells toward cultured and primary AML cells in vitro, and improved antileukemic responses in NOD/SCID-IL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice bearing human AML cells. Phenotypically, IL-12 increased the frequency of HPC-NK cells expressing NKG2A and killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR), which were more responsive to target cell stimulation. In addition, NK15/12 cell products demonstrated superior maturation potential, resulting in >70% positivity for CD16 and/or KIR within 2 weeks after infusion into NSG mice. We predict that higher functionality and faster in vivo maturation will favor HPC-NK cell alloreactivity toward malignant cells in patients, making this cytokine combination an attractive strategy to generate clinical HPC-NK cell products for cancer adoptive immunotherapy.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine; Laboratory of Hematology; Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc); Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine; Laboratory of Hematology; Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc); Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', ""Glycostem Therapeutics; 's-Hertogenbosch , The Netherlands."", ""Glycostem Therapeutics; 's-Hertogenbosch , The Netherlands."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine; Laboratory of Hematology; Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc); Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine; Laboratory of Hematology; Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc); Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology; Radboudumc ; Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine; Laboratory of Hematology; Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc); Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",,PMC4485802,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML, acute myeloid leukemia', '*BM, bone marrow', '*HPC, hematopoietic progenitor cell', '*HSCT, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*KIR, killer immunoglobulin-like receptor', '*NK, natural killer', '*NSG, NOD/SCID-IL2Rgammanull', '*UCB, umbilical cord blood', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*adoptive immunotherapy', '*interferon-gamma', '*interleukin-12', '*killer immunoglobulin-like receptor', '*natural killer cell']","['10.1080/2162402X.2015.1017701 [doi]', '1017701 [pii]']",,20150401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hwever, GVL is tightly linked to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Among hematological malignancies, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most resistant to GVL, although the reasons for this remain poorly understood. Clinical studies have identified alterations in Ikaros (Ik) transcription factor as the major marker associated with poor outcomes in ALL. We have shown that the absence of Ik in professional host-derived hematopoietic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) exacerbates GVHD. However, whether Ik expression plays a role in resistance to GVL is not known. In this study we used multiple clinically relevant murine models of allo-HCT to explore whether Ik expression in hematopoietic APCs and/or leukemic cells is critical for increasing resistance to GVL and thus inducing relapse. We found that Ik deficiency in host APCs failed to enhance GVL despite increased GVHD severity. Mechanistic studies with bone marrow (BM) chimeras and tetramer analyses demonstrated reduced tumor-specific immunodominant (gag+) antigen responses in the [B6Ik(-/-)-->B6] group. Loss of GVL was observed when both the leukemia cells and the host APCs were deficient in Ik. We found that calreticulin (CRT) expression in host antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) of Ik(-/-) animals was significantly lower than in wild-type animals. Rescuing CRT expression in Ik(-/-) DCs improved leukemic-specific cytotoxic T cell function. Together, our data demonstrate that the absence of Ikaros in host hematopoietic cells promotes resistance to GVL despite increasing GVHD and thus provides a potential mechanism for the poor outcome of Ik(-/-) ALL patients.","['Department of Internal Medicine; University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center ; Ann Arbor, MI USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases; University of Michigan Medical School ; Ann Arbor, MI USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine; University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center ; Ann Arbor, MI USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine; University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center ; Ann Arbor, MI USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine; University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center ; Ann Arbor, MI USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine; University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center ; Ann Arbor, MI USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine; University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center ; Ann Arbor, MI USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine; University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center ; Ann Arbor, MI USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases; University of Michigan Medical School ; Ann Arbor, MI USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine; University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center ; Ann Arbor, MI USA.']",,PMC4485841,['NOTNLM'],"['*51Cr, Chromium-51', '*ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*APC, allophycocyanin', '*APCs, antigen-presenting cells', '*Allo-HCT, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*BC, blast crisis', '*BLI, bioluminescence imaging', '*BM, bone marrow', '*BMDCs, bone marrow derived dendritic cells', '*BMT, bone marrow transplantation', '*CML, chronic myeloid leukemia', '*CRT, calreticulin', '*CTL, cytotoxic T cell', '*DCs, dendritic cells', '*FACS, Fluorescence-activated cell sorting', '*FBS, fatal bovine serum', '*FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate', '*GVHD, graft-versus-host-disease', '*GVL, graft-versus-leukemia', '*HCT, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*ICAM-1, intracellular adhesion molecule 1', '*Ik DN, Ikaros dominant negative', '*Ik, Ikaros', '*Ikaros', '*MACS, magnetic- activated cell sorting', '*MBL-2, moloney-murine sarcoma virus-induced MBL-2 lymphoma cells', '*MHC, major histocompatibility complex', '*MLR, mixed lymphocyte reaction', '*MiHAs, multiple minor histocompatibility antigens', '*PBS, phosphate buffered saline', '*PE, phycoerythrin', '*SIRP-alpha, signal regulatory protein alpha', '*TCD-BM, T cell depleted bone marrow', '*TSA, tumor specific antigen', '*Tregs, regulatory T cells', '*UCUCA, University Committee on Use and Care of Animals', '*WT, wild-type', '*antigen-presenting cells', '*bone marrow transplantation', '*graft-versus-leukemia', '*luc+, luciferase+', '*mAbs, monoclonal antibodies', '*mCRT, murine calreticulin']","['10.1080/2162402X.2015.1016699 [doi]', '1016699 [pii]']",,20150401,"['R01 HL090775/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007863/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jun 29.,"The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has revolutionized management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), transforming this fatal disease into a chronic disease with nearly normal life expectancy. Nilotinib is a second generation TKI targeting the oncoprotein BCR-ABL used in patients in the chronic phase of CML. Several research teams have suggested over recent years that nilotinib might be the causal agent in the development or aggravation of vascular disease, particularly in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or an established cardiovascular disease. We report here the case of a patient who developed severe peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs that worsened despite optimal medical and surgical care, presenting recurrent re-stenoses after different revascularization techniques (bypass, angioplasty...) associated with aggravation of severe trophic disorders to the point of potentially requiring amputation. Discontinuation of nilotinib enabled a stabilization of the arterial lesions and complete healing of the trophic lesions. This case illustrates the importance of recognizing co-morbid conditions in patients with severe vascular disease and to examine the possibility of drug interactions leading to rapid aggravation of arterial disease with no other cause. Studying the pathophysiological impact of TKIs on the vascular system may open new avenues of research for the investigation of factors triggering arteriosclerosis.","['Inserm U970, pole cardiovasculaire, service de medecine vasculaire, universite Paris Descartes, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, 20, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Inserm U970, pole cardiovasculaire, service de medecine vasculaire, universite Paris Descartes, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, 20, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Radiologie cardiovasculaire, pole cardiovasculaire, universite Paris Descartes, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Inserm U970, pole cardiovasculaire, service de chirurgie vasculaire, universite Paris Descartes, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, 75015 Paris, France.', 'Radiologie cardiovasculaire, pole cardiovasculaire, universite Paris Descartes, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, 75015 Paris, France.', ""Service d'hematologie, hopital Saint-Louis, 75015 Paris, France."", 'Inserm U970, pole cardiovasculaire, service de medecine vasculaire, universite Paris Descartes, hopital europeen Georges-Pompidou, 20, rue Leblanc, 75015 Paris, France.

Epub 2015 Jul 3.,"Interleukin (IL)-10-producing B cells (B10 cells) have emerged as important regulatory elements with immunosuppressive roles. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells also secrete IL-10 and share features of B10 cells, suggesting a possible contribution of CLL B cells to immunosuppression in CLL patients. Factors controlling the emergence of B10 cells are not known. B-cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (BAFF) is critical for B-cell maturation and survival, and is implicated in the development and progression of CLL. We sought to investigate the role of BAFF in the emergence of IL-10-producing regulatory B cells in healthy donors and CLL patients. Here, we report that BAFF signaling promotes IL-10 production by CLL B cells in a mouse model of CLL and in CLL patients. Moreover, BAFF-mediated IL-10 production by normal and CLL B cells is mediated via its receptor transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor. Our work uncovered a major targetable pathway important for the generation of regulatory B cells that is detrimental to immunity in CLL.","['Department of Immunology, Monash University Central Clinical School, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Immunology, Monash University Central Clinical School, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Immunology, Monash University Central Clinical School, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Division of Blood Cancers, Department of Medicine, Monash University Central Clinical School, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Division of Blood Cancers, Department of Medicine, Monash University Central Clinical School, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', ""Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews's Place, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Department of Immunology, Monash University Central Clinical School, Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct (AMREP), Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']","['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (Tnfrsf13b protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf13b protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",PMC4606984,,,"['leu2015174 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.174 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.174 [doi],20150703,"['14-0107/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['EMS63887'],,,,['NLM: EMS63887'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 3.,"We examined the combination of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus with bortezomib and rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) in a phase I/II study. All patients received six cycles of the combination of everolimus/rituximab or everolimus/bortezomib/rituximab followed by maintenance with everolimus until progression. Forty-six patients were treated; 98% received prior rituximab and 57% received prior bortezomib. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in the phase I. The most common treatment-related toxicities of all grades were fatigue (63%), anemia (54%), leucopenia (52%), neutropenia (48%) and diarrhea (43%). Thirty-six (78%) of the 46 patients received full dose therapy (FDT) of the three drugs. Of these 36, 2 (6%) had complete response (90% confidence interval (CI): 1-16). In all, 32/36 (89%) of patients experienced at least a minimal response (90% CI: 76-96%). The observed partial response or better response rate was 19/36 (53, 90 CI: 38-67%). For the 36 FDT patients, the median progression-free survival was 21 months (95% CI: 12-not estimable). In summary, this study demonstrates that the combination of everolimus, bortezomib and rituximab is well tolerated and achieved 89% response rate even in patients previously treated, making it a possible model of non-chemotherapeutic-based combination therapy in WM.","['Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Colorado Blood Cancer Institute, Denver, CO, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA, USA.']","['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)']",,,,"['leu2015164 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.164 [doi]']",10.1038/leu.2015.164 [doi],20150703,['1R01FD003743/FD/FDA HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jun 29.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop a new brief, comprehensive geriatric assessment scale for older patients diagnosed with different hematological malignancies, the Geriatric Assessment in Hematology (GAH scale), and to determine its psychometric properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 30-item GAH scale was designed through a multi-step process to cover 8 relevant dimensions. This is an observational study conducted in 363 patients aged>/=65years, newly diagnosed with different hematological malignancies (myelodysplasic syndrome/acute myeloblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia), and treatment-naive. The scale psychometric validation process included the analyses of feasibility, floor and ceiling effect, validity and reliability criteria. RESULTS: Mean time taken to complete the GAH scale was 11.9+/-4.7min that improved through a learning-curve effect. Almost 90% of patients completed all items, and no floor or ceiling effects were identified. Criterion validity was supported by reasonable correlations between the GAH scale dimensions and three contrast variables (global health visual analogue scale, ECOG and Karnofsky), except for comorbidities. Factor analysis (supported by the scree plot) revealed nine factors that explained almost 60% of the total variance. Moderate internal consistency reliability was found (Cronbach's alpha: 0.610), and test-retest was excellent (ICC coefficients, 0.695-0.928). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the GAH scale is a valid, internally reliable and a consistent tool to assess health status in older patients with different hematological malignancies. Future large studies should confirm whether the GAH scale may be a tool to improve clinical decision-making in older patients with hematological malignancies.","['Hematology Department, H. U.

Epub 2015 Jul 2.,"The SWI/SNF multisubunit complex modulates chromatin structure through the activity of two mutually exclusive catalytic subunits, SMARCA2 and SMARCA4, which both contain a bromodomain and an ATPase domain. Using RNAi, cancer-specific vulnerabilities have been identified in SWI/SNF-mutant tumors, including SMARCA4-deficient lung cancer; however, the contribution of conserved, druggable protein domains to this anticancer phenotype is unknown. Here, we functionally deconstruct the SMARCA2/4 paralog dependence of cancer cells using bioinformatics, genetic, and pharmacologic tools. We evaluate a selective SMARCA2/4 bromodomain inhibitor (PFI-3) and characterize its activity in chromatin-binding and cell-functional assays focusing on cells with altered SWI/SNF complex (e.g., lung, synovial sarcoma, leukemia, and rhabdoid tumors). We demonstrate that PFI-3 is a potent, cell-permeable probe capable of displacing ectopically expressed, GFP-tagged SMARCA2-bromodomain from chromatin, yet contrary to target knockdown, the inhibitor fails to display an antiproliferative phenotype. Mechanistically, the lack of pharmacologic efficacy is reconciled by the failure of bromodomain inhibition to displace endogenous, full-length SMARCA2 from chromatin as determined by in situ cell extraction, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and target gene expression studies. Furthermore, using inducible RNAi and cDNA complementation (bromodomain- and ATPase-dead constructs), we unequivocally identify the ATPase domain, and not the bromodomain of SMARCA2, as the relevant therapeutic target with the catalytic activity suppressing defined transcriptional programs. Taken together, our complementary genetic and pharmacologic studies exemplify a general strategy for multidomain protein drug-target validation and in case of SMARCA2/4 highlight the potential for drugging the more challenging helicase/ATPase domain to deliver on the promise of synthetic-lethality therapy.","['Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Pfizer Oncology Research Unit, La Jolla, CA.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Pfizer Oncology Research Unit, La Jolla, CA.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Pfizer Oncology Research Unit, La Jolla, CA.', 'Pfizer Worldwide Medicinal Chemistry, Cambridge, MA.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Pfizer Oncology Research Unit, La Jolla, CA.', 'Institute for Applied Cancer Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.']","['0 (Azabicyclo Compounds)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PF-06687252)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SMARCA2 protein, human)', '0 (SWI-SNF-B chromatin-remodeling complex)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",PMC4755107,,,['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-3798 [doi]'],10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-3798 [doi],20150702,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS744906'],['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, gram-dose vitamin C is being intravenously injected for the treatment of cancer, which can expose circulating blood cells to extremely high concentrations of vitamin C. As well as platelets, red blood cells (RBCs) can actively participate in thrombosis through procoagulant activation. Here, we examined the procoagulant and prothrombotic risks associated with the intravenous injection of gram-dose vitamin C. Vitamin C (0.5-5 mM) increased procoagulant activity of freshly isolated human RBCs via the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) to outer cellular membrane and the formation of PS-bearing microvesicles. PS exposure was induced by the dysregulation of key enzymes for the maintenance of membrane phospholipid asymmetry, which was from vitamin C-induced oxidative stress, and resultant disruption of calcium and thiol homeostasis. Indeed, the intravenous injection of vitamin C (0.5-1.0 g/kg) in rats in vivo significantly increased thrombosis. Notably, the prothrombotic effects of vitamin C were more prominent in RBCs isolated from cancer patients, who are at increased risks of thrombotic events. Vitamin C-induced procoagulant and prothrombotic activation of RBCs, and increased thrombosis in vivo. RBCs from cancer patients exhibited increased sensitivity to the prothrombotic effects of vitamin C, reflecting that intravenous gram-dose vitamin C therapy needs to be carefully revisited.","['*College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Korea;', 'College of Pharmacy, Hanyang University, Ansan 426-791, Korea;', '*College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Korea;', '*College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Korea;', 'College of Pharmacy, Ewha Womans Universtiy, Seoul 120-750, Korea;', '*College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Korea;', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Boramae Hospital, Seoul 156-707, Korea; and.', 'College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul 110-799, Korea.', '*College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Korea;']","['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Vitamins)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer patient', 'procoagulant activation', 'red blood cells', 'thrombotic risk', 'vitamin C']","['kfv133 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfv133 [doi]']",10.1093/toxsci/kfv133 [doi],20150702,,,"['(c) The Author 2015.

Epub 2015 Jul 3.,PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop a method to detect ovarian residual disease by multicolor flow cytometry in acute leukemia patients. METHODS: We designed an experimental model consisting in adding acute leukemia cells to a cell suspension obtained from healthy ovarian cortex. Leukemic cell detection within the ovarian cell suspension required the development of a specific myeloid antibody panel different from that commonly used for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in bone marrow. The method was then used to detect ovarian residual disease in 11 acute leukemia patients. RESULTS: Multicolor flow cytometry is able to evaluate the presence of viable leukemic cells in the ovarian cortex with good specificity and robust sensitivity of 10-4. We observed a good correlation between multicolor flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction results. Ovarian residual disease detection by multicolor flow cytometry was positive in 3 out of 11 acute leukemia patients. CONCLUSION: Multicolor flow cytometry can potentially be applied to ovarian tissue from all acute leukemia patients and is essential to evaluate the risk of cancer re-seeding before autograft of ovarian tissue in case of acute leukemia.,"['INSERM U 1098, CIC1431, 8, rue du Docteur Jean-Francois-Xavier GIROD, F-25020, Besancon Cedex, France, t1zver@chu-besancon.fr.']","['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC4554377,,,['10.1007/s10815-015-0512-4 [doi]'],10.1007/s10815-015-0512-4 [doi],20150703,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 Jul 2.,"MicroRNAs (miRs) play important roles in orchestrating many aspects of the immune response. The miR-17-92 cluster, which encodes 6 miRs including 17, 18a, 19a, 20a, 19b-1, and 92-1, is among the best characterized of these miRs. The miR-17-92 cluster has been shown to regulate a variety of immune responses including infection, tumor, and autoimmunity, but the role of this cluster in T-cell response to alloantigens has not been previously explored. By using major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched, -mismatched, and haploidentical murine models of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT), we demonstrate that the expression of miR-17-92 on donor T cells is essential for the induction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but dispensable for the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. The miR-17-92 plays a major role in promoting CD4 T-cell activation, proliferation, survival, and Th1 differentiation, while inhibiting Th2 and iTreg differentiation. Alternatively, miR-17-92 may promote migration of CD8 T cells to GVHD target organs, but has minimal impact on CD8 T-cell proliferation, survival, or cytolytic function, which could contribute to the preserved GVL effect mediated by T cells deficient for miR-17-92. Furthermore, we evaluated a translational approach and found that systemic administration of antagomir to block miR-17 or miR-19b in this cluster significantly inhibited alloreactive T-cell expansion and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) production, and prolonged the survival in recipients afflicted with GVHD while preserving the GVL effect. Taken together, the current work provides a strong rationale and demonstrates the feasibility to target miR-17-92 for the control of GVHD while preserving GVL activity after allo-BMT.","['Department of Hematology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Microbiology & Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC;', 'Microbiology & Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL;', 'Microbiology & Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC;', 'Microbiology & Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC;', 'Microbiology & Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC;', 'Microbiology & Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC;', 'Microbiology & Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China;', 'Microbiology & Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China;', 'Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL;', 'Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL;', 'Microbiology & Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.']","['0 (MIRN17-92 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (locked nucleic acid)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",PMC4566810,,,"['S0006-4971(20)30932-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-02-627356 [doi]']",10.1182/blood-2015-02-627356 [doi],20150702,"['R01 AI080285/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 AI080285/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143812/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI118305/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA169116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA118116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA143/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA169116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA192202/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA118116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['Blood. 2015 Sep 10;126(11):1265-7.

The Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) gene appears to be a highly promising marker for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients after chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the relative expression level of the WT1 gene in CRNA, bone marrow (BM)- and peripheral blood (PB)-RNA for the monitoring of MRD in AML patients after HSCT. METHODS: One hundred and eighteen AML patients were studied with WT1 expression assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in plasma, BM- and PB-RNA. Correlation analysis was used to compare gene expression differences. RESULTS: The expression of the WT1 gene was successfully detected in 118 cases but was absent in controls (mean relative expression of WT1/ABL 8.77, range 0.5-56.0, P < 0.001) (WT1 in BM-RNA: mean relative expression 8.66, range 0.5-56.0, P < 0.001; WT1 in PB-RNA: mean relative expression 8.55, range 0.5-54.0, P < 0.001). WT1 expression in CRNA, BM-RNA and PB-RNA showed no difference at diagnosis (CRNA vs. BM-RNA, r = 0.999; CRNA vs. PB-RNA, r = 0.988). After HSCT, 62 patients achieved remission. The expression level of WT1 in CRNA and BM-RNA in nine patients who achieved permanent remission fluctuated within the normal range (WT1/ABL < 0.02). The other 53 patients who were predicted to relapse had elevated WT1 levels in CRNA and BM-RNA. Of these 53 patients, 48 had increased expression of the WT1 gene in both CRNA and BM-RNA at a median of 1 month prior to clinical relapse. In the other five patients (5/53) diagnosed with extramedullary relapse, the level of WT1 in CRNA was elevated prior to relapse. However, in these patients WT1 expression in both BM-RNA and PB-RNA was still negative (at a median of 1 month earlier than in BM-RNA). This study indicated that CRNA was no different from BM-RNA for determination of WT1 expression in AML patients (F = 0.260, P = 0.642). CONCLUSION: Analysis of WT1 expression in CRNA in AML patients could be a simple, convenient and noninvasive method to predict latent information about relapse.","[""Key Laboratory of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, Ministry of Health, Regenerative Medicine Research Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No. 1 Keyuan 4th Road, Gaopeng Avenue, Chengdu, 610041, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",,,,['10.1007/s40291-015-0147-2 [doi]'],10.1007/s40291-015-0147-2 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2015 May 22.,"INTRODUCTION: Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) has been shown previously to be aberrantly expressed in a high proportion of paediatric precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (pre-B ALL), suggesting a potential oncogenic role in this tumour type. We therefore assessed CTGF mRNA transcript diversity in B-lineage ALL using primary patient specimens and cell lines. METHODS: CTGF mRNA expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and Northern blotting. We performed a structural analysis of CTGF mRNA by nested reverse-transcriptase PCR and examined CTGF protein diversity by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Northern blot analysis of pre-B ALL cell lines revealed short CTGF transcripts that were expressed in association with the active phase of cellular growth. Structural analysis confirmed the synthesis of several novel CTGF mRNA isoforms in B-lineage ALL cell lines that were uniformly characterised by the retention of the coding sequence for the C-terminal (CT) domain. One of these novel spliceforms was expressed in a majority (70%) of primary pre-B ALL patient specimens positive for canonical CTGF mRNA. Evidence that these alternative transcripts have coding potential was provided by cryptic CTGF proteins of predicted size detected by immunoblotting. CONCLUSION: This study identifies for the first time alternative splicing of the CTGF gene and shows that a short CTGF splice variant associated with cell proliferation is expressed in most cases of primary CTGF-positive pre-B ALL. This novel variant encoding only the CT domain may play a role in pre-B ALL tumorigenesis and/or progression.","[""Division of Children's Leukemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia; Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia.

Using intravital dye labeling and 3D imaging, we discovered that systems-level vascular patterning in the kidney is dependent on the kinetics of vascular mural cell (VMC) differentiation. Conditional ablation of the TALE transcription factor Pbx1 in renal VMC progenitors in the mouse led to the premature upregulation of PDGFRbeta, a master initiator of VMC-blood vessel association. This precocious VMC differentiation resulted in nonproductive angiogenesis, abnormal renal arterial tree patterning and neonatal death consistent with kidney dysfunction. Notably, we establish that Pbx1 directly represses Pdgfrb, and demonstrate that decreased Pdgfrb dosage in conditional Pbx1 mutants substantially rescues vascular patterning defects and neonatal survival. These findings identify, for the first time, an in vivo transcriptional regulator of PDGFRbeta, and reveal a previously unappreciated role for VMCs in systems-level vascular patterning.","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA lis2008@med.cornell.edu daherzli@physbio-tech.net.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA lis2008@med.cornell.edu daherzli@physbio-tech.net.']","['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",PMC4529034,['NOTNLM'],"['Angiogenesis', 'Imaging', 'Mouse', 'Renal development', 'Transcriptional regulation', 'Vascular mural cells', 'Vascular patterning']","['dev.124776 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.124776 [doi]']",10.1242/dev.124776 [doi],20150702,"['R01 DK045218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD061403/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK08723/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK45218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,['(c) 2015.

Epub 2015 Jul 3.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression and thereby control most, if not all, biological processes. Aberrant miRNA expression has been linked to a variety of human diseases including cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanism often remains unclear. Here we have screened a miRNA expression library in a growth factor-dependent mouse pre-B-cell system to identify miRNAs with oncogenic activity. We show that miR-125b is sufficient to render pre-B cells growth factor independent and demonstrate that continuous expression of miR-125b is necessary to keep these cells in a transformed state. Mechanistically, we find that the expression of miR-125b protects against apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal, and that it blocks the differentiation of pre-B to immature B cells. In consequence, miR-125b-transformed cells maintain expression of their pre-B-cell receptor that provides signals for continuous proliferation and survival even in the absence of growth factor. Employing microarray analysis, we identified numerous targets of miR-125b, but only reconstitution of MAP3K11, a critical regulator of mitogen- and stress-activated kinase signaling, interferes with the cellular fitness of the transformed cells. Together, this indicates that MAP3K11 might function as an important tumor suppressor neutralized by oncomiR-125b in B-cell leukemia.","['Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (bioss), Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter Innsbruck, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, Biocenter Innsbruck, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (bioss), Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (bioss), Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter Innsbruck, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (bioss), Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter Innsbruck, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']","['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn125 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 11)']",PMC4678593,,,"['cdd201587 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2015.87 [doi]']",10.1038/cdd.2015.87 [doi],20150703,['W 1101/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],['EMS64947'],,,,['NLM: EMS64947'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, the human U251MG glioblastoma tumor line is the most sensitive, with an IC50 of 6.7 muM, compared with normal fibroblasts, which have an IC50 > 20 muM. Treatment of U251MG cells that harbor aberrantly active signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3 with Cmpd1 suppresses Stat3 tyrosine705 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in parallel with the induction of pserine727 Stat3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (pErk1/2(MAPK)). Inhibition of pErk1/2(MAPK) induction by the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 [2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one] blocked both the pserine727 Stat3 induction and ptyrosine705 Stat3 suppression by Cmpd1, indicating dependency on the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-Erk1/2(MAPK) pathway for Cmpd1-induced modulation of Stat3 signaling. Cmpd1 also blocked epidermal growth factor-stimulated pStat1 induction, whereas upregulating pSrc, pAkt, p-p38, pHeat shock protein 27, and pmammalian target of rapamycin levels. However, pJanus kinase 2 and pEpidermal growth factor receptor levels were not significantly altered.

Taken together, these data identify a novel mechanism for the inhibition of Stat3 signaling by a resveratrol analog and suggest that the preferential growth inhibitory effects of Cmp1 occur in part by Erk1/2(MAPK)-dependent modulation of constitutively active Stat3.","['Natural Products and Experimental Therapeutics Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, Hawaii (Z.L.C., P.Y., D.P., J.T.); Daniel K.

Epub 2015 Jul 2.,"DNA copy number analysis has been instrumental for the identification of genetic alterations in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Notably, some of these genetic defects have been associated with poor treatment outcome and might be relevant for future risk stratification. In this study, we characterized recurrent deletions of CD200 and BTLA genes, mediated by recombination-activating genes, and used breakpoint-specific polymerase chain reaction assay to screen a cohort of 1154 cases of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia uniformly treated according to the EORTC-CLG 58951 protocol. CD200/BTLA deletions were identified in 56 of the patients (4.8%) and were associated with an inferior 8-year event free survival in this treatment protocol [70.2% +/- 1.2% for patients with deletions versus 83.5% +/- 6.4% for non-deleted cases (hazard ratio 2.02; 95% confidence interval 1.23-3.32; P=0.005)]. Genetically, CD200/BTLA deletions were strongly associated with ETV6-RUNX1-positive leukemias (P<0.0001), but were also identified in patients who did not have any genetic abnormality that is currently used for risk stratification. Within the latter population of patients, the presence of CD200/BTLA deletions was associated with inferior event-free survival and overall survival.

Therefore, Taspase1 represents a conditional oncoprotein in the context of t(4;11) leukemia. In this report, we used site-directed mutagenesis to unravel the molecular events by which Taspase1 becomes sequentially activated. Monomeric pro-enzymes form dimers which are autocatalytically processed into the enzymatically active form of Taspase1 (alphabetabetaalpha). The active enzyme cleaves only very few target proteins, e.g., MLL, MLL4 and TFIIA at their corresponding consensus cleavage sites (CSTasp1) as well as AF4-MLL in the case of leukemogenic translocation. This knowledge was translated into the design of a dominant-negative mutant of Taspase1 (dnTASP1). As expected, simultaneous expression of the leukemogenic AF4-MLL and dnTASP1 causes the disappearance of the leukemogenic oncoprotein, because the uncleaved AF4-MLL protein (328 kDa) is subject to proteasomal degradation, while the cleaved AF4-MLL forms a stable oncogenic multi-protein complex with a very long half-life. Moreover, coexpression of dnTASP1 with a BFP-CSTasp1-GFP FRET biosensor effectively inhibits cleavage. The impact of our findings on future drug development and potential treatment options for t(4;11) leukemia will be discussed.","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, Max-von-Laue-Str. 9, D-60438 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, ETH Zurich, Wolfgang-Pauli-Str. 10, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, Max-von-Laue-Str. 9, D-60438 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, Max-von-Laue-Str. 9, D-60438 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, ETH Zurich, Wolfgang-Pauli-Str. 10, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, Max-von-Laue-Str. 9, D-60438 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']","['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (taspase1, human)']",PMC4486195,['NOTNLM'],"['AF4-MLL', 'Oncoprotein activation', 'Taspase1', 't(4;11) leukemia']","['10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.04.009 [doi]', 'S2352-3964(15)00103-6 [pii]']",10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.04.009 [doi],20150416,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20150703']

The study was conducted in 95 children with ALL and 190 healthy control subjects from the Turkish population. The data revealed no difference in the prevalence of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes between the childhood ALL patients and the controls. No association was found between GSTP1 Ile105Val variants and the susceptibility to childhood ALL, separately or in combination.

Several drugs have been ascribed with the ability to provoke ICD when employed as standalone therapeutic interventions. These include various chemotherapeutics routinely employed in the clinic (e.g., doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone, bleomycin, bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and oxaliplatin) as well as some anticancer agents that are still under preclinical or clinical development (e.g., some microtubular inhibitors of the epothilone family). In addition, a few drugs are able to convert otherwise non-immunogenic instances of cell death into bona fide ICD, and may therefore be employed as chemotherapeutic adjuvants within combinatorial regimens.

Epub 2015 Feb 26.,"BAALC is a novel molecular marker in leukemia that is highly expressed in patients with acute leukemia. Increased expression levels of BAALC are known as poor prognostic factors in adult acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of the BAALC gene expression levels in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its association with MDR1. Using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the mRNA expression levels of BAALC and MRD1 were measured in bone marrow samples of 28 new diagnosed childhood ALL patients and 13 children without cancer. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was measured one year after the initiation of the chemotherapy using the RT-qPCR method. The high level expression of BAALC had a significant association with the pre-B-ALL subtype, leukocytosis and positive MRD after one year of treatment in leukemic patients. In addition, a positive correlation between BAALC and MDR1 mRNA expression was shown in this group. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, the increase of BAALC expression as a poor prognostic factor for childhood ALL is shown for the first time. Additionally, the correlation between BAALC and MDR1 in mRNA expression levels can aid for an improved understanding of the mechanism through which BAALC may function in ALL and multidrug resistance.","['Division of Cell, Molecular and Developmental Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Isfahan 81746-73441, Iran.', 'Division of Cell, Molecular and Developmental Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Isfahan 81746-73441, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Sayed Al-Shohada Hospital, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan 81856-66153, Iran.', 'Division of Cell, Molecular and Developmental Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Isfahan 81746-73441, Iran.', 'Division of Cell, Molecular and Developmental Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Isfahan 81746-73441, Iran.']",,PMC4467268,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1 gene', 'BAALC gene', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'multidrug resistance']","['10.3892/br.2015.437 [doi]', 'BR-0-0-437 [pii]']",,20150226,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, the acetylation of N-terminal histone tails represents the fundamental epigenetic mark of open structure chromatin and active gene transcription. The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins are epigenetic readers which utilize tandem bromodomains (BRD) modules to recognize and dock themselves on the acetylated lysine tails. The BET proteins act as scaffolds for the recruitment of transcription factors and chromatin organizers required in transcription initiation and elongation. The recent discovery of small molecules capable of blocking their lysine-binding pocket is the first paradigm of successful pharmacological inhibition of epigenetic readers. JQ1 is a prototype benzodiazepine molecule and a specific BET inhibitor with antineoplastic activity both in solid tumours and haematological malignancies. The quinolone I-BET151 and the suitable for clinical development I-BET762 benzodiazepine were introduced in parallel with JQ1 and have also shown potent antitumour activity in preclinical studies. I-BET762 is currently being tested in early phase clinical trials, along with a rapidly growing list of other BET inhibitors. Unlike older epigenetic therapies, the study of BET inhibitors has offered substantial, context-specific, mechanistic insights of their antitumour activity, which will facilitate optimal therapeutic targeting in future. Here, we review the development of this novel class of epigenetic drugs, the biology of BET protein inhibition, the emerging evidence from preclinical work and early phase clinical studies and we discuss their potential role in the treatment of haematological malignancies.","['Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, 4th Floor Commonwealth Building, Hammersmith Campus, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.']",,PMC4480520,['NOTNLM'],"['BET proteins', 'MYC', 'acetylation', 'acute leukaemia', 'benzodiazepines', 'bromodomains', 'lymphoma', 'multiple myeloma']","['10.1177/2040620715576662 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620715576662 [pii]']",10.1177/2040620715576662 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the exception of a few specific AML subtypes, the mainstays of treatment have not significantly changed over the last 20 years, and are still based on standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. As a result, clinical outcome remains poor for the majority of patients, with overall long-term survival in the region of 20-30%. Recent successes in characterizing the genetic landscape of AML have highlighted that, despite its heterogeneity, many cases of AML carry recurrent mutations in genes encoding epigenetic regulators. Transcriptional dysregulation and altered epigenetic function have therefore emerged as exciting areas in AML research and it is becoming increasingly clear that epigenetic dysfunction is central to leukemogenesis in AML. This has subsequently paved the way for the development of epigenetically targeted therapies. In this review, we will discuss the most recent advances in our understanding of the role of epigenetic dysregulation in AML pathobiology. We will particularly focus on those altered epigenetic programs that have been shown to be central to the development and maintenance of AML in preclinical models. We will discuss the recent development of therapeutics specifically targeting these key epigenetic programs in AML, describe their mechanism of action and present their current clinical development. Finally, we will discuss the opportunities presented by epigenetically targeted therapy in AML and will highlight future challenges ahead for the AML community, to ensure that these novel therapeutics are optimally translated into clinical practice and result in clinical improvement for AML patients.","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council, Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK.']",,PMC4480521,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'epigenetics', 'targeted therapy']","['10.1177/2040620715577614 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620715577614 [pii]']",10.1177/2040620715577614 [doi],,"['14-1069/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'MR/M010392/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transformation of the tumor F6 cell line from human fetal mesenchymal stem cells (FMSCs) was first reported in a previous study that also identified the presence of a population of cancer stem cells in the F6 cell line. However, the existence of the epigenetic changes during the transformation process have yet to be elucidated. To confirm the role of the FHIT gene in the transformation process of FMSC, the expression level and methylation status of the FHIT gene was examined in F6 tumor cells and FMSCs. Additionally, the alteration in cell morphology, the cell cycle and apoptosis in F6 cells following 5-Aza-CdR treatment was assessed. It was found that the FHIT gene was expressed in FMSCs, but not in F6 cells. The methylation-specific PCR results demonstrated that the promoter methylation of FHIT genes existed in the F6 cell line. Subsequent to treatment with 5-Aza-CdR the expression of FHIT genes was restored in F6 cells. In addition, the morphology of F6 cells was altered, and the cell cycle was arrested in the G2 phase, with the initiation of apoptosis. Overall, the present findings demonstrated that the FHIT gene was methylated in F6 cells and demethylation treatment lead to changes in the biological characteristics, thereby promoting the apoptosis of F6 cells. FHIT gene methylation may be one of the molecular events involved in the development and transformation of FMSCs into F6 tumor cells.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, P.R.

However, the expression levels of miR-203 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its clinical significance remain unknown. In the present study, the association between B-cell-specific moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi1) and miR-203 was investigated. miR-203 was demonstrated to act as a tumor suppressor by regulating the expression of Bmi1. miR-203 expression levels were downregulated in NSCLC tissues while Bmi1 expression was upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, downregulated Bmi1 or enhanced miR-203 expression inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. In addition, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed, which identified Bmi1 as a novel target of miR-203. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that miR-203 functions as a tumor suppressor and is important in inhibiting the proliferation of NSCLC cells through targeting Bmi1. These findings indicate that miR-203 may be useful as a novel potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.","['Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, P.R.

Thus, numerous studies have focused on the development of novel treatments for brain tumors. Frog ribonucleases, such as Onconase and Rana catesbeiana ribonuclease (RC-RNase), exert antitumor effects on various tumor cells, including cervical cancer, breast cancer, hepatoma, leukemia, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer cells. In addition, frog Onconase has been applied as a treatment in clinical trials. However, the antitumor effects of frog ribonucleases on brain tumors are unclear. Previous studies have indicated that RC-RNase demonstrates a decreased cytotoxic effect in normal cells compared with Onconase. Therefore, the present study investigated the ability of RC-RNase to exert antitumor activities on human glioblastoma. It was found that RC-RNase inhibits the growth of the human glioblastoma DBTRG, GBM8901 and GBM8401 cells. In addition, the present study revealed that RC-RNase induces caspase-9/-3 activity and triggers the apoptotic cell death pathway in human glioblastoma cells. Notably, it was also demonstrated that RC-RNase effectively inhibits the growth of human glioblastoma tumors in a nude mouse model.

Epub 2015 Feb 27.,"The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) increases with age. Elderly patients with AML are less tolerant to high-intensity consolidation therapy than younger patients, with significantly worse prognoses. Induction and consolidation therapy combined with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell microtransplantation may improve the prognosis of elderly patients with AML. The present study reports the effect of maintenance therapy with low-dose chemotherapy treatment combined with microtransplantation in elderly patients with AML following consolidation. Between January 2011 and April 2014, three elderly patients (>55 years old), including one 58-year-old patient with acute mixed lineage leukemia (AMLL) and two patients with AML aged 59 years and 62 years, underwent microtransplantation maintenance therapy. Following a complete response to induction chemotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy with two to four cycles of medium dose Ara-c (auto transplantation was performed in the patient with AMLL), maintenance therapy was performed using low-dose Ara-c combined with human leukocyte antigen haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell microtransplantation, which was repeated every 3 to 6 months. The patients were followed up for 27, 20 and 16 months, respectively, and all three patients achieved disease-free survival. The bone marrow Wilms' tumor suppression gene (WT1) level of the case with AMLL was dynamically monitored. The results showed that the WT1 level was abnormally high prior to microtransplantation and gradually declined to normal levels subsequent to the process. None of the patients suffered from graft versus host disease during the microtransplantation process. In conclusion, microtransplantation maintenance therapy following consolidation therapy is feasible in elderly patients with AML, and is expected to be able to further remove residual lesions and improve treatment efficacy. A large-scale clinical trial is required to confirm the effect of maintenance therapy in elderly patients with AML.","[""Department of Hematology, 303rd Hospital of The People's Liberation Army, Nanning, Guangxi 530021, P.R.

The patient presented with mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, hepatosplenomegaly, a high neutrophil alkaline phosphatase score and an absence of the Philadelphia chromosome or the BCR-ABL fusion gene. A bone marrow aspirate smear and biopsy indicated that the CNL coexisted with a plasma cell neoplasm. In addition, monoclonal lambda-paraproteinemia was detected by serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis, and bone lesions were identified in multiple vertebrae. The patient achieved complete remission following one cycle of induction chemotherapy with the decitabine regimen in combination with the low-dose cytarabine, aclarubicin and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (CAG) priming regimen. The occurrence of CNL and MM concurrently is extremely rare and thus, it has only been reported in a small number of cases. The occurrence of CNL and MM in the same patient as two distinct hematological malignancies indicates the neoplastic transformation of a pluripotent stem cell. Decitabine combined with the CAG priming regimen may present a good therapeutic strategy for elderly patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia.","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Jiangning Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, P.R.

Epub 2015 Mar 27.,"Dyslipidemia is a common feature in immunosuppressed patients, such as kidney and bone marrow transplantation recipients and patients with breast, prostate or gynecological carcinoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In addition, high levels of oxidatively modified low-density lipoproteins (oxLDLs) are closely associated with carcinogenesis. There are, however, no reports on the association between the serum oxLDL levels and the expression of important immunomodulatory molecules in patients with hematological disorders. In the present study, 39 patients with hematological disorders were stratified into four groups: Two groups with malignancies [chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)] and two groups without malignancies [myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA)]. Immunomodulatory molecules were monitored in these groups. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results indicated that the plasma oxLDL levels were significantly higher in patients with AML or CML than those in patients with MDS or IDA. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction results revealed that the expression of numerous important immunomodulatory elements, including tumor-related genes, immunological and inflammatory cytokines, defense-responsive genes, genes regulating cell proliferation, adhesion and migration molecules and leukocyte chemotaxis genes, showed considerable variation in patients with hematological disorders, particularly in those with MDS or IDA, as compared with the expression in the healthy volunteers. The present study demonstrated that, in patients with a hematological malignancy (either AML or CML), the activation of numerous immune response-related molecules was inhibited. Thus, an association between hematological malignancies and dyslipidemia, i.e. high levels of oxLDL, is suggested. Further research is necessary to investigate how oxLDL influences cancer progression.","[""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan 610072, P.R.

Although the causative events that lead to the onset of IBD are yet to be fully elucidated, deregulation of immune and inflammatory mechanisms are hypothesized to significantly contribute to this disorder. Since the onset of IBD is often during infancy, in the present study, the serum values of a large panel of cytokines and chemokines in pediatric patients (<18 years; n=26) were compared with age-matched controls (n=37). While elevations in the serum level of several proinflammatory and immune regulating cytokines were confirmed, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-5, IL-7, interferon (IFN)-gamma-inducible protein-10, IL-16, cutaneous T-cell-attracting chemokine, leukemia inhibitory factor, monokine induced by gamma-IFN, IFN-alpha2 and IFN-gamma, notably decreased levels of IL-2, IL-17 and macrophage inhibitory protein-1beta were also observed. Therefore, while a number of proinflammatory cytokines exhibit increased levels in IBD patients, pediatric IBD patients may also exhibit certain aspects of a reduced immunological response.","[""Department of Advanced Diagnostic and Clinical Trials, Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS 'Burlo Garofolo', Trieste 34137, Italy."", ""Department of Advanced Diagnostic and Clinical Trials, Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS 'Burlo Garofolo', Trieste 34137, Italy."", ""Department of Advanced Diagnostic and Clinical Trials, Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS 'Burlo Garofolo', Trieste 34137, Italy."", ""Department of Advanced Diagnostic and Clinical Trials, Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS 'Burlo Garofolo', Trieste 34137, Italy ; Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste 34127, Italy."", 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara 44121, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara 44121, Italy.', ""Department of Advanced Diagnostic and Clinical Trials, Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS 'Burlo Garofolo', Trieste 34137, Italy.""]",,PMC4473502,['NOTNLM'],"['chemokines', 'cytokines', 'inflammatory bowel disease']","['10.3892/etm.2015.2370 [doi]', 'ETM-0-0-2370 [pii]']",,20150319,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in a rat model of cerebral ischemia. Rat cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion. Following treatment with 500 or 50 ng IL-6, the infarct volumes and symptoms of neurological deficit were ameliorated. Furthermore, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining suggested that the IL-6 treatment reduced neuronal apoptosis in vivo, which was consistent with a lower percentage of annexin V- and caspase-3-positive cortical neurons. In addition, IL-6 in vitro induced the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and the expression of induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl-1, but not the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2, suggesting the activation of the Janus kinase/STAT pathway by IL-6. IL-6 also appeared to be involved in the regulation of cytokine secretion and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in cerebral ischemia. IL-6 downregulated a number of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-1beta, as well as myeloperoxidase activity, indicating the accumulation of granulocytes in the ischemic brain tissue. IL-6 was also observed to support the integrity of the BBB by reducing Evans blue leakage in vivo and suppressing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in ischemic brain tissue. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that the neuroprotective effects of IL-6 in cerebral ischemia are the result of a range of processes, including the modulation of cell apoptosis, cytokine secretion and the integrity of the BBB. IL-6 could therefore be used as a therapeutic agent in clinical practice.","['Department of Pharmacy, Central Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, P.R.

It consists of several subgroups with different cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations, clinical presentations and outcomes. Banding cytogenetics plays a pivotal role in the detection of recurrent chromosomal rearrangements and is the starting point of genetic analysis in ALL, still. Nowadays, molecular (cyto)genetic tools provide substantially to identify previously non-detectable, so-called cryptic chromosomal aberrations in ALL. However, ALL according to banding cytogenetics with normal karyotype - in short cytogenetically normal ALL (CN-ALL) - represent up to ~50 % of all new diagnosed ALL cases. The overall goal of this study was to identify and characterize the rate of cryptic alterations in CN-ALL and to rule out if one single routine approach may be sufficient to detect most of the cryptic alterations present. RESULTS: Sixty-one ALL patients with CN-ALL were introduced in this study. All of them underwent high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Also DNA could be extracted from 34 ALL samples. These DNA-samples were studied using a commercially available MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) probe set directed against 37 loci in hematological malignancies and/or array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 21 of 61 samples (~34 %) applying FISH approaches: structural abnormalities were present in 15 cases and even numerical ones were identified in 6 cases. Applying molecular approaches copy number alterations (CNAs) were detected in 27/34 samples. Overall, 126 CNAs were identified and only 34 of them were detectable by MLPA (~27 %). Loss of CNs was identified in ~80 % while gain of CNs was present in ~20 % of the 126 CNAs. A maximum of 13 aberrations was detected per case; however, only one aberration per case was found in 8 of all in detail studied 34 cases. Of special interest among the detected CNAs are the following new findings: del(15)(q26.1q26.1) including CHD2 gene was found in 20 % of the studied ALL cases, dup(18)(q21.2q21.2) with the DCC gene was present in 9 % of the cases, and the CDK6 gene in 7q21.2 was deleted in 12 % of the here in detail studied ALL cases. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, high resolution molecular cytogenetic tools and molecular approaches like MLPA and aCGH need to be combined in a cost-efficient way, to identify disease and progression causing alterations in ALL, as majority of them are cryptic in banding cytogenetic analyses.","['Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Genomics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal ; CIMAGO, Centro de Investigacao em Meio Ambiente, Geneticae Oncobiologia, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Genomics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal ; CIMAGO, Centro de Investigacao em Meio Ambiente, Geneticae Oncobiologia, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany ; Croatian Institute of Brain Research, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany.', 'Cytogenetic Laboratory, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre and Institute, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics (Oncology and Hematology), Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany.', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany ; Department of Pediatrics (Oncology and Hematology), Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany.', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany.', 'ZytoVision GmbH, Bremerhaven, Germany.', 'Cytogenetics Department, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, RJ Brazil ; Post Graduation Program in Oncology, National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ Brazil.', 'Pediatric Oncohematology Center, Hospital Oswaldo Cruz/ Pos Graduation Course of the Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE Brazil.', 'Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany.']",,PMC4486437,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'Array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)', 'Cryptic rearrangements', 'Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)', 'Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)', 'Multitude multicolor banding (mMCB)']","['10.1186/s13039-015-0153-4 [doi]', '153 [pii]']",10.1186/s13039-015-0153-4 [doi],20150630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
