The cells were cultured up to 48 h in the presence of drugs alone and in the following combinations: 2-CdA+DOX, 2-CdA+MIT, and 2-CdA+IDA. Apoptosis was assessed after 24 h and 48 h of incubation using annexin V/propidium iodide assay by flow cytometry. The apoptotic index (AI) was defined as a percentage of annexin V-positive B-CLL cells. Additionally, in some patients other hallmarks of apoptosis (activation of caspases, DNA fragmentation) were assessed in parallel for confirmation of apoptotic mode of induced cell death. All of the cytostatics induced apoptosis of B-CLL cells at a rate significantly higher than the index of spontaneous apoptosis occurring during 24 h and 48 h of cell culture. 2-CdA in combination with DOX significantly increased the percentage of annexin V-positive cells, particularly after 48 h of incubation, as compared with DOX used in monotherapy (median AI for 2-CdA+DOX=37.9%, median AI for DOX =13.8%, P=0.0011, and median AI for 2-CdA=22.1%, P=0.013). Combination of 2-CdA with MIT induced a similar effect, also more distinct after 48 h (median AI for 2-CdA+MIT=41.05%, median AI for MIT=16.3%, p=0.0012, and median AI for 2-CdA=22.1%, p=0.017). For both combinations median AI were similar to the sum of median AI for each drug when used alone. IDA in a concentration ten times lower (0.1 micro g/ml) than used before in acute leukemia cells produced high cytotoxic effects, masking the additive effect of combination with 2-CdA. Only at a dose of 25 ng/ml of IDA, significant differences in AI after 24 h and 48 h were detected between samples treated with 2-CdA+IDA (median 27.5% and 65.0%, respectively) and those incubated with IDA alone (median 10.5% and 33.4%; P=0.0004 and 0.0274, respectively). Similarly, there were significant differences between AI of cells treated with 2-CdA+IDA and 2-CdA alone (median 9.5% at 24 h and 23.5% at 48 h; P=0.0013 and 0.0207, respectively). In conclusion; these data indicate an additive cytotoxic effect on B-CLL cells of DOX, MIT, and IDA applied in vitro with 2-CdA; all of them induced apoptosis with similar efficacy. We suggest that further preclinical and clinical studies concerning combined use of 2-CdA with anthracyclines are desirable. High sensitivity of B-CLL cells to IDA suggests the possibility of lowering its dose in patients, especially when combined with 2-CdA.","['Szmigielska-Kaplon, A', 'Smolewski, P', 'Najder, M', 'Robak, T']","['Szmigielska-Kaplon A', 'Smolewski P', 'Najder M', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20020913,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology']",2002/10/10 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/10/10 04:00'],"['2002/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/10 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-002-0527-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2002 Sep;81(9):508-13. doi: 10.1007/s00277-002-0527-7.

The French-American-British (FAB) classification provides significant prognostic information, but carries the disadvantage of arbitrary demarcation of subgroups and overemphasis of morphological findings. In addition, there is considerable variation in survival and risk of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) development even within defined FAB subgroups, particularly in patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Over the last 2 decades, several research groups have tried to identify additional clinical, hematological, and cell biological parameters in order to more accurately predict the natural course of MDS. These investigations have clarified that the number and extent of peripheral blood cytopenias, the bone marrow blast count, and the cytogenetic pattern are the most powerful prognostic indicators in MDS. Recent efforts have been directed at constructing prognostic scoring systems. These scoring systems try to enhance the predictive power by combining several features of the disease, which have proved their independent prognostic weight on multivariate analysis. The International MDS Risk Analysis Workshop substantially advanced the prognostic categorization of MDS patients by proposing a new scoring system (International Prognosis Scoring System, IPSS) that can be successfully applied to risk assessment of newly diagnosed patients and will likely prove useful for the design and analysis of therapeutic trials in MDS.","['Aul, C', 'Giagounidis, A', 'Germing, U', 'Ganser, A']","['Aul C', 'Giagounidis A', 'Germing U', 'Ganser A']","['Medizinische Klinik II (Hamatologie, Onkologie und Immunologie), St. Johannes-Hospital Duisburg, An der Abtei 7-11, 47166 Duisburg, Germany. info@krebs-duisburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20020924,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Models, Statistical', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment/methods/statistics & numerical data']",2002/10/10 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/10/10 04:00'],"['2002/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/10 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-002-0530-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2002 Sep;81(9):485-97. doi: 10.1007/s00277-002-0530-z.

However, in the 1940s up to about 1956, radiotherapy with ""Peteosthor"" - a drug containing Thorium X ((224)Ra) as an effective compound - was introduced in Germany as a presumed cure and it maintained a central place in the treatment of these diseases. In 1948, I was entrusted to assess the new treatment. Animal studies and the clinical evaluation of the patients made me soon realise a number of severe adverse health effects which induced me to pronounce and subsequently repeat warnings against the intravenous administration of high doses of (224)Ra, especially because it was then administered predominantly to children and juveniles. As a consequence, this type of treatment was finally abandoned in 1956. But there remained a need to observe and document the resulting late health effects. Already in 1967, our initial follow-up study provided data for about 800 patients with exact information on the (224)Ra dose levels administered, administration schemes, and the resulting detrimental effects.

Many chemotherapeutics with clinical impact are substrates for the structurally distant related membrane transport protein MRP1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1). Thus, we were interested in analysing the behaviour of DHT and control compounds in specific drug transport of MRP1 overexpressing cells. We established a fluorescence based drug efflux system for specific, functional detection of interference of a test compound in MRP1 mediated drug extrusion. Briefly, MRP1 overexpressing HL60/Adr cells were incubated to uptake and then efflux fluorescent 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA), rhodamine 123 (Rh123), or 3,3-diethylocarbocyanine iodide (DiOC2), respectively. Changes in cell fluorescence intensity after coincubation with the compound of interest were determined by flow cytometry. MRP1 mediated efflux of CFDA was analysed in the presence of DHT, the known substrates genistein, probenecid, and the specific inhibitor MK-571. To exclude unknown P-gp related interference in drug transport, efflux of the fluorescent P-gp substrate DiOC2 and specific inhibition by cyclosporin A (CsA) were analysed. Cytotoxicity of DHT in resistant HL60/Adr cells was found to be even superior to that in the parental HL60 leukaemia cell line. Consequently, DHT did not interfere in MRP1 mediated drug transport. In contrast to DiOC2, rhodamine 123 was not specifically effluxed by P-gp but also by MRP1. Therefore, we propose the MRP1 specific CFDA efflux model as a screening and/or excluding system for MRP1 substrates. Together with previous data our results suggest DHT to be an interesting candidate for further investigation directed towards a drug development regimen.","['Pec, Martina K', 'Aguirre, Amable', 'Fernandez, Javier J', 'Souto, Maria L', 'Dorta, Javier F', 'Villar, Jesus']","['Pec MK', 'Aguirre A', 'Fernandez JJ', 'Souto ML', 'Dorta JF', 'Villar J']","['Unidiad de Investigacion, Hospital Ntra Sra Candelaria, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain. martinakpec@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Genes, MDR', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pyrans/*pharmacology']",2002/10/10 04:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/10/10 04:00'],"['2002/10/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/10 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2002 Nov;10(5):605-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (dehydrothyrsiferol)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The decision about the intent to treat and the timing of GH replacement needs to be taken in collaboration with the paediatric oncologist who will provide guidance about overall prognosis and the risk of relapse. After a dose of > or =30 Gy to the hypothalamic pituitary axis the risk of GH deficiency (GHD) 2 years later is very high (>50%) and therefore there is 'solid' epidemiological evidence, which predicts outcome. Therapeutically the choice is whether or not to offer GH replacement at 2 years in the presence of biochemical evidence of GHD but independent of auxology, or wait until the growth rate declines. Diagnostically the IGF-1 SDS is more useful than previously thought, particularly if XRT-induced GHD is severe; there may, however, be systematic discordancy between the GH responses to different pharmacological stimuli (ITT vs. arginine). For irradiated children in categories 2 and 3, greater emphasis is placed on auxology in determining the need for assessment of GH status. Early rather than very precocious puberty is a real issue and needs to be actively treated with a GnRH analogue if final height appears to be significantly compromised.","['Shalet, S M', 'Brennan, B M D']","['Shalet SM', 'Brennan BM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK. stephen.m.shalet@man.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Horm Res,Hormone research,0366126,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', '*Growth', 'Human Growth Hormone/*deficiency/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2002/10/10 04:00,2003/03/18 04:00,['2002/10/10 04:00'],"['2002/10/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/10 04:00 [entrez]']","['64768 [pii]', '10.1159/000064768 [doi]']",ppublish,Horm Res. 2002;58 Suppl 1:86-90. doi: 10.1159/000064768.,['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)'],35,"['Copyright 2002 S.

Signaling through focal adhesion kinase (FAK) impacts these processes, although its role during nephrogenesis requires further delineation. We previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin is not downregulated in cystic kidneys from B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bcl-2) -/- mice. Here we examine whether FAK downstream signaling pathways are affected in these cystic kidneys. Cystic kidneys from bcl-2 -/- mice exhibited sustained phosphorylation of Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK, ERK1). However, similar levels of expression were noted for phosphorylated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, and its target protein kinase B/ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase in kidneys from postnatal day 20 bcl-2 +/+ and bcl-2 -/- mice. We also examined expression of the adapter protein Shc, implicated in growth and apoptosis. Expression of p66(Shc) decreases to low levels in postnatal kidneys, whereas p52/p46(Shc) was constitutively expressed during nephrogenesis. Shc expression was similar in normal and cystic kidneys. Therefore, sustained activation of MAPK/ERKs through the Src/FAK pathway may contribute to the hyperproliferation observed in cystic kidneys from bcl-2 -/- mice.","['Sorenson, Christine M', 'Sheibani, Nader']","['Sorenson CM', 'Sheibani N']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53792, USA. cmsorenson@facstaff.wisc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,American journal of physiology.

METHODS: Twenty-three patients with organized glomerular Ig deposits were classified into two groups based on the fibrillar or microtubular ultrastructural appearance of the deposits. Kidney biopsy samples were studied by immunofluorescence microscopy, using anti-light chain conjugates (all cases) and anti-IgG subclass conjugates (13 patients). In each group, we studied clinicopathological features, associated monoclonal gammapathy (detected by immunoelectrophoresis and/or immunoblot) or B-cell lymphoproliferative disease, effects of chemotherapy and long-term renal outcome. RESULTS: In 14 IT/MTGN and 9 FGN patients, clinical symptoms [hypertension, nephrotic syndrome (NS) and hematuria] and the mean diameters of the substructures were similar. In 13 IT/MTGN patients, glomerular (IgG1, 2 or 3) deposits were monotypic (kappa, 7 cases; lambda, 6 cases). Glomerular deposits were associated with a monoclonal Ig of the same isotype in eight patients, detected in the serum (5 cases), and/or in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes (4 cases), and with lymphoproliferative disease in seven patients. The ultrastructural features of monoclonal Ig inclusions in lymphocytes were similar to those of glomerular microtubular deposits. In contrast, none of the FGN patients presented lymphoplasmocytic proliferation or paraproteinemia. Glomerular Ig deposits were polyclonal in eight cases and contained IgG4 in all three cases studied. Although patient and renal survival did not differ significantly between the two groups, chemotherapy led to remission of NS in ten IT/MTGN patients, with parallel improvement in hematological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of ultrastructural patterns in these nephropathies is important. GN with organized microtubular monoclonal deposits (GOMMID) probably accounts for a large proportion of immunotactoid (microtubular) GN cases.","['Bridoux, Frank', 'Hugue, Valerie', 'Coldefy, Olivier', 'Goujon, Jean-Michel', 'Bauwens, Marc', 'Sechet, Anne', ""Preud'Homme, Jean-Louis"", 'Touchard, Guy']","['Bridoux F', 'Hugue V', 'Coldefy O', 'Goujon JM', 'Bauwens M', 'Sechet A', ""Preud'Homme JL"", 'Touchard G']","['Department of Nephrology, and Laboratory of Immunology and Immunopathology(CNRS ESA 6031), University Hospital, Poitiers, France. f.bridoux@chu-poitiers.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Kidney Int,Kidney international,0323470,IM,,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Glomerulonephritis/drug therapy/*immunology/*pathology', 'Hepatitis B Antibodies/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Microtubules/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraproteinemias/drug therapy/*immunology/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/10/10 04:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2002/10/10 04:00'],"['2002/10/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/10 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0085-2538(15)48734-4 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1523-1755.2002.00628.x [doi]']",ppublish,Kidney Int. 2002 Nov;62(5):1764-75. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1755.2002.00628.x.,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hepatitis B Antibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EPA has been shown to promote apoptosis in Ramos cells, and our present study was focused on a possible cell cycle arrest and the pathways by which the apoptotic process is induced. Apoptosis may proceed along the intrinsic (mitochondrial) or the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway, which are mediated via different caspases. Caspases are a class of homologous cysteine proteases recognized as pivotal mediators of apoptosis. We investigated whether EPA affects progression of the cell cycle or promotes apoptosis directly. By incorporation of [3H]thymidine and [3H]valine, we showed that DNA, as well as protein synthesis, was reduced after incubation of Ramos cells with EPA for 6 h. We monitored cell cycle distribution by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine staining and observed no cell cycle arrest in the EPA-incubated cells. Incubation of cells with EPA caused PS-flipping, as demonstrated by annexin V-binding (flow cytometry), and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase measured by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, we observed increased activity of caspase-3 and -9, but not of caspase-8. Whereas inhibitors of caspase-3 and -9 reduced EPA-induced apoptosis, inhibition of caspase-8 did not. This suggests that EPA may promote apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway in Ramos cells. Thus, the reduction in cell number can be explained by a direct apoptotic effect of EPA rather than via cell cycle arrest.","['Heimli, Hilde', 'Giske, Camilla', 'Naderi, Soheil', 'Drevon, Christian A', 'Hollung, Kristin']","['Heimli H', 'Giske C', 'Naderi S', 'Drevon CA', 'Hollung K']","['Institute for Nutrition Research, University of Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/10 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2002/10/10 04:00'],"['2002/10/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/10 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11745-002-0963-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Lipids. 2002 Aug;37(8):797-802. doi: 10.1007/s11745-002-0963-6.,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposed to a cocktail of growth factor, this HSC can self re-new and/or differentiate into the three lineages we have in the peripheral blood. These HSC are of major importance in the clinics since they can be used for some marrow (or stem cell) transplantation, and lead to the cure of a number of malignant and non malignant hemopathies. We have today three sources of HSC: the bone marrow, the mobilized peripheral blood stem cell and the cord blood. Bone marrow used to be the classical source of HSC after harvesting by aspirations in the iliac crest. However, this approach is now supplanted by the recovery of HSC in peripheral blood using a cell separation after four days of G-CSF administration. These are several advantages of this technique, but the most important one is the more rapid hematopoietic recovery after transplantation, reducing the risk of infection and transfusion. A recent source of HSC is the umbilical cord blood. At the moment of delivery, the cord blood is extremely enriched in HSC due to the migration of these cells from the liver to the bone marrow stroma, where they will persist after birth. We have learned that the marrow stroma display a major role in the regulation of hematopoiesis and the pathogenesis of several malignant hemopathies can be explained by disturbance in the function of stromal cell. We have particularly studied the patho-genesis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We have also observed that a subpopulation of stromal cells, the mesenchymal cells are of major importance in the microenvironment. In addition, the plasticity of these cells is demonstrated in vitro and we have currently a research program investigating its differentiation in neural cells. All these observations bring new promises in the treatment of hemopathies but also in some other neurological degenerative diseases.","['Bron, D', 'De Bruyn, C', 'Lagneaux, L', 'Tondreau, T', 'Delforge, A']","['Bron D', 'De Bruyn C', 'Lagneaux L', 'Tondreau T', 'Delforge A']",,['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Belgium,Bull Mem Acad R Med Belg,Bulletin et memoires de l'Academie royale de medecine de Belgique,7608462,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2002/10/10 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/10 04:00'],"['2002/10/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/10 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Mem Acad R Med Belg. 2002;157(1-2):135-45; discussion 145-6.,,,,,,"Les cellules souches hematopoietiques: sources, indications et perspectives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, a critical role for constitutive activation of Stat3 in tumor cell proliferation and survival has been established in diverse cancers. However, the oncogenic signaling pathways in melanoma cells remain to be fully defined. In this study, we demonstrate that Stat3 is constitutively activated in a majority of human melanoma cell lines and tumor specimens examined. Blocking Src tyrosine kinase activity, but not EGF receptor or JAK family kinases, leads to inhibition of Stat3 signaling in melanoma cell lines. Consistent with a role of Src in the pathogenesis of melanoma, we show that c-Src tyrosine kinase is activated in melanoma cell lines. Significantly, melanoma cells undergo apoptosis when either Src kinase activity or Stat3 signaling is inhibited. Blockade of Src or Stat3 is also accompanied by down-regulation of expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1. These findings demonstrate that Src-activated Stat3 signaling is important for the growth and survival of melanoma tumor cells.","['Niu, Guilian', 'Bowman, Tammy', 'Huang, Mei', 'Shivers, Steve', 'Reintgen, Douglas', 'Daud, Adil', 'Chang, Alfred', 'Kraker, Alan', 'Jove, Richard', 'Yu, Hua']","['Niu G', 'Bowman T', 'Huang M', 'Shivers S', 'Reintgen D', 'Daud A', 'Chang A', 'Kraker A', 'Jove R', 'Yu H']","['Immunology Program, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Department of Oncology, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, Florida, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'ErbB Receptors/physiology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Melanoma/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Pyridones/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein', 'src-Family Kinases/*physiology']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2002/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205859 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Oct 10;21(46):7001-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205859.,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'TSO2IAD7WJ (PD 180970)']",,,"['CA55652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA75243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89693/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription mapping of the FRA6F region identified 19 known genes, 10 within the FRA6F interval and nine in a proximal or distal position. The nucleotide sequence of FRA6F is rich in repetitive elements (LINE1 and LINE2, Alu, MIR, MER and endogenous retroviral sequences) as well as in matrix attachment regions (MARs), and shows several DNA segments with increased helix flexibility. We found that tight clusters of stem-loop structures were localized exclusively in the two regions with greater frequency of breakage. Chromosomal instability at FRA6F probably depends on a complex interaction of different factors, involving regions of greater DNA flexibility and MARs. We propose an additional mechanism of fragility at FRA6F, based on stem-loop structures which may cause delay or arrest in DNA replication. A senescence gene likely maps within FRA6F, as suggested by detection of deletion and translocation breakpoints involving this fragile site in immortal human-mouse cell hybrids and in SV40-immortalized human fibroblasts containing a human chromosome 6 deleted at q21. Deletion breakpoints within FRA6F are common in several types of human leukemias and solid tumors, suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene in the region. Moreover, a gene associated to hereditary schizophrenia maps within FRA6F. Therefore, FRA6F may represent a landmark for the identification and cloning of genes involved in senescence, leukemia, cancer and schizophrenia.","['Morelli, Cristina', 'Karayianni, Efthimia', 'Magnanini, Chiara', 'Mungall, Andrew J', 'Thorland, Erik', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Smith, David I', 'Barbanti-Brodano, Giuseppe']","['Morelli C', 'Karayianni E', 'Magnanini C', 'Mungall AJ', 'Thorland E', 'Negrini M', 'Smith DI', 'Barbanti-Brodano G']","['Department of Experimental and Diagnostic Medicine, Section of Microbiology and Center for Biotechnology, University of Ferrara, I-44100 Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Aging/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Fragile Sites', '*Chromosome Fragility', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2001/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2002/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205573 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Oct 17;21(47):7266-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205573.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Applying virus LTR-specific inverse-PCR and RT-PCR combined with automated sequencing on CasBr-M Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV) induced myeloid leukemias, 126 virus integration sites were cloned. Using locus- and LTR-specific primers, a nested-PCR/Southern-blotting procedure was developed on genomic DNA from a large panel of MuLV-induced leukemias, to analyse whether a particular virus insertion represented a cVIS. In fact 39 out of 41 integrations analysed this way appeared to represent a common virus integration.

The finding that 39 out of 41 integrations analysed represented a cVIS, suggests that the majority of the other virus insertions that were not yet analysed by the PCR/Southern-blotting method are located in a cVIS as well and may therefore also harbor novel disease genes.","['Joosten, Marieke', 'Vankan-Berkhoudt, Yolanda', 'Tas, Marjolein', 'Lunghi, Monja', 'Jenniskens, Yvonne', 'Parganas, Evan', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'van den Akker, Eric', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['Joosten M', 'Vankan-Berkhoudt Y', 'Tas M', 'Lunghi M', 'Jenniskens Y', 'Parganas E', 'Valk PJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'van den Akker E', 'Delwel R']","['The Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Dr. Molewaterplein 50, 3015GE Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Virus Integration']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2001/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2002/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205813 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Oct 17;21(47):7247-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205813.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax oncoprotein activates transcription from its long terminal repeat (LTR) through interaction with cellular factors such as CREB and a transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300. However, little is known about the interaction between Tax and transcriptional repressors. Here, we demonstrate the physical and functional interaction between Tax and HDAC1. We found that HDAC1 represses the trans-activation function of Tax in 293T and MT4 cells. However, this repression was restored by treatment with an HDAC inhibitor, Trichostatin A. We also observed physical interaction between Tax and HDAC1 both in vitro and in vivo. The N-terminal region of HDAC1 (amino acid residues 28-97) was required for this binding. Moreover, HDAC1 inhibited the synergistic trans-activation of Tax observed on ectopic expression of CBP. However, this repression was relieved by overexpression of CBP. Thus, HDAC1 is likely to compete with CBP in binding with Tax and functions as a negative regulator for the transcriptional activation by Tax.","['Ego, Takeshi', 'Ariumi, Yasuo', 'Shimotohno, Kunitada']","['Ego T', 'Ariumi Y', 'Shimotohno K']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2001/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2002/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205701 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Oct 17;21(47):7241-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205701.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene amplification is a well-characterized hallmark of genomic instability thought to result from recombination events following the formation of double-strand, chromosomal breaks. Therefore, gene amplification frequency serves as an indicator of genomic stability. The PALA assay is designed to measure directly the frequency with which a specific gene, CAD, is amplified within a cell's genome. We have used the PALA assay to analyse the effects of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) oncoprotein, Tax, on genomic amplification. We demonstrate that Tax-expressing cells are five-times more likely to undergo gene amplification than control cells. Additionally, we show that Tax alters the ability of cells to undergo the typical PALA-mediated G(1) phase cell cycle arrest, thereby allowing cells to replicate DNA in the absence of appropriate nucleotide pools. This effect is likely the mechanism by which Tax induces gene amplification. These data suggest that HTLV-I Tax alters the genomic stability of cells, an effect that may play an important role in Tax-mediated, HTLV-I associated cellular transformation.","['Lemoine, Francene J', 'Marriott, Susan J']","['Lemoine FJ', 'Marriott SJ']","['Interdepartmental Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Animals', 'Aspartate Carbamoyltransferase', 'Aspartic Acid/*analogs & derivatives', 'Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Glutamine-Hydrolyzing)', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Dihydroorotase', '*Gene Amplification', 'Gene Products, tax/*pharmacology', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/*analogs & derivatives', 'Rats']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2002/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205898 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Oct 17;21(47):7230-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205898.,"['0 (CAD trifunctional enzyme)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '78QVZ7RG8L (sparfosic acid)', 'EC 2.1.3.2 (Aspartate Carbamoyltransferase)', 'EC 3.5.2.3 (Dihydroorotase)', 'EC 6.3.5.5 (Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Glutamine-Hydrolyzing))', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)']",,,"['CA-09197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-77371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are searching for downstream targets of Jak2 in Bcr-Abl positive cells. It is known that c-Myc expression is required for the oncogenic effects of Bcr-Abl, and that over-expression of c-Myc complements the transformation defect of the Bcr-Abl SH2 deletion mutant. Moreover, the Bcr-Abl SH2 deletion mutant and an Abl C-terminal deletion mutant are deficient in activating c-Myc expression. Since the Jak2 binds to the C-terminal domain of Bcr-Abl and optimal Jak2 activation requires the SH2 domain, we tested whether Jak2 was involved in c-Myc protein induction by Bcr-Abl. We treated the 32Dp210 Bcr-Abl cells with the Jak2 specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG490, and found that this drug, like the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571, inhibited c-Myc protein induction by Bcr-Abl. Treatment of 32Dp210 Bcr-Abl cells with AG490 also inhibited c-MYC RNA expression. It is also known that c-Myc protein is a labile protein that is increased in amounts in response to various growth factors by a mechanism not involving new Myc protein formation. Treatment of 32Dp210 Bcr-Abl cells with both the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and AG490 blocked the reduction of the c-Myc protein observed by AG490 alone. An adaptor protein SH2-Bbeta is involved in the enhancement of the tyrosine kinase activity of Jak2 following ligand/receptor interaction. In this regard we showed that the Jak2/Bcr-Abl complex contains SH2-Bbeta. Expression of the SH2-Bbeta R555E mutant in 32Dp210 Bcr-Abl cells reduced c-Myc expression about 40% compared to a vector control. Interestingly, we found the reduction of the c-Myc protein in several clones of dominant-negative (DN) Jak2 expressing K562 cells correlated very well with the reduction of tumor growth of these cells in nude mice as compared to vector transfected K562 cells. Both STI-571 and AG490 also induced apoptosis in 32Dp210 cells. Of interest, IL-3 containing medium reversed the STI-571 induced apoptosis of 32Dp210 cells but did not reverse the induction of apoptosis by AG490, which strongly supports the specificity of the inhibitory effects of AG490 on the Jak2 tyrosine kinase. In summary, our findings indicate that Jak2 mediates the increase in c-Myc expression that is induced by Bcr-Abl. Our results indicate that activated Jak2 not only mediates an increase of c-MYC RNA expression but also interferes with proteasome-dependent degradation of c-Myc protein.","['Xie, Shanhai', 'Lin, Hui', 'Sun, Tong', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B']","['Xie S', 'Lin H', 'Sun T', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, Texas, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'Xenopus Proteins/metabolism']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2002/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205942 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Oct 17;21(47):7137-46. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205942.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SH2B1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5B protein, Xenopus)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,"['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intensity of in vitro inhibition of topoisomerase II activity by ADM was almost the same as that by THP. There were no significant differences between the uptake of either of these agents by the isolated nuclei of L1210 cells. The nuclear uptake of both agents in the presence of the cytosolic fraction of L1210 cells consisted of both simple diffusion and carrier-mediated components, and the carrier-mediated component of THP was approximately 2-fold higher than that of ADM. THP showed approximately 5-fold higher affinity to the proteasome than ADM, and interfered with ADM binding in a competitive manner.

We studied a large cohort of newly diagnosed de novo AML patients karyotyped on CALGB 8461 from 1984-1999, where trisomy was the sole abnormality. The common isolated trisomies (IT(C)), +8, +11, +13 and +21, comprised 90% of all sole trisomies. The outcome of 101 IT(C) patients was compared to that of 976 with normal and ""poor risk"" cytogenetics. The overall survival (OS) for IT(C) patients was unsatisfactory with 10% [95% confidence interval (CI), 3-17%] alive at 5 years. Repeated cycles of I/HDAC intensification did not improve outcome. However, SCT significantly improved relapse-free survival (RFS). Among IT(C) patients <60 years in first remission, only 1 of 7 receiving SCT relapsed, compared to 16 of 19 patients treated with chemotherapy only. The prognosis of IT(C) was dependent on SCT. For non-transplanted patients, the 5-year OS for IT(C) was 5% (95% CI, 0-11%), compared to 20% (95% CI, 16-23%) for 640 normal cytogenetics patients. IT(C) was an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS in non-transplanted patients. In those receiving SCT, however, the 5-year OS for IT(C) patients (69%, 95% CI, 32-100%) was not different to that of transplanted normal cytogenetics patients (60%, 95% CI, 38-81%). We conclude that in de novo adult AML patients not receiving SCT, IT(C) appears to independently predict a poor outcome that may be improved with SCT in first remission.

The cells were incubated with drug concentrations up to 500 nM for periods between 3 and 24 hours, followed by morphological and biochemical analyses. All three substances induced DNA fragmentation, evident as DNA laddering and appearance of cells with hypodiploid DNA content, externalization of phosphatidyl serine, activation of caspases and degradation of the apoptosis-specific endonuclease inhibitor DFF45. However, concentrations and times necessary for these effects to occur were different, aclarubicin being the quickest acting drug with a lag phase of 3 h, followed by daunorubicin with 6 h and doxorubicin with 24 h. More importantly, aclarubicin induced these effects while the cell membrane was intact, whereas doxorubicin and daunorubicin led to immediate loss of membrane integrity. Programmed cell death is characterised by preservation of membrane integrity in order to allow removal of apoptotic bodies, whereas cell rupture is an early event in necrosis. We therefore suggest that, in our experimental settings, doxorubicin- and daunorubicin-induced cell death occurs by necrosis, while aclarubicin induces programmed cell death.","['Dartsch, D C', 'Schaefer, A', 'Boldt, S', 'Kolch, W', 'Marquardt, H']","['Dartsch DC', 'Schaefer A', 'Boldt S', 'Kolch W', 'Marquardt H']","['Department of Toxicology, Hamburg University Medical School, Vogt-Koelln Str 30, 22527 Hamburg, Germany. polka@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,,"['Aclarubicin/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Necrosis', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism']",2002/10/09 04:00,2003/06/14 05:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1020647211557 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2002 Dec;7(6):537-48. doi: 10.1023/a:1020647211557.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (caspase-activated DNase inhibitor)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the role of sialyl Lewis x oligosaccharides in tumor dissemination, human melanoma MeWo cells, which do not express sialyl Lewis x, were transfected with alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase III (FTIII), and cell lines expressing different amounts of sialyl Lewis x were isolated. When these cells were injected into the tail vein of nude mice, cells expressing moderate amounts of sialyl Lewis x (MeWo-FTIII.M) produced a significantly greater number of lung tumor foci than did parental MeWo cells. In contrast, cells expressing large amounts of sialyl Lewis x (MeWo-FTIII.H) produced few lung tumor foci in nude mice but were highly tumorigenic in beige mice, which have defective natural killer (NK) cells. In vitro assays demonstrated that MeWo-FTIII.H cells are much more sensitive to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity than are MeWo-FTIII.M cells or parental MeWo cells and the susceptibility of MeWo-FTIII.H cells to NK cell-mediated cytolysis can be inhibited by preincubating MeWo-FTIII.H cells with anti-sialyl Lewis x antibody. Moreover, we discovered that NK cell-mediated cytolysis of MeWo-FTIII.H cells can be inhibited by the addition of an antibody against the NK cell receptor CD94 or sialyl Lewis x oligosaccharides. These results, combined with structural analysis of MeWo-FTIII.H cell carbohydrates, indicate that moderate amounts of sialyl Lewis x lead to tumor metastasis, whereas expression of high levels of sialyl Lewis x leads to an NK cell attack on tumor cells, demonstrating that expression of different amounts of sialyl Lewis x results in entirely different biological consequences.","['Ohyama, Chikara', 'Kanto, Satoru', 'Kato, Kazunori', 'Nakano, Osamu', 'Arai, Yoichi', 'Kato, Tetsuro', 'Chen, Shihao', 'Fukuda, Michiko N', 'Fukuda, Minoru']","['Ohyama C', 'Kanto S', 'Kato K', 'Nakano O', 'Arai Y', 'Kato T', 'Chen S', 'Fukuda MN', 'Fukuda M']","['Department of Urology, Akita University School of Medicine, Akita 010-8543, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20021007,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Fucosyltransferases/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lectins, C-Type/immunology', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/pathology/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Oligosaccharides/genetics/*immunology', 'Sialyl Lewis X Antigen', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.212456599 [doi]', '212456599 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Oct 15;99(21):13789-94. doi: 10.1073/pnas.212456599.

However, the fairly high prevalence of this infection among HIV-1-positive individuals indicates the importance of better understanding the potential interference of HTLV-2 infection on HIV-1 infection and AIDS. We previously demonstrated that one signature of PBMC freshly derived from HIV-1-infected individuals is the constitutive activation of a C-terminal truncated STAT5 (STAT5Delta). Therefore, we analyzed the potential activation of STATs in HTLV-2 monoinfected and HTLV-2/HIV-1 dually infected individuals. We observed that PBMC of HTLV-2-infected individuals do not show STAT activation unless they are cultivated ex vivo, in the absence of any mitogenic stimuli, for at least 8 h. The emergence of STAT activation, namely of STAT1, in culture was mostly related to the secretion of IFN-gamma. Of note, this phenomenon is not only a characteristic feature of HTLV-2-infected individuals but also occurred with PBMC of HIV-1(+) individuals. Surprisingly, HTLV-2/HIV-1 coinfection resulted in low/absent STAT activation in vivo that paralleled a diminished secretion of IFN-gamma after ex vivo cultivation. Our findings indicate that both HTLV-2 and HIV-1 infection prime T lymphocytes for STAT1 activation, but they also highlight an interference exerted by HTLV-2 on HIV-1-induced STAT1 activation. Although the nature of such a phenomenon is unclear at the present, these findings support the hypothesis that HTLV-2 may interfere with HIV-1 infection at multiple levels.","['Bovolenta, Chiara', 'Pilotti, Elisabetta', 'Mauri, Massimiliano', 'Panzeri, Barbara', 'Sassi, Monica', ""Dall'Aglio, PierPaolo"", 'Bertazzoni, Umberto', 'Poli, Guido', 'Casoli, Claudio']","['Bovolenta C', 'Pilotti E', 'Mauri M', 'Panzeri B', 'Sassi M', ""Dall'Aglio P"", 'Bertazzoni U', 'Poli G', 'Casoli C']","['Department of Immunology and Infectious Disease, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 58, 20132 Milan, Italy. c.bovolenta@hsr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'HIV Infections/complications/*immunology/*virology', 'HIV-1/*immunology', 'HTLV-II Infections/complications/*immunology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism/virology', '*Milk Proteins', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Viral Interference/*immunology']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.8.4443 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Oct 15;169(8):4443-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.8.4443.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, the phagocytic response must be a tightly regulated process. Recent studies have established that clustering FcgammaR on human myeloid cells causes tyrosine phosphorylation of Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (SHIP). However, it is not known how these immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing phagocytic FcgammaR activate SHIP, or whether the activation of SHIP by ITAMs has any functional relevance. Experiments addressing the mechanism of SHIP association with ITAMs have been done in in vitro systems using phosphopeptides. In this study we undertook to dissect the molecular mechanism by which SHIP associates with the native ITAM-FcgammaR and becomes phosphorylated. In this report we provide evidence that first, SHIP is indeed phosphorylated by ITAM-FcgammaR, using cell systems that lack FcgammaRIIb expression; second, coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that SHIP associates with native ITAM-bearing FcgammaRIIa in vivo; and third, phosphorylation of SHIP by FcgammaRIIa is inhibited by overexpressing either the SHIP Src homology 2 domain or a dominant negative mutant of Shc. In contrast, SHIP phosphorylation was not inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of Grb2. We extend these observations to show that SHIP activation by ITAM-FcgammaR down-regulates NF-kappaB-induced gene transcription. These findings both provide a molecular mechanism for SHIP association with native ITAM-bearing receptors and demonstrate that SHIP association with ITAM-FcgammaR serves to regulate gene expression during the phagocytic process.","['Tridandapani, Susheela', 'Wang, Yijie', 'Marsh, Clay B', 'Anderson, Clark L']","['Tridandapani S', 'Wang Y', 'Marsh CB', 'Anderson CL']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Heart and Lung Research Institute, Room 405D, Ohio State University, 473 West Twelfth Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. tridandapani.2@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Motifs/immunology', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macrophages/enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/*enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains/genetics/*physiology']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.8.4370 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Oct 15;169(8):4370-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.8.4370.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",,,"['AI 50074-01A1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 35121/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HO 38764/HO/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, the generation of antitumor immunity by the administration of an agonistic mAb against CD137 is NK cell-dependent. In this study, we report that NK cells could be induced by IL-2 and IL-15 to express CD137 and ligation of CD137-stimulated NK cell proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion, but not their cytolytic activity. Importantly, CD137-stimulated NK cells promoted the expansion of activated T cells in vitro, demonstrating immunoregulatory or ""helper"" activity for CD8(+)CTL. Furthermore, tumor-specific CTL activity against P815 tumor Ags was abrogated following anti-CD137 treatment in NK-depleted mice. We further demonstrate that CD137-stimulated helper NK cells expressed the high-affinity IL-2R and were hyperresponsive to IL-2.

We employed a retroviral transduction-transplantation approach to evaluate the oncogenic effects of E2a-Hlf on murine B-cell progenitors harvested from adult bone marrow. Expression of E2a-Hlf induced short-lived clusters of primary hematopoietic cells but no long-term growth on preformed bone marrow stromal cell layers comprised of the AC6.21 cell line. Coexpression with Bcl-2, however, resulted in the sustained self-renewal of early preB-I cells that required stromal and interleukin-7 (IL-7) support for growth in vitro. Immortalized cells were unable to induce leukemias after transplantation into nonirradiated syngeneic hosts, unlike the leukemic properties and cytokine independence of preB-I cells transformed by p190(Bcr-Abl) under identical in vitro conditions. However, bone marrow cells expressing E2a-Hlf in combination with Bcl-2, but not E2a-Hlf alone, induced leukemias in irradiated recipients with long latencies, demonstrating both a requirement for suppression of apoptosis and the need for further secondary mutations in leukemia pathogenesis. Coexpression of IL-7 substituted for Bcl-2 to induce the in vitro growth of pre-B cells expressing E2a-Hlf, but leukemic conversion required additional abrogation of undefined stromal requirements and was associated with alterations in the Arf/Mdm2/p53 pathway. Thus, E2a-Hlf enhances the self-renewal of bone marrow B-cell progenitors without inciting a p53 tumor surveillance response or abrogating stromal and cytokine requirements for growth, which are nevertheless abrogated during progression to a leukemogenic phenotype.","['Smith, Kevin S', 'Rhee, Joon Whan', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Smith KS', 'Rhee JW', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genotype', 'Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'Leukemia/etiology/metabolism', 'Methylcellulose/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.22.21.7678-7688.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Nov;22(21):7678-87. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.21.7678-7688.2002.,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,"['R37 CA042971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC135651,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Tumor cells (K562, L1210, and P815) were cultured in vitro and the morphology of those cells was observed with inverse microscope and transmission electron microscope. MTT assay was performed to measure the cell proliferation and inhibition rate. DNA content was assayed by flow cytometry. According to protocols of transplant tumor research, mice were transplanted with tumor cells L1210, P388, Heps, and S180. The survival rate and weight of tumor were observed after the treatment of test drugs. RESULTS: The antitumor effects of L-asparaginase were observed in vitro with tumor cells K562, L1210, and P815 (P <0.01). In vivo experiments showed that ip administration of L-asparaginase significantly increased the survival rate and life span of mice with P388 or L1210 tumor cells (P <0.01). Tumor growth induced with Heps was also significantly suppressed. Furthermore, significant suppression of tumor growth was observed in mice induced with Heps and S180 by iv administration of L-asparaginase.

This mini review focuses on the role of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA or RA), the principal endogenous retinoid and its metabolism in cancer therapy. ATRA has been used successfully in differentiating therapy of acute promyelecytic leukemia and other types of cancers. However, its usefulness is limited by the rapid emergence of ATRA resistance due (in part) to ATRA - induced acceleration of ATRA metabolism. A novel strategy to subjugate the limitation associated with exogenous ATRA therapy has been to modulate and/or increase the levels of endogenous ATRA by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-dependent ATRA-4-hydroxylase enzyme(s) responsible for ATRA metabolism. These inhibitors are also referred to as retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBAs). This review highlights development in the design, synthesis and evaluation of RAMBAs since 1987. Major emphasis is given to liarozole, the most studied and only RAMBA to undergo clinical investigation and also the recently developed novel and highly potent 4-azoly retinoids. The potential role of a new family of cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP26, with specificity towards ATRA is also discussed.","['Njar, V C O']",['Njar VC'],"['Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201-1559, USA. vnjar001@umaryland.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Mini Rev Med Chem,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/therapeutic use']",2002/10/09 04:00,2003/01/07 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1389557023406223 [doi]'],ppublish,Mini Rev Med Chem. 2002 Jun;2(3):261-9. doi: 10.2174/1389557023406223.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase)', 'K0Q29TGV9Y (liarozole)']",74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this situation, biological response modifiers (BRM's), which are not based on selective toxicity, are expected to be useful. There exist several types of BRM's, including retinoids which act directly on cells at the gene expression level, and thalidomide (and related molecules) which modulate internal circumstances of our body. We have been engaged in medicinal chemical/structural development studies based on these bio-active compounds. Retinoids include all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a major active form of vitamin A (retinol), and its bio-isosters, which elicit their biological effects by binding to their nuclear receptors, RAR's. ATRA has been used in differentiation therapy [typically for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)] and the treatment of dermatological diseases. Our structural development studies of retinoids, including computer-assisted molecular design has yielded class/subtype-selective agonists, synergists and antagonists of RAR's and their partner nuclear receptors, RXR's. Thalidomide elicits a wide range of pharmacological effects, including anti-cachexia, anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic activities. We have found that thalidomide is a multi-target drug. Hypothetical target events/molecules of thalidomide include TNF-alpha production, nuclear androgen receptor, aminopeptidases, and alpha-glucosidase. Specific and potent compounds for each of these target phenomena/molecules have been prepared by appropriate modification of the thalidomide structure, and are expected to be superior lead compounds for novel immunomodulators, anti-angiogenic agents, and anti-tumor promoting agents.","['Hashimoto, Yuichi']",['Hashimoto Y'],"['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0032, Japan. hashimot@iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Mini Rev Med Chem,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,IM,,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Retinoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thalidomide/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2002/10/09 04:00,2003/05/31 05:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/31 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1389557023405576 [doi]'],ppublish,Mini Rev Med Chem. 2002 Dec;2(6):543-51. doi: 10.2174/1389557023405576.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Retinoids)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)']",25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This family presently includes three members: I-mfa (inhibitor of MyoD family), HIC p40 and HIC p32 (human I-mfa domain-containing protein). I-mfa, by interacting with MyoD family members, represses both transcriptional activation and myogenesis mediated by these factors. HIC two isoforms, HIC p40 and HIC p32, are involved in the positive regulation of Tax-mediated HTLV-I (human T-cell leukemia virus type 1) promoter activation and in the negative regulation of Tat-mediated HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) promoter transcription. The common carboxy-terminal region of HIC p40 and HIC p32, which is clearly involved in these regulations, shares 77% homology with the carboxy-terminal domain of I-mfa. This suggests that I-mfa, HIC p40 and HIC p32 are part of a new family of proteins involved in gene expression regulation and characterized by a specific cysteine-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Moreover, the three proteins present different subcellular localizations: I-mfa and HIC p32 are mainly cytoplasmic while HIC p40 is mainly nucleolar. The specific localization of each member of this new family will be discussed, possibly explaining how they work. Effectively, a mechanism of protein sequestration in a particular compartment, cytoplasm or nucleolus, could be involved in their function, as it is the case for many other proteins. This relationship between sequestration and function regulation will be exemplified for several cellular factors.","['Thebault, S', 'Mesnard, J M']","['Thebault S', 'Mesnard JM']","['Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, PO Box 419100, San Francisco, CA 94141-9100, USA. sthebault@gladstone.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Protein Pept Sci,Current protein & peptide science,100960529,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cysteine/chemistry', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1389203013381143 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Protein Pept Sci. 2001 Jun;2(2):155-67. doi: 10.2174/1389203013381143.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '183511-66-2 (MDFI protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This broad-based resistance results in large part, but not solely, from overexpression of members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of membrane transporters, including P-glycoprotein, various members of the multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRPs), and ABCG2, also known as MXR1, BCRP, and ABCP. When overexpressed in cell lines, ABCG2 has the ability to confer high levels of resistance to anthracyclines, mitoxantrone, bisantrene, and the camptothecins topotecan and SN-38. This review focuses on the discovery, the biochemistry and the normal physiology of human ABCG2, a novel ABC half transporter expressed abundantly in placenta, as well as in liver, intestine and stem cells. ABCG2 may serve a protective function by preventing toxins from entering cells as well as potentially playing a role in regulating stem cell differentiation. We also discuss the involvement of ABCG2 in multidrug resistance in cancer, especially with regard to acute myeloid leukemia. The mechanism by which substrates are recognized by ABCG2 and how the energy of ATP hydrolysis is transduced into transport remain elusive. A complete understanding of the mechanism and biological function of ABCG2 will be important for understanding its normal physiology as well as potentially for the development of novel chemotherapeutic treatment strategies.","['Ejendal, Karin F K', 'Hrycyna, Christine A']","['Ejendal KF', 'Hrycyna CA']","['Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, 1393 Brown Laboratories of Chemistry, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1393, USA. hrycyna@purdue.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Protein Pept Sci,Current protein & peptide science,100960529,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Tissue Distribution']",2002/10/09 04:00,2003/03/18 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1389203023380521 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Protein Pept Sci. 2002 Oct;3(5):503-11. doi: 10.2174/1389203023380521.,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Older adults, or those with leukemia following an antecedent hematologic disorder such as MDS, experience only brief remissions with modern chemotherapy, and in this population the rate of long-term disease-free survival is less than 10%.

The five-drug-chemotherapy 'DIAVE' (dexamethazone, idarubicine, cytosine-arabinoside, vincristine, etoposide), followed by G-CSF, previously reported as consolidation, was adopted as a mobilization regimen in 29 children (median age: 8 years, range: 3-21; median weight: 34 kg, range: 15-73) with ALL in second remission (CR2: 21), in CR3 (2) or ANLL in CR1 (6). A median peak of 94 x 10(6) CD34(+)cells/l (range: 10-604) was reached at a median time of 12 days (range: 10-18) after the beginning of the mobilizing regimen, which was well tolerated. A median of 10.9 x 10(6) CD34(+)cells/kg (range: 2.4-56.6) were collected in 25 patients (86%), approaching 40 x 10(6)/l CD34(+) cells in the PB (ALL in CR2: 20/21, in CR3: 0/2; ANLL: 5/6) by means of one (20) or two (5) leukaphereses; a median of 2.5 blood volumes was processed. Patients with ANLL mobilized more cells than patients with ALL; moreover, the shorter the interval between remission and mobilizing therapy, the higher was the yield. The products collected underwent purification, aiming at achieving complete removal of possibly contaminating leukemic cells, in 21 cases; also, unmanipulated aliquots were stored as rescues for all but one patient. All the 23 patients undergoing transplantation engrafted (ANC >0.5 x 10(9)/l) at a median of 12 days. In conclusion, the DIAVE regimen compares favorably with conventional mobilizing regimens, usually containing cyclophosphamide, in terms of low toxicity, collection time predictability, and efficacy, as shown by the high proportion of patients mobilizing, the large amounts of stem cell collected by means of one or two leukaphereses only, and the prompt engraftment after infusion.","['Balduzzi, A', 'Perseghin, P', 'Dassi, M', 'Bonanomi, S', 'Rovelli, A', 'Gaipa, G', 'Biondi, A', 'Uderzo, C']","['Balduzzi A', 'Perseghin P', 'Dassi M', 'Bonanomi S', 'Rovelli A', 'Gaipa G', 'Biondi A', 'Uderzo C']","['Clinica Pediatrica, Universita degli Studi di Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', '*Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2002/10/09 04:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703685 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2002 Oct;30(7):413-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703685.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that expression of SOCS2, an intracellular regulator of cytokine signaling, was restricted to mouse progenitor cells and neurons in response to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-like cytokines. Progenitors lacking SOCS2 produced fewer neurons and more astrocytes in vitro, and Socs2(-/-) mice had fewer neurons and neurogenin-1 (Ngn1)-expressing cells in the developing cortex, whereas overexpression of SOCS2 increased neuronal differentiation. We also report that growth hormone inhibited Ngn1 expression and neuronal production, and this action was blocked by SOCS2 overexpression.

The French-American-British (FAB) classification of adult forms of MDS is not always applicable because many pediatric patients do not fit into any of the categories. To circumvent the FAB schema and other flawed formats, the authors developed a practical classification system for childhood MDS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors analyzed 40 children with MDS diagnosed in Toronto between 1988 and 1998 to test the utility of the classification. Children were classified according to three main features: category, cytology, and cytogenetics. RESULTS: Using this system the authors were able to classify all 40 patients; about half could not be classified by FAB. Patients could also be longitudinally classified by serial analysis to show progression of disease. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia was excluded because of its known myeloproliferative pathogenesis. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, which almost never occurs in children, was also omitted. Also excluded were other chronic myeloproliferative disorders and any cytopenias without malignant potential. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data, the CCC system appears to have prognostic potential; children with advanced class and cytogenetic abnormalities had a poorer outcome. The authors urge international adoption of this system for uniformity in clinical practice and reporting purposes.","['Mandel, Karen', 'Dror, Yigal', 'Poon, Annette', 'Freedman, Melvin H']","['Mandel K', 'Dror Y', 'Poon A', 'Freedman MH']","['Divison of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Corrected and Republished Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2003 May;25(5):426-7; author reply 427-8.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility included a diagnosis of hemophilia, history of more than six hemorrhages into a joint within a 6-month period, and evidence of synovitis by objective imaging. With written, informed consent, 0.25 to 1.0 mCi of P-colloid was injected into the problem joints. Safety was monitored by external beta-scanning and physical assessment. Efficacy was determined by analysis of the change in joint hemorrhage frequency from 6 months before and up to 96 months after the injection using a signed-rank test. Physical assessment and pain assessment were analyzed similarly using values obtained within 1 week before and 6 months after the radiosynoviorthesis. Cost was modeled using charges from the authors' institution in relation to existing alternative therapies. RESULTS: One hundred injections were given into 91 joints in 59 children. Seven children had high-titer neutralizing antibodies to factor VIII or IX. Nine children were infected with HIV. Joints injected included 44 ankles, 19 knees, 27 elbows, and 1 shoulder. Nine joints required reinjection. All children showed a significant decrease in bleeding rate (P < 0.0001) and pain (P = 0.03), with improved physical function (P = 0.02). In one child acute lymphocytic leukemia developed, but it was judged unrelated to the two P injections that he had received 3 and 10 months before the leukemia diagnosis.

A critical step in the development of DT(388)-GMCSF for clinical use in childhood and adolescent AML is to determine whether children and adolescents have preexisting antibodies to DT(388)-GMCSF due to childhood immunizations against diphtheria toxoid. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sera from 33 children and adolescents with AML and one with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia were collected. The median age was 11.8 years. All scheduled diphtheria toxoid vaccinations were current except for the child diagnosed at 4 months of age. Anti-DT(388)-GMCSF antibody concentrations were detected by an enzymoimmunoassay and by an in vitro bioassay. RESULTS: Thirty of 34 (88%) children and adolescents had detectable anti-DT(388)-GMCSF IgG antibody concentrations. The median concentration was 1.5 microg/mL, with a range from undetectable to 191.4 microg/mL. There was a positive correlation between the enzymoimmunoassay and bioassay. There was no difference between the anti-DT(388)-GMCSF IgG concentrations in these children and adolescents with AML and in 43 adults with AML. Preliminary results of the phase 1 trial of DT -GMCSF in adults with AML indicate that patients with baseline anti-DT(388)-GMCSF IgG concentrations of less than 2 microg/mL can achieve circulating DT(388)-GMCSF concentrations and can exhibit antileukemic activity. Twenty-three of 34 (67.6%) children and adolescents had anti-DT(388)-GMCSF IgG concentrations less than 2 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Despite routine diphtheria toxoid vaccinations, most children and adolescents with AML do not have anti-DT -GMCSF IgG concentrations that preclude in vivo activity of DT -GMCSF.","['Hall, Philip D', 'Razzouk, Bassem I', 'Willoughby, Tony E', 'McLean, Thomas W', 'Frankel, Arthur E']","['Hall PD', 'Razzouk BI', 'Willoughby TE', 'McLean TW', 'Frankel AE']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*immunology', 'Diphtheria Toxoid/immunology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/*immunology', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*immunology', 'Vaccination']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200210000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Oct;24(7):521-6. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200210000-00005.,"['0 (DTctGMCSF protein, recombinant)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxoid)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, HIV-1 replicates in activated human CD4(+) T cells, monocytes, and metabolically active human cells of a variety of cell types become permissive for HIV-1 replication when transduced to express CD4 and CCR5 or CXCR4. The molecular basis of this species restriction to HIV-1 replication was investigated by using African green monkey and rhesus macaque cell lines that were stably transduced to express human CD4 and CCR5. The cells supported replication of cognate viruses [simian immunodeficiency virus from African green monkeys (SIV-AGM) and macaques (SIVmac239)] but did not support replication of an R5-tropic cytopathic HIV-1. A beta-lactamase-based HIV-1 entry assay was used to show that the virus efficiently entered the nonhuman primate cells. Provirus formation was reduced 50-fold compared with similarly infected human cells. Real-time PCR quantitation demonstrated that reverse transcription failed to initiate efficiently in the simian cells. The block to reverse transcription was overridden at multiplicity of infection >1 or by preincubation of the nonhuman primate cells with virus, a feature reminiscent of the Friend virus resistance gene-1 (FV-1), restriction to murine leukemia virus replication in mouse cells. Heterokaryon analysis in which human and simian cells were fused demonstrated that the block was dominant. These findings suggested that the primate cells contain a dominant inhibitor that prevents HIV-1 reverse transcription.","['Munk, Carsten', 'Brandt, Stephanie M', 'Lucero, Ginger', 'Landau, Nathaniel R']","['Munk C', 'Brandt SM', 'Lucero G', 'Landau NR']","['The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, Infectious Disease Laboratory, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20021004,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4 Antigens/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Receptors, CCR5/genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.212400099 [doi]', '212400099 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Oct 15;99(21):13843-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.212400099.

We have used BLV Env protein variants to gain insights into the structure and function of this important determinant of viral infectivity. Each of 23 different single amino acid variants found in cDNA clones of env transcripts present after short-term culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from BLV-infected sheep was expressed in COS-1 cells and tested for the ability to mediate cell fusion and to be cleaved to surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) protein subunits. Of 11 Env variants that failed to induce syncytia or did so poorly, 7 contained changes in amino acids identical or chemically conserved in the HTLV-1 Env protein. These seven included the four variants that showed aberrant proteolytic cleavage and poor cell surface expression, underscoring their importance for Env structure. Ten of 12 variants that retained wild-type syncytium-inducing ability clustered in the N-terminal half of BLV SU, which forms the putative receptor-binding domain (RBD). Several variants in the RBD showed evidence of subtle misfolding, as judged by reduced binding to monoclonal antibodies recognizing conformational epitopes F, G, and H formed by the N terminus of SU. We modeled the BLV RBD by aligning putative structural elements with known elements of the ecotropic Friend murine leukemia virus RBD monomer. All the variant RBD residues but one are exposed on the surface of this BLV model. These variants as well as function-altering, antibody-reactive residues defined by other investigators group on one face of the molecular model. They are strikingly absent from the opposite face, implying that it is likely to face inward in Env complexes. This surface might interact with the C-terminal domain of SU or with an adjacent monomer in the Env oligomer. This location suggests an orientation for the monomer of ecotropic Friend murine leukemia virus RBD.","['Johnston, Elizabeth R', 'Albritton, Lorraine M', 'Radke, Kathryn']","['Johnston ER', 'Albritton LM', 'Radke K']","['Department of Animal Science and Graduate Group in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of California, Davis, California 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Cattle', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Giant Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.21.10861-10872.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Nov;76(21):10861-72. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.21.10861-10872.2002.,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,"['AI-33410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI033410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007377/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07377/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC136609,,,,['GENBANK/AY078387'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Viruses carrying mutations in this portion of gag can mediate the assembly and release of virions but are unable to successfully carry out the early phase of the M-MuLV life cycle. Wild-type and mutant viruses were found to synthesize similar levels of linear viral DNA in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, and there were no significant differences in either the density or sedimentation of the viral protein-nucleic acid complexes. Analysis of the termini of the linear viral DNAs showed that the 3' ends of the mutant viral DNA were processed normally by the integrase. Further, the preintegration complexes extracted from the cytoplasm of cells infected with the mutant viruses were competent for integration into target DNA in vitro. Nevertheless, no circular viral DNAs were detected in cells infected by the mutants, and functional proviruses were not formed. These results suggest that p12 has an unexpected role in the early phase of the life cycle and is needed after viral DNA synthesis to deliver the incoming DNA to the correct location and in the appropriate state to permit either circularization or integration of the viral DNA in vivo.","['Yuan, Bing', 'Fassati, Ariberto', 'Yueh, Andrew', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Yuan B', 'Fassati A', 'Yueh A', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus/virology', 'Cytoplasm/virology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Virus Integration']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.21.10801-10810.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Nov;76(21):10801-10. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.21.10801-10810.2002.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gag protein p12, moloney murine leukemia virus)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",,,"['R01 CA030488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA030488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC136648,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas other human error-prone DNA polymerases identified thus far show no preferential lymphoid tissue distribution, the highest levels of pol mu mRNA have been detected in peripheral lymphoid tissues, particularly germinal center B cells. Conceivably, up-regulation of the pol mu gene may be biologically significant in lymphomagenesis, especially in the development of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHLs), because of enhanced error-prone DNA repair activities. To explore this possibility, we generated a digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe to pol mu mRNA and used the probe and in situ hybridization to examine the expression pattern of the pol mu gene in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 37 B-NHLs. This included eight chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomas, six mantle cell lymphomas, seven follicular lymphomas, nine diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, three splenic marginal zone lymphomas, two Burkitt's lymphomas, and two precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphomas. We also correlated the pol mu mRNA expression levels with the tumor proliferation index, which was assessed in each case by image analysis of Ki-67 immunostained slides. Nineteen of 21 (90%) B-NHLs arising from postgerminal center B cells (follicular lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, splenic marginal zone lymphomas, and Burkitt's lymphomas) exhibited high expression of pol mu mRNA. In contrast, only 2 of 16 (13%) B-NHLs arising from pregerminal center B cells (chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomas, mantle cell lymphomas, and precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphomas) expressed significant levels of pol mu mRNA. Pol mu gene expression did not seem to correlate with the proliferation index, especially because a significant level of pol mu mRNA was not detected in either case of precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphomas. In conclusion, pol mu gene expression is highly associated with B-NHLs of postgerminal center B-cell derivation. Furthermore, the expression level is independent of the proliferation rate and thus is unrelated to the biological aggressiveness of the tumors. These findings, along with the error-prone nature of the enzyme, suggest that up-regulation of pol mu gene expression may be a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of a subset of B-NHLs through DNA repair-associated genomic instability.","['Chiu, April', 'Pan, Langxing', 'Li, Zongdong', 'Ely, Scott', 'Chadburn, Amy', 'Knowles, Daniel M']","['Chiu A', 'Pan L', 'Li Z', 'Ely S', 'Chadburn A', 'Knowles DM']","['Department of Pathology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization/methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)64411-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9440(10)64411-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2002 Oct;161(4):1349-55. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9440(10)64411-2.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA polymerase mu)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,PMC1867311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: CD38 expression was analyzed in 155 consecutive unselected patients newly diagnosed with B-CLL from January 1991 to July 1997. In all cases CD38 expression was evaluated at diagnosis and patients were classified into two groups: those with > or = 30% were considered positive (CD38+) and those with < 30% were considered negative (CD38-). Statistical differences between each group were analyzed using c2 tests for categorical variables and Student's t-tests for continuous variables. Survival analysis was performed at the univariate level by the Kaplan Meier technique and at the multivariate level by Cox hazard models. RESULTS: Thirty (19%) patients were CD38+. CD38+ was associated with atypical morphology (p=0.004), a diffuse bone marrow pattern (p=0.016), Rai stage > or =2 (p=0.009), high lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.02), high b2 microglobulin (p=0.004), and higher lymphocyte count (p=0.02). Furthermore, CD38+ patients required treatment more frequently (p=0.006) and CLL-related mortality was significantly higher (p=0.012). When we divided the study group into patients with Rai 0-1 and Rai 2-4 stages, CD38 positivity was only significantly associated with mortality in the early stage patients (p= 0.012 vs p= 0.68). CD38 expression in the multivariate analysis lost its statistical significance. None of these results was modified when the CD38 cut-off was set at 20%. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: CD38 expression identifies a subgroup of B-CLL patients with aggressive clinical presentation and worse outcome. Its expression is probably associated with other prognostic factors, but the feasibility of determining this parameter makes it easily reproducible and adds prognostic information at diagnosis to aid prediction of the clinical course and outcome of B-CLL.","['Domingo-Domenech, Eva', 'Domingo-Claros, Alicia', 'Gonzalez-Barca, Eva', 'Beneitez, David', 'Alonso, Ester', 'Romagosa, Vicens', 'De Sanjos, Silvia', 'Petit, Jose', 'Granena, Albert', 'Fernandez de Sevilla, Alberto']","['Domingo-Domenech E', 'Domingo-Claros A', 'Gonzalez-Barca E', 'Beneitez D', 'Alonso E', 'Romagosa V', 'De Sanjos S', 'Petit J', 'Granena A', 'Fernandez de Sevilla A']","[""Department of Clinical Hematology, Institut Catala d'Oncologia and Hospital Princeps d'Espanya, Ciutat Sanitaria i Universitaria de Bellvitge, Barcelona, Spain. 31577edd@comb.es""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/*biosynthesis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*metabolism/mortality', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Time Factors', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/metabolism']",2002/10/09 04:00,2003/01/14 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Oct;87(10):1021-7.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed two new translocations with a breakpoint in the 11q23 region at standard cytogenetic analysis: a previously undescribed t(3;11)(q21;q23) in a 70-year old woman with a fulminating form of AML-M1 and a new translocation t(6;11)(q15;q23) in a 61-year old man with an atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia. In these two patients, involvement of the MLL gene was analyzed by molecular cytogenetic techniques which also allowed a more precise mapping of the breakpoints. DESIGN AND METHODS: The MLL gene was analyzed by Southern blot and by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a double-color MLL probe. A panel of 11q, 3q and 6q cosmid/YAC probes mapping around the breakpoints was used for breakpoint mapping. RESULTS: In both patients, FISH analysis and Southern blot showed that the MLL gene was not rearranged; in patient 1, MLL was retained on the 11q+ derivative, whereas in patient 2 it moved to the 6q- chromosome. In the t(3;11) we localized the chromosome 11 breakpoint at 11q23.3, in a region flanked by CP-939H3 and cos1p3, distal to the MLL locus; in the t(6;11) the break occurred at 11q21, in a region flanked by CP-819A5 and CP-829A6, proximal to the MLL locus. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our cases add two new translocations to the list of chromosomal anomalies involving the long arm of chromosome 11, and show that apparent translocation t(11q23) may involve loci and genes other than MLL. Characterizing the molecular heterogeneity of 11q23 translocations may identify some prognostic significance.","['Giugliano, Emilia', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Scaravaglio, Patrizia', 'Wlodarska, Iwona', 'Emanuel, Betty', 'Stul, Michel', 'Serra, Anna', 'Tonso, Anna', 'Pini, Massimo', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Hagemeijer, Anne']","['Giugliano E', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Scaravaglio P', 'Wlodarska I', 'Emanuel B', 'Stul M', 'Serra A', 'Tonso A', 'Pini M', 'Saglio G', 'Hagemeijer A']","['Medicina Interna II, Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e Biologiche, Osp.

We selected serum immunofixations of 61 patients affected by malignant hemopathies and 53 patients affected by other pathologies susceptible to give immunofixation's alterations. We showed that the frequency of immunofixation abnormalities was more important in patients affected by malignant hemopathies than in patients affected by other pathologies (70.5% vs 35.8%). A high frequency of monoclonal immunoglobulins was found in patients with lymphoma (53.3%) and oligoclonal immunoglobulins in other hemopathies (48.2%).

In retrospective study, second complete remission rates ranged from 30% to 64%, while they ranged from 8% to 89% in prospective trials. The second complete remission rates were closely associated with age and duration of first complete remission. Combination therapies resulted in higher complete remission rates but were associated with higher toxicity. Median duration of second complete remission was < 14 months and overall median survival was < 12 months. The probability of 3-year survival ranged from 8% to 29%. The inhomogeneity of these studies, the differences in dosages and schedules, and the frequent absence of randomisation make it difficult to select the best salvage therapy. No reinduction regimen has so far clearly proven superior. Only stem cell transplantation provided durable remissions for the majority of AML patients after a first relapse. Considering the poor outcomes of patients with AML in first relapse, improved therapies need to be developed. A number of novel agents that include several differentiation agents, enzyme inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies have been studied to provide improved outcomes for patients with AML who have relapsed. This is the same for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Arsenic trioxide has shown great promise for the induction, consolidation, and maintenance of complete remission in relapsed patients with APL. Within this context autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplantations are also considered in second or subsequent relapse. Molecular monitoring for the PML-RARalpha fusion protein permits prompt intervention for early molecular relapse ultimately improving chances of prolonged remission.","['Thomas, Xavier', 'Le, Quoc-Hung']","['Thomas X', 'Le QH']","[""Service d'hematologie clinique, hopital Edouard-Herriot, 69437 Lyon. xavier.thomas@chu-lyon.fr""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2002 Sep;89(9):795-807.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],125,,,,Traitement des leucemies aigues myeloides de l'adulte en rechute.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An estimated one in ten thousand pregnancies are associated with malignancies, especially gynecologic tumors (cervix, breast, ovary), lymphomas, melanomas, brain tumors and leukemia.

However, appeal for the long-term use of HU in HIV-1 infection may be limited by its propensity to induce hematopoietic toxicity. We report a comparison of the efficacy and bone marrow toxicity of HU (400 and 200 mg/kg/day) with the novel RR inhibitors and free radical-scavenging compounds didox (DX; 3,4-dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid; 350 mg/kg/day) and trimidox (TX; 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzamidoxime; 175 mg/kg/day) in the murine AIDS (LPBM5 MuLV) model of retrovirus infection. Infected mice received daily drug treatment for 8 weeks. Efficacy was determined by measuring drug effects on retroviral-induced disease progression (i.e. development of splenomegaly and hypergammaglobulinemia) and by evaluating splenic levels of proviral DNA. Bone marrow toxicity was evaluated by measuring peripheral blood indices (WBC, hematocrit and reticulocyte counts), femoral cellularity and by determining the numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells (CFU-GM, BFU-E) per femur and spleen. Compared to infected controls receiving no drug treatment, disease progression was significantly suppressed by TX, DX and HU. However, HU was associated with mortality and induced significant hematopoietic toxicity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Conversely, TX and DX effectively inhibited retrovirus-induced disease but did not induce hematopoietic toxicity. These results suggest that due to their reduced hematopoietic toxicity and ability to inhibit disease progression in murine AIDS, TX and DX may offer effective alternatives to HU therapy in HIV-1 infection.","['Mayhew, Christopher N', 'Mampuru, Leseilane J', 'Chendil, Damodoran', 'Ahmed, Mansoor M', 'Phillips, Jonathan D', 'Greenberg, Richard N', 'Elford, Howard L', 'Gallicchio, Vincent S']","['Mayhew CN', 'Mampuru LJ', 'Chendil D', 'Ahmed MM', 'Phillips JD', 'Greenberg RN', 'Elford HL', 'Gallicchio VS']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Kentucky Medical Center, CHS Building, 900 South Limestone Street, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Antiviral Res,Antiviral research,8109699,IM,,"['Animals', 'Benzamidines/*adverse effects/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects', 'DNA, Viral', 'Female', 'Femur/cytology/drug effects', 'Free Radical Scavengers/*adverse effects/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*adverse effects/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Hydroxyurea/*adverse effects/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/drug therapy', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/blood/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/blood/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Splenomegaly', 'Tumor Virus Infections/blood/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology']",2002/10/09 04:00,2003/01/08 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0166354202001080 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-3542(02)00108-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Antiviral Res. 2002 Nov;56(2):167-81. doi: 10.1016/s0166-3542(02)00108-0.,"['0 (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzamidoxime)', '0 (Benzamidines)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'L106XFV0RQ (3,4-dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.'],['R44-AI36095/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemias bearing MLL translocations may be myeloid or lymphoid or bear mixed lineage properties; however, those bearing MLL/MLLT1 translocations are predominantly lymphoid, suggesting that MLLT1 may influence the leukemic phenotype. The murine homolog Mllt1 exhibits 86% amino acid sequence identity with the human gene and is broadly expressed in murine tissues and cell lines, with the exception of liver and myeloid cell lines. We have mapped Mllt1 to mouse chromosome 17 band E2 using FISH analysis. The genomic structure and 5' regulatory sequence of Mllt1 are highly conserved between mouse and human. There is also conservation of the genomic structure, but not the promoter, between MLLT1 and MLLT3/AF9, a homologous gene that is also an MLL translocation partner in human leukemias with a predominant myeloid phenotype. Targeted disruption of Mllt1 in mice leads to embryonic lethality prior to 8.5 dpc. These studies indicate that MLLT1 is involved in essential developmental processes and suggest that expression patterns of MLL fusion partners may influence the lineage of MLL-associated leukemias.","['Doty, Raymond T', 'Vanasse, Gary J', 'Disteche, Christine M', 'Willerford, Dennis M']","['Doty RT', 'Vanasse GJ', 'Disteche CM', 'Willerford DM']","['Dpartment of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mice/*genetics', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Sequence Homology', '*Transcription Factors']",2002/10/09 04:00,2003/07/15 05:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1079979602905255 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.2002.0525 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2002 May-Jun;28(3):407-17. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2002.0525.,"['0 (MLLT1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,"['AI41051/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro effects of imatinib on BCR/ABL+ leukemic cells include inhibition of Bcr/Abl tyrosine phosphorylation, block of proliferation, and induction of apoptosis. The in vivo effects of imatinib were evaluated in 12 CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) patients in blast crisis or accelerated phase who were treated with imatinib. Treatment caused a decrease in spontaneous proliferation of leukemic cells in 10 of 12 evaluable patients and the development of apoptosis in 9 of 11 cases. Imatinib also caused an inhibition of Bcr/Abl autophosphorylation; however, the degree of inhibition obtained in vivo was substantially lower than that achieved in vitro with similar concentrations of imatinib. In seven patients cells could be evaluated at relapse: spontaneous proliferation was no longer inhibited and Bcr/Abl phosphorylation was comparable or superior to that present at the beginning of treatment, before imatinib administration. Plasma imatinib concentrations were not reduced. Leukemic cells obtained at relapse maintained in vitro sensitivity (Bcr/Abl autophosphorylation and proliferation inhibition) to imatinib concentration measured in vivo (3 microM or higher), although a partial resistance to the antiproliferative effects of imatinib was present at low (0.01-0.3 microM) concentrations. In four patients, addition of erythromycin to blood samples obtained at relapse restored imatinib sensitivity in terms of phosphorylation inhibition, indicating that the majority of plasma imatinib was not available to cells and probably bound to alpha1 acid glycoprotein. These data suggest that measurements of Bcr/Abl kinase activity in peripheral blood samples may represent a more reliable indicator of active concentrations than the measurement of imatinib plasma levels.","['Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo B', 'Rossi, Francesca', 'Verga, Magda', 'Ruchatz, Holger', 'Gunby, Rosalind', 'Frapolli, Roberta', 'Zucchetti, Massimo', 'Scapozza, Leonardo', 'Bungaro, Silvia', 'Tornaghi, Lucia', 'Rossi, Fabio', 'Pioltelli, Pietro', 'Pogliani, Enrico', ""D'Incalci, Maurizio"", 'Corneo, Gianmarco']","['Gambacorti-Passerini CB', 'Rossi F', 'Verga M', 'Ruchatz H', 'Gunby R', 'Frapolli R', 'Zucchetti M', 'Scapozza L', 'Bungaro S', 'Tornaghi L', 'Rossi F', 'Pioltelli P', 'Pogliani E', ""D'Incalci M"", 'Corneo G']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Via Venezian 1, 20133 Milan, Italy. gambacorti@istitutotumori.mi.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Blood Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Recurrence']",2002/10/09 04:00,2003/07/15 05:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1079979602905267 [pii]', '10.1006/bcmd.2002.0526 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2002 May-Jun;28(3):361-72. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2002.0526.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The patient had not previously received purine analogues and none of the donors was homozygous for a human leucocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype that was shared by the recipient. Therefore, his only apparent risk factor was lymphoplasmacytoid NHL.

Two years later, in October 2001, the patient developed leukocytosis, an increased LDH level, and large blasts with basophilic cytoplasm with cytoplasmic projections appeared in the peripheral blood. Bone marrow aspiration revealed increased blasts (59.6%). These blasts were negative on peroxidase stain, positive on acid phosphatase, and weakly positive on alpha naphthyl butyrate esterase stain and periodic acid-Schiff stain. Immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies revealed that these blasts were strongly positive with anti-CD41 (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa), weakly positive with CD7, CD33, and CD34, and negative with other monoclonal antibodies. A diagnosis of megakaryoblastic transformation from chronic myeloid leukemia was therefore made. Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for portions of the major-bcr and abl genes from bone marrow cells revealed two fused signals in 90.6% and one fused signal in 5.8% of 106 cells.

RESULTS: (1) In the population study, 13 new cases of haematological malignancies were diagnosed. For five of these the early detection was probably beneficial. (2) From the hospital records another 59 participants and 36 non-participants to the population study were found to have haematological malignancies. (3) Additionally, six cases were identified from the Cancer Registry. Totally, we thus identified 114 period prevalent cases, of which 86% had been reported to the Cancer Registry. Age-adjusted period prevalence of haematological malignancies was 4.7 per thousand in men and 2.9 per thousand in women. The prevalence increased with age. There were 84 cases with leukaemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma diagnosed at any time and still alive at 31 December 1996 (point prevalence 2.2 per thousand). Our estimated incidence of haematological malignancies did not differ significantly from that reported from the Cancer Registry. CONCLUSION: We found approximately the same rates of haematological malignancies as the Cancer Registry, although an underreporting of 14% to the Cancer Registry was detected. The point prevalence of leukaemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma was 2.2%.","['Skjelbakken, T', 'Lochen, M-L', 'Dahl, I M S']","['Skjelbakken T', 'Lochen ML', 'Dahl IM']","['Department of Medicine, Institute of Community Medicine, University Hospital of Tromso, N-9037 Tromso, Norway. tove.skjelbakken@ism.uit.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Outpatients', 'Prevalence', '*Registries']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']","['1o544 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01544.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2002 Aug;69(2):67-75. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01544.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antioxidant activity of propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) together with the stimulating effect of protein kinase C suggests that propofol might have the potential to modulate apoptosis. Thus, it is of both clinical interest and biomedical importance to investigate and clarify the effect and mechanism of propofol upon the intracellular reactions underlying apoptotic cell death. METHODS: The effect of propofol on apoptosis was investigated using cultured human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. This well-characterized cell line is useful for the study of apoptosis because the various biochemical steps occurring during apoptosis have been well documented. RESULTS: Treatment of HL-60 cells with propofol resulted in growth inhibition with the formation of apoptotic bodies in a concentration-dependent manner. DNA fragmentation and ladder formation was also observed in a concentration-dependent manner. Propofol treatment resulted in activation of caspase-3, -6, -8 and -9, thereby suggesting that cell surface death receptor activation of the caspase cascade mediates propofol-induced apoptosis with consequent formation of the cleaved product of Bid (a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member protein) and activation of the mitochondrial pathway with cytosolic release of cytochrome c. CONCLUSION: Propofol may induce apoptosis, which is dependent on the mechanism that activates both the cell surface death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway.","['Tsuchiya, M', 'Asada, A', 'Arita, K', 'Utsumi, T', 'Yoshida, T', 'Sato, E F', 'Utsumi, K', 'Inoue, M']","['Tsuchiya M', 'Asada A', 'Arita K', 'Utsumi T', 'Yoshida T', 'Sato EF', 'Utsumi K', 'Inoue M']","['Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology, Osaka City University Medical School, Abeno, Osaka, Japan. oxymasa@ea.mbn.or.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,0370270,IM,,"['Anesthetics, Intravenous/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Propofol/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",2002/10/10 04:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/10/10 04:00'],"['2002/10/10 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/10 04:00 [entrez]']","['aas460903 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1399-6576.2002.460903.x [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. 2002 Oct;46(9):1068-74. doi: 10.1034/j.1399-6576.2002.460903.x.,"['0 (Anesthetics, Intravenous)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'YI7VU623SF (Propofol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes were CD19, CD20, CD23 and CD5 positive, which confirmed the diagnosis of B-CLL. Skin biopsy of one of the lesions showed an intense infiltrate composed of small lymphocytes with no epidermotropism. These cells also showed the expression of CD19, CD20, CD23 and CD5 antigens similar to those presented on PB lymphocytes. Polymerase chain reaction performed on bone marrow lymphocytes and a lesional skin biopsy using consensus primers for immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes also showed the same monoclonal population of B lymphocytes both in the bone marrow and in the skin. The patient received four courses of cladribine 0.12 mg kg-1 daily as a 2-h infusion for five consecutive days. The courses were repeated at monthly intervals. The lymphocytosis gradually decreased and the PB count normalized after three courses. At the same time, a significant decrease in the cutaneous symptoms was observed.

This research is based on 70 ethnographic interviews with mothers of young children 24-48 months of age and interviews with health care personnel in eight rural neighborhoods. Lay explanations of anemia draw on biomedical concepts, such as the amount of iron in the blood or in food, but one common explanation is elaborated to involve a biomedical life-threatening disease, leukemia, in cases where the anemia is not treated. Furthermore, mothers often view the liquid iron given free at the clinic as treatment for anemia as too strong, causing negative dental effects; many refuse to administer the iron drops to their children and give other treatments. Formal public health measures result in effects local people consider unacceptable and not congruent with being a good parent; with few exceptions, the medical community dismisses those preoccupations as inappropriate signs of ignorance on the part of caretakers. The existence of several systems of healing allows for parental rejection of public health measures and easy access to alternative remedies.","['Jefferds, Mariaelena D']",['Jefferds MD'],"['Department of Anthropology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA. jefferds@pilot.msu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/blood/*drug therapy/*prevention & control', '*Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Child, Preschool', 'Community Health Centers', 'Costa Rica', 'Family Characteristics', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Iron, Dietary/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Mothers/*psychology', '*Public Health Administration', 'Treatment Refusal/*ethnology']",2002/10/09 04:00,2002/10/18 04:00,['2002/10/09 04:00'],"['2002/10/09 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00254-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 2002 Oct;55(7):1143-56. doi: 10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00254-4.,"['0 (Iron, Dietary)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Special stains, such as periodic acid Schiff, Sudan Black-B, Oil Red-O and nonspecific esterase, were used in special cases. RESULTS: Thirty-three cases were diagnosed as lymphoma, 1 as extramedullary hematopoiesis and 2 as leukemic involvement. CONCLUSION: Leukemic lymphadenopathy can be misdiagnosed as lymphoma on FNA smears. The clinical findings, previous history, hematologic studies and immunocytochemical studies are essential to the differentiation of leukemic smears from lymphoma.

As part of a large case-control study conducted by the Children's Cancer Group, we evaluated the association between maternal and paternal medication use and the risk of ALL in offspring. METHODS: Information on selected medication use in the year before and during the index pregnancy was obtained by telephone interview. Participants included 1842 children of 14 years or younger with newly diagnosed and immunophenotypically defined ALL and 1986 individually matched controls. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models and stratified by immunophenotypes of ALL and age at diagnosis of cases. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders and other medication use, we found that maternal use of vitamins (odds ratio [OR] = 0.7, 99% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5-1.0) and iron supplements (OR = 0.8, 99% CI: 0.7-1.0) only during the index pregnancy was associated with a decreased risk of ALL. Parental use of amphetamines or diet pills and mind-altering drugs before and during the index pregnancy was related to an increased risk of childhood ALL, particularly among children where both parents reported using these drugs (OR = 2.8, 99% CI: 0.5-15.6 for amphetamines or diet pills, OR = 1.8, 99% CI: 1.1-3.0 for mind-altering drugs). Stratified analyses showed that maternal use of antihistamines or allergic remedies and parental use of mind-altering drugs were strongly associated with infant ALL, whereas patterns of association between childhood ALL and parental medication use did not influence markedly the immunophenotypic subgroup of ALL. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that certain parental medication use immediately before and during the index pregnancy may influence risk of ALL in offspring.","['Wen, Wanqing', 'Shu, Xiao Ou', 'Potter, John D', 'Severson, Richard K', 'Buckley, Jonathan D', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Robison, Leslie L']","['Wen W', 'Shu XO', 'Potter JD', 'Severson RK', 'Buckley JD', 'Reaman GH', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amphetamines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Appetite Depressants/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hallucinogens/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', '*Paternal Exposure', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2002/10/05 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/05 04:00'],"['2002/10/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10859 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 Oct 15;95(8):1786-94. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10859.,"['0 (Amphetamines)', '0 (Appetite Depressants)', '0 (Hallucinogens)']",,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],"['CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 49450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to determine whether transatlantic differences in survival also are present in childhood cancers. METHODS: The authors analyzed 16,148 European patients and 3476 patients in the United States who were diagnosed with malignant disease at age < 15 years during 1985-1989. The patients were obtained from 34 EUROCARE cancer registries in 17 countries and from 9 SEER registries in the United States. The authors considered the major 14 diagnostic categories of the International Classification of Childhood Cancers. To increase the power of comparisons, they also considered all childhood cancers together. Observed survival was calculated by actuarial methods. RESULTS: For all cancers combined, northern Europe had the highest 5-year survival rate at 75% (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 72-78%), and Eastern Europe had the lowest survival rate at 55% (95%CI, 52-58%). The survival rate in the United States was roughly comparable to the survival rates in Italy and other Western European countries at 70%. Northern Europe also had highest survival rate for patients with lymphoid leukemias (83%; 95%CI, 78-88%); whereas Germany, Italy, and the other Western European countries had survival rates similar to the average survival rate for patients in the United States (77%; 95%CI, 74-80%). The survival rate was 7-9% lower in Europe compared with the survival rate in United States for patients with neuroblastoma and Wilms tumors and 8% higher for patients with retinoblastoma (all significant). Small, nonsignificant differences were found for patients with osteosarcoma, ependymoma, and medulloblastoma (with a higher survival rate in the United States) and for patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (with a higher survival rate in Europe). Very similar survival rates among the two populations were found for the other cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the survival of adults with cancer, the survival of children with cancer in Europe (except Eastern Europe) is very similar to that in the United States. Childhood cancers are generally more responsive to therapy than adult cancers, but these results also may reflect wide accessibility of these treatments for most patients. These results are relevant to the interpretation of differences in adult cancer survival.","['Gatta, Gemma', 'Capocaccia, Riccardo', 'Coleman, Michel P', 'Ries, Lynn A Gloeckler', 'Berrino, Franco']","['Gatta G', 'Capocaccia R', 'Coleman MP', 'Ries LA', 'Berrino F']","['Division of Epidemiology, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milan, Italy. gatta@istitutotumori.mi.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', '*Child Welfare', 'Child, Preschool', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'SEER Program/*statistics & numerical data', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States']",2002/10/05 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/05 04:00'],"['2002/10/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10833 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 Oct 15;95(8):1767-72. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10833.,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A comprehensive list of 509 patients with primary osteosarcoma treated at our institution between February 1973 and March 2000 was identified. All study patients received chemotherapy and/or surgery on one of six different protocols (T4, 5, 7, 10, 12, and CCG-7921/POG-9351). Chemotherapy was scheduled for up to 40 weeks with some variations in the actual treatment period and consisted of various combinations of the following agents: high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin, vincristine, cisplatin, and ifosfamide. RESULTS: Secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) occurred in 14 of 509 patients. Only one had pulmonary metastasis at diagnosis and subsequent multiple recurrences that required thoracotomies and further modification of the chemotherapy regimen. The median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma was 16.6 years (range, 3.1-74.4 years). The median follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 0.1-25.0 years). The time interval from diagnosis of the primary osteosarcoma to the development of SMN was 1.3-13.1 years (median, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-9.6). The most common SMN occurred in the central nervous system (n = 4): anaplastic glioma, meningioma, high-grade glioma, and maxillary astrocytoma. There were two cases of acute myeloid leukemia and one case each of myelodysplastic syndrome, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, breast carcinoma, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The overall 5 and 10-year cumulative incidences of SMNs were 1.4% +/- 1.1% and 3.1% +/- 1.8%. The standardized incidence ratio was 4.6 (95% CI, 2.53-7.78, P = 0.00001) for the cohort and 3.64 (95% CI, 1.82-6.52, P = 0.0007) when patients with a history of retinoblastoma or Rothmund-Thomson syndrome were excluded. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of secondary malignancies in long-term survivors of osteosarcoma was significantly higher than the expected incidence of cancer in the general population. However, the standardized incidence ratios were much lower than those reported for Hodgkin disease and retinoblastoma. Although additional follow-up is warranted, the successes of current treatment regimens consisting of intensive, high-dose chemotherapy in combination with topoisomerase II inhibitors outweigh the risks.","['Aung, LeLe', 'Gorlick, Richard G', 'Shi, Weiji', 'Thaler, Howard', 'Shorter, Nicholas A', 'Healey, John H', 'Huvos, Andrew G', 'Meyers, Paul A']","['Aung L', 'Gorlick RG', 'Shi W', 'Thaler H', 'Shorter NA', 'Healey JH', 'Huvos AG', 'Meyers PA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Osteosarcoma/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Time Factors']",2002/10/05 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/05 04:00'],"['2002/10/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10861 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 Oct 15;95(8):1728-34. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10861.,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the diagnostic criteria of this entity are still under debate, there is general agreement that patients with Ph negative, bcr/abl negative CML have a severe clinical course that is not affected significantly by current treatment options. METHODS: A population of 76 patients with bcr/abl negative CML who had received minimal or no previous therapy was characterized carefully with the intent of investigating clinical and hematologic variables and their association with survival by univariate, correlation, and multivariate analyses. A group of 73 patients with Ph negative CML who were not tested for the bcr/abl rearrangement (bcr/abl unknown) was analyzed separately and used for extension of the analysis. RESULTS: In the bcr/abl negative patient population, the median overall survival was 24 months. At the time of the analysis, 38 patients (50%) had died, and blastic transformation preceded death in 31%. Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 30% of the 76 patients, with trisomy 8 the most common abnormality. Complex chromosomal abnormalities were rare, and monosomy 7 was not observed. Survival was not affected significantly by treatment. Multivariate analysis identified older age (> 65 years), anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL), and severe leukocytosis (white blood cells > 50 x 10(9)/L) as variables with independent prognostic significance for poor survival. A prognostic scoring system stratified patients into a low-risk group (53%) and a high-risk group (47%), with median survivals of 38 months and 9 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Bcr/abl negative CML is a distinct clinical entity associated with very poor prognosis. Two risk categories are identifiable using a simple scoring system based on age, hemoglobin level, and leukocyte number.","['Onida, Francesco', 'Ball, Greg', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Smith, Terry L', 'Glassman, Armand', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Scappini, Barbara', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Beran, Miloslav']","['Onida F', 'Ball G', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Smith TL', 'Glassman A', 'Albitar M', 'Scappini B', 'Rios MB', 'Keating MJ', 'Beran M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

METHOD: The study was carried out in 43 state regions of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in the period between 1991 and 1995. It was created an Index of Industrialization-Related Leukemia (IIRL) based on number of manufactures and industrial jobs per 100,000 inhabitants, fiscal aggregated value, diversity of industry activities and presence of manufactures that poses potential risk exposure for leukemia. IIRL was classified in five categories. Standardized leukemia mortality rates were established for each region, classified in five categories, plotted in five different colors and compared to the IIRL map. RESULTS: The most industrialized regions in the state of Sao Paulo are Campinas, Piracicaba, Jundiai, Sorocaba and Sao Paulo. There was no relationship between mortality by any leukemia type and industrialization. The region of Jales showed the highest standardized mortality rates by leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality by leukemia had a homogeneous distribution in the state of Sao Paulo and no association with the level of industrialization.

In this report, we apply correlation analyses to drug and irradiation response results from a cohort of 36 classical B chronic lymphocyte leukemia (CLL) patients. Nine drugs and two types of irradiation were selected according to their usefulness in CLL therapy or on the basis of their otherwise interesting mechanisms of action.

Altogether 2376 duplicate cultures were performed in order to determine ID(80) values, i.e. doses causing an 80% inhibition in 4-day cultures when leucine incorporation was used as an indicator of cells vitality. Non-parametric Spearman's rank order correlation confirmed a tight relationship between 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine and fludarabine, as expected. Surprisingly, correlation between two P-glycoprotein-dependent drugs, vincristine and doxorubicin, was not demonstrable. A number of entirely unexpected correlations were identified between drugs with very different mechanisms of action: (i) chlorambucil and gamma-irradiation; (ii) 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine and vincristine; (iii) 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine and gamma-irradiation; (iv) fludarabine and cis-platin; (v) doxorubicine and gamma-irradiation; (vi) prednisolone and cyclosporin A; (vii) vincristine and verapamil.

Bcr-Abl associated leukemias are characterized by a high degree of chromosomal and genomic instability. It is unclear if the phenotype of genomic instability is a primary consequence of Bcr-Abl expression or if it is acquired secondarily. We have attempted to answer this question in previous studies by measuring the frequency of point mutations in double heterozygote transgenic mice derived from mating homozygous P190(Bcr-Abl) transgenic mice (line 623) and the Big Blue Mice((R)) (Stratagene). Our results showed a 2-3-fold increase in the point mutation frequency in pre-leukemic (i.e. about 100 days before the onset of leukemia) P190 mice, compared to control mice (C57/BL6). In the present report, we extended these prior studies to ascertain if Bcr-Abl induced point mutations is a reversible phenotype. Pre-leukemic P190(Bcr-Abl)/Big Blue double homozygous and C57/BL6 control mice were injected with the c-Abl specific kinase inhibitor STI571 for 10 consecutive days. We observed a decrease in the Bcr-Abl induced mutation frequencies in spleen and kidney tissue from mice treated with STI571. These results confirm that Bcr-Abl can directly and reversibly induce an increase in point mutation frequencies that could contribute to the genomic instability observed in Bcr-Abl positive leukemias.","['Brain, Julia', 'Saksena, Anuraag', 'Laneuville, Pierre']","['Brain J', 'Saksena A', 'Laneuville P']","['Molecular Oncology Group, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, C6 Royal Victoria Hospital, McGill University, 687 Pine Avenue West, Que., H3A 1A1, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homozygote', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutagenesis/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Point Mutation/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Spleen/*drug effects/metabolism']",2002/10/05 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/10/05 04:00'],"['2002/10/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212601001813 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00181-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Nov;26(11):1011-6. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00181-3.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several recent studies have shown increased bone marrow vasculature in acute and chronic leukaemia as well as in myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndromes. Increased serum and/or cellular levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as the most potent and specific angiogenic factor were reported in acute and chronic leukaemia and multiple myeloma and also predict poor prognosis in these haematological malignancies. Little is known about angiogenesis and VEGF levels in polycythemia. Thus, the serum levels of VEGF (pg/ml) and erythropoietin (U/l) were determined using ultra-sensitive ELISA assays in 16 polycythemia patients (10 with polycythemia vera (PV) and 6 with secondary polycythemia) and correlated with their clinical and laboratory features. The serum levels of VEGF were significantly higher in 90% of PV cases and 60% of secondary polycythemia compared to healthy controls. The median VEGF levels (pg/ml) were 622 (range, 272-4760), 306 (range, 111-408) and 143 (range, 91-282) in PV, secondary polycythemia and healthy controls, respectively. Since serum VEGF reflects both plasma VEGF and platelet released VEGF, the concentration of VEGF per platelet (VEGF/PLT) as pg per 10(6) platelet was used as a more standardised measure. Splenomegaly emerged as the main factor associated with a marked increase in serum VEGF/PLT levels. On the other hand, the serum erythropoietin levels (U/l) were significantly reduced in PV (range, 1.2-14.3) raised in secondary polycythemia (range, 26-104) compared with normal controls (range, 9.7-31.1), P<0.01. In conclusion, the present study shows increased VEGF levels in most polycythemia patients, and splenomegaly is associated with a profound increase in VEGF serum levels in these patients. Also, patients with PV have significantly reduced serum levels of erythropoietin compared with secondary polycythemia. Also, serum VEGF/PLT was higher in PV patients treated with phlebotomy alone rather than oral chemotherapy, suggesting a possible advantage for chemotherapy over phlebotomy alone in suppressing the disease progression. Further studies with large number of polycythemia cases are warranted to explore the role of these cytokines in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and/or therapy of polycythemia.","['Murphy, P', 'Ahmed, N', 'Hassan, H T']","['Murphy P', 'Ahmed N', 'Hassan HT']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Institute for Health, University of Lincoln, Lincoln, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*blood', 'Lymphokines/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phlebotomy', 'Platelet Count', 'Polycythemia Vera/*blood/complications', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Splenomegaly/*blood/etiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2002/10/05 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/10/05 04:00'],"['2002/10/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S014521260200053X [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00053-x [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Nov;26(11):1007-1010. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00053-x.,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since leukaemic blasts from three of these patients were Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+), we were able to determine if blood progenitors from these particular patients arose from the leukaemic clone or from residual normal progenitors. Blasts and colonies were intensively investigated using a combination of cell surface marker analysis by flow cytometry, RT-PCR and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH detected rearrangements within the major breakpoint BCR (M-BCR) region in blasts and in some myeloid and erythroid colonies from patients 1 and 2. The minor breakpoint (m-BCR) region was detected in blasts and in some myeloid and erythroid colonies from patient 3. RT-PCR detected long b2a2 BCR-ABL transcripts in blasts from patients 1 and 2, although misspliced short e1a2 transcripts were also seen in patient 1. Only e1a2 transcripts were found in blasts from patient 3. Flow sorting demonstrated the B-cell marker CD19 on blasts and on a proportion of myeloid and erythroid progenitors from patients 1 and 3. RT-PCR also detected IgH rearrangements, further evidence of B-cell differentiation, in blasts from these two patients. We conclude that both normal and clonal circulating progenitor numbers can be raised in both M-BCR and m-BCR Ph+ AML. The underlying cause, perhaps efflux from a congested marrow, may be common to AML patients with a high blood white cell count.","['Baines, Paul', 'Austin, Steve', 'Fisher, Janet', 'Owen-Jones, Eleri', 'Lee-Jones, Lisa', 'Throp, Duncan', 'Mckinley, Mark', 'Hoy, Terry', 'Mills, Ken', 'Thompson, Peter', 'Burnett, Alan']","['Baines P', 'Austin S', 'Fisher J', 'Owen-Jones E', 'Lee-Jones L', 'Throp D', 'Mckinley M', 'Hoy T', 'Mills K', 'Thompson P', 'Burnett A']","['Haematology Department, University Hospital of Wales, CF14 4XW, Cardiff, UK. bainesp@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,['Leuk Res. 2002 Nov;26(11):971-3.

Thirty-one patients received combined passive active immunisation with human specific Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HEPABIG-VHB Pharmaceuticals) and Hepatitis B vaccine (arm I) and 29 patients received active immunisation along with interferon (arm II). Protective antibody levels were detected in 89.6 and 21% patients, respectively, at the 6-month evaluation. Infection with HBV occurred in 17 and 59% patients, respectively, at the 6-month evaluation. Interferon, thus, failed to serve the role as a vaccine adjuvant. At the 9-month evaluation of patients who received immunoglobulin, protective antibody titers were lost in 8 out of 19 evaluable patients (42%) and of these, 3 patients became HBsAg reactive at this point of time. This study indicated that 47.3% patients undergoing aggressive chemotherapy responded to combined passive active prophylaxis with protective titers of antiHBs at the 9-month evaluation. However, the rate of HBV infection was greatly reduced to 27%. We suggest that usage of passive immunisation in the aggressive phase, followed by active immunisation after cessation of intense chemotherapy would be a better option to increase the rates of protective antibody levels in these immunocompromised patients with leukemia.","['Somjee, Saika', 'Pai, Suresh', 'Parikh, Purvish', 'Banavali, Shripad', 'Kelkar, Rohini', 'Advani, Suresh']","['Somjee S', 'Pai S', 'Parikh P', 'Banavali S', 'Kelkar R', 'Advani S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Dr. Ernest Borges Road, Parel, Mumbai 400012, India.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hepatitis B/complications/*prevention & control', 'Hepatitis B Antibodies/blood', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/analysis', 'Hepatitis B Vaccines/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Infant', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Recombinant Proteins', '*Vaccination', 'Vaccines, DNA/*therapeutic use']",2002/10/05 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/10/05 04:00'],"['2002/10/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602000449 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00044-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Nov;26(11):989-92. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00044-9.,"['0 (Hepatitis B Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '0 (Hepatitis B Vaccines)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying molecular basis for MDS and its leukemic evolution is unclear. Except for patients with 17p syndrome, loss of function of the p53 tumor suppressor gene accounts for <10% of MDS and AML cases. Recently, mutations of the checkpoint gene, CHK2, the human homologue of the yeast CDS1 and RAD53 genes, have been reported in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome who also have normal p53. As p53 mutations are rare in MDS and AML, we investigated the status of the CHK2 gene by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in patients with MDS (n=10) and patients in whom MDS had transformed into AML (n=3). In the MDS group, we found one patient with a conserved mutation (Lys-->Arg) in the forked head-associated (FHA) domain of the CHK2 coding sequence. We also found a deletion in the CHK2 transcript in one patient from the MDS-->AML group, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the kinase domain. We conclude that alterations of CHK2 and possible involvement in the pathogenesis of MDS may be a rare event.","['Aktas, Dilek', 'Arno, Matthew J', 'Rassool, Feyruz', 'Mufti, Ghulam J']","['Aktas D', 'Arno MJ', 'Rassool F', 'Mufti GJ']","[""Department of Genetics, Hacettepe University Children's Hospital, 06100 Syhhyye, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA Replication/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinases/*genetics', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/10/05 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/10/05 04:00'],"['2002/10/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602000759 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00075-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Nov;26(11):985-7. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00075-9.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A case history of a 4-year-old boy from Turkey with neglect of the required treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is used to examine the causes and management of medical neglect. RESULTS: Although epidemiological studies on child neglect are lacking, this case exemplifies how in DEVELOPING countries, reasons for neglect or non-compliance with medical recommendations and the roles and actions taken by the health care and the social service systems may differ from western populations. Common to both western and developing countries, the characteristics of the child, family, and society may be reasons for medical neglect. However, cultural fatalistic beliefs profoundly present in the developing world may also contribute to the medical neglect of a child. Identification of the neglect, a comprehensive, multidisciplinary assessment emphasizing the strengths within the family and the society, and the determination of the pediatric team to act in the best interest of the child may result in resolution of the neglect even in circumstances where resources within systems are not sufficient. CONCLUSIONS: In developing countries, increased emphasis on child neglect, its prompt recognition and management within the pediatric profession as well as at a health care and social service system levels are needed to address this prevalent and potentially fatal child health problem.","['Ertem, Ilgi Ozturk', 'Bingoler, Bahar Emine', 'Ertem, Mehmet', 'Uysal, Zumrut', 'Gozdasoglu, Sevgi']","['Ertem IO', 'Bingoler BE', 'Ertem M', 'Uysal Z', 'Gozdasoglu S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Ankara University Medical School, Cebeci, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Child Abuse Negl,Child abuse & neglect,7801702,IM,['Child Abuse Negl. 2002 Aug;26(8):747-9.

We characterized the jasplakinolide-induced loss of viability by programmed cell death in the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line and found that this process was accompanied by neutral endopeptidase (NEP)/CD10 expression on the surface of the apoptotic cells. HL-60 cells do not normally express detectable amounts of NEP/CD10 on their surface or intracytoplasmically, but upon jaspamide treatment, CD10 was synthesized de novo, its expression being inhibited by cycloheximide pretreatment. Once synthesized, NEP/CD10 interfered with the jasplakinolide signal delivered to HL-60 cells. Inhibition of NEP/CD10 by the NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon or by an anti-CD10 monoclonal antibody significantly increased apoptosis induction. The appearance of CD10 on the cell surface was blocked by preincubation of the cells with the monocytic/macrophage-differentiating agents vitamin D3 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but not by the granulocytic differentiating agents retinoic acid or dimethyl sulfoxide. Moreover, in the promonocytic U937 and mature monocytic THP-1 cell lines, jaspamide induced apoptosis but not CD10 expression. In HL-60 cells, CD10 expression was partially but not totally blocked by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxacarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, indicating a connection between apoptosis induction and CD10 synthesis. Our findings suggest that the CD10 expression is related to the programmed cell death induction by jaspamide, and also with the process of granulocytic differentiation in HL-60 cells.","['Cioca, D P', 'Kitano, K']","['Cioca DP', 'Kitano K']","['The Second Department of Internal Medicine, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano-ken, Japan. dcioca@personal.ro']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Depsipeptides', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Neprilysin/*biosynthesis', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology']",2002/10/05 04:00,2002/10/19 04:00,['2002/10/05 04:00'],"['2002/10/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00018-002-8515-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2002 Aug;59(8):1377-87. doi: 10.1007/s00018-002-8515-6.,"['0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '102396-24-7 (jasplakinolide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these vehicles are characterized by relatively low titre and in the case of many tumor cell lines, low transduction efficiency. We constructed bicistronic retroviral vector pseudotypes of amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) and gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV), encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a rapid and easily detectable reporter gene. Transduction of five different human melanoma and four renal carcinoma cell lines by these two virus pseudotypes revealed differences in transduction efficiency, which wase markedly lower for the renal carcinoma cell lines. Stimulation of retroviral receptor expression (PiT1 and PiT2) by phosphate depletion induced a limited increase of receptor mRNA levels, but did not improve the gene transfer efficiency. In contrast, simultaneous transduction with both vector pseudotypes markedly increased the transduction efficiency, compared to GaLV or A-MuLV alone. The same effect could be achieved by several repeated exposures of target cells to fresh vector preparation. Overexpression of GaLV receptor (PiT1) in target cells significantly increased the transduction rate and enabled retrovirus mediated gene transfer into the cells which normally are not transducible by GaLV pseudotypes. We demonstrated that, using different transduction strategies, the relatively inefficient, widely used retroviral vector systems could be significantly improved.","['Grabarczyk, Piotr', 'Wysocki, Piotr J', 'Gryska, Katarzyna', 'Mackiewicz, Andrzej']","['Grabarczyk P', 'Wysocki PJ', 'Gryska K', 'Mackiewicz A']","['Department of Cancer Immunology, K Marcinkowski University of Medical Sciences, GreatPoland Cancer Center, Poznan. pgrabarczyk@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,IM,,"['Carcinoma, Renal Cell/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/physiology', 'Melanoma/genetics', 'Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/*physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/05 04:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2002/10/05 04:00'],"['2002/10/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/05 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2002;49(2):333-9.,"['0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cohort included 57,613 workers employed for at least 1 year in the pulp and paper industry in 12 countries. We assessed exposure to SO(2) at the level of mill and department, using industrial hygiene measurement data and information from company questionnaires; 40,704 workers were classified as exposed to SO(2). We conducted a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) analysis based on age-specific and calendar period-specific national mortality rates. We also conducted a Poisson regression analysis to determine the dose-response relations between SO(2) exposure and cancer mortality risks and to explore the effect of potential confounding factors. The SMR analysis showed a moderate deficit of all causes of death [SMR = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87-0.96] among exposed workers. Lung cancer mortality was marginally increased among exposed workers (SMR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.98-1.18). After adjustment for occupational coexposures, the lung cancer risk was increased compared with unexposed workers (rate ratio = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.14-1.96). There was a suggestion of a positive relationship between weighted cumulative SO(2) exposure and lung cancer mortality (p-value of test for linear trend = 0.009 among all exposed workers; p = 0.3 among workers with high exposure). Neither duration of exposure nor time since first exposure was associated with lung cancer mortality. Mortality from non-Hodgkin lymphoma and from leukemia was increased among workers with high SO(2) exposure; a dose-response relationship with cumulative SO(2) exposure was suggested for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. For the other causes of death, there was no evidence of increased mortality associated with exposure to SO(2). Although residual confounding may have occurred, our results suggest that occupational exposure to SO(2) in the pulp and paper industry may be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.","['Lee, Won Jin', 'Teschke, Kay', 'Kauppinen, Timo', 'Andersen, Aage', 'Jappinen, Paavo', 'Szadkowska-Stanczyk, Irena', 'Pearce, Neil', 'Persson, Bodil', 'Bergeret, Alain', 'Facchini, Luiz Augusto', 'Kishi, Reiko', 'Kielkowski, Danuta', 'Rix, Bo Andreassen', 'Henneberger, Paul', 'Sunyer, Jordi', 'Colin, Didier', 'Kogevinas, Manolis', 'Boffetta, Paolo']","['Lee WJ', 'Teschke K', 'Kauppinen T', 'Andersen A', 'Jappinen P', 'Szadkowska-Stanczyk I', 'Pearce N', 'Persson B', 'Bergeret A', 'Facchini LA', 'Kishi R', 'Kielkowski D', 'Rix BA', 'Henneberger P', 'Sunyer J', 'Colin D', 'Kogevinas M', 'Boffetta P']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,,"['Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Leukemia/etiology/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/*etiology/*mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology/mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Odds Ratio', 'Paper', 'Sulfur Dioxide/*adverse effects']",2002/10/04 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/04 04:00'],"['2002/10/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['sc271_5_1835 [pii]', '10.1289/ehp.02110991 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2002 Oct;110(10):991-5. doi: 10.1289/ehp.02110991.,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0UZA3422Q4 (Sulfur Dioxide)']",,,,PMC1241024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Limiting the number of samples should facilitate the assessment of etoposide pharmacokinetics in children. We compared limited sampling strategies using multiple linear regression of plasma concentrations and clearance with Bayesian methods of estimating clearance using compartmental pharmacokinetic models. Optimal sampling times were estimated in the multiple linear regression method by determining the combination of two samples which maximized the correlation coefficient, and in the Bayesian estimation approach by minimizing the variance in estimates of clearance. Clearance estimates were compared to the actual clearances from Monte Carlo-simulated data and predicted clearances estimated using all available plasma concentrations in clinical data from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Multiple linear regression poorly predicted clearance (mean bias 8.3%, precision 17.5%), but improved if plasma concentrations were logarithmically transformed (mean bias 1.4%, precision 12.5%). Bayesian estimation methods with optimal samples gave the best overall prediction (mean bias 2.5%, precision 6.8%) and also performed better than regression methods for abnormally high or low clearances.

These methods provide apoptotic information from different aspects. To find a new way in apoptosis research and potential clinical application, we recently developed a novel method with an imaging-combined flow cytometer (IFC) and an innovative cell staining process by using 2-[7-(1,3-dihydro-1,3,3-trimethyl-2H-indol-2-ylidene)-1,3,5-heptatrienyl]-1,3,3-t rimethyl-3H-indolium iodide (HITC) and 2-[7-[1,3-dihydro-1,1-dimethyl-3-(4-sulfobutyl)-2H-benz[e]indol-2-ylidene]-1,3,5- heptatrienyl]-1,1-dimethyl-3-(4-sulfobutyl)-1H-benz[e]indolium hydroxide, inner salt, sodium salt (IR-125). The IFC used in the research is a new generation of cytometry designed for simultaneous observations of cell populations and images. This is possible because the IFC is equipped with dual laser beams, one argon and one infrared. A promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, was used in the research. The cells were stained with our newly developed HITC or IR-125 staining method and a traditional nucleic acid dye, propidium iodide. The cells stained with HITC or IR-125 appeared completely dark in the IFC image window before washing. Phosphate buffered saline wash did not change the cell appearance. A wash with 50% methanol caused the cells to have a clear cell image with bright nuclei on the IFC. To obtain apoptotic cells, we treated the HL-60 cells with 0.15 microM of camptothecin (CAM), a topoisomerase I inhibitor and experimental apoptosis inducer, for 4 h. The control showed larger round cells with bright nuclei and one to three dark nucleoli. The CAM-induced apoptotic cells were smaller, with fragmented and condensed nuclei on the IFC. These appearances were identical to the cell morphology of with light and electron microscopy. We used other methods including FACScan and DNA electrophoresis to confirm the apoptotic changes after CAM treatment and compared them with the IFC method. In addition, we found that the novel method with the IFC and HITC or IR-125 staining can show not only cell apoptotic changes but also peripheral blood cell populations and images simultaneously. This study suggests many potential applications of the IFC and this novel staining method in other cellular biological researches and clinical assays.","['Wang, Fu-sheng', 'Kubota, Fumio']","['Wang FS', 'Kubota F']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, California, USA. wangf@sysmex.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Camptothecin', '*Carbocyanines', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cell Size/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/physiology/ultrastructure', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods', '*Indoles', 'Microscopy, Electron']",2002/10/03 04:00,2003/04/10 05:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.10143 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 2002 Oct 15;50(5):267-74. doi: 10.1002/cyto.10143.,"['0 (Carbocyanines)', '0 (IR125)', '0 (Indoles)', ""16595-48-5 (1,1',3,3,3',3'-hexamethylindotricarbocyanine)"", 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although CD2+ B-cells have been identified in normal fetal and postnatal thymus, they have not been reported in adults. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed flow cytometric immunophenotypic data on consecutive low-grade B-cell leukemias and lymphomas to investigate the frequency of CD2 expression. We also reviewed samples from normal healthy donors to determine whether there is a normal CD2+ B-cell population. RESULTS: CD2 expression (partial or complete) was observed in 13 of 83 (16%) chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), 16 of 29 (55%) follicle center lymphomas (FCL), 3 of 12 (25%) hairy cell leukemias (HCL), 0 of 6 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), 8 of 28 (29%) large cell lymphomas (LCL), and in 0 of 5 marginal zone/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas (MZL/MALT). We determined that 5.74 +/- 2.46% (mean +/- SD) of normal peripheral blood B cells and 6.48 +/- 1.62 % (mean +/- SD) of normal bone marrow B cells coexpress CD2. CONCLUSIONS: CD2 expression in B-cell neoplasia is a more prevalent phenomenon than previously appreciated.

Low levels of the death-inducing TRAIL receptors, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 but not the putative 'decoy' receptors, TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4, were expressed on the surface of B-CLL cells. Resistance to TRAIL was upstream of caspase-8 activation, as little or no caspase-8 was processed in TRAIL-treated B-CLL cells. Low levels of a TRAIL death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) were formed in these cells, accompanied by the recruitment of endogenous FADD, caspase-8 and c-FLIP(L) but not c-FLIP(S). Both caspase-8 and c-FLIP(L) were cleaved to form two stable intermediates of approximately 43 kDa, which remained associated with the DISC. Caspase-8 was not further processed to its active heterotetramer. Thus the resistance of B-CLL cells to TRAIL may be due partly to low surface expression of the death receptors resulting in low levels of DISC formation and also to the high ratio of c-FLIP(L) to caspase-8 within the DISC, which would prevent further activation of caspase-8. Our results highlight the possibility of sensitising B-CLL cells to TRAIL by modulation of c-FLIP levels or by upregulation of surface expression of death receptors.","['MacFarlane, Marion', 'Harper, Nicholas', 'Snowden, Roger T', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Barnett, Georgina A', 'Pringle, J Howard', 'Cohen, Gerald M']","['MacFarlane M', 'Harper N', 'Snowden RT', 'Dyer MJ', 'Barnett GA', 'Pringle JH', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, University of Leicester, PO Box 138, Lancaster Road, Leicester LE1 9HN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/analysis', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteins/analysis', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/19 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2001/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2002/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205853 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Oct 3;21(44):6809-18. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205853.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the role of IRF-4 gene regulation in the context of HTLV-1 infection using gene array technology and IRF-4 expressing T cells. Many potential IRF-4 regulated genes were identified, the vast majority of which were repressed by IRF-4 expression. Cyclin B1, a G2-M checkpoint protein identified as an IRF-4 repressed gene in the array, was further characterized in the context of HTLV-1 infection. All HTLV-1 infected cell lines and ATL patient lymphocytes demonstrated a dramatic decrease in cyclin B1 levels; subsequent analysis of the cyclin B1 promoter identified two sites important in IRF-4 binding and repression of cyclin B1 expression. Furthermore, IRF-4-mediated repression of cyclin B1 led to a significant decrease in CDC2 kinase activity in HTLV-1 infected T cells. IRF-4 expression in HTLV-1 infected T cells also downregulated other genes implicated in the mitotic checkpoint as well as genes involved in actin cytoskeletal rearrangement, DNA repair, apoptosis, metastasis and immune recognition. Several of the identified genes are dysregulated in ATL and may provide important mechanistic information concerning pathways critical to the emergence of ATL.","['Mamane, Yael', 'Grandvaux, Nathalie', 'Hernandez, Eduardo', 'Sharma, Sonia', 'Innocente, Steve A', 'Lee, Jonathan M', 'Azimi, Nazli', 'Lin, Rongtuan', 'Hiscott, John']","['Mamane Y', 'Grandvaux N', 'Hernandez E', 'Sharma S', 'Innocente SA', 'Lee JM', 'Azimi N', 'Lin R', 'Hiscott J']","['Terry Fox Molecular Oncology Group, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, McGill University, Montreal, Canada H3T 1E2.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/19 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2002/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205843 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Oct 3;21(44):6751-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205843.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have studied the use of a novel anti-pan-B-cell marker Pax-5 for use in diagnostic pathology. Pax-5 encodes for BSAP (Pax-5), a B-cell-specific transcription factor, the expression of which is detectable as early as the pro-B-cell stage and subsequently in all further stages of B-cell development until the plasma cell stage where it is downregulated. Pax-5 is essential for B-lineage commitment in the fetal liver, whereas in adult bone marrow this transcription factor is required for progression of B-cell development beyond the early pro-B (pre-BI) cell stage. Among the B-cell genes that are present in early B-cell development and are upregulated by Pax-5 are CD19 and Igalpha (CD79a). We have tested a commercially available anti-Pax-5 antibody (anti-BSAP, clone 24) in a series of 592 routinely fixed and paraffin wax-embedded biopsies, including lymph nodes, bone marrow, and various other organs containing lymphoid tissues. Pax-5 protein (BSAP) was detected in all cases of precursor and mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas/leukemias. In addition, in 97% of classic Hodgkin lymphomas, Reed-Sternberg cells expressed Pax-5. However, Pax-5 was not detected in any of the multiple myelomas, solitary plasmacytomas, and 4% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Among those diffuse large B-cell lymphomas not expressing Pax-5 were only those with terminal B-cell differentiation. All T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including ALCL and lymphoblastic lymphomas and leukemias, were negative. There was a strong association between Pax-5 and CD20 expression. We conclude that anti-Pax-5 is an excellent pan-B and pan-pre-B-cell marker. We have found that anti-Pax-5 is superior to anti-CD20 in the diagnosis of pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia and classic Hodgkin lymphoma versus ALCL of T and ""null"" cell type. It was also useful in differential diagnosis between lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and plasmacytoma. Even though there is an excellent correlation between CD20 and Pax-5 expression, anti-Pax-5 exceeds the specificity and sensitivity of L26 (anti-CD20) because of its earlier expression in B-cell differentiation and its ability to detect all committed B cells, including classic Hodgkin lymphoma.","['Torlakovic, Emina', 'Torlakovic, Goran', 'Nguyen, Phuong L', 'Brunning, Richard D', 'Delabie, Jan']","['Torlakovic E', 'Torlakovic G', 'Nguyen PL', 'Brunning RD', 'Delabie J']","['Department of Pathology, Noewegian, Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway. emina.torlakovic@labmed.uio.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor', 'Paraffin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Transcription Factors/*immunology/metabolism']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-200210000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2002 Oct;26(10):1343-50. doi: 10.1097/00000478-200210000-00011.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8002-74-2 (Paraffin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify immunological targets of the graft-versus-leukemia response (GVL) after DLI, we used CML post-DLI responder sera to screen a CML cDNA expression library. One of the antigens identified in this screen is a M(r) 28,000 protein, termed CML28. CML28 is identical to hRrp46p, a component of the human exosome, a multiprotein complex involved in the 3' processing of RNA. Components of the human exosome include known autoantigens, such as PMScl-100, an autoantibody target in patients with polymyositis, scleroderma, or polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome. Recombinant CML28-GST fusion protein was purified, and used in Western blot and ELISA to demonstrate the development of a high-titer CML28-specific IgG antibody response in a patient with relapsed CML who responded to DLI. Northern blotting demonstrated that CML28 is highly expressed in a variety of hematopoietic and epithelial tumor cell lines, but not in normal hematopoietic tissues or other normal tissue, with the exception of testis. Purified recombinant CML28 was used to generate a CML28-specific murine monoclonal antibody. Western blotting with CML28 monoclonal antibody against whole-cell lysates derived from blood and marrow of normal donors and patients with leukemia revealed high expression of this antigen in tumor but not in normal samples. Because CML28 was highly expressed in epithelial tumor cell lines, anti-CML28 responses were also examined in patients with solid tumors. By ELISA, we found specific serological responses in 10-33% of patients with lung cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer. Our studies suggest that immunogenicity of CML28 is likely because of overexpression of this antigen in tumor cells. Moreover, given its expression and immunogenicity in a wide variety of malignancies, CML28 merits additional evaluation as a target for antigen-specific immunotherapy.","['Yang, Xiao-Feng', 'Wu, Catherine J', 'Chen, Linyun', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Canning, Christine', 'Kantoff, Philip', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Dranoff, Glenn', 'Ritz, Jerome']","['Yang XF', 'Wu CJ', 'Chen L', 'Alyea EP', 'Canning C', 'Kantoff P', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Dranoff G', 'Ritz J']","[""Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115."", ""Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115."", ""Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115."", ""Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115."", ""Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115."", ""Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115."", ""Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115."", ""Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115."", ""Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Antibodies, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/blood/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Exoribonucleases', 'Exosome Multienzyme Ribonuclease Complex', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis/blood/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Oct 1;62(19):5517-5522.,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (EXOSC5 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exosome Multienzyme Ribonuclease Complex)']",,,"['K08 HL004293/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 AI054514/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'KO8 HL04293/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI029530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI029530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4762257,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS759631'],,,,,,

To overcome this impairment, we fused unpulsed DCs to human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected CD4(+) T cells (fusion DC-T cells). The efficiency of fusion was 50% and the fusion cells expressed higher HLA-ABC and CD86 Ags than HTLV-I-infected DCs. The fusion DC-T cells stimulated autologous CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, but DCs fused to itself or PHA-blasts did not stimulate any subsets. The functionally highest fusion DC-T cells was obtained when a DC and HTLV-I-infected T cells were fused at a ratio of 3:1. Expression of HTLV-Igag Ag on CD4(+) T cells was up-regulated when infected in the presence of 8-azaguanine, and these fusion DC-T cells were quite efficient in induction of higher CD8(+) T cell response. The results suggest that fusion DC-T cells produce functionally competent Ag-presenting cells and may be a likely candidate for immunotherapeutic use.","['Shimokubo, Satoshi', 'Wakamatsu, Shin-ichi', 'Maeda, Yumi', 'Baba, Masanori', 'Makino, Masahiko']","['Shimokubo S', 'Wakamatsu S', 'Maeda Y', 'Baba M', 'Makino M']","['Department of Microbiology, Leprosy Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, 189-0002, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*physiology', '*Cell Fusion', 'Dendritic Cells/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/19 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202915461 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.2002.1546 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Sep 15;301(1):13-20. doi: 10.1006/viro.2002.1546.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we conducted an analysis of these RNA structures, stem loop 1 (SL1) and stem loop 2 (SL2), to determine if both the loop and the stem nucleotide bases are important for RNA encapsidation. We have found that the primary sequence of the unpaired bases located in the loop regions of both SL1 and SL2 are important for efficient RNA encapsidation and virus replication. The primary sequence of the bases that form the stems for both SL1 and SL2 was observed to aid in efficient encapsidation and replication. We also observed that the order of SL1 and SL2 is important for RNA encapsidation and virus replication efficiency. A viral RNA with two copies of either SL1 or SL2 was found to replicate and package RNA as efficiently as a viral RNA with only one copy of SL1 or SL2. This provides evidence that SL1 and SL2 are not functionally equivalent. Sequences from human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) that are located in the same region of HTLV-1 as the SL1 and SL2 of BLV were used to replace the BLV SL1, SL2, or both in a BLV RNA. These BLV RNAs were still encapsidated and replicated, suggesting that these sequences may function as an encapsidation signal in HTLV-1. The chimeric RNAs did not replicate as well as the parental, indicating that the primary nucleotide sequence along with the secondary and tertiary structure of the RNA plays a role in efficient RNA encapsidation and replication.","['Mansky, Louis M', 'Gajary, Lisa C']","['Mansky LM', 'Gajary LC']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, Center for Retrovirus Research, and Comprehensive Cancer, Center, Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA. mansky.3@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'RNA, Viral/*physiology', 'Virus Assembly/*physiology', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202915783 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.2002.1578 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Sep 30;301(2):272-80. doi: 10.1006/viro.2002.1578.,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human marrow progenitor cells, rViscumin inhibited colony formation and did not exert any protective activity against cisplatin-induced inhibition of clonogenicity. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that cisplatin treatment of K562 cells resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in mRNA expression of the nucleotide excision repair gene ERCC-1. This upregulation was not prevented when cells were post-incubated with rViscumin. Our study provides evidence that rViscumin is capable of enhancing cytotoxicity of anticancer agents in vitro.

We now investigated the relationship of these isoforms to the expression of cell cycle stimulatory (cyclin A) and inhibitory (p21WAF1) proteins and to the induction of apoptosis in wt p53 MCF-7 and mutant p53 SKBR3 human breast carcinomas. The latter cells exhibited lower 42kDa Mcl-1, higher expression of cyclin A relative to that of p21WAF1, and apoptosis in response to okadaic acid, a phosphatase 1/2A inhibitor. The proteasome inhibitor MG-115 selectively increased expression of the 40kDa Mcl-1 isoform and induced p21WAF1, but also promoted preferential apoptosis in SKBR3 cells. Neither okadaic acid nor MG-115 caused comparable effects in MCF-7 cells. However, vanadate or acetyl furanonaphthoquinone induced the 40kDa Mcl-1 and greater Jun kinase (JNK) phosphorylation without apoptosis-associated PARP fragmentation in MCF-7 cells. Our data suggest that the higher susceptibility of SKBR3 cells to undergo apoptosis may be partly due to their greater proliferative potential (cyclin A), low expression of the anti-apoptotic 42kDa Mcl-1 isoform, and suboptimal JNK activation in response to stress.","['Rieber, Manuel', 'Medina, Jose D', 'Strasberg-Rieber, Mary']","['Rieber M', 'Medina JD', 'Strasberg-Rieber M']","['IVIC, Centre of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Tumor Cell Biology Laboratory, Apartado 21827, Caracas 1020 A, Venezuela. mrieber@ivic.ve']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/pathology', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cyclin A/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X02023124 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02312-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Oct 4;297(4):943-9. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02312-4.,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (carbobenzoxy-leucyl-leucyl-norvalinal)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the involvement of the nuclear isoform of TC-PTP in interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated signaling pathway. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that plays important roles in the immune system, hematopoiesis, and acute phase reactions, and has also implicated in IL-6-related diseases. Here, we demonstrate that IL-6-induced tyrosine-phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 were suppressed by overexpression of the nuclear isoform of TC-PTP in 293T cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 directly interacted with a substrate-trapping mutant of TC-PTP. Furthermore, retrovirus-mediated overexpression of the nuclear isoform of TC-PTP suppressed the IL-6-induced growth arrest of myeloid leukemia M1 cells. Endogenous TC-PTP complexed with STAT3 in the nucleus of M1 cells. These results strongly suggest that the nuclear isoform of TC-PTP may serve as a negative regulator of IL-6-mediated signaling pathway.","['Yamamoto, Tetsuya', 'Sekine, Yuichi', 'Kashima, Keiichi', 'Kubota, Atsuko', 'Sato, Noriko', 'Aoki, Naohito', 'Matsuda, Tadashi']","['Yamamoto T', 'Sekine Y', 'Kashima K', 'Kubota A', 'Sato N', 'Aoki N', 'Matsuda T']","['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-Ku Kita 12 Nishi 6, Sapporo 060-0812, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 2', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X0202291X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02291-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Oct 4;297(4):811-7. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02291-x.,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn2 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High numbers of tumour cells are found in the peripheral blood (PB) only at end-stage disease (secondary plasma cell leukaemia, PCL) in a minority of patients. Using flow cytometric and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, a high percentage of tumoral BM PC from untreated patients was found to express CD106. In addition, these cells also expressed an activated form of CD29, as determined using the CD29 activation reporter monoclonal antibody HUTS-21. Adhesion-binding experiments showed that CD106+-activated CD29+ BM PC from these patients adhered to fibronectin (FN) in a CD29/CD49d-dependent manner. In contrast, marrow PC from progressive patients and BM or circulating malignant cells from secondary PCL patients expressed lower levels or were negative for CD106 and activated CD29, respectively, with a decreased or zero ability to adhere to FN. The expression of constitutive CD29 and CD49d, however, was similar during disease progression. We conclude that BM myelomatous cells co-express CD106 and a functionally active form of CD29.

Treatment of CML patients with interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) has induced haematological and cytogenetic remission. Interferons transcriptionally activate target genes through the JAK-STAT and interferon regulated factors (IRFs) family pathways. Interferon regulated factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcriptional activator of genes critical for cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. The skipping of exons 2 or 2 and 3 of IRF-1 in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myelogenous leukaemia suggests that this factor may have a critical role in leukaemogenesis. The role of IRF-1 in CML is currently unknown. Therefore, mutational analysis of IRF-1 was performed and its expression pattern was also studied in CML patients. We studied IRF-1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 21 patients in chronic phase CML. No point mutations were identified at the cDNA level. Surprisingly, fourfold reduction of full-length IRF-1 mRNA expression was established in 17/21 patients compared with normal individuals. Low expression of full-length IRF-1 was observed in conjunction with high levels of aberrantly spliced mRNAs, reported for the first time. In three patients who were also analysed during blastic transformation, further reduction of full-length IRF-1 mRNA was observed. These findings demonstrate that, in CML patients, IRF-1 can produce high levels of aberrant spliced mRNAs with subsequent reduction in the levels of full-length IRF-1 mRNA. This observation is consistent with the notion that exon skipping may constitute another mechanism of tumour suppressor gene inactivation in this disease.","['Tzoanopoulos, Dimitrios', 'Speletas, Matthaios', 'Arvanitidis, Konstantinos', 'Veiopoulou, Christina', 'Kyriaki, Sofia', 'Thyphronitis, George', 'Sideras, Paschalis', 'Kartalis, Georgios', 'Ritis, Konstantinos']","['Tzoanopoulos D', 'Speletas M', 'Arvanitidis K', 'Veiopoulou C', 'Kyriaki S', 'Thyphronitis G', 'Sideras P', 'Kartalis G', 'Ritis K']","['First Division of Internal Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Regional Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Alexandroupolis, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Alternative Splicing', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/12/17 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']","['3829 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03829.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Oct;119(1):46-53. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03829.x.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the prognostic significance of levels of Cox-2 in BM cells from patients with CML. Western blot and solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) were used to measure Cox-2 BM levels in 149 patients with chronic phase CML (CP CML). Results were compared with those of normal controls. Expression of Cox-2 was significantly higher in CML than in normal controls (P < 0.0001). Increasing levels of Cox-2 were significantly associated with shorter survival (P = 0.0002, Cox proportional hazard model). A multivariate model based on Cox-2 and degree of splenomegaly was developed for survival in patients with early CP CML. Agents that inhibit Cox-2 activity merit investigation in patients with CP CML.","['Giles, Francis J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Bekele, B Nebiyou', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Faderl, Stephan', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Rogers, Anna', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Talpaz, Moshe', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Albitar, Maher']","['Giles FJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Bekele BN', 'Cortes JE', 'Faderl S', 'Thomas DA', 'Manshouri T', 'Rogers A', 'Keating MJ', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukaemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. frankgiles@aol.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Radioimmunoassay/methods', 'Survival Analysis']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/12/17 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']","['3784 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03784.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Oct;119(1):38-45. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03784.x.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She achieved a complete cytogenetic and molecular remission. Clinical course was complicated, with an intracerebral bleed, respiratory failure requiring ventilation and prolonged pancytopenia following initial chemotherapy. A live female infant was born at 28 weeks gestation who survived to discharge with significant pulmonary complications. She remains oxygen dependent at 6 months of age. ATRA has been used from the 3rd week of gestation, but fetal malformations are common during the first trimester. In contrast it seems to be safe in the second and third trimesters with regard to teratogenesis but can cause other side-effects. Most successful outcomes in treatment of APL during pregnancy are seen after treatment with ATRA and delivery of the baby at as late a stage as possible. Pregnancies terminated before remission has been obtained or those treated in the first trimester have a poor maternal outcome.","['Carradice, D', 'Austin, N', 'Bayston, K', 'Ganly, P S']","['Carradice D', 'Austin N', 'Bayston K', 'Ganly PS']","['Department of Haematology, Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand. duncancarradice@doctors.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/drug therapy/etiology', 'Cesarean Section', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Diuretics/therapeutic use', 'Epilepsy, Tonic-Clonic/drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Fetal Growth Retardation/etiology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Lung/abnormalities', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Nutrition Disorders/etiology/therapy', 'Oxygen/therapeutic use', 'Parenteral Nutrition, Total', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/etiology/therapy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Respiration Disorders/congenital/etiology', 'Tranexamic Acid/therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",2002/10/03 04:00,2003/03/18 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']","['459 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2257.2002.00459.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2002 Oct;24(5):307-11. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2257.2002.00459.x.,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Diuretics)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6T84R30KC1 (Tranexamic Acid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The basis for an interaction of IL-6 cytokines with adult sensory neurones has been established by analysing the levels and distribution of the two signal-transducing receptor subunits, glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of male adult rats before and following nerve injury. All sensory neurones express gp130-immunoreactivity (IR) in the cytoplasm and on the plasma membrane. Levels of gp130 and its intracellular distribution remained unchanged up to 14 days following sciatic nerve axotomy. LIFR-IR was largely absent from the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of sensory neurones, but confined almost exclusively to the nuclear compartment. However, following axotomy, punctate cytoplasmic LIFR-IR was detected which persisted up to 28 days following axotomy. The expression of cytoplasmic LIFR 2 days post-axotomy was proportionally greater in a subset of small diameter sensory neurones which expressed either the sensory neuropeptide CGRP or the cell surface marker isolectin B4. The coexpression of gp130 and LIFR in the same intracellular compartment following axotomy conveys potential responsiveness of injured sensory neurones to members of the IL-6 family of cytokines.","['Gardiner, Natalie J', 'Cafferty, William B J', 'Slack, Sarah E', 'Thompson, Stephen W N']","['Gardiner NJ', 'Cafferty WB', 'Slack SE', 'Thompson SW']","[""Centre for Neuroscience Research, Guy's, Kings and St. Thomas' School of Biomedical Science, Kings College London, Guy's Campus, London SE1 1UL, England, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Axotomy', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Compartmentation/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Ganglia, Spinal/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neurons, Afferent/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', '*Protein Subunits', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Sciatic Nerve/*injuries', 'Sciatic Neuropathy/metabolism']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/29 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']","['1101 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1471-4159.2002.01101.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2002 Oct;83(1):100-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.2002.01101.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to better understand IL-6 stimulated myeloma cell growth, we have performed gene expression profiling to identify IL-6 early response genes. Using the KAS-6/1 IL-6-dependent human myeloma cell line, IL-6 stimulation dramatically induced expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA. To verify this result, we used reverse transcriptase PCR and RNAse protection assays and demonstrated using both assays that MCP-1 is indeed an IL-6 responsive gene in a variety of IL-6-responsive myeloma cell lines. Moreover, we also demonstrated IL-6 stimulated MCP-1 secretion by the myeloma cell lines as well as by fresh patient tumor cells. Lastly, we present evidence that fresh patient tumor cells express mRNA for the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2, as do myeloma cell lines along with a second MCP-1 receptor, CCR11. Although MM cell chemotaxis in response to MCP-1 was only minimal, we were able to demonstrate that MCP-1 stimulated activation of MAPK. Because of the important role that this chemokine plays in both angiogenesis and bone homeostasis, and the ability of MCP-1 to activate myeloma cells, these results suggest a new mechanism by which IL-6 may contribute to disease pathogenesis.","['Arendt, B K', 'Velazquez-Dones, A', 'Tschumper, R C', 'Howell, K G', 'Ansell, S M', 'Witzig, T E', 'Jelinek, D F']","['Arendt BK', 'Velazquez-Dones A', 'Tschumper RC', 'Howell KG', 'Ansell SM', 'Witzig TE', 'Jelinek DF']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Graduate and Medical Schools, Mayo Clinic/Foundation, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Chemokine CCL2/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402714 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):2142-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402714.,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,"['CA62228/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed a clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor (TCR)-gamma chain gene in all cases. One additional case showed a clonal rearrangement of the TCR-beta chain gene by Southern blot hybridization. PCR analysis showed a clonal immunoglobulin rearrangement in three cases presenting with more than 50% of large B cells whereas the other cases had a germline configuration. In 6/8 cases, double-labeling immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was mostly present in the large B cells but also detected in some T cells. We further evaluated the frequency of AILD-TL with more than 25% of large B cells in the 106 cases collected by the French GELA group and found an incidence of 18%. The outcome of these patients did not differ significantly from those with less than 25% of B cells. With this approach we confirm the heterogeneity of AILD-TL features and the possible association with a substantial numbers of CD20(+), EBV(+) large B cells. We propose to denominate these cases as 'AILD-TL rich in large B cells' and to consider them as a different entity which can be misdiagnosed as a reactive process or as T cell rich B cell lymphoma.","['Lome-Maldonado, C', 'Canioni, D', 'Hermine, O', 'Delabesse, E', 'Damotte, D', 'Raffoux, E', 'Gaulard, P', 'Macintyre, E', 'Brousse, N']","['Lome-Maldonado C', 'Canioni D', 'Hermine O', 'Delabesse E', 'Damotte D', 'Raffoux E', 'Gaulard P', 'Macintyre E', 'Brousse N']","['Department of Pathology (EA 219, University Paris V), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2001/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402642 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):2134-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402642.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[""French Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte (GELA)""]",,,,,

Six cases were identified and LGL expansion occurred more frequently following a reduced fludarabine and anti-T lymphocyte globulin-based preparative regimen (4 cases/49), than after a conventional myeloablative regimen (2 cases/152). Expansion of LGL was seen between 3 and 15 months following allo-SCT. Hematopoiesis, with mild to severe cytopenia, was a favored target for LGL. Autoimmune manifestations including polyarthritis and hypergammaglobulinemia were also observed. LGL proliferation was observed in the context of chronic antigenic stimulation associated with recurrent viral infections especially CMV. Moreover, five out of these six high risk patients achieved a long-term complete remission concomitant or following LGL expansion.

Cell numbers reached 17.5- to 62.3- (day 14) and 17.4- to 92.4-fold (day 21) of input cells. Expansion of CFU-GM/Mix was 4.0- to 12.8-fold (day 14) and 4.9- to 11.7-fold (day 21). Primitive week6 CAFC were expanded up to 6.5-fold (day 14) and 6.2-fold (day 21) without exogenous GF. When direct contact of HPC and stromal cells was inhibited, a loss of CFC and much more of CAFC potential was observed with unaffected overall cell proliferation. Here, we show the generation of GF producing murine stromal cells which efficiently support early hematopoiesis without exogenous GF. Direct stromal cell-HPC contact is advantageous for maintenance of differentiation potential.","['Keller, U', 'Gotze, K S', 'Duyster, J', 'Schmidt, B', 'Rose-John, S', 'Peschel, C']","['Keller U', 'Gotze KS', 'Duyster J', 'Schmidt B', 'Rose-John S', 'Peschel C']","['III Department of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion', 'DNA Primers', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology/metabolism']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2001/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402660 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):2122-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402660.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 10 patients bearing a fusion gene transcript suitable for minimal residual disease quantitative assessment, we performed a simultaneous analysis of the WT1 and of the fusion-gene transcript at sequential time intervals during follow-up. Sequential WT1 analysis was also performed in five AML patients lacking additional molecular markers. The data obtained show that normal and regenerating BM samples and purified CD34-positive cells consistently express minimal amounts of WT1 transcript and that this is extremely low and frequently undetectable in normal PB. By contrast, high levels of WT1 expression are present in the BM and PB samples of all acute leukemia (AL) cases at diagnosis. The WT1 levels during follow-up were found to follow the pattern of the other molecular markers (fusion gene transcripts) used for MRD monitoring and increased WT1expression in the BM and/or PB during follow-up of AL patients was always found to be predictive of an impending hematological relapse.","['Cilloni, D', 'Gottardi, E', 'De Micheli, D', 'Serra, A', 'Volpe, G', 'Messa, F', 'Rege-Cambrin, G', 'Guerrasio, A', 'Divona, M', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Saglio, G']","['Cilloni D', 'Gottardi E', 'De Micheli D', 'Serra A', 'Volpe G', 'Messa F', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Guerrasio A', 'Divona M', 'Lo Coco F', 'Saglio G']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Dept of Clinical and Biological Sciences of the University of Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', '*Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402675 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):2115-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402675.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In sensitive B-CLL cells, apoptosis was characterized by cell shrinking, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), phosphatidylserine exposure, activation of caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9, reduction of Mcl-1 levels, translocation of AIF from mitochondria to nucleus and chromatin condensation. No significant variations in the levels of Bcl-2, Bax and Bak proteins were noticed upon treatment with 2CdA. Co-treatment of cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk attenuated some morphological and biochemical characteristics of apoptosis and delayed 2CdA-induced DeltaPsi(m) loss, but did not prevent cell death. Z-VAD-fmk did not prevent 2CdA-induced AIF translocation but in this case apoptotic cells displayed only peripheral chromatin condensation, characteristic of AIF action. Reduced or negligible caspase 3 expression did not prevent 2CdA toxicity in cells from four patients. Cells from three patients that responded poorly to 2CdA lacked expression of caspases 9 or 3. Cells from another patient resistant to 2CdA expressed caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9 but they were not activated by treatment. These results indicate that execution of apoptosis is carried out independently by AIF and caspases, which are responsible for the development of apoptotic phenotype in response to 2CdA. Although caspases can also collaborate in DeltaPsi(m) loss, proapoptotic proteins from the Bcl-2 superfamily may be the key inducers of DeltaPsi(m) loss and apoptosis in B-CLL cells sensitive to 2CdA.","['Perez-Galan, P', 'Marzo, I', 'Giraldo, P', 'Rubio-Felix, D', 'Lasierra, P', 'Larrad, L', 'Anel, A', 'Naval, J']","['Perez-Galan P', 'Marzo I', 'Giraldo P', 'Rubio-Felix D', 'Lasierra P', 'Larrad L', 'Anel A', 'Naval J']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor', 'Caspases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cladribine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Flavoproteins/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402650 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):2106-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402650.,"['0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Flavoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The knowledge about its mode of action, however, is still limited. Here, we investigated the in vitro ability of bendamustine to induce apoptosis on freshly isolated peripheral lymphocytes in B-CLL and analyze the potential underlying mechanisms of action for inducing apoptosis. In CLL cells taken from 37 previously treated and untreated CLL patients, we investigated the influence of bendamustine alone, and in combination with fludarabine, on the induction of apoptosis and changes of Bcl-2 and Bax expression on mRNA and protein level using the RNase protection assay or flow cytometry, respectively. Apoptotic cells were determined with flow cytometry using the fluorescent DNA-binding agent 7-ADD. Using bendamustine alone in concentrations from 1 microg/ml to 50 microg/ml, a dose- and time-dependent manner of cytotoxicity from 30.4% to 94.8% after 48 h could be observed. The LD50 for untreated and pretreated CLL cells was 7.3 or 4.4 microg/ml, respectively. The median apoptotic rate was similar in both groups. The combination of bendamustine with fludarabine led to a highly synergistic effect in inducing apoptosis, which was 150% higher than expected for bendamustine plus fludarabine. The level of the initial Bcl-2 and Bax protein and the m-RNA expression remained unchanged during the incubation with bendamustine. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time the in vitro efficacy of bendamustine in inducing apoptosis in B-CLL cells alone and in combination with fludarabine.","['Schwanen, C', 'Hecker, T', 'Hubinger, G', 'Wolfle, M', 'Rittgen, W', 'Bergmann, L', 'Karakas, T']","['Schwanen C', 'Hecker T', 'Hubinger G', 'Wolfle M', 'Rittgen W', 'Bergmann L', 'Karakas T']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Blotting, Western', 'Flow Cytometry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2001/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402651 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):2096-105. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402651.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, in the current study cytogenetic analyses were performed in 117 patients with AML both at diagnosis and at relapse. Changes in karyotype were observed in 38% (36% of initially normal karyotypes, 39% of initially aberrant karyotypes). An evolution of karyotype, ie the acquisition of further aberrations in addition to those present at diagnosis, occurred more frequently in patients with unfavorable karyotypes at diagnosis as compared to all others (60% vs 32%, P = 0.0095). The duration from initial diagnosis to relapse was significantly shorter in cases with an evolution of the aberrant karyotype as compared to cases with no changes in the aberrant karyotype between diagnosis and relapse or with solely regression of aberrations at relapse (9.2 +/- 4.4 vs14.0 +/- 8.5 months, P = 0.0081). In an additional analysis, another cohort of 120 patients with refractory and relapsed AML who were treated uniformly within the respective trial of the German AML Cooperative Group was analyzed cytogenetically at diagnosis and at relapse to further prove the prognostic impact of karyotype aberrations at relapse. Karyotypes were prognostically favorable, intermediate, unfavorable and not available in 8%, 50%, 17% and 25% at diagnosis and in 8%, 49%, 21% and 22% at relapse, respectively. Karyotype aberrations at diagnosis had no impact on response to therapy (P = 0.32) but influenced survival and event-free survival significantly (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02). In contrast, karyotype aberrations at relapse strongly influenced response to therapy (P = 0.05), survival (P = 0.01), and event-free survival (P = 0.002).

A good control of thrombocytosis was achieved with PI as the only treatment in 106 patients and with HU in 23 patients. Twenty-six patients received no treatment. After a median follow-up of 104 months, seven patients (four treated with HU, and three with PI) developed AML whereas one patient treated with PI developed MDS. A significant difference in progression-free survival was observed between HU- and PI-treated patients (P = 0.004). A short-arm deletion of chromosome 17 was most frequently detected in HU-treated patients, while a long-arm trisomy of chromosome 1 and a monosomy 7q were seen in PI-treated patients. No TP53 mutation was discovered in the six patients studied (two HU-treated and four PI-treated).

Of 298 patients with AML, 40 (13%) had blast cells that contained the t(8;21). This translocation was associated with a high frequency of French-American-British M2 morphology (82%) and the presence of granulocytic sarcoma (23%). Molecular analysis detected the AML1-ETO fusion transcript in all 25 cases with the t(8;21) tested, but failed to identify additional cases with AML1-ETO among the 127 cases with other cytogenetic findings. Compared to patients with other genetic abnormalities, those with the t(8;21) were less likely to have internal tandem duplications of the FLT3 gene (none of 10 vs 16 of 68). The 6-year overall survival estimate was 55% +/- 9% and the event-free survival estimate, 33% +/- 7%. Of the clinical and biological features examined, only gender was prognostically significant: the 6-year overall survival estimate for males was 68% +/- 10%, compared to 33% +/- 11 for female patients (P = 0.03).

Phosphorylation of the IkappaB inhibitors by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex leads to their proteasomal degradation, resulting in activated NF-kappaB. Here, we investigated the activation status of NF-kappaB and the IKK complex in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Gelshift assays revealed an increased level of activated nuclear NF-kappaB in myeloid blasts. Both bone marrow and peripheral blood blasts from AML patients showed enhanced IKK activity relative to controls, whereas the IKK protein concentrations were comparable. In addition, an increased level of IkappaB-alpha was detected in AML blast cells, although this appeared to be insufficient to block nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, also confirmed by immunofluorescence. In subtype M4 and M5 AML cells a more extensive NF-kappaB activation and higher IKK activity was found than in M1/M2 specimens. Isolated AML blasts cultured ex vivo responded to external stimulation (TNF, LPS) by further IKK activation, IkappaB degradation and NF-kappaB activation. Preincubation with the proteasome inhibitor PSI inhibited the NF-kappaB system in isolated AML blasts. This study established for the first time a dysregulation of IKK signaling in AML leading to increased NF-kappaB activity suggesting potential therapeutic avenues.","['Baumgartner, B', 'Weber, M', 'Quirling, M', 'Fischer, C', 'Page, S', 'Adam, M', 'Von Schilling, C', 'Waterhouse, C', 'Schmid, C', 'Neumeier, D', 'Brand, K']","['Baumgartner B', 'Weber M', 'Quirling M', 'Fischer C', 'Page S', 'Adam M', 'Von Schilling C', 'Waterhouse C', 'Schmid C', 'Neumeier D', 'Brand K']","['Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2001/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402641 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):2062-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402641.,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cases were divided into: (i) del(6q) only (n = 6); (ii) del(6q) plus other numerical and/or structural abnormalities (n = 8); (iii) del(6q) and other 'specific' translocations (n = 4). The biologic and clinical features of the patients carrying this anomaly, as well as their outcome, were compared with those of 267 patients without del(6q). A T cell phenotype was more frequently associated with del(6q) cases in general (P = 0.001) and particularly with cases presenting del(6q) as the isolated abnormality (P = 0.0027). No significant difference with respect to multidrug resistance (MDR)/P glycoprotein expression was observed between the two groups of patients (21% vs 28% of MDR-positive cases, respectively). A BCR-ABL fusion transcript was less frequently detected in cases with del(6q) (11%) compared with those without the anomaly (29%). p15 and p16 deletions were identified by Southern blot analysis in 21% of cases with del(6q) and in 26% of cases without del(6q). In this latter group, a T cell phenotype was less frequently associated with p15 and/or p16 deletion than in the group carrying del(6q) (36% vs 100% of cases, P = 0.011). Overall, patients with ALL and del(6q) had a high complete remission (CR) rate (83%); however, they had a lower 18 month event-free survival (31% vs 41%) and a higher relapse rate (70% vs 37%, P = 0.02) compared with patients without del(6q). To date, this is the largest series of adult ALL cases reported with del(6q) homogeneously treated, which have also been prospectively studied for MDR expression and for the detection of known fusion genes. This anomaly, as an isolated change, identifies a subset of cases with hyperleukocytosis (median WBC count 52 x 10(9)/l) and a strict correlation with a T cell phenotype.

HBMS maintained leukemic cells viability in all tested cases (mean viability 85%). Under these culture conditions we noticed upregulation or de novo expression of costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) in 22/22, 15/23 and 21/23 cases, respectively. Upregulation, in terms of fluorescence intensity, was also observed in the expression of MHC I, MHC II, CD54 (ICAM 1) and CD58 (LFA 3) molecules. HBMS alone, although to a lesser extent, was able to induce modulation of these molecules, but not CD80, in a similar proportion of cases. Neither stCD40L nor HBMS induced modulation of CD10 and CD34 molecules. Moreover, in 4/4 tested cases, stCD40L-stimulated ALL cells were able to induce allogeneic T cells proliferation. To evaluate whether leukemia-reactive T cells were detectable in the BM of ALL patients at diagnosis, stCD40L-stimulated ALL cells were co-cultured with autologous T cells (ratio 1:1), isolated from BM at diagnosis, for 4 days and a 24 h ELISPOT assay was applied to detect the presence of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing cells. In four of seven cases IFN-gamma-producing cells were detected with frequencies of 1/900, 1/1560, 1/2150 and 1/1575 autologous T cells. These data confirm that stCD40L exposure can activate the antigen-presenting cell (APC) capacity of BCP-ALL cells cultured on HBMS and that ELISPOT assay can be used to measure the frequency of leukemia-reactive autologous T cells in the BM of ALL patients even after short-term culture with stCD40L-stimulated ALL cells.","['Todisco, E', 'Gaipa, G', 'Biagi, E', 'Bonamino, M', 'Gramigna, R', 'Introna, M', 'Biondi, A']","['Todisco E', 'Gaipa G', 'Biagi E', 'Bonamino M', 'Gramigna R', 'Introna M', 'Biondi A']","['Centro Ricerca M Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2001/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402672 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):2046-54. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402672.,"['147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA from 230 patients was retrospectively analysed by Southern blotting, single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing techniques. The results were correlated with clinical characteristics and outcome. One hundred and ninety-four fully analysed patients, similarly treated using the Nordic NOPHO-86 or the current NOPHO-92 protocols, were included in the outcome analysis. Deletions approached a minimally deleted region between the p16ink4a and p15ink4b genes, making the p14ARF gene the most commonly deleted coding sequence. Bi-allelic deletion was associated with high white blood cell count (WBC) (P < 0.001), T cell phenotype (P < 0.001) and mediastinal mass (P < 0.001). Patients with Ink4 locus bi-allelic deletions had an inferior pEFS (P < 0.01) and multivariate analysis indicated that bi-allelic deletion of the p16ink4a and the p14ARF genes was an independent prognostic risk factor (P < 0.05). Sub-group analysis revealed a pronounced impact of deletion status for high-risk patients, ie with high WBC. Deletion-status and clinical risk criteria (WBC) could thus be combined to further differentiate risk within the high-risk group. The analysis of the Ink4 locus adds independent prognostic information in childhood ALL treated by Nordic protocols and may help in selection of patients for alternative treatment.","['Calero Moreno, T M', 'Gustafsson, G', 'Garwicz, S', 'Grander, D', 'Jonmundsson, G K', 'Frost, B-M', 'Makipernaa, A', 'Rasool, O', 'Savolainen, E-R', 'Schmiegelow, K', 'Soderhall, S', 'Vettenranta, K', 'Wesenberg, F', 'Einhorn, S', 'Heyman, M']","['Calero Moreno TM', 'Gustafsson G', 'Garwicz S', 'Grander D', 'Jonmundsson GK', 'Frost BM', 'Makipernaa A', 'Rasool O', 'Savolainen ER', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Soderhall S', 'Vettenranta K', 'Wesenberg F', 'Einhorn S', 'Heyman M']","['Research Laboratory of Radiumhemmet, CCK Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/*genetics', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2001/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402697 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):2037-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402697.,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to being aberrantly expressed in acute leukemias, activating mutations of the FLT3 gene have been found in patients with AML, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and more rarely, ALL. Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of the FLT3 gene have been detected in 17-34% of patients with AML and portend a poor prognosis for these patients. FLT3 receptors containing ITD mutations (FLT3/ITDs) are constitutively activated in the absence of FLT3 ligand (FL) stimulation leading to the activation of downstream signaling proteins, including ERK and STAT 5. FLT3 activity, therefore, is a logical target for therapeutic intervention. AG1296 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the tyrphostin class that shows inhibitory activity for wild-type FLT3, in addition to the PDGF and c-KIT receptors. We examined the inhibitory effects of AG1296 on FLT3/ITDs isolated from AML patients in the IL-3-dependent cell line, Ba/F3, as well as in primary leukemia samples from AML patients. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that FLT3/ITDs were constitutively phosphorylated in the absence of FL. The auto-phosphorylation of FLT3/ITDs was inhibited by AG1296 with an IC(50) of approximately 1 microM. FLT3/ITDs were associated with constitutive phosphorylation of ERK, STAT 5A, STAT 5B, CBL, VAV and SHP2 in Ba/F3 cells. The phosphorylation of these downstream signaling molecules was suppressed in a dose-responsive fashion by AG1296. AG1296 inhibited IL-3 independent growth and induced apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells transformed by FLT3/ITDs. AG1296 also inhibited FLT3 auto-phosphorylation, and induced a cytotoxic effect, in primary AML cells. These findings suggest that inhibiting the activity of FLT3 may have a therapeutic value in some leukemias expressing FLT3/ITDs.","['Tse, K-F', 'Allebach, J', 'Levis, M', 'Smith, B D', 'Bohmer, F D', 'Small, D']","['Tse KF', 'Allebach J', 'Levis M', 'Smith BD', 'Bohmer FD', 'Small D']","['Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Department of Oncology Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402674 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):2027-36. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402674.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '146535-11-7 (6,7-dimethoxy-3-phenylquinoxaline)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,"['CA70970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA91177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to identify CTL epitopes in the human CD68 protein. Mouse CD68 was also analysed to search for epitopes that could be used in murine tumor model. Peptides binding to murine H2(b) class I molecules were identified and used to stimulate CTL responses from allogeneic donor mice to avoid immunological tolerance. High avidity CTL clones specific for three different peptide epitopes did not kill CD68-expressing murine target cells, indicating that endogenous antigen processing failed to produce sufficient amounts of these peptides. In contrast, allo-restricted human CTL specific for an HLA-A2-binding peptide of CD68 recognised not only picomolar concentrations of peptide, but also displayed low levels of killing against HLA-A2-positive K562 and THP-1 leukemia cell lines and blast cells from AML patients.

Endocrine abnormalities were detected in three patients, the most serious being a severe hypothyroidism, which prompted cessation of IL2 maintenance after 6 years and required thyroid supplementation treatment. Immunological studies were carried out prior to the last IL2 cycle and showed high levels of CD3-positive T cells expressing the IL2 receptor alpha chain (CD25), both in the peripheral blood and in the bone marrow. Our study shows that low-dose IL2 can be given for a prolonged period of time without serious organ-specific late sequelae and with a good quality of life.","['Meloni, G', 'Trisolini, S M', 'Capria, S', 'Torelli, G F', 'Baldacci, E', 'Torromeo, C', 'Valesini, G', 'Mandelli, F']","['Meloni G', 'Trisolini SM', 'Capria S', 'Torelli GF', 'Baldacci E', 'Torromeo C', 'Valesini G', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2001/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402566 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):2016-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402566.,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the proposed mechanisms for this poor overall response is the inability of the immune system to detect and eliminate residual malignant leukemia cells, which subsequently serve as a source of leukemic relapse. This review discusses the rationale of immunotherapy for acute leukemia and presents in vitro and in vivo model systems that were devised for pre-B acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). New advances in the ex vivo manipulation of acute leukemia cells are presented, which attempt to modify these cells into functional antigen-presenting cells. These cells can then be used as autologous vaccines at the time of minimal residual disease after standard chemotherapy, to stimulate host immune responses against their own leukemia cells. The various approaches toward this aim include incubation of leukemia cells with cytokines or growth factors and gene manipulation of these cells. In particular, ex vivo culture of ALL cells with CD40 ligand, incubation of AML cells with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 (GM-CSF/IL-4) and lentiviral transduction of ALL and AML cells for expression of immunomodulators (CD80 and GM-CSF) are current approaches under investigation for the development of autologous acute leukemia cell vaccines.","['Stripecke, R', 'Levine, A M', 'Pullarkat, V', 'Cardoso, A A']","['Stripecke R', 'Levine AM', 'Pullarkat V', 'Cardoso AA']","['Institute for Genetic Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402701 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):1974-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402701.,['0 (Cancer Vaccines)'],90,,"['K01-CA87864-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA6848/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include the potentially devastating coagulopathy, sensitivity to anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens, as well as unique responses to all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide that have revolutionized therapy over the last decade. The chromosomal translocation t(15;17) which generates the PML-RARalpha fusion gene has long been considered the diagnostic hallmark of APL; however, this abnormality is not detected in approximately 10% cases with successful karyotype analysis. In the majority of these cases, the PML-RARalpha fusion gene is still formed, resulting from insertion events or more complex rearrangements. These cases share the beneficial response to retinoids and favorable prognosis of those with documented t(15;17), underscoring the clinical relevance of molecular analyses in diagnostic refinement. In other cases of t(15;17) negative APL, various chromosomal rearrangements involving 17q21 have been documented leading to fusion of RARalpha to alternative partners, namely PLZF, NPM, NuMA and STAT5b. The nature of the fusion partner has a significant bearing upon disease characteristics, including sensitivity to retinoids and arsenic trioxide. APL has provided an exciting treatment model for other forms of AML whereby therapeutic approach is directed towards cytogenetically and molecularly defined subgroups and further modified according to response as determined by minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. Recent studies suggest that rigorous MRD monitoring, coupled with pre-emptive therapy at the point of molecular relapse improves survival in the relatively small subgroup of PML-RARalpha positive patients with 'poor risk' disease. Advent of 'real-time' quantitative RT-PCR technology seems set to yield further improvements in the predictive value of MRD assessment, achieve more rapid sample throughput and facilitate inter- and intra-laboratory standardization, thereby enabling more reliable comparison of data between international trial groups.","['Grimwade, D', 'Lo Coco, F']","['Grimwade D', 'Lo Coco F']","[""Division of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Guy's, King's and St Thomas' School of Medicine, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402721 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):1959-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402721.,,146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary, acquired ATRA resistance occurs in most patients treated with ATRA alone and in many patients who relapse from combination ATRA chemotherapy regimens despite limited ATRA exposure. Although early studies suggested that an adaptive hypercatabolic response to pharmacological ATRA levels is the principal mechanism of ATRA resistance, recent studies suggest that molecular disturbances in APL cells have a predominant role, particularly if disease relapse occurs a few months after discontinuing ATRA therapy. This review summarizes the systemic and APL cellular elements that have been linked to clinical ATRA resistance with emphasis on identifying areas of deficient information and important topics for further investigation. Overall, the subject review strongly supports the hypothesis that, although APL is an infrequent and nearly cured disease, much can be gained by understanding the complex relationship of ATRA resistance to the progression and relapse of APL, which has important implications for other leukemias and malignancies.","['Gallagher, R E']",['Gallagher RE'],"['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, New York 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402719 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):1940-58. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402719.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",195,,['CA56771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A main model proposed for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is that PML-RARalpha exerts its oncogenic effects by repressing retinoic acid-inducible genes critical to myeloid differentiation. Dysregulation of these genes may result in abnormal signaling, thereby freeing pre-leukemic cells from controls which normally induce the onset of differentiation. It is also likely that treatment of APL cells by retinoic acid induces de novo up-regulation of the same genes which are dominantly repressed by PML-RARalpha and whose expression is required for reactivation of the differentiation program.

Models to explain the origin of this leukemia propose a block in cell differentiation due to aberrant repression of retinoic acid responsive genes and/or disruption of the function of the PML-containing nuclear bodies. Recently, PML has been identified as a regulator of replicative senescence and the premature senescence that occurs in response to oncogenic ras. This review discusses the idea that senescence is a general tumor suppressor mechanism related to terminal differentiation and disrupted during the establishment of APL and other cancers. According to this idea the PML-RARalpha fusion protein promotes leukemogenesis not only through repression of retinoic acid responsive genes, but also by way of interfering with several tumor suppressor proteins that cooperate to establish senescence.

However, both PML and PML nuclear bodies are disrupted in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The treatment of APL patients with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) results in clinical remission associated with blast cell differentiation and reformation of the PML nuclear bodies. These observations imply that the structural integrity of the PML nuclear body is critically important for normal cellular functions. Indeed, PML protein is a negative growth regulator capable of causing growth arrest in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle, transformation suppression, senescence and apoptosis. These PML-mediated, physiological effects can be readily demonstrated. However, a discrete biochemical and molecular model of PML function has yet to be defined.

The purpose of this review is to simplify this confusing field of research by using strict criteria to deduce which models of PML body function are well supported.","['Strudwick, S', 'Borden, K L B']","['Strudwick S', 'Borden KL']","['Structural Biology Program, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York University, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['DNA Repair/physiology', 'DNA Replication/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2001/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402724 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):1906-17. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402724.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",151,,"['CA 80728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 88991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies with knock out mice indicate that retinoic acid receptor activity is not essential for normal hematopoiesis, but both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that these receptors may be important modifiers/regulators of different myeloid precursors/ progenitors including the primitive transplantable stem cell. A number of target genes have been identified that are either directly or indirectly regulated by RA receptors and which likely play important roles in the retinoid-mediated regulation of myelopoiesis. Several in vitro models of hematopoiesis suggest that the transcriptional activity of RA receptors is developmentally regulated during different stages of myelopoiesis. This regulation might involve non-ligand mediated molecular events that alter the interaction of RA receptors with transcriptional corepressor complexes. Moreover, the interaction of RA receptors with other families of transcription factors expressed in different hematopoietic lineages might also account for differential RA receptor activity at different stages of myelopoiesis.","['Collins, S J']",['Collins SJ'],"['Human Biology Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,['Leukemia. 2002 Oct;16(10):1893-5.

Bone loss is among the long-term adverse effects of this procedure. The underlying pathophysiology is believed to be multifactorial. We report a case of osteoporosis in a young patient who underwent allogenic bone marrow transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia that was complicated by intestinal graft-versus- host disease. Her bone density measurement showed T-scores of -3.46 and -2.47 in the lumbar spine and femoral neck respectively. On evaluation, she had low normal serum calcium, low urine calcium, low 25- hydroxyvitamin D, elevated total and bone specific alkaline phosphatases, and elevated parathyroid hormone. Following treatment with calcifediol, the biochemical markers normalized and the bone mineral density increased by 88% in the lumbar spine and almost 60% in the femoral neck, both of which were above the mean for her age group.

In contrast, no pachytene cells were detected in cultures of 13 dpc ovaries without GFs. After 3 days in culture with GFs, 38% of germ cells from 14 dpc ovaries were at pachytene compared with 19% without GFs. In conclusion, we have demonstrated positive effects of GFs upon oocyte formation by meiosis in vitro.

Comparative binding studies using recombinant E2 from the most prevalent 1a and 1b genotypes revealed that E2 recognition by hepatoma cells is independent from the viral isolate, while E2-CD81 interaction is isolate specific. Binding of soluble E2 to human hepatoma cells was impaired by deletion of the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1), but the wild-type phenotype was recovered by introducing a compensatory mutation reported previously to rescue infectivity of an HVR1-deleted HCV infectious clone. We have identified the receptor responsible for E2 binding to human hepatic cells as the human scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). E2-SR-BI interaction is very selective since neither mouse SR-BI nor the closely related human scavenger receptor CD36, were able to bind E2. Finally, E2 recognition by SR-BI was competed out in an isolate-specific manner both on the hepatoma cell line and on the human SR-BI-transfected cell line by an anti-HVR1 monoclonal antibody.","['Scarselli, Elisa', 'Ansuini, Helenia', 'Cerino, Raffaele', 'Roccasecca, Rosa Maria', 'Acali, Stefano', 'Filocamo, Gessica', 'Traboni, Cinzia', 'Nicosia, Alfredo', 'Cortese, Riccardo', 'Vitelli, Alessandra']","['Scarselli E', 'Ansuini H', 'Cerino R', 'Roccasecca RM', 'Acali S', 'Filocamo G', 'Traboni C', 'Nicosia A', 'Cortese R', 'Vitelli A']","['Istituto di Ricerche di Biologia Molecolare P.Angeletti (IRBM), Via Pontina Km 30.600, 00040 Pomezia (Rome), Italy. elisa_scarselli@merck.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'CD36 Antigens/*physiology', 'CHO Cells', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hepacivirus/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', '*Receptors, Immunologic', 'Receptors, Lipoprotein/physiology', 'Receptors, Scavenger', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class B', 'Tetraspanin 28', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/10/03 04:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/10/03 04:00'],"['2002/10/03 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/cdf529 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2002 Oct 1;21(19):5017-25. doi: 10.1093/emboj/cdf529.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (CD81 protein, human)', '0 (Cd81 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Lipoprotein)', '0 (Receptors, Scavenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SCARB1 protein, human)', '0 (Scarb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class B)', '0 (Tetraspanin 28)']",,,,PMC129051,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously defined the molecular nature of the B cell lineage-specific mHag HB-1. The CTL epitope was identified as the decamer peptide EEKRGSLHVW presented in the context of HLA-B44. The HB-1 antigen is encoded by a locus of yet unknown function on chromosome 5q32. A single nucleotide polymorphism within this locus results in an amino acid change from histidine (H) to tyrosine (Y) at position P8 within the CTL epitope. Based on genomic information, we have developed a PCR-RFLP assay to perform HB-1 typing at the DNA level. We determined that the allelic frequency for the H and Y variant is 0.79 and 0.21, respectively. From these data, we calculated that the expected recipient disparity between HLA-B44-matched sibling pairs for HB-1H is 2.8%, whereas recipient disparity for HB-1Y is expected to be 12.4%. Therefore, we addressed whether the HB-1Y peptide is reciprocally immunogenic. We revealed that both peptide variants bind equally efficient to HLA-B44 molecules and that the H/Y substitution has no influence on formation of epitope precursor peptides by 20 S proteasome-mediated degradation. More directly, CTL recognizing the naturally presented HB-1Y peptide could be generated from a HB-1H homozygous donor using peptide-pulsed dendritic cells. Using a set of synthetic structurally related peptide variants, we found that the H/Y substitution has a major impact on TCR recognition by CTL specific for either of the HB-1 allelic homologues. HB-1 is the first human mHag described that induces bi-directional allogeneic CTL responses that may contribute to a specific graft-versus-leukemia response following allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Dolstra, Harry', 'de Rijke, Bjorn', 'Fredrix, Hanny', 'Balas, Antonio', 'Maas, Frans', 'Scherpen, Frank', 'Aviles, Maria J', 'Vicario, Jose L', 'Beekman, Nico J', 'Ossendorp, Ferry', 'de Witte, Theo M', 'van de Wiel-van Kemenade, Elly']","['Dolstra H', 'de Rijke B', 'Fredrix H', 'Balas A', 'Maas F', 'Scherpen F', 'Aviles MJ', 'Vicario JL', 'Beekman NJ', 'Ossendorp F', 'de Witte TM', 'van de Wiel-van Kemenade E']","['Central Hematology Laboratory, University Medical Center St. Radboud, Geert Grooteplein 8, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands. h.dolstra@chl.azn.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,,"['*Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/physiology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genetic Structures', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/chemistry/*genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multienzyme Complexes/physiology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2002/10/02 04:00,2002/11/28 04:00,['2002/10/02 04:00'],"['2002/10/02 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/02 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1521-4141(2002010)32:10<2748::AID-IMMU2748>3.0.CO;2-T [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2002 Oct;32(10):2748-58. doi: 10.1002/1521-4141(2002010)32:10<2748::AID-IMMU2748>3.0.CO;2-T.,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the cellular level FA is characterized by increased sensitivity to agents forming interstrand crosslinks (ICL) in DNA. Six FA genes have been cloned and interactions among individual FANC proteins have been found. The FANCD2 protein co-localizes in nuclear foci with the BRCA1 protein following DNA damage and during S-phase, requiring the FANCA, C, E and G proteins to do so. This finding may reflect a direct role for the BRCA1 protein in double strand break (DSB) repair and interaction with the FANC proteins. Therefore interactions between BRCA1 and the FANC proteins were investigated. Among the known FANC proteins, we find evidence for direct interaction only between the FANCA protein and BRCA1. The evidence rests on three different tests: yeast two-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation from in vitro synthesis, and coimmunoprecipitation from cell extracts. The amino terminal portion of FANCA and the central part (aa 740-1083) of BRCA1 contain the sites of interaction. The interaction does not depend on DNA damage, thus FANCA and BRCA1 are constitutively interacting. The demonstrated interaction directly connects BRCA1 to the FA pathway of DNA repair.","['Folias, Alexandra', 'Matkovic, Mara', 'Bruun, Donald', 'Reid, Sonja', 'Hejna, James', 'Grompe, Markus', ""D'Andrea, Alan"", 'Moses, Robb']","['Folias A', 'Matkovic M', 'Bruun D', 'Reid S', 'Hejna J', 'Grompe M', ""D'Andrea A"", 'Moses R']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,IM,,"['BRCA1 Protein/*metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2002/10/02 04:00,2003/03/18 04:00,['2002/10/02 04:00'],"['2002/10/02 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/02 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/hmg/11.21.2591 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2002 Oct 1;11(21):2591-7. doi: 10.1093/hmg/11.21.2591.,"['0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FANCA protein, human)', '0 (FANCD2 protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)']",,,"['P01 HL48546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01HL54785/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK43889/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL52725/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we have previously shown that this enzyme triggers 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced growth inhibition in human breast cancer cells. The present study addresses the role of PTPL1/FAP-1 in antiestrogen-regulated apoptotic effect and insulin-like growth factor-I survival action in MCF7 cells and further identifies the impacted signaling pathway. By terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling and cytoplasmic nucleosome enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we demonstrated that 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced apoptosis was totally lost in PTPL1/FAP-1 antisense transfectants in which enzyme expression was abrogated, revealing the crucial role of this phosphatase in the apoptotic process in human breast cancer cells. Time-dependent expression of PTPL1/FAP-1 in MCF7 cells completely abolished the survival action of insulin-like growth factor-I. This effect occurred through a highly significant reduction in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway activation (80% reduction in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, 55% inhibition of Akt activation) accompanied by a 65% decrease in insulin receptor substrate-1 growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. These results provide the first evidence that PTPL1/FAP-1 has a key role in the apoptotic process in human breast cancer cells independent of Fas but associated with an early inhibition of the insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Our data therefore suggest new therapeutic routes and strengthen the importance of identifying endogenous regulators and substrates of this phosphatase in breast tumors.","['Bompard, Guillaume', 'Puech, Carole', 'Prebois, Christine', 'Vignon, Francoise', 'Freiss, Gilles']","['Bompard G', 'Puech C', 'Prebois C', 'Vignon F', 'Freiss G']","['Inserm, Unit 540, Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology of Cancers, 60 rue de Navacelles, 34090 Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20020926,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 13', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2002/10/02 04:00,2003/02/05 04:00,['2002/10/02 04:00'],"['2002/10/02 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/10/02 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M208950200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71530-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Dec 6;277(49):47861-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M208950200.

The characteristics and classification of atypical immunophenotypes are not unified and the clinical significance is not yet fully described. The purpose of the study was: precise description of atypical immunophenotypes and analysis of their frequency in different types of acute leukaemia, analysis of association between expression of atypical immunophenotypes and the level of initial leukocytosis, percentage of blast cells in peripheral blood, expression of CD34, analysis of frequency of multidrug resistance molecule (MDR) expression and association between MDR and immunophenotypes of leukaemia cells, analysis of association between atypical immunophenotypes and proliferation, secretion of cytokines (IL-6, TNF) and spontaneous apoptosis of leukaemia cells, analysis of association between atypical immunophenotypes and sensitivity to induction therapy. The bone marrow samples used for routine diagnosis were the basic source of leukaemia cells for the study. The morphological examination and the immunophenotypes of leukaemia cells were done for classification of leukaemia. The immunophenotype and the expression of MDR determination was performed with flow cytometry after staining the cells with monoclonal antibodies (directly labelled) for CD determinants and MDR. The spontaneous proliferation of leukaemia cells was studied with 3H-Thymidine uptake after 3-days culture in vitro. The type of proliferation (autocrine, paracrine) was defined based on comparison of shorter (3-days) and longer (6-days) culture of leukaemia cells. The percentage of apoptotic leukaemia cells was analysed with flow cytometry after staining of leukaemia cells with propidium iodide in subdiploidal region of DNA profile. The secretion of cytokines (IL-6 and TNF) was determined by ELISA technique in supernatants of leukaemia cells cultured for 24 hr in vitro. The biological activity of TNF was determined in the bioassay using L929 mouse cells line. The effect of induction therapy was estimated base on time of cytoreduction in peripheral blood and time of reaching the haematological remission in bone marrow. The study included 230 children with acute leukaemia: lymphoblastic (ALL)--189 children (ALL-proB--19, common ALL--139, ALL-B--5 and ALL-T--26) and myeloid (AML)--34 children. Moreover, into the study 2 cases of acute undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) and 3--acute mixed lineage leukaemia (AMLL) and 2--biphenotypic leukaemia were included. The all studies of leukaemia cells had been done before the therapy was installed. Basing on the assay of immunophenotypes the following forms of atypical immunophenotypes were distinguished: immunophenotype incomplete, hyperexpression of determinants, asynchronic immunophenotype, coexpression of determinants from the other line than origin of leukaemia cells, balanced expression of determinants from two cells lines (biphenotypic leukaemia) and three cells lines (mixed lineage leukaemia). The atypical immunophenotypes were observed in: 21.1% ALL-proB cases, 34.5% common ALL cases, 42.3% ALL-T and 58.8% AML. The most common form of atypical immunophenotypes was coexpression of determinants from the other cell line. There were no associations between atypical immunophenotypes and the level of initial leukocytosis and percentage of blast cells in peripheral blood. The expression of CD34, recognised as the one of markers of poorer prognosis, was analysed regarding the leukaemia type and immunophenotype of leukaemia cells. The lowest frequency of CD34 expression was noted in ALL-T (28.5%), the highest one in common ALL (62.3%). The significant association between frequency of CD34 and atypical immunophenotypes was observed in AML and ALL-T. Moreover, in common ALL the expression of CD34 was significantly higher when myeloid determinants were present on common ALL cells (common ALL + My) in comparison to coexpression of lymphoid determinants (common ALL + Ly). The frequency of MDR expression (cases with more than 10% of MDR positive cells) was in range between 16.6% in ALL-proB and 78.9% in AML. The mean percentage of cells expressing MDR was low in ALL-proB (10.7%) and high in ALL-T (39.6%). In ALL the atypical immunophenotype was associated with expression of MDR whereas in AML this association did not appear. The common ALL + My leukaemia cells showed higher ability to proliferation in vitro compare with common ALL without atypical immunophenotype. The opposite results were observed in AML. AML leukaemia cells with coexpression of lymphoid determinants (AML + Ly) showed lower proliferation in vitro than AML without atypical immunophenotype. The autocrine type of proliferation was observed frequently in AML (35.3% of cases) than in ALL (14.2%). This type of spontaneous proliferation was observed only when the leukaemia cells without changes in immunophenotype had been cultured. The low level in common ALL and high in AML of spontaneous release of IL-6 and TNF were noted. AML leukaemia cells without changes in immunophenotype released significantly higher amount of these cytokines than AML cells with atypical immunophenotypes (AML + Ly). The above observations suggested that coexpression of myeloid determinants in ALL and lymphoid determinants in AML were leading to changes of some biological properties of these cells. The ALL + My leukaemia cells behaved similarly to myeloid leukaemia cells, while AML + Ly cells showed features of lymphoid leukaemia cells. The common ALL and AML leukaemia cells with atypical immunophenotype showed higher percentage of apoptotic cells (16.1% and 16.9% respectively) comparing to common ALL and AML without changes in immunophenotype (9.0% and 9.2% respectively). The weak negative association of MDR expression and apoptosis suggested the indirect inhibiting influence of MDR on ability of cells to undergo into the apoptosis process. In common ALL and AML with typical immunophenotype of leukaemia cells and ALL-T the level of apoptosis was associated positively with the spontaneous proliferation, whereas this relation was negative in AML with atypical immunophenotype. There were no differences of the time of cytoreduction of leukaemia cells in peripheral blood in B cell origin ALL and AML with or without changes in immunophenotype of blastic cells. In ALL-T + My the time of cytoreduction was significantly longer. However, the expression of CD10 in ALL-T had no effect on cytoreduction time. The expression of MDR in ALL-T with typical immunophenotype was independent marker associated with elongation of cytoreduction time. The time of reaching the complete haematological remission was analysed in 186 children with ALL (ALL-proB--18 children, common ALL--137 children, ALL-T--26) and only 19 children with AML. The longest period of time for reaching the remission was observed in AML, shortest--in ALL-T. In common ALL and ALL-T the expression of myeloid determinants was associated with significant elongation of time of reaching the remission. In the majority of AML cases with coexpression lymphoid determinants, the complete remission was reached. The time needed for the reaching of remission was similar in AML with or without coexpression of lymphoid determinants. The results of this study suggest that coexpression of determinants from the other cell line modify the biological properties of leukaemia cells into the cells from the line of origin of these additional determinants. In ALL the combined expression of MDR and atypical immunophenotype of leukaemia cells were associated with poorer response to induction therapy. In AML the combined expression of CD34 and atypical immunophenotype were associated with response to induction therapy by reaching the complete remission, but without any influence on the time of reaching this remission. The results of analysis of cytoreduction time and time of reaching the remission improved the usefulness of these parameters for the estimation of response to the induction therapy. The clinical importance of these observations consist in characterisation of leukaemia cells potentially resistant to the induction therapy what may suggest the modification and individualization of the induction therapy.","['Pituch-Noworolska, A']",['Pituch-Noworolska A'],"['Katedra Immunologii Klinicznej i Patologii Zaklad Immunologii Klinicznej Polsko-Amerykanskiego Instytutu Pediatrii Wydzialu Lekarskiego, ul.

Serum NSE values were measured using a radioimmunoassay in 35 patients (acute type, n = 15; lymphoma type, n = 10; chronic type, n = 10) and in 7 controls carrying T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1).

Contrary to previous findings demonstrating that 20% of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) had positive serum NSE, the frequency of a high NSE value in patients with acute and lymphoma type ATL was much higher (60% and 50%, respectively). The serum NSE value positively correlated with serum thymidine kinase activity (TK) and serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels (P < 0.04 and P < 0.01, respectively). Serum NSE values at the initial diagnosis were adversely related to overall survival time according to the log-rank test (P < 0.02). Pathological examinations demonstrated that both patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma type ATL had cytoplasmic NSE and CD30 markers on cell membranes. These findings suggest that serum NSE is partially produced by ATL cells and that ATL tumor cells seem preferentially produce NSE compared with other NHL cells.

To characterize better the parental NB4 cell line and four ATRA-resistant subclones (NB4-R4, NB4-A1, NB4-B1, and NB4-007/6), we have performed both conventional and 24-color FISH karyotyping. Thus, we could identify all chromosomal abnormalities including marker chromosomes that were unclassified with R banding. Moreover, we have performed dual-color FISH by use of specific PML and RARA probes, to evaluate the number of copies for each gene and fusion gene. Interestingly, the number of copies of PML, RARA, and fusion genes was different for each cell line. Finally, we assessed the presence of the PML, RARA, PML/RARA, and RARA/PML transcripts by RT-PCR and of the PML/RARA and RARA proteins by Western blotting in all the cell lines.

Here we report the effect of Avemar on Jurkat leukemia cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and the activity of key glycolytic/pentose cycle enzymes that control carbon flow for nucleic acid synthesis. The cytotoxic IC(50) concentration of Avemar for Jurkat tumor cells is 0.2 mg/ml, and increasing doses of the crude powder inhibit Jurkat cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. At concentrations higher than 0.2 mg/ml, Avemar inhibits cell growth by more than 50% (72 h of incubation), which is preceded by the appearance of a sub-G(1) peak on flow histograms at 48 h. Laser scanning cytometry of propidium iodide- and annexin V-stained cells indicated that the growth-inhibiting effect of Avemar was consistent with a strong induction of apoptosis. Inhibition by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone of apoptosis but increased proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) indicate caspases mediate the cellular effects of Avemar.

METHODS: The records from 1991-2000 inclusive were reviewed to derive those adolescent patients who were unable to produce semen for cryopreservation prior to undergoing treatment for a malignant condition. RESULTS: During the study period 238 adolescents attended our unit of whom 205 (86.1%) banked semen ('producers'). The remaining 33 adolescents (13.9%) were initially unable to produce a sample ('non-producers'), four of these provided a urine specimen for analysis (12.1%) and of these one had sufficient sperm for cryopreservation. Of the 'accompanied' patients 29.7% (19/64) were non-producers while in the 'unaccompanied' patients only 8.0% (14/174) were non-producers (chi(2) = 16.58, P < 0.001). The relative risk (RR) of not producing a semen sample for the accompanied group of patients was greater than that for the unaccompanied group (RR = 3.689, 95% confidence interval: 2.0-6.9). One patient returning alone successfully provided a semen sample for storage. CONCLUSION: Units should consider the effect of the presence of an accompanying person when an adolescent is unable to produce a semen sample and should consider requesting urine to retrieve sperm.","['Bahadur, G', 'Ling, K L E', 'Hart, R', 'Ralph, D', 'Riley, V', 'Wafa, R', 'Ashraf, A', 'Jaman, N', 'Oyede, A W']","['Bahadur G', 'Ling KL', 'Hart R', 'Ralph D', 'Riley V', 'Wafa R', 'Ashraf A', 'Jaman N', 'Oyede AW']","['Royal Free and University College Medical School, Department of Obstetrics Gynaecology, Fertility and Reproductive Medicine Laboratories, University College Hospitals Trust, 88-96 Chenies Mews, London WC1E 6HX, UK. g.bahadur@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Cryopreservation', '*Fertility', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/etiology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Osteosarcoma/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/therapy', '*Semen Preservation', '*Specimen Handling', 'Sperm Count', 'Sperm Motility', 'Urine/cytology']",2002/09/28 04:00,2003/03/05 04:00,['2002/09/28 04:00'],"['2002/09/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/humrep/17.10.2654 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2002 Oct;17(10):2654-6. doi: 10.1093/humrep/17.10.2654.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acquired resistance is typically associated with reactivation of BCR-ABL due to kinase domain mutations or gene amplification, indicating that BCR-ABL remains a viable target for inhibition in these patients. Strategies for overcoming resistance can be envisioned through exploitation of other molecular features of the BCR-ABL protein, such as its dependence on the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). To determine whether inhibition of Hsp90 could induce degradation of imatinib mesylate-resistant, mutant BCR-ABL proteins, hematopoietic cells expressing 2 mutant BCR-ABL proteins found in imatinib mesylate-resistant patients (T315I and E255K) were examined for sensitivity to geldanamycin and 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG).

Rare reports have suggested that WM sometimes is associated with 14q23 translocations, deletions of 6q, and t(11;18)(q21;q21). We tested for these abnormalities in the clonal cells of WM patients. We selected patients with clinicopathologic diagnosis of WM (all had IgM levels greater than 1.5 g/dL). Southern blot assay was used to detect legitimate and illegitimate IgH switch rearrangements. In addition to conventional cytogenetic (CC) and multicolor metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) analyses, we used interphase FISH to screen for t(9;14)(p13;q32) and other IgH translocations, t(11;18)(q21;q21), and 6q21 deletions.

Here, we report a novel murine model system for APL, based on the transduction of purified murine hematopoietic progenitors (lin(-)) using high-titer retroviral vectors encoding promyelocytic leukemia-RAR (PML-RAR), and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker. PML-RAR-expressing lin(-) cells were impaired in their ability to undergo terminal myeloid differentiation and showed increased proliferative potential in vitro. Inoculation of transduced lin(-) cells into syngeneic, irradiated mice resulted in the development of retinoic acid-sensitive promyelocytic leukemias at high frequency (> 80%) and short latency (approximately 4 months). Morphologic and immunophenotypic analysis revealed no gross abnormalities of the preleukemic bone marrows. However, hematopoietic progenitors from PML-RAR preleukemic mice showed a severe impairment in their ability to undergo myeloid differentiation in vitro. This result, together with the monoclonality or oligoclonality of the leukemic blasts, supports a ""multiple-hit"" model, where the fusion protein causes a ""preleukemic"" phase, and leukemia occurs after additional genetic lesions. This model system faithfully reproduces the main characteristics of human APL and represents a versatile tool for the in vitro and in vivo study of mechanisms of leukemogenesis and the design of protocols for differentiation treatment.","['Minucci, Saverio', 'Monestiroli, Silvia', 'Giavara, Sabrina', 'Ronzoni, Simona', 'Marchesi, Francesco', 'Insinga, Alessandra', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Gasparini, Patrizia', 'Capillo, Manuela', 'Colombo, Emanuela', 'Matteucci, Cristian', 'Contegno, Francesco', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Scanziani, Eugenio', 'Gobbi, Alberto', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe']","['Minucci S', 'Monestiroli S', 'Giavara S', 'Ronzoni S', 'Marchesi F', 'Insinga A', 'Diverio D', 'Gasparini P', 'Capillo M', 'Colombo E', 'Matteucci C', 'Contegno F', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Scanziani E', 'Gobbi A', 'Pelicci PG']","['European Institute of Oncology, Department of Experimental Oncology, Milan, Italy. sminucci@ieo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Hematopoiesis/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",2002/09/28 04:00,2002/12/06 04:00,['2002/09/28 04:00'],"['2002/09/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2001-11-0089 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50964-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Oct 15;100(8):2989-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2001-11-0089.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,['TGM06S01/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although IL-3Ralpha chain was scarcely expressed in most patients with T-ALL, it was overexpressed in 40% and 45% of patients with B-ALL and AML, respectively, compared with the levels observed in normal CD34(+) progenitors. The biological and clinical significance of this overexpression pattern was investigated in AML. At the biological level, elevated IL-3Ralpha expression was associated with peculiar properties of leukemic blasts, specifically in 3 areas. First, in all patients the blasts expressing elevated IL-3Ralpha levels exhibited higher cycling activity and increased resistance to apoptosis triggered by growth factor deprivation. Second, spontaneous signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) phosphorylation was observed in 13% of AML patients, all pertaining to the group of patients exhibiting high IL-3Ralpha expression. Third, following IL-3 treatment, Stat5 was activated at higher levels in blasts with elevated IL-3Ralpha expression. At the clinical level, a significant correlation was observed between the level of IL-3Ralpha expression and the number of leukemic blasts at diagnosis, and patients exhibiting elevated IL-3Ralpha levels had a lower complete remission rate and survival duration than those showing normal IL-3Ralpha levels. These findings suggest that in AML, deregulated expression of IL-3Ralpha may contribute to the proliferative advantage of the leukemic blasts and, hence, to a poor prognosis.","['Testa, Ugo', 'Riccioni, Roberta', 'Militi, Stefania', 'Coccia, Eliana', 'Stellacci, Emilia', 'Samoggia, Paola', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Mariani, Gualtiero', 'Rossini, Annalisa', 'Battistini, Angela', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Peschle, Cesare']","['Testa U', 'Riccioni R', 'Militi S', 'Coccia E', 'Stellacci E', 'Samoggia P', 'Latagliata R', 'Mariani G', 'Rossini A', 'Battistini A', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Peschle C']","['Departments of Hematology and Oncology, Virology, and Immunology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy. u.testa@ticali.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Apoptosis', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/28 04:00,2002/12/06 04:00,['2002/09/28 04:00'],"['2002/09/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-03-0852 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50963-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Oct 15;100(8):2980-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-03-0852.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This disease is not characterized by highly proliferative cells but rather by the presence of leukemic cells with significant resistance to apoptosis and, therefore, prolonged survival. B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) is a newly identified tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member shown to be critical for maintenance of normal B-cell development and homeostasis and it shares significant homology with another TNF superfamily member, APRIL. The striking effects of BLyS on normal B-cell maintenance and survival raises the possibility that it may be involved in pathogenesis and maintenance of hematologic malignancies, including B-CLL. In this study, we investigated the status of APRIL and BLyS expression, as well as their receptors, in this disease. All B-CLL patient cells studied expressed one or more of 3 known receptors for BLyS; however, the pattern of expression was variable. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that B-CLL cells from a subset of patients aberrantly express BLyS and APRIL mRNA, whereas these molecules were not detectable in normal B cells. Furthermore, we provide in vitro evidence that BLyS protects B-CLL cells from apoptosis and enhances cell survival. Because these molecules are key regulators of B-cell homeostasis and tumor progression, leukemic cell autocrine expression of BLyS and APRIL may be playing an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease.","['Novak, Anne J', 'Bram, Richard J', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Jelinek, Diane F']","['Novak AJ', 'Bram RJ', 'Kay NE', 'Jelinek DF']","['Departments of Immunology, Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, and Internal Medicine, Mayo Graduate and Medical Schools, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/28 04:00,2002/12/06 04:00,['2002/09/28 04:00'],"['2002/09/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0558 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50962-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Oct 15;100(8):2973-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0558.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (BLyS receptor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF13C protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,"['CA09441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62228/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most anticancer agents function through induction of apoptosis, and therefore resistance against these agents is likely to be caused by selection for CLL cells with defects in the particular apoptosis pathway that is triggered by these drugs. Anticancer agents that function through alternative apoptotic pathways might therefore be useful in treating chemo-resistant CLL. Triterpenoids represent a class of naturally occurring and synthetic compounds with demonstrated antitumor activity. We examined the effects of CDDO (triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid) on CLL B cells in vitro. CDDO induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in all (n = 30) CLL samples tested, including previously untreated and chemo-resistant CLL specimens. CDDO induced rapid proteolytic processing of caspase-8, but not caspase-9, in CLL B cells, suggesting activation of a mitochondria-independent pathway. CDDO-induced apoptosis of CLL B cells was blocked by cytokine response modifier A (CrmA), a suppressor of caspase-8, but not by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein-baculovirus IAP repeat-3 (XIAP-BIR3), a fragment of XIAP, which selectively inhibits caspase-9. Examination of CDDO effects on expression of several apoptosis-relevant genes demonstrated significant reductions in the levels of caspase-8 homolog Fas-ligand interleukin-1-converting enzyme (FLICE)-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), an endogenous antagonist of caspase-8. However, reductions of FLIP achieved by FLIP antisense oligonucleotides were insufficient for triggering apoptosis, indicating that CDDO has other targets in CLL B cells besides FLIP. These data suggest that the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO should be further explored as a possible therapeutic agent for treatment of chemo-resistant CLL.","['Pedersen, Irene M', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Schimmer, Aaron', 'Kim, Youngsoo', 'Zapata, Juan M', 'Charboneau, Lula', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Bennett, Frank', 'Sporn, Michael B', 'Liotta, Lance D', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Reed, John C']","['Pedersen IM', 'Kitada S', 'Schimmer A', 'Kim Y', 'Zapata JM', 'Charboneau L', 'Rassenti L', 'Andreeff M', 'Bennett F', 'Sporn MB', 'Liotta LD', 'Kipps TJ', 'Reed JC']","['The Burnham Institute and University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'Caspases/blood', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nitric Oxide/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/toxicity']",2002/09/28 04:00,2002/12/06 04:00,['2002/09/28 04:00'],"['2002/09/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-04-1174 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50961-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Oct 15;100(8):2965-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-04-1174.,"['0 (2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,"['CA-78814/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high prevalence of this activating mutation makes it a potential target for molecularly based therapy. Indolinone tyrosine kinase inhibitors have known activity against KIT, another member of the type III RTK family. Given the conserved homology between members of this family, we postulated that the activity of some KIT inhibitors would extend to FLT3. We used various leukemic cell lines (BaF3, MV 4-11, RS 4;11) to test the activity of indolinone compounds against the FLT3 kinase activity of both wild-type (WT) and ITD isoforms. Both SU5416 and SU5614 were capable of inhibiting autophosphorylation of ITD and WT FLT3 (SU5416 concentration that inhibits 50% [IC(50)], 100 nM; and SU5614 IC(50) 10 nM). FLT3-dependent activation of the downstream signaling proteins mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) was also inhibited by treatment in the same concentration ranges. FLT3 inhibition by SU5416 and SU5614 resulted in reduced proliferation (IC(50), 250 nM and 100 nM, respectively) and induction of apoptosis of FLT3 ITD-positive leukemic cell lines. Treatment of these cells with an alternative growth factor (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) restored MAPK signaling and cellular proliferation, demonstrating specificity of the observed inhibitory effects. We conclude that SU5416 and SU5614 are potent inhibitors of FLT3. Our finding that inhibition of FLT3 induces apoptosis of leukemic cells supports the feasibility of targeting FLT3 as a novel treatment strategy for AML.","['Yee, Kevin W H', ""O'Farrell, Anne Marie"", 'Smolich, Beverly D', 'Cherrington, Julie M', 'McMahon, Gerald', 'Wait, Cecily L', 'McGreevey, Laura S', 'Griffith, Diana J', 'Heinrich, Michael C']","['Yee KW', ""O'Farrell AM"", 'Smolich BD', 'Cherrington JM', 'McMahon G', 'Wait CL', 'McGreevey LS', 'Griffith DJ', 'Heinrich MC']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, and Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Portland, OR 97201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Exons', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/09/28 04:00,2002/12/06 04:00,['2002/09/28 04:00'],"['2002/09/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0531 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50958-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Oct 15;100(8):2941-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0531.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SU 5614)', '71IA9S35AJ (Semaxinib)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the KT-1/A3 cell line, in which constitutive expression of SOCS3 is barely detectable, is sensitive to IFN-alpha treatment. Forced expression of SOCS3 in the KT-1/A3 cell line confers resistance to IFN-alpha treatment. Furthermore, most of the blast cells from patients in CML blast crisis, which are usually resistant to IFN-alpha therapy, showed constitutive expression of SOCS3.

We now describe our studies examining the effects of CD437 and a nonretinoidal analog (MM002) on the in vitro proliferation of the ALL-REH cell line, the in vitro and in vivo growth of a novel Epstein-Barr virus-negative (EBV(-)) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cell line (WSU-CLL), and primary cultures of human B-CLL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. CD437 and MM002 induce apoptosis in both cell lines, as indicated by the activation of caspase-2 and caspase-3, cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) (poly(ADP-ribose)) polymerase, increase in annexin V binding, and subsequent nuclear fragmentation. CD437-mediated apoptosis was not associated with the modulation of Bcl-2, Bax, or Mcl-1 levels, but was associated with the cleavage of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-X(L) to a proapoptotic 18-kD form. This cleavage of Bcl-X(L) was dependent on caspase-3 activation since Bcl-X(L) cleavage and apoptosis were inhibited by the caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DVED-fmk. CD437 markedly inhibited the growth of WSU-CLL cells in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Tumor growth inhibition, growth delay, and log cell kill were 85.7%, 21 days, and 2.1, respectively, in the treated mice. Moreover, 1 of the 5 treated mice was tumor-free longer than 150 days and thus was considered cured. Exposure of primary cultures of both B-CLL and ALL cells obtained from patients to CD437 and MM002 resulted in their apoptosis.

We previously reported that CD47 engagement by CD47 mAb or thrombospondin induced caspase-independent cell death of chronic lymphocytic leukemic B cells (B-CLL). Here we show that human immature dendritic cells (iDCs) phagocytosed the CD47 mAb-killed leukemic cells in the absence of caspases 3, 7, 8, and 9 activation in the malignant lymphocytes. Yet the dead cells displayed the cytoplasmic features of apoptosis, including cell shrinkage, phosphatidylserine exposure, and decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim). CD47 mAb-induced cell death also occurred in normal resting and activated lymphocytes, with B-CLL cells demonstrating the highest susceptibility. Importantly, iDCs and CD34(+) progenitors were resistant. Structure-function studies in cell lines transfected with various CD47 chimeras demonstrated that killing exclusively required the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the CD47 molecule. Cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, and antimycin A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transfer, completely suppressed CD47-induced phosphatidylserine exposure. Interestingly, CD47 ligation failed to induce cell death in mononuclear cells isolated from Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients, suggesting the involvement of Cdc42/WAS protein (WASP) signaling pathway. We propose that CD47-induced caspase-independent cell death be mediated by cytoskeleton reorganization. This form of cell death may be relevant to maintenance of homeostasis and as such might be explored for the development of future therapeutic approaches in lymphoid malignancies.","['Mateo, Veronique', 'Brown, Eric J', 'Biron, Guy', 'Rubio, Manuel', 'Fischer, Alain', 'Deist, Francoise Le', 'Sarfati, Marika']","['Mateo V', 'Brown EJ', 'Biron G', 'Rubio M', 'Fischer A', 'Deist FL', 'Sarfati M']","[""Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universite Montreal, Laboratoire d' Immunoregulation, Universite de Montreal, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'CD47 Antigen', 'Carrier Proteins/*immunology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/*immunology', 'Cytoskeleton/immunology/*ultrastructure', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Necrosis', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphatidylserines/*pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'Thrombospondins/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/blood/immunology']",2002/09/28 04:00,2002/12/06 04:00,['2002/09/28 04:00'],"['2002/09/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2001-12-0217 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50951-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Oct 15;100(8):2882-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2001-12-0217.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (CD47 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Thrombospondins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical course of the disease is dominated by progressive, life-threatening bone marrow failure and high incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia and solid tumors. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a therapeutic option but requires HLA-matched donors. Gene therapy holds great promise for FA, but previous attempts to use retroviral vectors in humans have proven ineffective given the impaired proliferation potential of human FA hematopoietic progenitors (HPCs). In this work, we show that using lentiviral vectors efficient genetic correction can be achieved in quiescent hematopoietic progenitors from Fanca(-/-) and Fancc(-/-) mice. Long-term repopulating HPCs were transduced by a single exposure of unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells to lentivectors carrying the normal gene. Notably, no cell purification or cytokine prestimulation was necessary. Resistance to DNA- damaging agents was fully restored by lentiviral transduction, allowing for in vivo selection of the corrected cells with nonablative doses of cyclophosphamide.

Recently, different CEBPA gene mutations likely to induce differentiation arrest have been described in nearly 10% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the prognostic significance of CEBPA mutations in 135 AML patients (French-American-British [FAB]-M3 excluded). All patients were prospectively enrolled between 1990 and 1996 in a multicenter trial of the ALFA (Acute Leukemia French Association) Group (median age 45 years, median follow-up 5.7 years). Mutations were assessed using direct sequencing of the CEBPA gene. Twenty-two mutations were found in 15 (11%) of 135 patients tested. Twelve patients had at least one mutation located in the N-terminal part of the protein leading to the lack of expression of the full-length C/EBPalpha protein. CEBPA mutations were present only in patients belonging to the intermediate cytogenetic risk subgroup and associated with the FAB-M1 subtype (P =.02). FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) was found in 5 of 15 CEBPA-mutated as compared with 30 of 119 CEBPA-nonmutated cases tested (P =.54). Presence of CEBPA mutations was identified as an independent good prognosis factor for outcome even after adjustment on cytogenetics and FLT3 status (estimated 5-year overall survival 53% vs 25%, P =.04). FLT3-ITD appeared to act as a major bad prognosis factor in patients with CEBPA-mutated AML. We thus propose a risk classification that includes in the favorable subgroup all patients from the intermediate subgroup displaying CEBPA mutations when not associated with FLT3-ITD.","['Preudhomme, Claude', 'Sagot, Christophe', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Tigaud, Isabelle', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Lamandin, Charlotte', 'Castaigne, Sylvie', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Dombret, Herve']","['Preudhomme C', 'Sagot C', 'Boissel N', 'Cayuela JM', 'Tigaud I', 'de Botton S', 'Thomas X', 'Raffoux E', 'Lamandin C', 'Castaigne S', 'Fenaux P', 'Dombret H']","[""Departement d'Hematologie and INSERM U524, Hopital Claude Huriez, Lille, France. cpreudhomme@chru-lille.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom', 'United States']",2002/09/28 04:00,2002/12/06 04:00,['2002/09/28 04:00'],"['2002/09/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-03-0990 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50929-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Oct 15;100(8):2717-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-03-0990.,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['ALFA Group'],,,,,

Clinical trials in adult patients with AML indicate that idarubicin may have superior efficacy when compared to daunorubicin in the remission-induction phases of chemotherapy. We conducted consecutive clinical trials in children with newly diagnosed AML in which daunorubicin (group 1, n = 102) or idarubicin (group 2, n = 160) was used during the remission-induction (RI) and the early consolidation phases of chemotherapy. Idarubicin was given at a dose of either 10 mg/m(2) (group 2A, n = 106) or 12 mg/m(2) (group 2B, n = 53). A high rate of RI was achieved for all groups (95% group 1, 90% group 2A, 94% group 2B).

RI deaths resulting from treatment toxicity were low-2% for group 1 and 5% for group 2. More gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and renal toxicity but fewer infections were observed in patients receiving idarubicin (P <.001, P =.04, P =.03, respectively).

OS was higher in allogeneic BMT patients than in autologous BMT patients (79% vs 63%; P =.23).

GST polymorphisms resulting in decreased enzymatic activity have been associated with several types of solid tumors. We determined the prognostic significance of the deletion of 2 GST subfamilies genes, M1 and T1, in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using polymerase chain reactions, we analyzed the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotype in 106 patients with AML (median age, 60.5 years; range, 19-76 years). The relevance of GSTM1 and GSTT1 homozygous deletions was studied with respect to patient characteristics, response to therapy, and survival. Homozygous deletions resulting in null genotypes at the GSTM1 and GSTT1 loci were detected in 45 (42%) and 30 (28%) patients, respectively. The double-null genotype was present in 19 patients (18%). GST deletions predicted poor response to chemotherapy (P =.04) and shorter survival (P =.04). The presence of at least one GST deletion proved to be an independent prognostic risk factor for response to induction treatment and overall survival in a multivariate analysis including age and karyotype (P =.02). GST genotyping was of particular prognostic value in the cytogenetically defined intermediate-risk group (P =.003). In conclusion, individuals with GSTM1 or GSTT1 deletions (or deletions of both) may have an enhanced resistance to chemotherapy and a shorter survival.","['Voso, Maria Teresa', ""D'Alo', Francesco"", 'Putzulu, Rossana', 'Mele, Luca', 'Scardocci, Alessandra', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Rutella, Sergio', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Hohaus, Stefan', 'Leone, Giuseppe']","['Voso MT', ""D'Alo' F"", 'Putzulu R', 'Mele L', 'Scardocci A', 'Chiusolo P', 'Latagliata R', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Rutella S', 'Pagano L', 'Hohaus S', 'Leone G']","[""Istituto di Ematologia, Universita' Cattolica S.

Growth velocity slows during therapy for ALL, especially during the first year; however, children who do not receive cranial irradiation usually reach normal adult height. While growth hormone deficiency generally occurs in patients who have received 24Gy of cranial irradiation, it may also develop in those treated with lower doses (18Gy) of cranial radiation or with only high-dose methotrexate. Obesity commonly occurs during therapy and persists after completion of therapy. Osteopenia can occur early during therapy for ALL and can persist for many years. Adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in any child who has recently received glucocorticoid therapy, and stress doses of steroid should be administered in the event of metabolic stress. Screening of urine is useful for early detection of hyperglycemia during therapy with glucocorticoids and L-asparaginase. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone is usually associated with vincristine therapy and may be aggravated by concurrent use of azole antifungals.

The variant env gene encodes a full-length surface envelope glycoprotein (SU) and a C-terminally truncated transmembrane protein (TM). To change the coreceptor usage of this vector from CCR5 to CXCR4, which is predominant on human CD4-positive lymphocytes, the putative V3-loop of SIVagm SU was replaced by that of the T cell tropic HIV-1 variant BH10. The resulting [MLV(SIVagm-X4)] vectors were shown to specifically transduce CD4/CXCR4-positive cell lines, demonstrating the equivalent function in cell entry and choice of coreceptor usage of the V3-loops of SIVagm and HIV-1. These modified vectors were able to transduce primary human lymphocytes and were resistant to neutralization by sera from HIV-1-infected individuals.

Total annual costs for an average, infected, 50 cow herd were: JD$ 2472; BVD$ 2421; neosporosis $ 2304; EBL$ 806. The stochastic nature of the proportion of infected herds and prevalence of infection within a herd were used to estimate probability distributions for these ex post costs. For all diseases, these distributions were right skewed. A sensitivity analysis showed the largest effect on costs was due to milk yield effects.

Until recently, autologous and allogeneic bone marrow or mobilized blood stem cells transplantation were used primarily to replace malignant, genetically abnormal or deficient immunohematopoietic compartment and therefore, highly toxic myeloablative regimen were considered mandatory for more effective eradication of all undesirable host-derived hematopoietic elements. Our preclinical and ongoing clinical studies indicated that much more effective eradication of host immunohematopoietic system cells could be achieved by adoptive allogeneic cell therapy with donor lymphocyte infusion following BMT. Thus, eradication of blood cancer cells, especially in patients with CML and less frequently in patients with other hematologic malignancies, could be frequently accomplished despite complete resistance of such tumor cells to maximally tolerated doses of chemoradiotherapy. Our cumulative experience suggested that graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects might be a useful tool for eradication of otherwise resistant tumor cells of host origin. Based on the cumulative clinical experience and experimental data in animal models of human diseases it appears that induction of host versus graft tolerance as step one, may allow durable engraftment of donor immunocompetent lymphocytes, which may be used for induction of effective biologic warfare against host-type immunohematopoietic cells that need to be replaced, malignant, genetically abnormal or self-reactive alike. Based on the aforementioned rationale, we speculated that the therapeutic benefit of BMT may be improved by using a safer conditioning as part of the transplant procedure, with the goal in mind to induce host versus graft tolerance to enable subsequent induction of GVL, possibly graft versus tumor or even graft versus autoimmunity effects, rather than attempt to eliminate host cells with hazardous myeloablative chemoradiotherapy. The latter hypothesis suggested that effective BMT procedure may be accomplished without lethal conditioning of the host, using new well tolerated non-myeloablative regimen, thus possibly minimizing immediate and late side effects related to myeloablative procedures considered until recently mandatory for conditioning of BMT recipients. Recent clinical data that will be presented suggests that effective BMT procedures may be accomplished with well-tolerated non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) regimen, with no major toxicity. Thus, new NST approaches may offer the feasibility of safer BMT procedure for a large spectrum of clinical indications in children and elderly individuals without lower or upper age limit, while minimizing procedure-related toxicity and mortality. Taken together, our cumulative data suggest that high dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be successively replaced by a more effective biologic tool, alloreactive donor lymphocytes, thus setting the stage for innovative therapeutic procedures for safer and more effective treatment of patients in need of BMT.","['Slavin, Shimon', 'Aker, Mehmet', 'Shapira, Michael Y', 'Panigrahi, Soumya', 'Gabriel, Cividalli', 'Or, Reuven']","['Slavin S', 'Aker M', 'Shapira MY', 'Panigrahi S', 'Gabriel C', 'Or R']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. slavin@huji.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Transfus Apher Sci,Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,101095653,,,"['Autoimmune Diseases/therapy', 'Critical Illness', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/trends', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods/trends']",2002/09/28 04:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2002/09/28 04:00'],"['2002/09/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1473-0502(02)00038-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s1473-0502(02)00038-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Apher Sci. 2002 Oct;27(2):159-66. doi: 10.1016/s1473-0502(02)00038-1.,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PM normally circulate between peripheral blood, lymphoid organs and sites of inflammation using specific migratory pathways and signalling; PM are easily recognizable on the basis of their distinctive morphology and phenotype (CD3-, CD11c-, CD14-, CD20-, CD36+, CD56-, CD68+, CD123+, BD-CA2+). Recently it has been shown that PM produce high levels of type I interferon, thus corresponding to natural interferon-producing cells. Furthermore, PM or their precursors may differentiate in vitro towards a new subset of dendritic cells, supporting a function in antigen-dependent T cell priming. Taken together, these data suggest PM play a relevant role in the immune system, linking innate and acquired immunities. In fact, PM seem to be crucial in the pathogenesis of different immune-mediated human diseases including viral infections and autoimmune disorders, and to be involved in the immune control of some malignant neoplasms. The issue concerning the cell lineage of PM remains unresolved, but the frequent association between a tumoral expansion of PM and myelo-monocytic leukemia, together with cytogenetic identity between the two cell populations identified in rare cases, corroborates the myeloid origin of PM.","['Facchetti, F', 'Vermi, W']","['Facchetti F', 'Vermi W']",,['ita'],"['Editorial', 'English Abstract', 'Review']",,Italy,Pathologica,Pathologica,0401123,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Blood Cells/immunology', 'Cell Movement', 'Dendritic Cells/chemistry/classification/*immunology/metabolism', 'HIV Infections/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*cytology/immunology', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Inflammation/pathology', 'Interferon-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Lymph Nodes/*cytology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology/immunology', 'Monocytes/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Plasma Cells/cytology']",2002/09/28 04:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/28 04:00'],"['2002/09/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s102420200027 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathologica. 2002 Aug;94(4):163-75. doi: 10.1007/s102420200027.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",114,,,,Monociti plasmacitoidi/cellule dendritiche plasmacitoidi.

Our purpose was to examine the relationship between 27 control practices and the estimated true seroprevalences for these four diseases for 2604 cattle in 90 dairy herds in the Maritimes provinces of Canada. Overall, 37.8, 20.4, 3.4, and 19.2% of all sampled cattle were truly exposed to the agents of BVD, EBL, JD, and neosporosis, respectively. The median within-herd true prevalences were 0, 9.3, 0, and 12.3%, respectively. Factor analysis reduced the 27 control practices to two highly correlated factors. Tobit-regression analyses determined that vaccination practices were associated with reduced prevalence of exposure for Bovine viral-diarrhoea and EBL. Also, farms that tended to purchase their dairy animals were associated with higher seroprevalence for Johnes' disease. Neither of these two factors was associated with the seroprevalence of Neospora caninum infection. The few routine biosecurity measures that were investigated in this study were generally not related to the seroprevalences of these farms.","['Chi, Junwook', 'VanLeeuwen, John A', 'Weersink, Alfons', 'Keefe, Gregory P']","['Chi J', 'VanLeeuwen JA', 'Weersink A', 'Keefe GP']","['Department of Agricultural Economics and Business, University of Guelph, Ont., Canada N1G 2W1.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Prev Vet Med,Preventive veterinary medicine,8217463,IM,,"['Animal Husbandry/*methods', 'Animals', 'Bovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Disease/epidemiology/prevention & control/virology', 'Canada', 'Cattle/*immunology', 'Cattle Diseases/*epidemiology/*microbiology/prevention & control/virology', 'Coccidiosis/epidemiology/parasitology/prevention & control/veterinary', 'Dairying', 'Data Collection', 'Diarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viral/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/prevention & control/virology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Neospora/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Paratuberculosis/epidemiology/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Prevalence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2002/09/27 06:00,2003/01/16 04:00,['2002/09/27 06:00'],"['2002/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/16 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0167587702000673 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-5877(02)00067-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Prev Vet Med. 2002 Sep 10;55(1):57-68. doi: 10.1016/s0167-5877(02)00067-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cells have been found to have a major role in immunosurveillance against malignant cells. However, with few exceptions like donor leukocyte infusions for relapsed chronic myeloid leukaemia post-allogeneic stem cell transplant, immunological therapies have not yet found wide application in the control of most human cancers. We attribute this to two immunological problems in cancer patients. Firstly, we hypothesize that among all subsets of T cells it is the repertoire of nai;ve cells that is most important and specific for cancer immunity. Some forms of cancer treatment like chemotherapy often damage this very important cell. Secondly, the effector arm of immune response (T cells) is polarized away from the cancer-protecting type 1 phenotype (TH1 cells and type 1-cytokines) towards the type 2 phenotype. We propose that regeneration of nai;ve T cells (for e.g. by thymic transplants) in a type 1-cytokine milieu could be crucial to the prevention of relapses in patients who achieve complete remissions with conventional therapies.","['Singh, H P', 'Gupta, S', 'Raina, V']","['Singh HP', 'Gupta S', 'Raina V']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi 110029, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,IM,,"['Cytokines/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/physiopathology', '*Secondary Prevention']",2002/09/27 06:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2002/09/27 06:00'],"['2002/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0306987701915361 [pii]', '10.1054/mehy.2001.1536 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2002 Jun;58(6):554-7. doi: 10.1054/mehy.2001.1536.,['0 (Cytokines)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cumulative MITO doses ranged from 2 to 183 mg/m(2) (mean 60.5 mg/m(2), median 62.5 mg/m(2)), and 141 patients received >100 mg/m(2). Two of 1,378 patients experienced CHF after initiating MITO therapy. Of 1,378 patients, 779 completed baseline and scheduled follow-up LVEF testing. Baseline LVEF was >50% in all 779 patients. Seventeen of 779 patients had asymptomatic LVEF of <50% (incidence proportion = 2.18%, 95% CI = 1.28 to 3.47%). Although the incidence of asymptomatic LVEF of <50% was not significantly related to monthly versus 3-monthly therapy, duration of therapy, age, or gender, asymptomatic LVEF of <50% trended higher with a cumulative dose of >/=100 mg/m(2) (5.0%) than with <100 mg/m(2) (1.8%) (p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The observed incidence of CHF in patients with MS who received a mean cumulative dose of 60.5 mg/m(2) MITO was <0.20%. Continued monitoring of patients with MS who are receiving MITO is needed to determine whether the incidence of CHF increases with higher cumulative MITO doses and prolonged follow-up.","['Ghalie, R G', 'Edan, G', 'Laurent, M', 'Mauch, E', 'Eisenman, S', 'Hartung, H P', 'Gonsette, R E', 'Butine, M D', 'Goodkin, D E']","['Ghalie RG', 'Edan G', 'Laurent M', 'Mauch E', 'Eisenman S', 'Hartung HP', 'Gonsette RE', 'Butine MD', 'Goodkin DE']","['Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA 98101, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*adverse effects', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*chemically induced/epidemiology']",2002/09/26 06:00,2002/10/17 04:00,['2002/09/26 06:00'],"['2002/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1212/wnl.59.6.909 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurology. 2002 Sep 24;59(6):909-13. doi: 10.1212/wnl.59.6.909.,['BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated that decidualization, a stromal transformation that occurs in response to embryo implantation, can be elicited in the uterus of estrogen receptor alpha knockout (alphaERKO) mice in the absence of the estrogen dependence normally seen in wild-type (WT) mice for this response. While the alphaERKO stromal compartment demonstrated the necessary decidual response, embryo implantation is a process initiated in the epithelial layer, a uterine component that lacks estrogen responsiveness in the alphaERKO. To determine if the alphaERKO uterus would be competent for implantation, donor embryos were transferred into the uterine lumen of WT and alphaERKO females that had been ovariectomized and treated with exogenous estradiol and progesterone to mimic early pregnancy. No implantation occurred in the alphaERKO, while implantation sites containing live embryos were seen in similarly treated WT uteri, indicating that functional estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is required for implantation. Previous observations of estrogen-independent decidualization in the alphaERKO prompted investigation of the mechanism leading to estrogen independence of this process. The disruption of progesterone receptor (PR), Hoxa10, Cox2, or LIF in transgenic mice results in the loss of decidualization response. Therefore, the expression of these genes was studied in WT and alphaERKO uteri by comparing expression following vehicle, progesterone alone (P), or estradiol priming followed by progesterone with nidatory estradiol (E+Pe) and by comparing expression following the above hormonal manipulations in addition to luminal infusion of oil used previously as decidualization-initiating stimulus. The whole-uterus level of PR and Hoxa10 mRNAs did not vary; however, the PR protein was induced in the stroma 24 h after oil infusion. Interestingly, in the WT, this induction was most apparent in samples receiving E+Pe, while in the alphaERKO samples, the induction occurred independent of any hormone priming. Cox2 protein and mRNA increased in both WT and alphaERKO samples 2 h after oil infusion in all three of the treatment groups. In the WT samples, Cox2 levels remained elevated 24 h after oil infusion only in the E+Pe treatment group; however, the elevated Cox2 was seen in samples taken 24 h after oil infusion in all three alphaERKO treatment groups. The alphaERKO uterine tissue appeared to sustain more extensive damage when examined 24 h after oil infusion. Severe trauma, such as crushing of the uterine tissue, has previously been shown to remove the requirement for nidatory estradiol for deciduomas to develop, indicating that the greater susceptibility of alphaERKO uterine tissue to damage from intraluminal oil infusion is contributing to decidualization in the absence of ERalpha. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mRNA was also induced following estradiol treatment in the WT, but also following oil infusion in WT samples that were not treated with estradiol. In contrast, estradiol does not induce LIF mRNA in the alphaERKO, but oil infusion leads to a robust increase in LIF in all alphaERKO sample groups. LIF binds and activates its membrane receptor, which initiates responses including the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat3 transcription factor. Thus, Stat3 phosphorylation was studied in WT and alphaERKO samples and found to be induced following oil infusion in all samples. Together, these and previous observations illustrate that estrogen is essential for epithelial proliferation and embryo implantation and that estrogen is dispensable for stromal decidualization in the alphaERKO, as the essential genes and signals required for the response are still induced.","['Curtis Hewitt, Sylvia', 'Goulding, Eugenia H', 'Eddy, E M', 'Korach, Kenneth S']","['Curtis Hewitt S', 'Goulding EH', 'Eddy EM', 'Korach KS']","['Laboratory of Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology, NIEHS, NIH, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Decidua/*physiology', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha', 'Estrogens/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*deficiency/physiology', 'Receptors, Progesterone/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Sesame Oil/administration & dosage', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Uterus/*physiology']",2002/09/26 06:00,2003/03/12 04:00,['2002/09/26 06:00'],"['2002/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod67.4.1268 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2002 Oct;67(4):1268-77. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod67.4.1268.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '8008-74-0 (Sesame Oil)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 is the only retrovirus known to be the etiologic agent of human cancer. HTLV-2, the other known oncovirus, is not apparently associated with human cancer. While HTLV-1 transforms T-cells in vitro, HIV kills CD4+ T-cells and is the etiological agent of human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, characterized by a progressive loss of CD4+ cells, weakening of the immune system, and susceptibility to opportunistic infections and cancer.

Most of these immune escape mechanisms are highly host adapted and specific to a given virus species or family. Recent observations however, suggest that a conserved family of viral proteins is used by both gamma-2 herpesviruses and by poxviruses to downregulate MHC class I. In addition, other cell surface molecules involved in immune recognition by T cells and NK cells are also downregulated. Two open reading frames (ORFs), K3 and K5, of Kaposi's sarcoma associated virus (KSHV) and one ORFs, K3, of murine gamma herpesvirus 68 (MHV 68) inhibit surface expression of MHC I molecules. In cells transfected with KSHV-K3 and KSHV-K5, MHC I is rapidly endocytosed and degraded in lysosomes whereas in MHV 68-K3 transfected cells, MHC I is targeted for proteasomal degradation. The K3 and K5 genes display a characteristic conserved domain structure of an amino-terminal plant homeo domain/leukemia associated protein-zinc finger domain followed by two carboxyterminal transmembrane domains. Related proteins are not only found in other gamma-2 herpesviruses, but also in several poxviruses. Moreover, recent data suggest that the K3-related protein of myxoma virus also downregulates MHC I. The presence of similar genes in eukaryotic genomes further indicates that the viral ORFs were originally derived from host genes of as yet unknown function. The molecular mechanism of MHC I downregulation by this novel gene family is only poorly understood at present. However, several lines of evidence suggest that they might function as ubiquitin ligases that regulate the intracellular transport of transmembrane proteins through ubiquitination.","['Fruh, Klaus', 'Bartee, Eric', 'Gouveia, Kristine', 'Mansouri, Mandana']","['Fruh K', 'Bartee E', 'Gouveia K', 'Mansouri M']","['Oregon Health and Science University, Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute, 505 NW 185th Avenue, Beaverton, OR 97006, USA. fruehk@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gammaherpesvirinae/*pathogenicity', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Poxviridae/*pathogenicity', 'Poxviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers']",2002/09/26 06:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/09/26 06:00'],"['2002/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['S016817020200120X [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1702(02)00120-x [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2002 Sep;88(1-2):55-69. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1702(02)00120-x.,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine if As(2)O(3) might be useful for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, we examined the ability of As(2)O(3) to induce apoptosis in K562 cells. In vitro cytotoxicity of As(2)O(3) was evaluated in K562 cells by a MTT assay; the IC(50) value for As(2)O(3) was determined to be 10 microM.

We also found morphological changes and chromatin condensation of the cells undergoing apoptosis. Activation of caspase-3 was observed 6 h after treatment with 20 microM As(2)O(3) by a Western blot analysis. Next, we examined the MAP kinase-signaling pathway of As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis in K562 cells. As(2)O(3) at 10 microM strongly induced the activation of p38 and JNK 1/2, while ERK 1/2 was inhibited.

In an effort to develop an antibody treatment for asthma that neutralizes the effects of IL-4, a murine monoclonal antibody, 3B9, was generated with specificity for human IL-4. In vitro studies demonstrated that 3B9 inhibited IL-4-dependent events including IL-5 synthesis, (T(H)2) cell activation and up-regulation of immunoglobulin E expression. 3B9 was then humanized (pascolizumab, SB 240683) to reduce immunogenicity in humans. SB 240683 demonstrated species specificity for both monkey and human IL-4 with no reactivity to mouse, rat, cow, goat or horse IL-4. Pascolizumab inhibited the response of human and monkey T cells to monkey IL-4 and effectively neutralized IL-4 bioactivity when tested against several IL-4-responsive human cell lines. Affinity studies demonstrated rapid IL-4 binding by pascolizumab with a slow dissociation rate. In vivo pharmacokinetic and chronic safety testing in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated that pascolizumab was well tolerated, and no adverse clinical responses occurred after up to 9 months of treatment. Three monkeys developed an anti-idiotypic response that resulted in rapid pascolizumab clearance. However, in the chronic dosing study the antibody response was transient and not associated with clinical events. In conclusion, pascolizumab is a humanized anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody that can inhibit upstream and downstream events associated with asthma, including (T(H)2) cell activation and immunoglobulin E production. Clinical trials are under way to test the clinical efficacy of pascolizumab for asthma.","['Hart, T K', 'Blackburn, M N', 'Brigham-Burke, M', 'Dede, K', 'Al-Mahdi, N', 'Zia-Amirhosseini, P', 'Cook, R M']","['Hart TK', 'Blackburn MN', 'Brigham-Burke M', 'Dede K', 'Al-Mahdi N', 'Zia-Amirhosseini P', 'Cook RM']","['GlaxoSmithKline, King of Prussia, PA, and Protein Design Laboratories, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA. timothy.hart@gsk.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,,"['Animals', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/biosynthesis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Area Under Curve', 'Asthma/*therapy', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'Goats', 'Half-Life', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/biosynthesis', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-4/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity', 'Safety', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Th2 Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/09/26 06:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/26 06:00'],"['2002/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['1973 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2249.2002.01973.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2002 Oct;130(1):93-100. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2002.01973.x.,"['0 (Anti-Asthmatic Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",,,,PMC1906490,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A nested case-control study was performed. The source population comprised 23,922 subjects who had either visited the outpatient clinic or who had received annual health check-ups at the K Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan, at least once during 1985-1996 (HTLV-I seroprevalence = 16.1%). Markers of HTLV-I infection were examined in stored sera from 29 incident cases of ATL diagnosed during 1985-1997, and 158 controls matched for sex, birth year, date of sample collection, and HTLV-I seropositivity (median follow-up = 6.4 years). RESULTS: In exact conditional logistic regression analysis, high levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (> or = 500 U/ml) and high HTLV-I antibody titers (> or = 1,024) were independently associated with an increased risk of developing ATL (Odds ratio 20.5. 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.5-194 and 2.9, 95% CI 0.98-9.5, respectively). The results remained essentially unchanged when the subjects were restricted to those whose histories were followed for two years or longer. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that high soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels and high HTLV-I antibody titers are strong predictors of ATL among carriers of HTLV-I.","['Arisaw, Kokichi', 'Katamine, Shigeru', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Kurokawa, Kenji', 'Sawada, Takashi', 'Soda, Midori', 'Doi, Hiroshi', 'Saito, Hiroshi', 'Shirahama, Satoshi']","['Arisaw K', 'Katamine S', 'Kamihira S', 'Kurokawa K', 'Sawada T', 'Soda M', 'Doi H', 'Saito H', 'Shirahama S']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and Health Promotion, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan. k-iwata@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,,"['Age Distribution', '*Carrier State', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Analysis']",2002/09/26 06:00,2003/01/30 04:00,['2002/09/26 06:00'],"['2002/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/30 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1019511224501 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2002 Sep;13(7):657-63. doi: 10.1023/a:1019511224501.,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The CTS is a prospective study of 133,479 California female teachers and administrators, established in 1995-1996 with members of the California State Teachers Retirement System completing a detailed mailed questionnaire regarding possible risk factors for breast and other cancers. Cancer outcomes were identified by linkage with the California Cancer Registry. RESULTS: CTS participants have a 51% higher age-standardized invasive breast cancer incidence rate and a 67% higher in-situ breast cancer incidence rate than would be expected based on race-specific statewide rates after three years of follow-up. CTS participants also have substantially elevated rates of endometrial cancer (rate ratio, RR = 1.72), ovarian cancer (RR = 1.28), melanoma (RR = 1.59), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR= 1.53), and leukemia (RR = 1.28), but low rates of invasive cervix cancer (RR = 0.53) and lung cancer (RR = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS: CTS members have high rates of several major cancers, particularly breast cancer, and low rates of lung and cervix cancer. Although late age at first birth can explain a portion of the observed excess risk of breast cancer in this cohort, the unique risk factor profile of CTS members may account for much of their higher risk of breast and selected other cancers.

METHODS: We compared birth weights of 268 children younger than five years old and diagnosed with cancer in the State of Texas in 1995 to the birth weights of 2680 randomly selected, age-matched population-based controls. Birth weight, sex, race/ethnicity, maternal age, smoking status, parity, and gestational age information was ascertained from the birth certificates.

Studies have shown that interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy induces both cytogenetic (reduction in Ph+ cells) and molecular response (reduction in the bcr/abl positive cells) in a large proportion of patients, thereby improving their prognosis and survival. There are no reports available from India on the clinical management of CML patients using IFN-alpha therapy and molecular methods for the evaluation of residual disease. We evaluated the efficacy of IFN-alpha 2b therapy bysequential cytogenetic and molecularanalysis. METHODS: Karyotypingwas done from G-banded metaphases obtained from 24-hour culture of bone marrow aspirates of 45 patients. Cytogenetic analysis was repeated at intervals of 4-6 months during the course of IFN-alpha therapy. Dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using specific probes for bcr and abl genes was done to assess the molecular response. RESULTS: Eight patients achieved complete cytogenetic response with no Ph+ cells. Using FISH analysis, 4 of these patients were negative for the fusion gene implying a complete response, while the remaining 4 patients showed bcr/abl fusion signals that represent residual disease. CONCLUSION: Our study emphasizes the need for sequential cytogenetic and molecular analysis in the management of patients with CML and for the evaluation of minimal residual disease in patients on IFN-alpha therapy.","['Talwar, Rashmi', 'Choudhry, V P', 'Jobanputra, Vaidehi', 'Kucheria, Kiran']","['Talwar R', 'Choudhry VP', 'Jobanputra V', 'Kucheria K']","['All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,India,Natl Med J India,The National medical journal of India,8809315,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2002/09/26 06:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/26 06:00'],"['2002/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Med J India. 2002 Jul-Aug;15(4):195-8.,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to others using cell lines and animal models, emphasis was placed on the use of primary human cells. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) marker gene expression was examined using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. The most effective target cells for rAAV-2-mediated gene transfer were bronchial epithelial, artery endothelial as well as smooth and skeletal muscle cells with mean transduction rates ranging from 34.3 to 81.6%. Lower transduction rates between 4.3 and 19.5% were found in chondrocytes, dermal papilla follicle epithelial cells and fibroblasts. No transduction was observed in melanocytes, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized CD34(+) cells or malignant CD19(+) cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A proportion of EGFP-expressing skeletal muscle and smooth muscle cells was maintained over a period of 6 weeks after transduction (42.7+/-5.4 and 67.1+/-0.9%, respectively). Interestingly, among hair follicle epithelial cells the proportion of transduced cells increased from 8+/-0.5 to 36+/-7.7% in the course of 6 weeks. In contrast, for endothelial cells, bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts, a rapid decline in the number of EGFP expressing cells were noted. An inverse relationship between the proportion of cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle and long-term gene expression was observed. All rAAV-2 susceptible primary cells expressed FGFR-1 and the alphaV integrin consistent with their role as co-receptors for AAV-2. In conclusion, AAV-2 is a suitable vector system for transduction and evaluation of functional effects of long-term gene expression in primary human muscle and hair follicle cells.","['Rohr, Ulrich-Peter', 'Kronenwett, Ralf', 'Grimm, Dirk', 'Kleinschmidt, Jurgen', 'Haas, Rainer']","['Rohr UP', 'Kronenwett R', 'Grimm D', 'Kleinschmidt J', 'Haas R']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225, Dusseldorf, Germany. urohr-uni-duesseldorf@gmx.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Dependovirus/classification/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', '*Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection/methods']",2002/09/25 06:00,2002/12/05 04:00,['2002/09/25 06:00'],"['2002/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0166093402001179 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-0934(02)00117-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 2002 Sep;105(2):265-75. doi: 10.1016/s0166-0934(02)00117-9.,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that this activation was divided into two phases: the first activation occurred transiently in the membrane skeleton fraction of the suspended cell status and diminished after 1h; and the second sustained activation was maintained by cell adhesion. TPA-treated CMK cells revealed increased expression of integrins alphaIIb and beta3 only when the cell adhesion persisted, regardless of the difference of culture substratum. Sustained activation of the MEK1-ERK1/2 pathway is generated in the membrane skeleton by continuous cell adhesion and seems to be essential to TPA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of CMK cells.","['Mizutani, Chisato', 'Tohyama, Yumi', 'Miura, Yasuo', 'Hishita, Terutoshi', 'Nishihara, Toshio', 'Yamamura, Hirohei', 'Ichiyama, Satoshi', 'Uchiyama, Takashi', 'Tohyama, Kaoru']","['Mizutani C', 'Tohyama Y', 'Miura Y', 'Hishita T', 'Nishihara T', 'Yamamura H', 'Ichiyama S', 'Uchiyama T', 'Tohyama K']","['The Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/25 06:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/25 06:00'],"['2002/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X02022350 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02235-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Sep 27;297(3):664-71. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02235-0.,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (U 0126)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TCS has been approved to be effective in clinical treatment of HIV infection and leukemia, but its allergenicity has limited its clinical usage. To identify amino acid residues in TCS with an important role in IgE induction, TCS-specific IgE mAb (TE1) was used to serve as a probe and TE1 epitope was determined by a random phage-peptide library. Based on phage peptide sequences, TE1 epitope was predicted at amino acid residues 169-174 (QQIGKR) of TCS protein. Based on modeling data, two amino acids (Lys173 and Arg174) on TCS were considered to have a crucial role in binding to TE1. After lysine 173 and arginine 174 were mutated to glycine, the mutant TCS protein specifically lost the binding activity to TE1 mAb and exhibited reduced IgE induction in the immunized mice. The data showed that the IgE epitope of TCS was determined and shown to play a critical role in induction of IgE, and the modification of IgE-epitope may be a useful strategy to reduce the allergenicity of an allergen.","['Cai, Xuan', 'Yao, Gang', 'Xu, Guofeng', 'Yang, Cuihong', 'Xu, Hong', 'Lin, Ying', 'Yu, Jian', 'Sun, Bing']","['Cai X', 'Yao G', 'Xu G', 'Yang C', 'Xu H', 'Lin Y', 'Yu J', 'Sun B']","[""Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 320 Yueyang Road, Shanghai 200031, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Formation/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin E/chemistry/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'Peptide Library', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/immunology', 'Trichosanthin/*pharmacology']",2002/09/25 06:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/25 06:00'],"['2002/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X02020764 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02076-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Sep 27;297(3):510-6. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02076-4.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '60318-52-7 (Trichosanthin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blast crisis as the first presentation of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) accounts for 10.0% of all cases. OBJECTIVE: We report a case of megakaryocytic blast crisis as the first presentation of CML. CASE REPORT: A 25-yr-old-female with a 2-month history of dry cough and a large, non-tender splenomegaly was found to have a hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dL, a hematocritof 33.0%, a white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.4 x 106 L with 38% small blasts, eosinophilia of 5%, basophilia of 8%, and a platelet count of 580 x 109 L. Bone marrow aspiration revealed 24% of blast cells with cytoplasmatic blebs and hyperplastic megakaryocytic lineage with dysplasia. Cytochemical stains were all negative, immunophenotyping studies showed CD41 and CD61 positivity in blast cells. Bone marrow biopsy showed grade II fibrosis. Karyotype revealed 46, XX, t(9,22) (q34.1;q11.2)[20] and the reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) gave rise a product with a size corresponding to the 210 kDa protein (p210). No matched donor was found. After induction therapy 5.9% of blast cells persisted. The patient received Imatinib Mesylate and is doing well after a 12-month follow-up.

Efficacy and toxicity in comparison with previous treatment.,27-36,"The aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness and toxicity of cladribine (2-CdA) used alone or in combination with prednisone (P) or cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone in re-treatment of patients with progressive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). We analyzed treatment outcome in 40 patients who had responded to previous treatment with 2-CdA-based regimens. Criteria for re-treatment were the same as for the first treatment. The patients were retreated with the same agents if they responded to the first treatment and then relapsed with progressive disease not earlier than 3 months after achieving the first response. Eight patients received 2-CdA alone (0.12 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) i.v. for 5 d, and 21 patients additionally were given P (30 mg m(-2) d(-1)) orally, also for 5 d. Eleven patients received 2-CdA for 3 d combined with cyclophosphamide (650 mg m(-2)) i.v. and mitoxantrone (10 mg m(-2)) i.v. on day 1 (CMC regimen). The cycles were repeated usually at 4 wk intervals or longer if severe myelosuppression or infections occurred. The therapy was finished if complete remission (CR) was achieved or until maximum of six courses. Overall response (OR) in re-treatment was obtained in 16 out of 40 (40%) patients (95% CI 16-64), including 62% after 2-CdA, 33% after 2-CdA +P and 36% after CMC. CR was obtained in four (10%) patients. Residual disease evaluated in the patients with CR by surface immunophenotyping had been demonstrated in 5 out of 16 (31%) patients after the first treatment and in one out of four (25%) patients after re-treatment. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 16 months (range 3-39) for the first treatment and 9.5 months (range 3-18) for re-treatment (P=0.34). Grade III or IV neutropenia was observed in 20% patients during the first treatment and in 35% patients during re-treatment (P=0.1). 2-CdA-induced thrombocytopenia occurred in 20% and 42% of the patients, respectively (P=0.05). Anemia was also more frequent during re-treatment (35%) than during the first treatment (7%) (P=0.007). Autoimmune hemolytic anemia developed in four (10%) of the patients during or after re-treatment. Severe infections, including pneumonia and herpes reactivation, occurred in 11 patients during the first treatment and in 10 patients during re-treatment. Twelve (30%) patients died during the study. Infections were the cause of death in six and AIHA in two patients. In conclusion, 2-CdA applied in monotherapy or in combination with prednisone or cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone has therapeutic activity in some B-CLL patients in whom these drugs induced earlier complete or partial remission. However, since the second response is usually shorter and myelotoxicity more pronounced than during the first therapy, more clinical trials to find other therapeutical approaches are necessary.","['Robak, Tadeusz', 'Bonski, Jerzy Z', 'Kasznicki, Marek', 'Gora-Tybor, Joanna', 'Hellmann, Andrzej', 'Konopka, Lech', 'Dmoszynska, Anna', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek, Jadwiga', 'Wolowiec, Dariusz']","['Robak T', 'Bonski JZ', 'Kasznicki M', 'Gora-Tybor J', 'Hellmann A', 'Konopka L', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Dwilewicz-Trojaczek J', 'Wolowiec D']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/09/25 06:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/25 06:00'],"['2002/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['2o711 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.02711.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2002 Jul;69(1):27-36. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.02711.x.,"['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Polish Leukemia Study Group'],,,,,

However, kinetic data on eradication of leukaemia cells and stem cell engraftement which could support this assumption are lacking. Thus, we investigated bcr/abl fusion transcripts and haematopoietic chimerism in 14 patients undergoing such a transplantation protocol. Ten of them obtained a complete molecular remission, and two patients achieved haematologic remissions but remained bcr/abl positive. Weekly determinations of bcr/abl transcript numbers by qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and donor chimerism revealed that 10 responders cleared bcr/abl positive cells from the peripheral blood within a median of 9 wk (range 3-22 wk). The close relation (P = 0.0075) between the first occurrence of graft-vs.-host disease and the complete clearance of bcr/abl positive blood cells argues in favour of an effective graft-vs.-leukaemia reaction.","['Kreuzer, Karl-Anton', 'Schmidt, Christian Andreas', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Held, Thomas K', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Siegert, Wolfgang']","['Kreuzer KA', 'Schmidt CA', 'Schetelig J', 'Held TK', 'Thiede C', 'Ehninger G', 'Siegert W']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik m.

Conventional fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays reliably target one to three probes in a single hybridization. Simultaneous detection of more than three chromosomal or gene targets should increase the overall power of molecular cytogenetics by permitting detection of multiple genetic aberrations at the single cell level. METHOD: Spectral FISH (S-FISH) is an innovative molecular cytogenetic approach that can target many specific chromosomal aberrations in interphase and metaphase cells in a single hybridization, using combinatorial fluorescence and digital imaging microscopy. RESULTS: S-FISH is a reliable means to identify disease-specific aberrations at the DNA level in individual tumor cells in hematopoietic disorders and malignant melanoma. CONCLUSION: S-FISH is a sensitive assay for the diagnosis and monitoring of disease-specific or patient-specific genetic aberrations, with significant clinical application in oncology for early detection of new or re-emerging abnormal clones, allowing for earlier therapeutic intervention.","['Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Zhang, Feiyu', 'Tcheurekdjian, Lucene', 'Bobadilla, Dolores', 'Bedell, Victoria', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Persons, Diane L', 'Sosman, Jeffrey A', 'Murata-Collins, Joyce L']","['Slovak ML', 'Zhang F', 'Tcheurekdjian L', 'Bobadilla D', 'Bedell V', 'Arber DA', 'Persons DL', 'Sosman JA', 'Murata-Collins JL']","['Department of Cytogenetics, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. mslovak@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,IM,,"['Acute Disease', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*genetics/secondary', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/secondary', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/25 06:00,2003/04/18 05:00,['2002/09/25 06:00'],"['2002/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0361-090X(02)00063-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0361-090x(02)00063-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 2002;26(3):171-9. doi: 10.1016/s0361-090x(02)00063-6.,,,,"['CA30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Although less frequent, breakthrough candidemia was seen more often in neutropenic patients with leukemia. The intensity of breakthrough candidemia was comparable to that of de novo candidemia. Most (70%) of the breakthrough candidemias were due to Candida glabrata or C. krusei.

While R(-) cells totally lacked mGR, this receptor level was low in NT(-) and NT(i) groups. FACS analysis corroborated these results, showing a approximately 4-10-fold difference between the highest mGR levels (mGR(++)) and the R(-) and NT(i) cells. Membrane extracts were analyzed for mGR by immunoblotting. Multiple receptor forms, ranging in M(r) from 94,000 to > 200,000, were observed in the WT cells, while only smaller peptides (85,000-94,000) were found in NT(-) cells.

The medical records of 18 children with a median age of 2.5 years (range, 0.5-14.2 years) were reviewed. The diagnoses were leukemia, central nervous system tumors, solid tumors, and lymphoma. The indications for PEG were anticipated therapy-related nutritional problems and inadequate food intake, weight loss, swallowing problems in relation to paresis of the pharynx, and relapse of the disease. Ten children received a PEG at treatment start, and eight children received it at a median time of 3.4 months (range, 0.9-27.4 months) after treatment start. The median duration of having a PEG in place was 12.3 months (range, 1.2-24.0 months). At admission the median weight for age expressed as standard deviation (SD) was -0.11 (range, -2.78-2.68). There was a significant (p =.005) decrease in the median SD from admission until PEG installation. There was also a significant increase in the median SD from the start of PEG use until 1 (p =.04) and 2 (p =.039) months after start. The most common complications were episodes of inflammation of the PEG site, which were successfully treated with topically or orally administered antibiotics, and episodes of infection, which required intravenously administered antibiotics.

In common with FcepsilonRI cross-linking, silver induced tyrosine phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and furthermore, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase dose-dependently inhibited the silver-induced LTC(4) production. In contrast to FcepsilonRI cross-linking, silver had no effect on the production of IL-4 and TNF-alpha, indicating that different mechanisms are involved in the activation by these two stimuli. In line with this, silver had no or only marginal effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of FcepsilonRIbeta, Lyn, Syk, and linker for activation of T cells, the early and crucial events in FcepsilonRI signaling. Silver induced calcium signals that were involved in the metal-induced degranulation, but not LTC(4) production. Unlike Ag, the silver-induced calcium signals were resistant to the depletion of thapsigargin-sensitive calcium stores and the inhibition of tyrosine kinases and phospholipase Cgamma. These findings indicate that silver activates mast cells by bypassing the early signaling events required for the induction of calcium influx. Our data strongly suggest the existence of an alternative pathway bypassing the early signaling events in mast cell activation and indicate that silver may be useful for analyses of such alternative mechanisms.","['Suzuki, Yoshihiro', 'Yoshimaru, Tetsuro', 'Matsui, Takashi', 'Ra, Chisei']","['Suzuki Y', 'Yoshimaru T', 'Matsui T', 'Ra C']","['Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Advanced Medical Research Center, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. ysuzuki@med.nihon-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects/immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', '*Leukotriene C4/biosynthesis', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/enzymology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Silver/pharmacology', 'Silver Nitrate/pharmacology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Type C Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",2002/09/24 06:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/24 06:00'],"['2002/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.7.3954 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Oct 1;169(7):3954-62. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.7.3954.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '95IT3W8JZE (Silver Nitrate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a novel mAb (2A11) raised against betaGR, we show here that the receptor is not dendritic cell-restricted as first reported, but is broadly expressed, with highest surface expression on populations of myeloid cells (monocyte/macrophage (Mphi) and neutrophil lineages). Dendritic cells and a subpopulation of T cells also expressed the betaGR, but at lower levels. Alveolar Mphi, like inflammatory Mphi, exhibited the highest surface expression of betaGR, indicative of a role for this receptor in immune surveillance. In contrast, resident peritoneal Mphi expressed much lower levels of betaGR on the cell surface. Characterization of the nonopsonic recognition of zymosan by resident peritoneal Mphi suggested the existence of an additional beta-glucan-independent mechanism of zymosan binding that was not observed on elicited or bone marrow-derived Mphi. Although this recognition could be inhibited by mannan, we were able to exclude involvement of the Mphi mannose receptor and complement receptor 3 in this process.

The inhibitory NK cell receptors are well understood; however, less is known about the activating signaling pathways. To explore whether a costimulatory receptor, inducible costimulator (ICOS), is involved in NK cell function, we assessed the role of ICOS in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production. In addition, to determine whether ICOS contributes to the elimination of tumors in vivo, we examined the tumor growth survival of mice injected with a tumor expressing the ICOS ligand, B7RP-1. We found that ICOS was up-regulated by cytokine stimulation in murine NK cells. Consistent with ICOS expression on activated NK cells, ICOS-dependent cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production were observed, and appeared to require signaling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. Interestingly, ICOS-mediated stimulation allowed activated NK cells to kill more efficiently tumor cells expressing MHC class I. Furthermore, fewer metastases appeared in the liver and spleen of mice injected with the ICOS ligand-expressing tumor compared with mice bearing the parental tumor. These results indicate that NK cell functions are regulated by ICOS.","['Ogasawara, Kouetsu', 'Yoshinaga, Steven K', 'Lanier, Lewis L']","['Ogasawara K', 'Yoshinaga SK', 'Lanier LL']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Cancer Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/metabolism', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Ligand', 'Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/enzymology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/physiology', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/24 06:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/24 06:00'],"['2002/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.7.3676 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Oct 1;169(7):3676-85. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.7.3676.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Icos protein, mouse)', '0 (Icosl protein, mouse)', '0 (Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Ligand)', '0 (Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",,,['CA89294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although activation of NF-kappaB by ligation of Fas (CD95/Apo-1), a member of the TNFR family, has been observed in a few studies, Fas-mediated NF-kappaB activation has not previously been shown to protect cells from apoptosis. We examined the Fas-induced NF-kappaB activation and its antiapoptotic effects in a leukemic eosinophil cell line, AML14.3D10, an AML14 subline resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. EMSA and supershift assays showed that agonist anti-Fas (CH11) induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB heterodimer p65(RelA)/p50 in these cells in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. The influence of NF-kappaB on the induction of apoptosis was studied using pharmacological proteasome inhibitors and an inhibitor of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation to block IkappaBalpha dissociation and degradation. These inhibitors at least partially inhibited NF-kappaB activation and augmented CH11-induced cell death. Stable transfection and overexpression of IkappaBalpha in 3D10 cells inhibited CH11-induced NF-kappaB activation and completely abrogated Fas resistance. Increases in caspase-8 and caspase-3 cleavage induced by CH11 and in consequent apoptotic killing were observed in these cells. Furthermore, while Fas-stimulation of resistant control 3D10 cells led to increases in the antiapoptotic proteins cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, Fas-induced apoptosis in IkappaBalpha-overexpressing cells led to the down-modulation of both of these proteins, as well as that of the Bcl-2 family protein, Bcl-x(L). These data suggest that the resistance of these leukemic eosinophils to Fas-mediated killing is due to induced NF-kappaB activation.","['Qin, Yimin', 'Camoretti-Mercado, Blanca', 'Blokh, Lyubov', 'Long, Catherine G', 'Ko, Franklin D', 'Hamann, Kimm J']","['Qin Y', 'Camoretti-Mercado B', 'Blokh L', 'Long CG', 'Ko FD', 'Hamann KJ']","['Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Eosinophils/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Protein Subunits', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/immunology', 'fas Receptor/*immunology/*metabolism']",2002/09/24 06:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/24 06:00'],"['2002/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.7.3536 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Oct 1;169(7):3536-44. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.7.3536.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,"['HL07650/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL56399/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL65558/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL66026/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggests that a number of adult cell populations have much broader stem cell capabilities than previously thought. To examine whether this applied to the hair follicle, and with a view to developing the follicle as a stem cell model system we investigated whether adult hair follicles were capable of demonstrating haematopoietic stem cell activity. To investigate haematopoietic activity in hair follicles we first used in vitro haematopoietic colony assays. This demonstrated that rodent hair follicle end bulbs as well as micro-dissected dermal papilla and dermal sheath cells actively produced cells of erythroid and myeloid lineages but that follicle epithelial cells did not. As a more stringent test, we then transplanted cultured dermal papilla or dermal sheath cells from transgenically marked donor mice into lethally irradiated recipient mice and observed multi-lineage haematopoietic reconstitution when assayed at intervals of up to one year. Colony assays from bone marrow of primary recipients revealed that over 70% of clonogenic precursors were derived from donor hair follicle cells. When bone marrow from primary mice was harvested and used to repopulate secondary myeloablated recipients, multi-lineage haematopoietic engraftment was observed. Our data show that dermal but not epidermal compartments of the adult hair follicle have much broader stem cell activities than previously described. Although the treatment for many forms of blood disorder, such as leukemia, often requires transplantation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), their availability can be rate limiting. Given its easy accessibility, our identification of the hair follicle as a source of extramedullary haematopoietic stem cell activity makes it an attractive potential source for blood stem cell therapeutics and highlights its value as a model system in adult stem cell biology.","['Lako, Majlinda', 'Armstrong, Lyle', 'Cairns, Paul M', 'Harris, Sue', 'Hole, Nicholas', 'Jahoda, Colin A B']","['Lako M', 'Armstrong L', 'Cairns PM', 'Harris S', 'Hole N', 'Jahoda CA']","['Department of Biological Sciences, South Road, University of Durham, Durham DH1 3LE, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/physiology/transplantation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Hair Follicle/cytology/*physiology/transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Hematopoietic System', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Skin/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Vibrissae/growth & development']",2002/09/24 06:00,2003/07/15 05:00,['2002/09/24 06:00'],"['2002/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1242/jcs.00060 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2002 Oct 15;115(Pt 20):3967-74. doi: 10.1242/jcs.00060.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It causes chemotaxis, generation of reactive oxygen species, and degranulation. However, only little is known of the molecular mechanisms by which LTB(4) induces these biological activities. To analyze the intracellular signaling pathways to mediate lysosomal enzyme release through the cloned LTB(4) receptor (BLT1), we transfected BLT1 to rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3). LTB(4) dose-dependently released beta-hexosaminidase, and the release was mostly inhibited when the cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin, indicating that the degranulation is mediated by G(i) proteins. LTB(4) activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) through G(i), and inhibition of PI3-K by wortmannin or LY290042 inhibited degranulation. Granulocytes from PI3-Kgamma-deficient mice showed reduced LTB(4)-induced degranulation, suggesting that this isozyme of PI3-K is involved in the degranulation. LTB(4) also caused calcium release from intracellular stores and calcium influx from the outside milieu through G(i), but only the calcium influx is critical for the lysosomal enzyme release. Calcium influx and PI3-K activation are both downstream events of G(i), since they were inhibited by pertussis toxin. These two events are in essence independent each other, because calcium depletion did not affect PI3-K, and inhibition of PI3-K did not attenuate calcium influx significantly. Thus, our results have clearly shown that LTB(4) binds BLT1 and activates G(i)-like protein, and both PI3-Kgamma activation and a sustained calcium elevation by calcium influx are necessary for enzyme release in these cells.","['Ito, Nobuko', 'Yokomizo, Takehiko', 'Sasaki, Takehiko', 'Kurosu, Hiroshi', 'Penninger, Josef', 'Kanaho, Yasunori', 'Katada, Toshiaki', 'Hanaoka, Kazuo', 'Shimizu, Takao']","['Ito N', 'Yokomizo T', 'Sasaki T', 'Kurosu H', 'Penninger J', 'Kanaho Y', 'Katada T', 'Hanaoka K', 'Shimizu T']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20020919,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Basophils/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/physiology', 'Chelating Agents/metabolism', 'Egtazic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukotriene B4/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Leukotriene B4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2002/09/24 06:00,2003/01/08 04:00,['2002/09/24 06:00'],"['2002/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M208051200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71584-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Nov 22;277(47):44898-904. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M208051200.

Advances in the setting of allogeneic stem cell transplantation now allow attempts to augment both immunological recovery and anti-tumour activity.

In addition, these actions were found to be related to the inhibitory activity toward DOX efflux from tumor cells in vitro. In this study, we searched for novel biochemical modulators of DOX among 3-n-propylxanthines with functional groups at the 1- or 7-position by using an assay system for their inhibitory effect on DOX efflux from P388 leukemia and DOX resistant P388 leukemia (P388/DOX) cells. 1-Substituted xanthines facilitated the DOX efflux from P388 cells. In contrast, among 7-substituted xanthines, XT-141 and XT-139 significantly inhibited the DOX efflux from P388 cells. In addition, XT-141 inhibited the DOX efflux from P388/DOX cells, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor facilitated DOX influx and inhibited DOX efflux from P388/DOX cells in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicated that the resistance of P388/DOX might depend on the over-expression of P-gp, and that XT-141 inhibited DOX efflux through its interaction with P-gp. We suspect that XT-141 is a useful biochemical modulator of DOX in DOX-resistant tumors with over-expression of P-gp in addition in DOX-sensitive tumors.","['Sadzuka, Yasuyuki', 'Egawa, Youichi', 'Sawanishi, Hiroyuki', 'Miyamoto, Ken-ichi', 'Sonobe, Takashi']","['Sadzuka Y', 'Egawa Y', 'Sawanishi H', 'Miyamoto K', 'Sonobe T']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, 422-8526, Shizuoka, Japan. sadzuka@u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Xanthines/*pharmacology']",2002/09/24 06:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/24 06:00'],"['2002/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0378427402002278 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-4274(02)00227-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2002 Sep 5;135(1-2):137-44. doi: 10.1016/s0378-4274(02)00227-8.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Xanthines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the concentrations of 0.3-3 microM, As(2)O(3) induces a dose-dependent cytotoxicity and growth inhibition on the JCS-16 cells. As(2)O(3) also induces apoptotic cell death, as judged by the presence of apoptotic nuclei, at 6 h after treatment. Morphological differentiation was not observed in As(2)O(3) treated JCS cells. Neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibody was found to reduce the As(2)O(3)-mediated apoptotic cell death of JCS-16 cells. Growth inhibitory effect of As(2)O(3) was also reduced after the addition of anti-TNF-alpha. In addition, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and reverse northern blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of TNF receptor (TNF-R2), IL-4, and IL-4R was down-regulate at 1 h after As(2)O(3) treatment.

The purpose of the present study was to develop a method to discriminate between uninfected flocks having ALV-E and ALV-J-infected flocks by ELISA. The GSA and anti-ALV-J antibody in the plasma samples from chickens at different ages in three grandparent farms were measured by ELISA. Infected flocks were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with different subgroup-specific primers and sequence analysis. The results indicated that the GSA of ALV-J-infected flocks increased, but that of the uninfected flocks decreased during young ages. The anti-ALV-J antibody of infected flocks was higher and increased earlier than that of uninfected flocks. Thus, measuring GSA in blood at the ages of 1 and 6 wk by ELISA is suitable to discriminate between ALV-J-infected flocks and uninfected flocks having ALV-E.","['Hwang, Chyi-Sing', 'Wang, Ching-Ho']","['Hwang CS', 'Wang CH']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Avian Leukosis/*diagnosis/immunology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/genetics/*immunology', '*Chickens', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Male', 'Phylogeny', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/veterinary', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/09/24 06:00,2003/04/18 05:00,['2002/09/24 06:00'],"['2002/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1637/0005-2086(2002)046[0598:SPOCIW]2.0.CO;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Avian Dis. 2002 Jul-Sep;46(3):598-604. doi: 10.1637/0005-2086(2002)046[0598:SPOCIW]2.0.CO;2.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, by selecting the polypurine-polypyrimidine stretch (2950-2978) in the human N-myc gene as a target, the (111)In-labeled TFO targeting human N-myc gene (N-mycTFO(111)In) was tested for its cellular uptake and nuclear localization in vitro and in vivo. This is because the deregulated N-myc expression is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of several important human malignancies, including breast carcinoma and neuroblastoma. N-mycTFO(111)In was bound selectively to the N-myc sequence in vitro. The total cellular uptake of TFO after the incubation of various normal and cancer cells with TFO for 24 h was 20-54.8% of the injected dose (%ID), and the nuclear localization was 6.59-30.0%ID, depending on cell lines. The highest cellular uptake was found in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-DZ (54.8%ID), human mammary ductal carcinoma T47-D (54%ID), human acute T cell leukemia Jurkat (54%ID), and multidrug-resistant human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7/TH (49.5%ID). The lowest was in the human normal mammary epithelium MCF10A (20.0%ID). The highest nuclear localization was found in MCF7/TH (30%ID) and SK-N-DZ (28.7%ID). The lowest was in MCF11A (6.59%ID). We next injected TFO into human mammary tumor-xenografted Balb/c nude mice. Tumor targeting of TFO in vivo reached its maximum peak 5 h after the intravenous injection in three types of tumor models. They are 21.0 +/- 3.23%ID per gram of tissue (%ID/g) for MCF7/TH, 7.77 +/- 2.11%ID/g for MCF7, and 4.53 +/- 1.20%ID/g for MCF10A. The TFO blood level decreased from 8.00 +/- 0.90%ID/g 15 min after the injection, to 1.30 +/- 0.30%ID/g after 19 h. The kidney TFO level increased rapidly from 5.93 +/- 0.94%ID/g after 15 min, to 25.1 +/- 5.60%ID/g after 19 h. A high TFO level (19.7-24.5%ID/g) in the liver was maintained until 19 h after the injection. Therefore, we suggest that the (111)In-labeled N-myc-targeting TFO, a promising modality for nanoexplosive gene therapy, could effectively target the nucleus of the multidrug-resistant breast carcinoma MCF7/TH in vitro and in vivo.

The amino acid sequence necessary for nucleolar localization was mapped to the MTG16a N-terminal region. MTG16a, like MTG8, the nuclear corepressor deranged by the t (8; 21), is capable to interact with specific histone deacetylases (HDACs) suggesting that the protein may mediate silencing of nucleolar gene transcription. In addition, MTG16a is capable to form oligomers with other MTG proteins. As a consequence of the t (16; 21) the AML1 DNA-binding domain replaces the MTG16a N-terminal region. The AML1-MTG16 fusion protein is targeted to the nucleoplasm where it is capable to oligomerize with MTG16a and interact with HDAC1 and HDAC3.

PLZF is expressed in quiescent progenitors: the expression level progressively rises through megakaryocytic development, whereas it gradually declines in erythroid and granulopoietic culture. To investigate the role of PLZF in megakaryopoiesis, we transduced the PLZF gene into the erythro-megakaryocytic TF1 cell line. PLZF overexpression upmodulates the megakaryocytic specific markers (CD42a, CD42b, CD61, PF4) and induces the thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR). The proximal promoter of the TpoR gene is activated in PLZF-expressing TF1 cells: in this promoter region, a PLZF DNA-binding site was identified by deletion constructs studies. Interestingly, PLZF and GATA1 proteins coimmunoprecipitate in PLZF-expressing TF1 cells: enforced expression of both PLZF and GATA1 in TF1 cells results in increased upregulation of megakaryocytic markers, as compared to exogenous PLZF or GATA1 alone, suggesting a functional role for the PLZF/GATA1 complex. Our data indicate that PLZF plays a significant stimulatory role in megakaryocytic development, seemingly mediated in part by induction of TpoR expression at transcriptional level. This stimulatory effect is potentiated by physical interaction of PLZF and GATA1, which are possibly assembled in a multiprotein transcriptional complex.","['Labbaye, Catherine', 'Quaranta, Maria Teresa', 'Pagliuca, Alfredo', 'Militi, Stefania', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Testa, Ugo', 'Peschle, Cesare']","['Labbaye C', 'Quaranta MT', 'Pagliuca A', 'Militi S', 'Licht JD', 'Testa U', 'Peschle C']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161 Rome, Italy. clabbaye@iss.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2002/09/21 10:00,2002/10/11 04:00,['2002/09/21 10:00'],"['2002/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2002/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/09/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205884 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Sep 26;21(43):6669-79. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205884.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",,,['CA 59936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-6 and IGF-1 have been shown to mediate proliferative and anti-apoptotic signals in plasmocytes. However, in primary plasma-cell leukemia (PCL) and in end-stage aggressive extramedullar disease, the cytokine requirement for both effects may be not mandatory. This suggests that constitutive activation of signaling pathways occurs. One of the signaling pathways whose deregulation may play an oncogenic role in MM is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) pathway. In human growth factor-independent MM cell lines OPM2 and RPMI8226, we show that the PI 3-K inhibitors LY294002 and Wortmannin strongly inhibited cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR)/P70-S6-kinase (P70(S6K)) pathway with rapamycin or of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway with PD98059 had minimal effect on proliferation. In both cell lines, constitutive activation of the PI 3-K/Akt/FKHRL-1, mTOR/P70(S6K) and MAPK pathways was detected. LY294002 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt, FKHRL-1 and P70(S6K) but had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that the PI 3-K and MAPK pathways are independent. IGF-1 but not IL-6 increased phosphorylation of Akt, FKHRL-1 and P70(S6K). Purified plasmocytes from four patients with MM and two patients with primary PCL were studied. In three of them including the two patients with PCL, constitutive phosphorylation of Akt, FKHRL-1 and P70(S6K) was present, inhibited by LY294002 and enhanced by IGF-1. In these patients with constitutive Akt activation, normal PTEN expression was detected. PI 3-K inhibition induced caspase-dependent apoptosis as confirmed by inhibition with the large spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and cleavage of pro-caspase-3. Both cell lines spontaneously expressed Skp2 and cyclin D1 proteins at high levels but no p27(Kip1) protein. In the presence of LY294002, cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1 was observed, p27(Kip1) protein expression was up-regulated whereas the expression of both Skp2 and cyclin D1 dramatically diminished. PI 3-K-dependent GSK-3alpha/beta constitutive phosphorylation was also detected in OPM2 cells that may contribute to high cyclin D1 expression. Overall, our results suggest that PI 3-K has a major role in the control of proliferation and apoptosis of growth factor-independent MM cell lines. Most of the biological effects of PI 3-K activation in these cell lines may be mediated by the opposite modulation of p27(Kip1) and Skp2 protein expression. Moreover, constitutive activation of this pathway is a frequent event in the biology of MM in vivo and may be more frequently observed in PCL.","['Pene, Frederic', 'Claessens, Yann-Erick', 'Muller, Odile', 'Viguie, Franck', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Bouscary, Didier']","['Pene F', 'Claessens YE', 'Muller O', 'Viguie F', 'Mayeux P', 'Dreyfus F', 'Lacombe C', 'Bouscary D']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Cochin, INSERM U567, CNRS UMR 8104, IFR 116, Universite Rene Descartes, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin D1/analysis', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Microfilament Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', '*Muscle Proteins', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/analysis', 'Protein Kinases/*physiology', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/*physiology', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/analysis', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",2002/09/21 10:00,2002/10/11 04:00,['2002/09/21 10:00'],"['2002/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2002/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/09/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205923 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Sep 26;21(43):6587-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205923.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tagln protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, E2a has been implicated as a gene with tumor suppressor activity, since mice deficient for E2a succumb to T cell lymphomas. We have performed retroviral tagging in EmuMyc transgenic mice to identify genes that contribute to lymphomagenesis. The EmuMyc transgenic mouse is a well-established model of a common translocation in human B cell lymphomas. Analyses of the proviral insertion sites in the MuLV-induced lymphomas revealed that a number of T cell lymphomas carried proviral insertions in the promoter region of E2a. These proviral insertions yield hybrid viral-E2a mRNAs resulting in a marked rise in E2A protein levels. The proviral insertions in E2a were predominantly of clonal origin indicating that E2a insertions are early events in these T cell lymphomas. The primary oncogenic effect of E2A is likely to be associated with enhancement of transcription of the c-Myc transgene via binding to the regulatory immunoglobulin enhancers.

We have inactivated the murine homologue of AF9 to elucidate its normal role. No effect on hematopoiesis was observed in mice with a null mutation of Af9. However, an Af9 null mutation caused perinatal lethality, and homozygous mice exhibited anomalies of the axial skeleton. Both the cervical and thoracic regions were affected by anterior homeotic transformation. Strikingly, mice lacking functional Af9 exhibited a grossly deformed atlas and an extra cervical vertebra. To determine the molecular mediators of this phenotype, analysis of Hox gene expression by in situ hybridization showed that Af9 null embryos have posterior changes in Hoxd4 gene expression. We conclude that the Af9 gene is required for normal embryogenesis in mice by controlling pattern formation, apparently via control of Hox gene regulation.

Flow cytometric data were obtained from six PL- cattle and compared with six age-matched animals with persistent lymphocytosis (PL+) and five non-infected healthy controls (BLV-). In the PL- group, the percentage and number of surface immunoglobulin-positive (sIg+) B cells were significantly reduced. Whereas in BLV-cattle, about 40% of the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were sIg + and 24% were sIgM + B cells. In the PL- group, less than 20% of the PBL were sIg+ and sIgM+ B cells. Only 5% of the PBL co-expressed sIgM+ and CD5+ versus 16% in BLV-. This decrease was persistent over 3 years and predominantly affected: (i) B cells that did not express sIgM; (ii) sIgM + B cells co-expressing CD5 and CD11b; and (iii) equally both lambda- and K-type light chain B-cell subpopulations. In contrast, the number of all circulating lymphocytes, CD5- and CD11b- sIgM+ B cells and CD2+ T cells did not differ. In PL+ animals, about 75% of the PBL were sIgM+ CD5+ B cells. These cells were of polyclonal origin, as light chains of the lambda- and K-type were expressed in a ratio of 4:1 (57.7% of PBL lambda+, 14% kappa+) as in BLV- animals (33.6% of PBL lambda+, 8.7% kappa+). In PL+ cattle the absolute number of B-cells and, therefore, their relative percentage is significantly increased. For this reason, even in case of absolutely increased T-cell numbers, the relative percentage of T-cells could be lower than in normal controls. The cause for the observed B cell decrease in PL- cattle is unknown, but it can be assumed that cytotoxic T cells are involved in this B-cell lymphopenia.","['Beyer, J', 'Kollner, B', 'Teifke, J P', 'Starick, E', 'Beier, D', 'Reimann, I', 'Grunwald, U', 'Ziller, M']","['Beyer J', 'Kollner B', 'Teifke JP', 'Starick E', 'Beier D', 'Reimann I', 'Grunwald U', 'Ziller M']","['Institute of Infectology, Federal Research Centre for Virus Diseases of Animals, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institutes, Insel Riems, Germany. joerg.beyer@rie.bfav.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,"Journal of veterinary medicine.

In addition, in vitro response to the cytostatic drug doxorubicin was evaluated by means of a growth inhibition assay. The number of significant DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) varied from 0 to 16 per cell line and the number of additional alterations with borderline significance was in a range of 0-7. Three of the cell lines had a total number of genomic changes of >/=20, five had 11-19, and eight had </=10 CNAs. One cell line did not show any imbalance at all. Among the significant CNAs, losses of genomic material were slightly more frequent than gains (60:49). Gains dominated among the borderline alterations compared to losses (45:9). CNAs common to all cell lines examined were not found. The most frequent genomic imbalance (gain of 6q23) was shared by 9 of the 15 cell lines. A significant loss of 18q23 was observed in eight lines, however, often close to borderline significance. Seven of the cell lines were characterized by a loss of the entire short arm of chromosome 9 or parts of it with 9p21 as minimal band of overlap. Interestingly, cell lines with a 9p21 deletion exhibited twice the number of gains and 1.6 times the number of losses per line as compared with the cell lines without this deletion. A consistent pattern of the CNAs accompanying the 9p deletion could not be detected, although some associations were more obvious than others, e.g., gains of 6q22 in five cell lines with del(9p21), of 6p21 in four lines combined with a gain of 6q22, and of 20q in four cell lines, of 1p32 in three of these seven lines, a loss of 14q32 in three of them. Three of the lines with 9p deletion had gains of 6p21, 6q22 and 20q in common. Enh(6q22) or dim(14q32), respectively, were found in only one of the nine cell lines without the 9p deletion. Based on the dose response curves of the cell lines for doxorubicin, eight doxorubicin-sensitive cell lines had an inhibition concentration 50% (IC50) <10 nM (CCRF-CEM2, JURKAT, KE-37, MOLT-3, MOLT-4, P12-Ichikawa, PEER, and RPMI-8402) and seven doxorubicin-resistant cell lines had an IC50 >10 nM (BE-13, CCRF-CEM1, HUT-78, J-Jhan, Karpas-45, MOLT-17, and PF-382).

Recently, a few studies showed that the acids may have anti-cancer effect on leukemia and brain tumours. We investigated the apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects of two types of boswellic acids, keto-beta-boswellic acid and acetyl-keto-beta-boswellic acid, on liver cancer Hep G2 cells. After treating the cells with the boswellic acids, cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and apoptosis were analysed. The activities of caspase-3, -8 and -9 were assayed. To explore the apoptotic pathway, specific caspase inhibitors were employed. It was found that boswellic acids decreased cell viability and [3H]thymidine incorporation, checked the cells in the G1 phase, and increased percentage of sub-G1. Boswellic acids strongly induced apoptosis accompanied by activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9. The apoptosis was blocked completely by caspase-8 or caspase-3 inhibitor, but inhibited partly by caspase-9 inhibitor. However, these caspase inhibitors did not show any effect on the alternations of cell viability caused by boswellic acids. In conclusion, boswellic acids have anti-proliferation and anti-cancer effects on Hep G2 cells. The apoptotic effect is mediated by a pathway dependent on caspase-8 activation. The acids may be a promising drug for the chemoprevention of liver cancer.","['Liu, Jian-Jun', 'Nilsson, Ake', 'Oredsson, Stina', 'Badmaev, Vladimir', 'Duan, Rui-Dong']","['Liu JJ', 'Nilsson A', 'Oredsson S', 'Badmaev V', 'Duan RD']","['Biomedical Center, B11, Lund University, S-22184 Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology']",2002/09/20 10:00,2003/03/12 04:00,['2002/09/20 10:00'],"['2002/09/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/20 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2002 Oct;10(4):501-5.,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '631-69-6 (boswellic acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we provide evidence that arsenic trioxide induces activation of the small G-protein Rac1 and the alpha and beta isoforms of the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in several leukemia cell lines. Such activation of Rac1 and p38-isoforms results in downstream engagement of the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 and is enhanced by pre-treatment of cells with ascorbic acid. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of p38 potentiates arsenic-dependent apoptosis and suppression of growth of leukemia cell lines, suggesting that this signaling cascade negatively regulates induction of antileukemic responses by arsenic trioxide. Consistent with this, overexpression of a dominant-negative p38 mutant (p38betaAGF) enhances the antiproliferative effects of arsenic trioxide on target cells. To further define the relevance of activation of the Rac1/p38 MAP kinase pathway in the induction of arsenic-dependent antileukemic effects, studies were performed using bone marrows from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Arsenic trioxide suppressed the growth of leukemic myeloid (CFU-GM) progenitors from such patients, whereas concomitant pharmacological inhibition of the p38 pathway enhanced its growth-suppressive effects. Altogether, these data provide evidence for a novel function of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, acting as a negative regulator of arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis and inhibition of malignant cell growth.","['Verma, Amit', 'Mohindru, Mani', 'Deb, Dilip K', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Kambhampati, Suman', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Kalvakolanu, Dhananjaya V', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Verma A', 'Mohindru M', 'Deb DK', 'Sassano A', 'Kambhampati S', 'Ravandi F', 'Minucci S', 'Kalvakolanu DV', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

Molecular alterations in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the PML/RARalpha fusion gene that characterizes APL constitute one mechanism of acquired resistance to ATRA. We identified missense mutations in PML/RARalpha from an additional ATRA-resistant patient at relapse and in a novel ATRA-resistant cell line, NB4-MRA1. These cause altered binding to ligand and transcriptional coregulators, leading to a dominant-negative block of transcription. These mutations are in regions of the LBD that appear to be mutational hot spots occurring repeatedly in ATRA-resistant APL patient cells. We evaluated whether histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition could overcome the effects of these mutations on ATRA-induced gene expression. Cotreatment with ATRA and TSA restored RARbeta gene expression in NB4-MRA1 cells, whose PML/RARalpha mutation is in helix 12 of the LBD, but not in an APL cell line harboring the patient-derived PML/RARalpha mutation, which was between helix 5 and 6. Furthermore, ATRA combined with TSA increases histone 4 acetylation on the RARbeta promoter only in NB4-MRA1 cells. Consistent with these results, the combined treatment induces differentiation of NB4-MRA1 only. Thus, the ability of an HDAC inhibitor to restore ATRA sensitivity in resistant cells may depend on their specific molecular defects. The variety of PML/RARalpha mutations arising in ATRA-resistant patients begins to explain how APL patients in relapse may differ in response to transcription therapy with HDAC inhibitors.","['Cote, Sylvie', 'Rosenauer, Angelika', 'Bianchini, Andrea', 'Seiter, Karen', 'Vandewiele, Jonathan', 'Nervi, Clara', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Cote S', 'Rosenauer A', 'Bianchini A', 'Seiter K', 'Vandewiele J', 'Nervi C', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

Bisulfite sequencing analysis of its promoter region showed that p57(KIP2) DNA was completely methylated in cell lines that did not express the p57(KIP2) gene. Thus, DNA methylation of its promoter might lead to inactivation of the p57(KIP2) gene. DNA methylation of this region is thought to be an aberrant alteration, since DNA was not methylated in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in reactive lymphadenitis.

Inv(16)(p13;q22) is found in almost all cases of AML M4Eo and results in the fusion of CBFB with MYH11, the gene encoding smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. Mouse embryos heterozygous for a Cbfb-MYH11 knock-in gene lack definitive hematopoiesis, a phenotype shared by Cbfb(-/-) embryos. In this study we generated a Cbfb-GFP knock-in mouse model to characterize the normal expression pattern of Cbfbeta in hematopoietic cells. In midgestation embryos, Cbfbeta was expressed in populations enriched for hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. This population of stem cells and progenitors was not present in mouse embryos heterozygous for the Cbfb-MYH11 knock-in gene. Together, these data suggest that Cbfb-MYH11 blocks embryonic hematopoiesis at the stem-progenitor cell level and that Cbfb is essential for the generation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

Stem cell leukemia (SCL, also known as TAL1 [T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1]) is a tissue-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor that plays a central function in hematopoietic development; however, its target genes and molecular mode of action remain to be elucidated. Here we show that SCL and the c-Kit receptor are coexpressed in hematopoietic progenitors at the single-cell level and that SCL induces c-kit in chromatin, as ectopic SCL expression in transgenic mice sustains c-kit transcription in developing B lymphocytes, in which both genes are normally down-regulated. Through transient transfection assays and coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, we define the role of SCL as a nucleation factor for a multifactorial complex (SCL complex) that specifically enhances c-kit promoter activity without affecting the activity of myelomonocytic promoters. This complex, containing hematopoietic-specific (SCL, Lim-only 2 (LMO2), GATA-1/GATA-2) and ubiquitous (E2A, LIM- domain binding protein 1 [Ldb-1]) factors, is tethered to DNA via a specificity protein 1 (Sp1) motif, through direct interactions between elements of the SCL complex and the Sp1 zinc finger protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate by chromatin immunoprecipitation that SCL, E2A, and Sp1 specifically co-occupy the c-kit promoter in vivo. We therefore conclude that c-kit is a direct target of the SCL complex. Proper activation of the c-kit promoter depends on the combinatorial interaction of all members of the complex. Since SCL is down-regulated in maturing cells while its partners remain expressed, our observations suggest that loss of SCL inactivates the SCL complex, which may be an important event in the differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic cells.","['Lecuyer, Eric', 'Herblot, Sabine', 'Saint-Denis, Marianne', 'Martin, Richard', 'Begley, C Glenn', 'Porcher, Catherine', 'Orkin, Stuart H', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Lecuyer E', 'Herblot S', 'Saint-Denis M', 'Martin R', 'Begley CG', 'Porcher C', 'Orkin SH', 'Hoang T']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal and from the Departments of Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2002/09/20 10:00,2002/12/06 04:00,['2002/09/20 10:00'],"['2002/09/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0568 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54183-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Oct 1;100(7):2430-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0568.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The occurrence of monocytic maturation was demonstrated by a significant increase of both CD14 and CD11b surface expression, the acquisition of morphologic features typical of mature monocytes, and phagocytic capacity in TRAIL-treated cultures. By using selective pharmacologic inhibitors, it was possible to demonstrate that activation of the caspase cascade played a crucial role in mediating TRAIL cytotoxicity and monocytic maturation of HL-60 cells. Moreover, experiments performed using agonistic polyclonal antibodies, which mimic the interactions between TRAIL and each TRAIL receptor, indicated that TRAIL-R1 was responsible for mediating the TRAIL-induced maturation. Importantly, the maturational effects of TRAIL were observed also in primary normal CD34(+) cells, seeded in serum-free liquid cultures for 4 to 8 days in the presence of SCF + GM-CSF. After treatment with TRAIL for 3 additional days, a significant increase in CD14 and CD11b expression, coupled with an increased number of mature monocytes and macrophages, was noticed in the absence of cytotoxicity. These data disclose a novel role for TRAIL as a positive regulator of myeloid differentiation. Moreover, the dichotomous effect of TRAIL on malignant cells (early induction of apoptosis and monocytic maturation of the surviving cells) might have important therapeutic implications for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Secchiero, Paola', 'Gonelli, Arianna', 'Mirandola, Prisco', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'Zamai, Loris', 'Celeghini, Claudio', 'Milani, Daniela', 'Zauli, Giorgio']","['Secchiero P', 'Gonelli A', 'Mirandola P', 'Melloni E', 'Zamai L', 'Celeghini C', 'Milani D', 'Zauli G']","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, Human Anatomy Section, University of Ferrara, Italy. secchier@mail.umbi.umd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'CD11b Antigen/analysis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Primers', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/09/20 10:00,2002/12/06 04:00,['2002/09/20 10:00'],"['2002/09/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0047 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54182-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Oct 1;100(7):2421-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0047.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used flow cytometric techniques capable of detecting 1 leukemic cell among 10 000 or more normal cells to compare MRD measurements in 718 pairs of bone marrow and peripheral blood samples collected from 226 children during treatment for newly diagnosed ALL. MRD was detected in marrow and blood in 72 pairs and in marrow but not in blood in 67 pairs; it was undetectable in the remaining 579 pairs. Remarkably, findings in marrow and blood were completely concordant in the 150 paired samples from patients with T-lineage ALL: for each of the 35 positive marrow samples, the corresponding blood sample was positive. In B-lineage ALL, however, only 37 of 104 positive marrow samples had a corresponding positive blood sample. Notably, peripheral blood MRD in these patients was associated with a very high risk for disease recurrence. The 4-year cumulative incidence of relapse in patients with B-lineage ALL was 80.0% +/- 24.9% for those who had peripheral blood MRD at the end of remission induction therapy but only 13.3% +/- 9.1% for those with MRD confined to the marrow (P =.007).

HSCT increased in all European countries and for all indications. There were major differences depending on disease indication and donor type. Transplantation rates (numbers of HSCTs per 10 million inhabitants) varied from less than 1 for some rare indications to 37.7 +/- 4.1 for acute myeloid leukemia in allogeneic HSCT or 95.5 +/- 13.5 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in autologous HSCT. There were indications with a steady, continuing increase and others with initial increase but subsequent decrease. Projections on medium-term development for each disease based on a weighted sensitivity analysis predict an ongoing increase in allogeneic HSCT except for chronic myeloid leukemia. In autologous HSCT they predict an increase for lymphoproliferative disorders, acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and some solid tumors but a decrease for most solid tumors, acute lymphoid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia. Transplantation rates can be predicted with reasonable sensitivity for most disease indications. Despite marked changes in the rapidly developing field of HSCT, this information on current use, trends, and midterm predictions forms a rational basis for patient counseling and health care planning.","['Gratwohl, Alois', 'Baldomero, Helen', 'Horisberger, Bruno', 'Schmid, Caroline', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Urbano-Ispizua, Alvaro']","['Gratwohl A', 'Baldomero H', 'Horisberger B', 'Schmid C', 'Passweg J', 'Urbano-Ispizua A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Department of Research, Kantonsspital Basel, Switzerland. hematology@uhbs.ch']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Europe', 'Hematologic Diseases/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/therapy', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data/*trends']",2002/09/20 10:00,2002/12/06 04:00,['2002/09/20 10:00'],"['2002/09/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-03-0675 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54175-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Oct 1;100(7):2374-86. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-03-0675.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Accreditation Committee of the European Group for Blood and Marrow', 'Transplantation (EBMT)']",,,,,

All patients received a standard induction course followed by a course of mitoxantrone and intermediate-dose cytarabine (HAM). After each course, minimal residual disease was tested by specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (median sensitivity, 10(-5)). Allogeneic SCT (if a donor) or autologous SCT (if not) was planned at 3 months in all patients in CR after HAM. CR rates after induction, after HAM, and at 3 months were 53%, 67%, and 62%, respectively. High leukocyte count and m-bcr subtype were the 2 identified bad-prognosis factors for CR at 3 months, both superseded by a poor early response assessed at day 8 of the induction course. HAM-associated salvage rate was higher in patients with M-bcr than in those with m-bcr ALL (55% vs 30%; P =.05).

The aim of this study was to determine whether immunophenotypic abnormalities could be defined in MDSs and could correlate with the French-American-British classification and cytogenetics. Analysis was performed on 275 BM samples (207 MDS patients, 68 controls) and 25 control blood samples. Immunophenotyping was based on a primary gating of blast cells, monocytes, and granulocytes according to CD45 antigen expression and side scatter light diffraction. Immunophenotypic hierarchical clustering was performed to analyze the results. The data obtained show that (1) immunophenotypic clustering partly discriminates patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts/refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB/RAEB-T), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and refractory anemia/refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RA/RARS) for CD45(lo) blast cells and patients with RA/CMML, RARS, and RAEB/RAEB-T for CD45(hi)/side scatter(hi) (SS(hi)) granulocytes; (2) the most discriminating markers were CD16, CD34, CD36, CD38, CD71, and HLA-DR for blast cells and CD11b, CD13, CD33, CD36, CD38, CD71, and HLA-DR for CD45(hi)/SS(hi) granulocytes; (3) clusters related to CD34 expression were associated with high levels of blast cells on BM smear; (4) clusters related to high levels of CD36 expression on CD45(lo) blast cells and CD45(hi)/SS(hi) granulocytes were associated with a poor International Prognosis Scoring System score; and (5) high levels of CD71 expression on CD45(hi)/SS(hi) granulocytes were associated with the RARS category.

It was found that both phosphorylation of STAT1 and -3 and activation of the promoter activity rapidly and transiently take place within minutes and 2-6 h, respectively, in favor of a direct effect of the LIF pathway on POMC promoter. Activated STAT1 and -3 form homo-/heterodimers able to bind the Sis-inducible element. The most abundant Sis-inducible element binding dimers are STAT3/3 and STAT1/3. Degenerated STAT1/3-binding sites from the POMC promoter were tested for their ability to bind activated STAT1 and 3; only the -390/-379 site, partially overlapping the Nur response element, binds with low affinity activated STAT1 and -3. Analysis of the three domains and subregions of the POMC promoter showed that two subregions are specifically responsive to LIF. The response of the distal subregion requires the intact STAT1 and -3 DNA-binding site -390/-379, whereas the responsiveness of the proximal subregion takes place despite the absence of direct STAT1 and -3 DNA binding and may imply interaction of activated STAT with basal transcription factors.","['Mynard, Vanessa', 'Guignat, Laurence', 'Devin-Leclerc, Jocelyne', 'Bertagna, Xavier', 'Catelli, Maria Grazia']","['Mynard V', 'Guignat L', 'Devin-Leclerc J', 'Bertagna X', 'Catelli MG']","[""Departement d'Endocrinologie et Biologie Cellulaire, Institut Cochin, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universite Rene Descartes, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Dimerization', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects/*physiology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism/physiology']",2002/09/20 10:00,2002/10/22 04:00,['2002/09/20 10:00'],"['2002/09/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/en.2002-220323 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2002 Oct;143(10):3916-24. doi: 10.1210/en.2002-220323.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains unclear which receptors are more crucial for the foam cell formation and progression. In the present study, we compared five major scavenger receptors (SR-A, CD36, CLA-1, CD68, and LOX-1) in their levels of expression at the different stages of foam cells derived from THP-1 cells. The expression of all scavenger receptors examined was up-regulated by the stimulation with TPA for 48 hours, despite the expressions of SR-A, CD36 and LOX-1 being very low before the treatment with TPA. Four to 7 days after the removal of TPA, the levels of CD36, CLA-1 and CD68 were increased significantly. In contrast, the expression of SR-A was suppressed significantly, and no change was observed in that of LOX-1. Furthermore, when the transformed macrophages were incubated with oxidized LDL, in which the uptake of [3H] cholesteryl oleoyl ether-labeled OxLDL was linear up to 7 days after the addition of OxLDL, the expression of CD36, CLA-1 and CD68 were greatly enhanced. This enhancement was more prominent than that without oxidized LDL, and the enhancement was sustained throughout the experimental period. On the other hand, SR-A was not up-regulated, and LOX-1 was down-regulated. We thus propose that CD36, CLA-1 and CD68, but not SR-A and LOX-1, may play crucial roles in the progression of macrophages to foam cells, which is a key step for the initiation of atherosclerosis.","['Tsukamoto, Kayo', 'Kinoshita, Makoto', 'Kojima, Kyoko', 'Mikuni, Yoko', 'Kudo, Mikiko', 'Mori, Masaki', 'Fujita, Mineko', 'Horie, Eiko', 'Shimazu, Nobuko', 'Teramoto, Tamio']","['Tsukamoto K', 'Kinoshita M', 'Kojima K', 'Mikuni Y', 'Kudo M', 'Mori M', 'Fujita M', 'Horie E', 'Shimazu N', 'Teramoto T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,J Atheroscler Thromb,Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis,9506298,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*genetics/metabolism', 'CD36 Antigens/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cholesterol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Foam Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*cytology/metabolism', '*Receptors, Immunologic', 'Receptors, LDL/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Lipoprotein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Oxidized LDL', 'Receptors, Scavenger', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class A', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class B', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class E', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/20 10:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2002/09/20 10:00'],"['2002/09/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.5551/jat.9.57 [doi]'],ppublish,J Atheroscler Thromb. 2002;9(1):57-64. doi: 10.5551/jat.9.57.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (OLR1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (Receptors, Lipoprotein)', '0 (Receptors, Oxidized LDL)', '0 (Receptors, Scavenger)', '0 (SCARB1 protein, human)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class A)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class B)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class E)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '66106-91-0 (cholesteryl oleyl ether)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some degree of depression is to be expected among parents caring for a loved one with leukemia. This study was done to determine the frequency of depression in parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in relation to age, gender, education, occupation, and performance status of their patients. METHODS: The study was conducted at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore, Pakistan over a period of three months, from May, 2000 to July, 2000. Either parent of 60 consecutive patients of acute lymphoblastic leukemia who achieved their first remission within last one-month were enrolled. Their age, gender, education, occupation, socioeconomic status, and non-medical risk factors of depression were recorded. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Structured Clinical Interview according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fourth version (SCID-IV) were used to identify parents with depression. Data regarding sociodemographic variables and non-medical risk factors of depression were recorded on data capture form. Data analysis was done by SPSS--10. Overall differences were assessed using percentages and chi-square. RESULTS: Depression was found to be positive among 56.7% (34) of the parents. It was more common among mothers, less educated parents and among those belonging to lower socioeconomic class. Parents attributed their depression to multiple factors; most common were related to concerns about family's well-being, financial constraints and distressing change in role and responsibilities. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that a majority of attending parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia suffers from depression and it is not associated with any of the variables studied. We need to conduct further studies on a large number of parents in order to make any logical conclusions.","['Iqbal, Akhtar', 'Siddiqui, Khawer S']","['Iqbal A', 'Siddiqui KS']","['Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore, Pakistan. iakhtar@brain.net.pk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Pakistan,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,"Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",8910750,IM,,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Depression/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pakistan', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology']",2002/09/20 10:00,2002/10/11 04:00,['2002/09/20 10:00'],"['2002/09/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/20 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad. 2002 Apr-Jun;14(2):6-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While cutaneous mastocytosis is relatively frequent mast cell leukemia belongs to the rarest forms of human leukemia. In the following we present the case of an aleukemic mast cell leukemia and shall discuss the revised classification of mastocytosis based on the ""Year 2000 Working Conference on Mastocytosis"" held in Vienna, Austria. A 48 year-old caucasian man presented with a four-week history of diarrhea, obstipation, vomiting, rash, and mild fever. Clinical inspection revealed a disseminated itching rash and a mild hepatomegaly. Red and white blood cell counts were within the normal range. Levels of the alkaline phosphatase and serum histamine were significantly increased. There was no splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Cytologic and histologic investigation of the bone marrow revealed a marked increase in atypical mast cells. Since only a few circulating mast cells could be detected in a cytospin preparation of the blood, the diagnosis of an aleukemic mast cell leukemia was established. About four weeks after the diagnosis had been established, the patient died with signs of a hemorrhagic shock due to a massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Autopsy revealed widespread mast cell infiltration of bone marrow, spleen, liver and lungs, but also a small, deeply penetrating, non-specific duodenal ulcer. In conclusion, despite of presentation with signs of a primary gastrointestinal disorder, the patient was found to suffer from an exceedingly rare aleukemic mast cell leukemia (""malignant mastocytosis"") and died after a total duration of the disease of only about three months.","['Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Krokowski, Manuela', 'Feller, Alfred C', 'Hintze, Gerhard', 'Sotlar, Karl', 'Valent, Peter']","['Horny HP', 'Krokowski M', 'Feller AC', 'Hintze G', 'Sotlar K', 'Valent P']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Medizinische Universitat zu Lubeck (MUL), Lubeck. horny@patho.mu-luebeck.de']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,IM,['Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2002 Mar 28;114(5-6):173-4.

While ALV-A is predominantly associated with lymphoid leukosis (LL) and less frequently with erythroblastosis (EB), ALV-J mainly induces tumours of the myeloid lineage. In order to examine the basis for the lineage specificity of tumour induction by these two ALV subgroups, we constructed two chimeric viruses by substituting the env genes into the reciprocal proviral clones. The chimeric HPRS-103(A) virus carrying the subgroup A env gene is identical to ALV-J prototype virus HPRS-103 except for the env gene, and the chimeric RCAS(J) virus carrying the subgroup J env gene is identical to the parent replication-competent ALV-A vector RCAS except for the env gene. In experimentally inoculated chickens, HPRS-103(A) virus induced LL and EB similar to ALV-A isolates such as RAV-1, while RCAS(J) virus induced myeloid leukosis (ML) and EB, similar to ALV-J, suggesting that the env gene is the major determinant for the lineage-specific oncogenicity. There were genetic differences in susceptibility to tumour induction between line 0 and line 15(I) chickens, indicating that in addition to the env gene, other viral or host factors could also serve as determinants for oncogenicity. Induction of both LL and ML by the two chimeric viruses occurred through the activation of c-myc, while the EB tumours were induced by activation of the c-erbB oncogene.","['Chesters, P M', 'Howes, K', 'Petherbridge, L', 'Evans, S', 'Payne, L N', 'Venugopal, K']","['Chesters PM', 'Howes K', 'Petherbridge L', 'Evans S', 'Payne LN', 'Venugopal K']","['Viral Oncogenesis Group, Institute for Animal Health, Compton, Berkshire RG20 7NN, UK1.', 'Viral Oncogenesis Group, Institute for Animal Health, Compton, Berkshire RG20 7NN, UK1.', 'Viral Oncogenesis Group, Institute for Animal Health, Compton, Berkshire RG20 7NN, UK1.', 'Viral Oncogenesis Group, Institute for Animal Health, Compton, Berkshire RG20 7NN, UK1.', 'Viral Oncogenesis Group, Institute for Animal Health, Compton, Berkshire RG20 7NN, UK1.', 'Viral Oncogenesis Group, Institute for Animal Health, Compton, Berkshire RG20 7NN, UK1.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,,"['Alpharetrovirus/genetics/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA, Viral', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, myc', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*virology', 'Lymphocytes', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Virus Integration']",2002/09/19 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/09/19 10:00'],"['2002/09/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-83-10-2553 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2002 Oct;83(Pt 10):2553-2561. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-83-10-2553.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF416332', 'GENBANK/AF416333', 'GENBANK/AY029740', 'GENBANK/AY029741', 'GENBANK/AY029742', 'GENBANK/AY029743', 'GENBANK/AY029744', 'GENBANK/AY029745', 'GENBANK/AY029746']",,,,,,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-83-10-2553 [doi],,

Because NF-kappaB transcription factors represent key regulators of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, we supposed that the anti-inflammatory effects of Aglaia extracts are mediated by the inhibition of NF-kappaB activity. Purified compounds of Aglaia species, namely 1H-cyclopenta[b]benzofuran lignans of the rocaglamide type as well as one aglain congener were tested for their ability to inhibit NF-kappaB activity. We show that a group of rocaglamides represent highly potent and specific inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene activity in Jurkat T cells with IC(50) values in the nanomolar range. Some derivatives are less effective, and others are completely inactive. Rocaglamides are able to suppress the PMA-induced expression of NF-kappaB target genes and sensitize leukemic T cells to apoptosis induced by TNFalpha, cisplatin, and gamma-irradiation. The suppression of NF-kappaB activation correlated with the inhibition of induced IkappaB(alpha) degradation and IkappaB(alpha) kinase activation. The level of interference was determined and found to be localized upstream of the IkappaB kinase complex but downstream of the TNF receptor-associated protein 2. Our data suggest that rocaglamide derivatives could serve as lead structures in the development of anti-inflammatory and tumoricidal drugs.","['Baumann, Bernd', 'Bohnenstengel, Frank', 'Siegmund, Daniela', 'Wajant, Harald', 'Weber, Christoph', 'Herr, Ingrid', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Proksch, Peter', 'Wirth, Thomas']","['Baumann B', 'Bohnenstengel F', 'Siegmund D', 'Wajant H', 'Weber C', 'Herr I', 'Debatin KM', 'Proksch P', 'Wirth T']","['Department of Physiological Chemistry, Ulm University, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20020916,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzofurans/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2002/09/19 10:00,2003/01/08 04:00,['2002/09/19 10:00'],"['2002/09/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M208003200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71572-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Nov 22;277(47):44791-800. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M208003200.

Tax activated the -1044, -163, and -125 TNF-alpha promoters by 9-25-fold but not the -82 promoter, demonstrating that Tax activation requires the -125 to -82 region, known as the TNF response element (TNF-RE). Three copies of the TNF-RE upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter conferred a similar magnitude of activation by Tax. We demonstrated that c-Jun, NFkappaB, p50, and p65 interact with and activate the TNF-RE by using mutational analysis of the TNF-RE, Tax mutants that selectively activate NFkappaB or the cAMP-response element binding protein/activating transcription factor pathway, and gel shift assays with nuclear extracts. Estradiol markedly repressed Tax-activated transcription of the TNF-alpha gene with estrogen receptor (ER) alpha or beta. Nuclear extracts from U2OS cells stably transfected with ER(alpha) demonstrated that ERs interact with the TNF-RE. Our studies provide evidence that ERs repress Tax-activated TNF-alpha transcription by interacting with a c-Jun and NFkappaB platform on the TNF-RE. Estrogens may ameliorate bone and inflammatory joint diseases in patients infected with HTLV-I by repressing transcription of the TNF-alpha gene.","['Tzagarakis-Foster, Christina', 'Geleziunas, Romas', 'Lomri, Abderrahim', 'An, Jinping', 'Leitman, Dale C']","['Tzagarakis-Foster C', 'Geleziunas R', 'Lomri A', 'An J', 'Leitman DC']","['Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Center for Reproductive Sciences, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0556, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20020916,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Estradiol/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics/metabolism']",2002/09/19 10:00,2003/01/08 04:00,['2002/09/19 10:00'],"['2002/09/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M205355200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71569-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Nov 22;277(47):44772-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M205355200.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the ability of dexamethasone (Dex) to induce ANXA1 secretion and to investigate the roles of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and of the GC receptor, on that process. For this purpose, the human immature lymphoblastic CCRF-CEM cell line was used. Treatment of the cells with Dex, for up to 4 h, significantly reduced the intracellular content of ANXA1 and increased the amount of this protein bound to the outer surface of the plasma membrane, whereas exposure of cells to Dex, for 12 h, induced the synthesis of ANXA1. At the same short time periods, Dex also induced a significant increase in the [Ca2+]i. Incubation of the cells with BAPTA-AM (10 microM), a cell-permeant high affinity Ca2+ chelator, completely inhibited Dex-induced ANXA1 secretion. Furthermore, the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, alone induced ANXA1 cleavage, but not its secretion. Additionally, we used brefeldin A to investigate the involvement of the classical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi pathway of protein secretion in the release of ANXA1. The GC receptor antagonist, RU486, neither reverted the Dex-dependent ANXA1 secretion nor inhibited the increase of the [Ca2+]i induced by Dex. Together, our results indicate that Dex induces ANXA1 synthesis and secretion in CCRF-CEM cells. ANXA1 secretion in this cell type show the following characteristics: (i) is unlikely to involve the classical ER-Golgi pathway; (ii) requires a Ca(2+)-dependent cleavage of ANXA1; (iii) involves both Ca(2+)-dependent and independent mechanisms; and (iv) is apparently independent of the GC receptor alpha isoform.","['Castro-Caldas, M', 'Duarte, C B', 'Carvalho, A P', 'Lopes, M C Fernandes']","['Castro-Caldas M', 'Duarte CB', 'Carvalho AP', 'Lopes MC']","['Center for Neuroscience of Coimbra, Department of Zoology, University of Coimbra, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,,"['Annexin A1/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brefeldin A/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Egtazic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/19 10:00,2003/04/16 05:00,['2002/09/19 10:00'],"['2002/09/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1016502120139 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2002 Aug;237(1-2):31-8. doi: 10.1023/a:1016502120139.,"['0 (Annexin A1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', ""139890-68-9 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid"", 'acetoxymethyl ester)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The detection of this genetic marker confirms the diagnosis and allows monitoring of the leukemic clone during treatment, which has prognostic value. Cytogenetics fails in some cases due to the absence of metaphases in cultures or their bad morphology. Southern blot and PCR methods require trained personnel and adequate equipment. FISH method allows the identification of chromosomic rearrangements in 24 to 48 h and is simple to set up in a cytogenetics laboratory. AIM: To evaluate the FISH method to detect PML/RAR alpha fusion, compared to cytogenetic analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen bone marrow specimens from APL patients with previous cytogenetic analysis were studied, using a commercial probe to detect PML/RAR alpha fusion. RESULTS: We obtained a normal cut-off value of 9.1%. Specificity and sensibility were 100%. Six positive cytogenetic cases at diagnosis were FISH positive. Six negative cytogenetic cases, one APL at diagnosis and five normal controls were FISH negative. One case in remission, that was negative by cytogenetics, was positive near the cut-off value by FISH. Two other cases in remission, not conclusive by cytogenetics, were negative by FISH.

This has meant cure for many and greater survival. However, these achievements have led to a dramatic increase in neurological complications due to the cancer itself and the surgical treatment on its own or combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Here we report that the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging agent, activates a p53-survivin signaling pathway inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Treatment of wild-type (wt) p53 ALL cells (EU-3 cell line) with doxorubicin caused accumulation of p53, resulting in dramatic down-regulation of survivin, depletion of cells in G(2)/M, and apoptosis (increased sub-G(1) compartment). In contrast, doxorubicin treatment of mutant (mut) p53 cells (EU-6/ALL line) up-regulated survivin and induced G(2)/M arrest without inducing apoptosis. However, treating EU-6 with anti-survivin antisense resensitized these cells to doxorubicin, resulting in apoptosis. With a p53-null cell line (EU-4), although doxorubicin treatment arrested cells in G(2)/M, survivin expression was unchanged, and cells underwent only limited apoptosis. However, re-expression of wt-p53 in EU-4 cells could restore the doxorubicin-p53-survivin pathway, resulting in significantly decreased survivin expression and increased apoptosis in these cells after doxorubicin treatment. Following cotransfection of p53-null EU-4 cells with survivin promoter-luciferase constructs and either wt-p53 or different mut-p53 expression vectors, wt-p53 inhibited survivin promoter activity; p53-mediated inhibition could be abrogated by overexpression of murine double minute2 (MDM2) protein. Together, these studies define a novel p53-survivin signaling pathway activated by DNA damage that results in down-regulation of survivin, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Furthermore, our data indicate that loss of wt-p53 function in tumor cells may contribute to up-regulation of survivin and resistance to DNA-damaging agents.","['Zhou, Muxiang', 'Gu, Lubing', 'Li, Fengzhi', 'Zhu, Yerun', 'Woods, William G', 'Findley, Harry W']","['Zhou M', 'Gu L', 'Li F', 'Zhu Y', 'Woods WG', 'Findley HW']","['Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA. mzhou@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics/physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/physiology', '*DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Luciferases/genetics', '*Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Survivin', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/physiology']",2002/09/18 10:00,2002/10/22 04:00,['2002/09/18 10:00'],"['2002/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/jpet.102.037192 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2002 Oct;303(1):124-31. doi: 10.1124/jpet.102.037192.,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,,"['CA 16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA82323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the course of a screening program aimed at IL-6 inhibitor from natural products, we isolated 20S,21-epoxy-resibufogenin-3-formate (ERBF) from bufadienolide and examined the effect of ERBF on activities of various cytokines. ERBF dose dependently suppressed IL-6 activity and caused a parallel rightward shift of dose-response curves to IL-6 at concentrations of 0.03 to 10 ng/ml. Analysis of data yields a pA(2) of 5.12 and a slope of 0.99. Selectivity of ERBF on activity of cytokines was examined using cytokine-dependent cell lines. ERBF did not affect IL-2-dependent growth of CTLL-2 cells, IL-3-dependent growth of Baf3 cells, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha-induced growth suppression in TNFalpha-sensitive L929 cells. ERBF also did not affect IL-4-stimulated expression of FcepsilonR II receptor (CD23) in U-937 cells, the IL-8-induced chemotaxis of human neutrophils, or nerve growth factor-stimulated neuronal differentiation in PC-12 cells. In contrast, ERBF dose dependently suppressed IL-6-induced neuronal differentiation in PC-12 cells. Furthermore, ERBF suppressed only IL-6-induced osteoclast formation without affecting osteoclast formation induced by IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3). In receptor binding assay, unbound (free) IL-6 was increased in a dose-dependent manner by pretreatment with ERBF on IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), suggesting that ERBF suppresses binding of IL-6 to IL-6R.

Mitochondria have emerged as central players in apoptosis. Antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family localise to the outer mitochondrial membrane and regulate mitochondrial release of apoptogenic proteins. Mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBzR) ligands have been shown to reverse Bcl-2 action and facilitate apoptosis. AIM: We evaluated the ability of the mBzR antagonist Pk11195 to overcome preapoptotic mitochondrial dysfunction in Egi-1 and Tfk-1, two human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells growing in culture were used to perform in vitro experiments over 48-96 hours following treatment. The cytotoxic agents used were 5 fluorouracil 10 microM and etoposide (Vp16) 10 microM, together with ultraviolet and 0.5-1 Gy x ray irradiation with or without 75 microM Pk11195. Apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction were measured at single cell resolution by flow cytometry using the mitochondrial fluorochrome DiOC6(3). Severe combined immunodeficient non-obese diabetic (SCID-NOD) mice with subcutaneous xenografts using the Egi-1 and Tfk-1 cell lines were treated with etoposide with or without addition of Pk11195 over a 72 hour period during which time the xenograft growth patterns were monitored. RESULTS: In vitro, the effect of Pk11195 on induction of apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma cells following stimulation by chemotherapy or radiotherapy was found to be both time and dose dependent, with Pk11195 increasing rates of apoptosis by 50-95%. Intraperitoneal administration of Pk11195 in combination with Vp16 was found to increase the growth inhibiting effects of Vp16 on xenografts during the treatment phase. PK11195 75 microM on its own had no intrinsic cytotoxic efficacy. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that functional antagonism of coexpressed Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 proteins using the mBzR antagonist Pk11195 can facilitate apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma following chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","['Okaro, A C', 'Fennell, D A', 'Corbo, M', 'Davidson, B R', 'Cotter, F E']","['Okaro AC', 'Fennell DA', 'Corbo M', 'Davidson BR', 'Cotter FE']","[""Department of Experimental Haematology, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine, Turner Street, London E1 2AD, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Gut,Gut,2985108R,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', '*Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'GABA-A Receptor Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/09/18 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/18 10:00'],"['2002/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/gut.51.4.556 [doi]'],ppublish,Gut. 2002 Oct;51(4):556-61. doi: 10.1136/gut.51.4.556.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (GABA-A Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'YNF83VN1RL (PK 11195)']",,,,PMC1773378,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, they are a test case of the concept that ribonucleotide depletion can be sensed by p53, resulting in a G(1) cell cycle block. The GART inhibitors have been proposed previously to be cytotoxic in tumor cells lacking p53 function but only cytostatic in p53 wild-type tumor cells. We have investigated this concept. Cell cycle progression into and through S phase was slowed by DDATHF, but both p53 +/+ and -/- human colon carcinoma cells entered and completed one S phase in the presence of drug. This inability of p53 to initiate a G(1) arrest after DDATHF treatment was mirrored by an independence of the cytotoxicity of DDATHF on p53 function. We conclude that carcinoma cells are killed equally well by DDATHF and related compounds whether or not the p53 pathway is intact and that the utility of GART inhibitors would not be limited to p53-negative tumors.","['Bronder, Julie L', 'Moran, Richard G']","['Bronder JL', 'Moran RG']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Massey Cancer Center, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/physiology', 'Glutamates/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Purines/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'S Phase/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*physiology']",2002/09/18 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/09/18 10:00'],"['2002/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Sep 15;62(18):5236-41.,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'IC32U30905 (AG 2034)']",,,"['CA 27605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of NF-kappaB classically depends on degradation of its inhibitor IkappaBalpha by the 26s proteasome. Specific proteasome inhibitors induce apoptosis in cancer cells and, at nonlethal concentrations, sensitize cells to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Recently, the protease coded by the HIV-I virus has been shown to share cleavage activities with the proteasome. For this reason, we investigated whether the HIV-I protease inhibitor saquinavir can inhibit NF-kappaB activation, block 26s proteasome activity in prostate cancer cells, and promote their apoptosis. The effect of saquinavir on LPS/IFN-gamma-induced activation of NF-kappaB was assessed by gel-shift assays and by Western analysis of corresponding IkappaBalpha-levels. Its effect on 20s and 26s proteasome activity was analyzed with a fluorogenic peptide assay using whole cell lysates from LnCaP, DU-145, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells pretreated with saquinavir for 9 h. Proteasome inhibition in living cells was assessed using ECV 304 cells stably transfected with an expression plasmid for an ubiquitin/green fluorescence protein fusion protein (ECV 304/10). Apoptosis was monitored morphologically and by flow cytometry. Saquinavir treatment prevented LPS/IFN-gamma-induced activation of NF-kappaB in RAW cells and stabilized expression of IkappaBalpha. It inhibited 20s and 26s proteasome activity in lysates from LnCaP, DU-145, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells with an IC(50) of 10 micro M and caused the accumulation of an ubiquitin/green fluorescence protein fusion protein in living ECV 304/10 cells. Incubation of PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer, U373 glioblastoma, and K562 and Jurkat leukemia cells with saquinavir caused a concentration-dependent induction of apoptosis. In the case of PC-3 and DU-145, saquinavir sensitized the surviving cells to ionizing radiation. We conclude that saquinavir inhibits proteasome activity in mammalian cells as well as acting on the HIV-I protease. Because saquinavir induced apoptosis in human cancer cells, HIV-I protease inhibitors might become a new class of cytotoxic drugs, alone or in combination with radiation or chemotherapy.","['Pajonk, Frank', 'Himmelsbach, Judith', 'Riess, Katrin', 'Sommer, Alfred', 'McBride, William H']","['Pajonk F', 'Himmelsbach J', 'Riess K', 'Sommer A', 'McBride WH']","['Department of Radiation Therapy, Radiological University Clinic, Hugstetter Strasse 55, 79106 Freiburg i.

In addition, evidence of clinical efficacy in advanced prostate cancer has been reported. PC-SPES has also been shown to have antitumor activity against several other cancer cell lines including breast and neuroepithelial cancer, melanoma, and leukemia cell lines. Because of these findings, we investigated the effects of PC-SPES in vitro in colon cancer cell lines SW480, SW620, and DLD-1 and in vivo in the Apc(min) mouse, a murine model for intestinal carcinogenesis. For the in vitro studies, colon cancer cell lines were exposed to an ethanolic extract of PC-SPES compared with a diluent control [ethanol < or = 0.3% (v/v)]. PC-SPES resulted in a marked suppression of cell proliferation in all colon cancer cells studied. PC-SPES (3 micro l/ml) caused a 95% inhibition of cell proliferation of the DLD-1 colon cancer cell line, and similar results were observed in the SW480 and SW620 colon cancer cell lines. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated a drastic (> or =60%) accumulation of cells in the G(2)-M phase with a concomitant decrease of cells in the G(0)-G(1) phase in all colon cancer cell lines studied after treatment with PC-SPES (1.5 micro l/ml for 48 h). Western blot analysis demonstrated a decrease in protein levels of beta-tubulin in the SW620 cell line exposed to PC-SPES. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling analysis revealed an increase in apoptotic colon cancer cells incubated with PC-SPES. For the in vivo studies, female 4-5-week-old Apc(min) mice were randomized to two groups: a PC-SPES-treated group (n = 11) received 250 mg/kg/day (0.2 ml) PC-SPES via gastrointestinal gavage; and a control group (n = 10) received 0.2 ml of the vehicle solution (1.5% carboxymethylcellulose with 0.2% Tween 20) via gastrointestinal gavage. Both groups were treated five times a week for 10 weeks. After treatment, the gastrointestinal tract was dissected for polyp scoring by two observers blinded to treatment. The Apc(min) mice given PC-SPES had a 58% reduction in tumor number and a 56% decrease in tumor load. No effect on either food intake or body weight was observed in the treated versus sham groups. The present study is the first to report the potent activity of PC-SPES against colon cancer. Both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis occurred after treatment with PC-SPES. This suggests that the components of this herbal mixture, either independently or in combination, acted in colon cancer, resulting in a drastic effect on tumor initiation and tumor progression.","['Huerta, Sergio', 'Arteaga, James R', 'Irwin, Ronald W', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Heber, David', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Huerta S', 'Arteaga JR', 'Irwin RW', 'Ikezoe T', 'Heber D', 'Koeffler HP']","['University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Center for Human Nutrition, UCLA School of Medicine, 900 Veteran Avenue, 12-217 Warren Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. shuerta@pol.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Colonic Polyps/drug therapy', '*Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Eating/drug effects', 'Estrogens/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/18 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/09/18 10:00'],"['2002/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Sep 15;62(18):5204-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (herbal preparation PC-SPES)']",,,"['AT 00151/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 07688/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although cardiac CT-1 gene expression is known to be upregulated in some animal models of congestive heart failure, the activation state of the CT-1 system in patients with congestive heart failure is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was designed to determine left ventricular expression of CT-1 and its glycoprotein 130 (gp130)/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor complex in human end-stage heart failure due to ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy. In addition, we investigated the activation state of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), the downstream effector of gp130 signaling. In the failing left ventricular myocardium, expression levels of CT-1 mRNA and protein were significantly increased by 142% and 68%, respectively, compared with non-failing donor hearts. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the increased expression of CT-1 in cardiac myocytes. Although gp130 gene expression was increased by 91% (P<0.001), gp130 protein abundance was significantly diminished by 34% in the failing myocardium. In contrast, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 protein concentrations were not changed. In addition, the ratio of activated tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 to total STAT3 was not significantly altered in failing hearts compared with non-failing controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that gp130 receptor downregulation balances enhanced CT-1 expression in human heart failure and thereby inhibits excessive activation of the gp130 signaling pathway.","['Zolk, Oliver', 'Ng, Leong L', ""O'Brien, Russell J"", 'Weyand, Michael', 'Eschenhagen, Thomas']","['Zolk O', 'Ng LL', ""O'Brien RJ"", 'Weyand M', 'Eschenhagen T']","['Institut fur Experimentelle und Klinische Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.

They are also involved in translocations found in acute leukemias and solid tumors. We have detected transcripts from five known and four novel winged helix genes in leukemia cell lines and CD34(+) blood progenitor cells by reverse trancription-polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers on the highly conserved DNA binding domain. The genomic clones coding for two new winged helix proteins, FOXD4a and FOXD4b were isolated by high-stringency hybridization of a human phage library. FOXD4a and FOXD4b are encoded by a 1319 and 1250 bp single exon coding for a winged helix DNA binding domain, an amino-terminal acidic region and a carboxy-terminal proline- and alanine-rich region which correspond to putative transcriptional regulatory motifs. TATA box, CCAAT box, and transcription factor binding motifs have been identified in the 5' region of the genes. In addition, foxD4a and foxD4b cDNA has been isolated from NB-4 mRNA. The fox genes are transcribed in a tissue-restricted pattern in adult and fetal human tissues. FoxD4a and foxD4b mRNA was expressed in the leukemia cell lines KG-1, Kasumi, NB-4, HL-60, U937, THP-1, HEL, U266, Jurkat, and Raji. It has already been shown that winged helix factors are also involved in carcinogenesis.

The alga cells grow in synthetic media whereas the mammalian cells require complex and more expensive media along with heavy investment and manpower. To assess the validity of this new approach, analysis of growth inhibition by antitumor agents was carried out jointly on a wall-less (cw15) mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, that obviates the problem of drug uptake, and the murine leukemic cell line L1210, commonly used for anticancer drug screening. The presence of the topoisomerases I and II (approximately 97 and approximately 2 x 170 kDa, respectively) in the nuclear extracts of C. reinhardtii and their possible role as targets of the drugs was also investigated. Concentrated extracts were separated into >100 and <100 kDa fractions and their topoisomerase I and II activities were measured on relaxation of supercoiled plasmid DNA, decatenation of the catenated kinetoplast DNA and cleavage of plasmid DNA. Our results do not show significant difference in growth inhibition by antitumorals between the wall-less mutant of the alga and the murine leukemic cell line L1210. We noted that alga cells were inhibited by antibiotics that target gyrase, a bacterial variant of topoisomerase II which is also found in chloroplasts. At the molecular level, the alga nuclear fractions, >100 and <100 kDa, displayed the same activities as the mammalian enzymes topoisomerases I and II, respectively, and were blocked by the same poisons. We concluded that the wall-less cw15 mutant of C. reinhardtii could advantageously replace mammalian cells in the screening of the anticancer drugs. The alga enzymes could also provide an opportunity to delineate the phylogeny of the topoisomerase superfamily.","['Maucourt, Karine', 'Agarwal, Manjul', 'Rene, Brigitte', 'Fermandjian, Serge']","['Maucourt K', 'Agarwal M', 'Rene B', 'Fermandjian S']","['Departement de Biologie et Pharmacologie Structurales, LBPA, UMR 8532 CNRS, ENS Cachan, 94235 Cachan, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Chlamydomonas reinhardtii/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Chloroplasts/drug effects', 'DNA Gyrase/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases/metabolism', 'DNA, Protozoan/analysis', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors']",2002/09/18 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/09/18 10:00'],"['2002/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['S000629520201256X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01256-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 Oct 1;64(7):1125-31. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01256-x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Protozoan)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', 'EC 5.99.1.- (DNA Topoisomerases)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Gyrase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its mechanism of action has not been characterized. In this study, we examined the in vitro and in vivo effects of FK228 on human lymphoma U-937 cells. FK228 very strongly inhibited the growth of U-937 cells with an IC(50) value of 5.92 nM. In a scid mouse lymphoma model, mice treated with FK228 once or twice a week survived longer than control mice, with median survival times of 30.5 (0.56 mg/kg) and 33 days (0.32 mg/kg), respectively (vs. 20 days in control mice). Remarkably, 2 out of 12 mice treated with FK228 (0.56 mg/kg once or twice a week) survived past the observation period of 60 days. The apoptotic population of U-937 cells time-dependently increased to 37.7% after 48 hr of treatment with FK228. In addition, FK228 induced G1 and G2/M arrest and the differentiation of U-937 cells to the CD11b(+)/CD14(+) phenotype. Expression of p21(WAF1/Cip1) and gelsolin mRNA increased up to 654- and 152-fold, respectively, after 24hr of treatment with FK228.

In conclusion, (i) FK228 prolonged the survival time of scid mice in a lymphoma model, and (ii) the beneficial effects of FK228 on human lymphoma may be exerted through the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and differentiation via the modulation of gene expression by histone acetylation.","['Sasakawa, Yuka', 'Naoe, Yoshinori', 'Inoue, Takeshi', 'Sasakawa, Tatsuya', 'Matsuo, Masahiko', 'Manda, Toshitaka', 'Mutoh, Seitaro']","['Sasakawa Y', 'Naoe Y', 'Inoue T', 'Sasakawa T', 'Matsuo M', 'Manda T', 'Mutoh S']","['Medicinal Biology Research Laboratories, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., 2-1-6, Kashima, Yodogawa-Ku, Osaka 532-8514, Japan. yuka_sasakawa@po.fujisawa.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Depsipeptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gelsolin/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Peptides, Cyclic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2002/09/18 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/09/18 10:00'],"['2002/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202012613 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01261-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 Oct 1;64(7):1079-90. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01261-3.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these compounds, the dimethyl derivative (DIMATE) was a competitive irreversible inhibitor (K(i) approximately 280 microM) of baker's yeast ALDH1 in vitro showing 80% inhibition at 400 microM when preincubated with the enzyme for 30min, whereas the trimethyl ammonium and the morpholine derivatives showed only 15% inhibition at 600 microM even after 60min preincubation. ATE inhibited ALDH1 activity in ALDH1-transfected L1210 T cells resistant to hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (HCPA) and inhibited growth synergistically in the presence of HCPA. In non-transfected L1210 counterparts ATE did not potentiate growth inhibition by HCPA. DIMATE was a 30-100-fold more effective growth inhibitor than ATE. Endogenous ALDH1 activities of BAF(3) cells over-expressing different levels of bcl(2) (0-100%) were similar (16-20mU/mg protein) and were all inhibited by DIMATE, reaching 20-30% at 4 microM. Up to 4 microM no apoptosis, as measured by DNA-fragmentation was observed, but at 8 and 10 microM DIMATE, DNA-fragmentation increased concomitantly with ALDH1 inhibition. No DNA-fragmentation was observed with ALDH1 irreversible inhibitors devoid of a thiolester group or with thiolesters which were not inhibitors of ALDH1. It was seen only with competitive irreversible inhibitors having the methanethiol and enzyme-inhibitory moieties. The methanethiol putatively released from DIMATE by ALDH1 esterase activity plays a role, albeit undefined, in lowering intramitochondrial glutathione levels which decreased by 47% as DNA-fragmentation increased.","['Quash, Gerard', 'Fournet, Guy', 'Chantepie, Jacqueline', 'Gore, Jacques', 'Ardiet, Claude', 'Ardail, Dominique', 'Michal, Yvonne', 'Reichert, Uwe']","['Quash G', 'Fournet G', 'Chantepie J', 'Gore J', 'Ardiet C', 'Ardail D', 'Michal Y', 'Reichert U']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunochimie, INSERM U329, Faculte de Medecine Lyon-Sud, Oullins, France. quash@lyon-sud.univ.lyon1.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Alkynes/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Esters/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/enzymology', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/18 10:00,2002/10/17 04:00,['2002/09/18 10:00'],"['2002/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202012947 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01294-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 Oct 15;64(8):1279-92. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01294-7.,"['0 (4-Amino-4-methyl-pent-2-ynthioc acid S-methyl ester)', '0 (Alkynes)', '0 (Esters)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (TRIMATE cpd)', '0 (dimethylthioampal)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.2.1 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (ALDH1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (ALDH1A1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (Retinal Dehydrogenase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we investigated the effect of costunolide on cellular differentiation in the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell culture system. Costunolide markedly increased the degree of HL-60 leukemia cell differentiation when simultaneously combined with 5nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)). Costunolide by itself had very weak effects on the differentiation of HL-60 cells. Cytofluorometric analysis and cell morphologic studies indicated that costunolide potentiated 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced cell differentiation predominantly into monocytes. Inhibitors for PKC, PI3-K, and ERK markedly inhibited HL-60 cell differentiation induced by costunolide in combination with 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). In addition, pretreatment of HL-60 cells with costunolide before the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) addition also potentiated cell differentiation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and the enhanced levels of cell differentiation closely correlated with the inhibitory levels of NF-kappaB-binding activity by costunolide.

A similar efficacy was not apparent for ginsenoside Rg3. The concentrations to inhibit 50% of cells (LC50) for PD, Rh2, PT, and Rh1 were 13, 15, 19, and 210 microg/mL, respectively. PD and PT induced DNA fragmentation at the LC50 after 72 h of treatment, compared to Rh2, Rh1, dexamethasone, and untreated cells. Cell-cycle analysis confirmed apoptosis with PD and PT treatment of THP-1 cells resulting in a buildup of sub-G1 cells after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment. Rh2 and dexamethasone treatments also increased apoptotic cells after 24 h, whereas Rh1 did not. After 48 and 72 h, Rh2, Rh1, and dexamethasone similarly increased apoptosis, but these effects were significantly (P<0.05) lower than those observed for both PD and PT treatments. Furthermore, treatments that produced the largest buildup of apoptotic cells were also found to have the largest release of lactate dehydrogenase. It can be concluded from these studies that the presence of sugars in PD and PT aglycone structures reduces the potency to induce apoptosis, and alternately alter membrane integrity. These cytotoxic effects were different to THP-1 cells than dexamethasone.","['Popovich, David G', 'Kitts, David D']","['Popovich DG', 'Kitts DD']","['Food, Nutrition and Health, Faculty of Agricultural Science, University of British Columbia, 6650 N.W.

Sixteen patients received PBSCT, and 24 received BMT between January, 1995 and March, 2000. The patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 22), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; n = 8), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 3), or other diseases (n = 7). The median ages of patients in the PBSCT and BMT groups were 9 yr and 6 yr, respectively. Cyclosporin A (CsA) plus methotrexate or methylprednisolone was used as a graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis regimen in the PBSCT group, whereas CsA alone or methotrexate alone was used in the BMT group. Circulating lymphocyte numbers and subpopulations determined by flow cytometric analysis were used as markers of immune recovery. In the PBSCT group, the median number of harvested CD34+ cells was 7.25 (range: 1.3-27.6) x 106/kg of the recipient's body weight, while the median number of harvested nucleated cells was 4.7 (range: 3.7-10.5) x 108/kg.

Myeloid engraftment occurred sooner after PBSCT than after BMT (median number of days to achieve absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) > 0.5 x 109/L; 11 and 15, respectively; p < 0.0001) and similar results were found for platelet engraftment (median number of days to achieve a platelet count of > 20 x 109/L; 12 and 21, respectively; p = 0.004). On the other hand, after PBSCT the absolute numbers of total circulating lymphocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations were not significantly different from those after BMT. The incidence of acute GvHD after PBSCT was the same as that after BMT, while chronic GvHD developed more frequently after PBSCT than after BMT (p = 0.005).

However, there is controversy concerning the prognostic significance of karyotype for outcome after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) performed in first complete remission (CR1). This single-institution report describes allo-BMT for AML in CR1 and the effect of diagnostic cytogenetic findings on the results of that treatment. Between August 1981 and December 1999, 93 patients underwent related donor (n = 82) or unrelated donor (n = 11) BMT. Conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis were achieved predominantly with busulfan and cyclophosphamide and with cyclosporine and methotrexate, respectively. Seventy-nine (85%) of 93 patients had successful marrow karyotyping at diagnosis, and the patients were categorized into 3 prognostic groups based on the British Medical Research Council AML 10 trial classification: 15 patients(19%) were classified as having favorable risk [inv(16), t(8;2 1), t(15;17)]; 55 (70%) as having intermediate risk [no abnormality, +8, +21, +22, del(7q), del(9q), 11q23 rearrangement, and other numerical or structural abnormalities]; and 9 (11%) as having adverse risk [-5, del(5q), -7, 3q rearrangements, > or = 5 abnormalities, t(6;9), t(9;22)]. The median follow-up was 93 months (range, 16-241 months). The overall survival (OS) rate, event-free survival (EFS) rate, relapse rate, and treatment-related mortality (TRM) were not statistically different between the groups. The 5-year actuarial EFS rates for favorable, intermediate, and adverse risk groups were 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-79%), 58% (95% CI, 43%-70%), and 67% (95% CI 28%-88%), respectively. Reclassification of patients into cytogenetic prognostic subgroups according to Southwest Oncology Group criteria did not change these results. In univariate analysis, the only variable found to have a prognostic influence on OS (P = .04) and TRM (P = .03) was the type of donor (unrelated donor was linked to a worse prognosis), which was confirmed in multivariate analysis. Our study suggests that presentation karyotype has less prognostic significance for outcome following allo-BMT than for outcome following conventional chemotherapy. In particular, AML patients with poor prognostic cytogenetic changes in CR1 who are unlikely to be cured with chemotherapy alone may benefit from allo-BMT.","['Chalandon, Yves', 'Barnett, Michael J', 'Horsman, Douglas E', 'Conneally, Eibhlin A', 'Nantel, Stephen H', 'Nevill, Thomas J', 'Nitta, Janet', 'Shepherd, John D', 'Sutherland, Heathe J', 'Toze, Cynthia L', 'Hogge, Donna E']","['Chalandon Y', 'Barnett MJ', 'Horsman DE', 'Conneally EA', 'Nantel SH', 'Nevill TJ', 'Nitta J', 'Shepherd JD', 'Sutherland HJ', 'Toze CL', 'Hogge DE']","['Division of Hematology, Vancouver Hospital, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/09/18 10:00,2003/06/12 05:00,['2002/09/18 10:00'],"['2002/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879102500173 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12234169 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(8):435-43. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm12234169.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HA-1-specific CTLs are thus potential tools for adoptive immunotherapy of relapsed leukemia after HLA-matched-HA-1-mismatched stem cell transplantation (SCT). In vitro generation of HA-1-specific CTLs from SC donors is possible using dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with synthetic HA-1 peptide as stimulator cells. However, this approach requires at least 6 weeks of in vitro culturing under GMP (good manufacturing practice) conditions. Our data show that in vitro induction of HA-1-specific CTLs is more rapid with the use of DCs that are retrovirally transduced with the HA-1 complementary DNA. Retrovirally transduced DCs showed functional and long-term stable expression of the HA-1 CTL epitope in primary CTL cultures. In 4 SC donors, HA-1-transduced DCs induced HA-1-specific CTLs in 14 to 21 days. The in vitro-generated CTL lines contained 6% to 9% T-cells that stained brightly with tetrameric HLA-A2/HA-1 peptide complexes (HA-1(A2) tetramer) and showed significant lysis of HA-1+ leukemic cells. The CTL induction procedure using peptide-pulsed DCs was less effective and required 28 to 35 days of T-cell culture.

The development of second malignant neoplasms represents one of the most serious side effects of treatment with radiation and chemotherapy. Although secondary leukemia was the first reported carcinogenic effect resulting from cancer treatment, solid tumors now comprise the largest second tumor burden in some populations of survivors. It should be recognized, however, that solid cancers do not necessarily represent an adverse effect of therapy, but may also reflect the operation of shared etiologic factors, host determinants, gene-environment interactions, and other influences. Quantification of second cancer risk is important in terms of patient management, enabling clinicians to make informed decisions with regard to optimal treatment of the initial cancer, balancing efficacy against acute and chronic sequelae. This article focuses on selected highlights and recent developments in treatment-associated solid malignancies, with emphasis on radiotherapy and chemotherapy in adults, and summarizes areas for future research. Although cancer therapy represents a double-edged sword, it should always be recognized that it is advances in treatment that are largely responsible for the tremendous improvement in patient survival. Thus, the benefit derived from many cancer therapies far outweighs any risk of developing a second cancer.","['Travis, Lois B']",['Travis LB'],"['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. travisl@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",2002/09/18 10:00,2002/10/02 04:00,['2002/09/18 10:00'],"['2002/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/02 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/028418602760169361 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2002;41(4):323-33. doi: 10.1080/028418602760169361.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microarray technology is one of many novel tools that are allowing global and high-throughput analysis of genes and gene products. In addition to an introduction on underlying principles, the current review focuses on the use of both complementary DNA and oligodeoxynucleotide microarrays in gene expression analysis. Genome-wide experiments generate a massive amount of data points that require systematic methods of analysis to extract biologically useful information. Accordingly, the current educational communication discusses different methods of data analysis, including supervised and unsupervised clustering algorithms. Illustrative clinical examples show clinical applications, including (1) identification of candidate genes or pathological pathways (ie, elucidation of pathogenesis); (2) identification of ""new"" molecular classes of diseases that may be relevant in disease reclassification, prognostication, and treatment selection (ie, class discovery); and (3) use of expression profiles of known disease classes to predict diagnosis and classification of unknown samples (ie, class prediction).

Since normal early pregnancy is characterized by a shift towards a Th2-like cytokine pattern, it may be assumed that cytokine secretion by DC during early pregnancy could be modulated by the non-classical HLA molecules G and E present on invasive trophoblast. MATERIAL AND METHODS: DC were cultivated from monocytes isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. DC were cocultured with K-562 leukemia cells lacking the class I and II HLA antigens transfected with either HLA-G or HLA-E or ultratransfected cells (controls) and the concentrations of IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-18 and TNF-alpha were measured in the supernatants by ELISA. RESULTS: Coculture with ultratransfected cells resulted in a significant increase of the production of IL-8 and TNF-alpha by mature and immature DC and of IL-10 by immature DC (p < 0.01). When cocultured with HLA-G and HLA-E transfected K-562 cells, the secretion of IL-8 by immature and mature DC and that of IL-10 and TNF-alpha by immature DC was significantly (p < 0.01) decreased. The contact with HLA-G and HLA-E transfected cells had no effect on the production of IL-12p70 and IL-18 by DC. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that DC react with an increased cytokine release upon contact with cells lacking HLA class I and II antigens. The suppressive effect of HLA-G and HLA-E on the secretion of TNF-alpha (Th1 cytokine), IL-10 (Th2 cytokine) and IL-8 (chemokine) by immature DC could be interpreted as further evidence for the central immunotolerance role of HLA-G and HLA-E during early pregnancy.","['Steck, T', 'Rieger, L', 'Rodel, E', 'Dietl, J', 'Kammerer, U']","['Steck T', 'Rieger L', 'Rodel E', 'Dietl J', 'Kammerer U']","['Frauenklinik und Poliklinik der Universitat Wurzburg, Germany. thomas.steck@mail.uni-wuerzburg.de']",['ger'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Zentralbl Gynakol,Zentralblatt fur Gynakologie,21820100R,IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism/*physiology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Transfection']",2002/09/17 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/17 10:00'],"['2002/09/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2002-34102 [doi]'],ppublish,Zentralbl Gynakol. 2002 May;124(5):304-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2002-34102.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-E antigen)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,Die Expression der Molekule HLA-G und HLA-E moduliert die Zytokinproduktion monozytengenerierter dendritischer Zellen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This area experienced between the years 1978 and 1992 a major influx of workers for the construction of a nuclear power station and a new nuclear waste reprocessing unit. A population mixing index was defined on the basis of the number of workers born outside the French department of 'La Manche' and living in each 'commune', the basic geographical unit under study. The analyses were done with indirect standardisation and Poisson regression model allowing or not for extra-Poisson variation. Urban 'communes' were considered as the reference population. The Incidence Rate Ratio was 2.7 in rural 'communes' belonging to the highest tertile of population mixing (95% Bayesian credible interval, 95%BCI=1.2-5.9). A positive trend was observed among rural strata with increasing population mixing index (IRR for trend=1.4, 95%BCI=1.1-1.8). The risk became stronger for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in children 1-6 years old in the highest tertile of population mixing (IRR=5.5, 95%BCI=1.4-23.3).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: K562 leukemia cells were exposed to STI571 +/- flavopiridol for 24 or 48 h, after which mitochondrial damage, caspase activation, expression/activation of signaling and cell cycle regulatory proteins, and apoptosis were assessed. RESULTS: In K562 cells, coadministration of marginally toxic concentrations of STI571 (200 nM) and flavopiridol (150 nM) for 48 h resulted in a marked increase in mitochondrial damage (e.g., cytochrome c release), activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and Bid, and apoptosis. Similar interactions were observed in Bcr/Abl(+) LAMA-84 cells but not in leukemic cells that fail to express Bcr/Abl (e.g., HL-60, U937, Jurkat). STI571/flavopiridol-mediated apoptosis was associated with the caspase-independent down-regulation of Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, and the caspase-dependent release of Smac/DIABLO and loss of deltapsi(m). Coadministration of flavopiridol and STI571 did not result in changes in levels of expression of Bcl-2, phopho-Stat5, phospho-p34(cdc2), or Bcr/Abl. Finally, STI571/flavopiridol effectively induced apoptosis in STI571-resistant K562 cells displaying amplification of the Bcr/Abl protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings indicate that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol induces multiple perturbations in signaling pathways in STI571-treated Bcr/Abl(+) human leukemia cells that culminate in mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis. They also suggest that simultaneous disruption of survival signaling and cell cycle regulatory pathways may represent an effective strategy in Bcr/Abl(+) malignancies.","['Yu, Chunrong', 'Krystal, Geoffrey', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Yu C', 'Krystal G', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*agonists/pharmacology', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/*agonists/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'U937 Cells/drug effects']",2002/09/17 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/17 10:00'],"['2002/09/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/17 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Sep;8(9):2976-84.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA88906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to develop a precise and reliable tool for quantitation of cyclin D1 mRNA suitable for archival clinical specimens. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay was used to quantitate cyclin D1 mRNA copy numbers. Using 2000 microdissected cells as template, 104 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node, spleen, and decalcified bone marrow biopsies from a panel of 95 cases of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHLs) were analyzed. In addition, cyclin D1 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Strong cyclin D1 mRNA overexpression was detected in mantle cell lymphomas (23 of 23), hairy cell leukemias (5 of 19), and multiple myelomas (7 of 23) with particularly high levels in 2 of the latter cases. Intermediate transcript levels were found in 5 of 23 multiple myelomas and 7 of 19 hairy cell leukemias. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (10 of 10), follicular lymphomas (9 of 9), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas (5 of 5) and reactive lymphoid tissues with the exception of normal spleen had no or very low cyclin D1 expression. In comparison with real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry showed a lower level of sensitivity, more variability, and did not allow accurate quantitation. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time RT-PCR for cyclin D1 mRNA is an excellent tool for the differential diagnosis of B-NHLs and, in combination with microdissection, a powerful approach for retrospective trials using archival clinical specimens as tissue source. Furthermore, real-time RT-PCR may help to identify subgroups of B-NHLs according to cyclin D1 mRNA copy numbers and to investigate the possible influence of different chromosomal breakpoints on cyclin D1 expression.","['Specht, Katja', 'Kremer, Marcus', 'Muller, Ulrike', 'Dirnhofer, Stephan', 'Rosemann, Michael', 'Hofler, Heinz', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Fend, Falko']","['Specht K', 'Kremer M', 'Muller U', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Rosemann M', 'Hofler H', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Fend F']","['Institute of Pathology, GSF-National Research Centre for Environment and Health, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Computer Systems', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/classification/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoid Tissue/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pseudolymphoma/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/09/17 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/17 10:00'],"['2002/09/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/17 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Sep;8(9):2902-11.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the overall success rate in treatment of AML is around 50%, despite intensive chemotherapeutic regimens. AML cell survival seems to be related to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether VEGF production by AML cells is a prognostic factor for therapeutic outcome and whether this is independent of known prognostic factors such as WBC count, French-American-British (FAB) classification, and risk assessment in which the presence of t(8;21), t(15;17), and inv(16) or FAB M3 defines a low-risk group. Pretreatment levels were measured in the supernatant of AML cells obtained from 47 children with newly diagnosed AML treated between 1988 and 1998. All patients were treated with intensive chemotherapeutic protocols from the Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group [DCLSG (DCLSG-ANLL87, DCLSG-ANLL92/94, and DCLSG-ANLL97)]. VEGF was measured at the mRNA level with reverse transcription-PCR and at the protein level using a VEGF immunoassay. VEGF in the supernatant from AML cells was highly variable and in concordance with reverse transcription-PCR results. The low-risk group had significantly lower VEGF levels compared with all others (P = 0.002).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: AML patients > or =60 years in CR after induction and consolidation chemotherapy on Cancer and Leukemia Group B study 9420 were eligible if they had neutrophils > or =1 x 10(9)/liters and platelets > or =75 x 10(9)/liters. Patients received low-dose IL-2 (1 x 10(6) IU/m(2)/day s.c. for 90 days) or low-dose IL-2 with intermediate pulse doses (6-12 x 10(6) IU/m(2)/day s.c. for 3 days) every 14 days (maximum five pulses). In a subset of patients, we investigated the expression of NKG2D ligands by leukemic cells because they are likely important mediators of natural killer cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Of 35 CR patients receiving IL-2, 34 were evaluable for toxicity. Median age was 67 (range, 60-76) years. Thirteen of 16 patients receiving low-dose IL-2 completed the planned therapy, and 11 of 18 who also received intermediate pulse dose IL-2 therapy completed all five pulses. The spectrum of toxicity in both groups was similar, with predominantly grade 1-2 fatigue, fever, injection site reactions, nausea, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Grade 3-4 hematological and nonhematological toxicity were more frequent in patients also receiving intermediate pulse dose IL-2 therapy. Grade 3-4 fatigue and hematological toxicity, although uncommon, were the major causes for discontinuing or attenuating therapy. In 8 cases, mRNA for one or more NKG2D ligands was detected in leukemic cells obtained at diagnosis before treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose IL-2, with or without intermediate pulse dose therapy, given immediately after chemotherapy in first CR to elderly AML patients is well tolerated. Expression of NKG2D ligands by leukemic cells was detected in the majority of cases tested and should be assessed for correlation with response to IL-2 in future studies.","['Farag, Sherif S', 'George, Stephen L', 'Lee, Edward J', 'Baer, Maria', 'Dodge, Richard K', 'Becknell, Brian', 'Fehniger, Todd A', 'Silverman, Lewis R', 'Crawford, Jeffrey', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Schiffer, Charles A', 'Caligiuri, Michael A']","['Farag SS', 'George SL', 'Lee EJ', 'Baer M', 'Dodge RK', 'Becknell B', 'Fehniger TA', 'Silverman LR', 'Crawford J', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Larson RA', 'Schiffer CA', 'Caligiuri MA']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclosporins/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Fatigue/chemically induced', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/09/17 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/17 10:00'],"['2002/09/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/17 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Sep;8(9):2812-9.,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,"['CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Nov;8(11):3639'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their genetic defects cause human diseases such as cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) and acute myelogenous leukemia. However, the mechanism(s) regulating their functions are still poorly understood. Here, we report a novel observation that suggests that the osteogenesis-associated homologue RUNX2 is negatively regulated by the phosphorylation of two conserved serines (S104 and S451) in two distinct functional aspects. The phosphorylation of S104 could abolish the heterodimerization of RUNX2 with the partner subunit, PEBP2beta, which enhances the metabolic stability of RUNX2. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of S451 resides within the C-terminal transcription inhibition domain of RUNX2 and hence is implicated in its functional mobilization. One CCD mutation, S104R of RUNX2, appears to mimic the phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of heterodimerization, thereby rendering RUNX2 metabolically unstable.","['Wee, Hee-Jun', 'Huang, Gang', 'Shigesada, Katsuya', 'Ito, Yoshiaki']","['Wee HJ', 'Huang G', 'Shigesada K', 'Ito Y']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20020913,England,EMBO Rep,EMBO reports,100963049,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits', 'Dimerization', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Serine/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2002/09/17 10:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2002/09/17 10:00'],"['2002/09/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/embo-reports/kvf193 [doi]', 'kvf193 [pii]']",ppublish,EMBO Rep. 2002 Oct;3(10):967-74. doi: 10.1093/embo-reports/kvf193.

Furthermore, this inhibitory activity is stable for at least 48 hours at 37 degrees C and partially blocks a second hit with a GALV pseudotyped vector. We hypothesized that this inhibition was due to interference at the receptor level between infectious and noninfectious vector particles and that it might be possible to overcome it by increasing receptor expression on target cells. Activation of protein kinase C in CD34(+) cells with the phorbol ester PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) increased the mRNA level of the GALV receptor (GLVR1) and the transduction efficiency (TE), and fully reversed the inhibition of transduction seen with high-titer GALV VCM. A murine stem cell virus (MSCV) vector with the GLVR1 receptor and green fluorescent protein cDNAs (MGLIG) was used to transduce fibroblasts, and clones expressing different levels of GLVR1 were isolated. The TE of these cells using a GALV vector correlated with the level of GLVR1 expression. When CD34(+) cells or K562 cells were first transduced with MGLIG and then with high-titer GALV VCM, no inhibition of transduction was seen. The low level of GLVR1 expression limits gene transfer to K562 and CD34(+) cells using GALV pseudotyped vectors, especially in the presence of high-titer VCMs.","['Relander, Thomas', 'Brun, Ann C M', 'Olsson, Karin', 'Pedersen, Lene', 'Richter, Johan']","['Relander T', 'Brun AC', 'Olsson K', 'Pedersen L', 'Richter J']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, University of Lund, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2002/09/17 10:00,2003/03/05 04:00,['2002/09/17 10:00'],"['2002/09/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(02)90678-7 [pii]', '10.1006/mthe.2002.0678 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2002 Sep;6(3):400-6. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2002.0678.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that deletion of these sequences (nucleotides +37 to +95) attenuates rather than increases the transcriptional activity of retroviral vectors in hematopoietic cells almost independently of the developmental lineage (erythroid, myeloid, or lymphoid). Expression rates of modified vectors were reduced by as much as 34-65%, although the strong enhancer array located in the direct repeat of the LTR was preserved. Sequence analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the presence of a highly conserved binding site for NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) proteins that immediately neighbors a known binding site for the transcription factor Yin-Yang1 (YY1) [corrected]. Specific inactivation of the NFAT site reduced transgene expression in all cell types investigated and had a similar effect as the destruction of a neighboring SP1 motif.

The success of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ), a small molecule that inhibits the activation of the BCR-Abl oncogene in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, has demonstrated how effective targeted strategies can be when properly applied. With the hope of selectively targeting other critical components of cancer growth and survival while minimizing toxicity to the host, numerous strategies have been developed to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases for various growth factors commonly expressed by cancer cells. Success of targeted inhibitors is inherently dependent on the proper selection of patients whose tumors are dependent on these growth factor pathways. Unfortunately, in prostate cancer, such selection has been a difficult-to-impossible task to date. Because of the vast number of mutational events, it is difficult to demonstrate that any particular growth factor signaling pathway is critical. In addition, because of the type (mostly bone only) and nature (usually small foci) of metastases, limited access to tumor tissue in the advanced cancer population has hampered attempts to characterize patients by their molecular features or phenotype. This article will focus on defining alternative criteria for a rational drug target and novel study designs for testing these agents in prostate cancer. In particular, the neoadjuvant setting represents a unique opportunity for new drug development in prostate cancer. An example of a neoadjuvant study testing, imatinib mesylate, is presented to display the advantages and limitations of this study design.","['George, Daniel J']",['George DJ'],"['Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. daniel_george@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Urology,Urology,0366151,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hormones/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism/surgery', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/09/17 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/09/17 10:00'],"['2002/09/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0090429502015893 [pii]', '10.1016/s0090-4295(02)01589-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Urology. 2002 Sep;60(3 Suppl 1):115-21; discussion 122. doi: 10.1016/s0090-4295(02)01589-3.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that p12 enhances the E5-transforming ability of bovine papillomavirus; and binds to the 16-kDa subunit of the vacuolar ATPase pump, immature forms of the beta and gamma(c) chains of the interleukin 2 receptor, and the free chain of MHC I. p12 carrying a lysine residue (p12K) at position 88 of its sequence may be rapidly degraded in the cell via proteasome, whereas p12 with an arginine residue (p12R) at the same position is severalfold more stable. These alleles are found in proviral DNA of HTLV-1-infected individuals and it was previously observed that the p12K allele was more frequent in HAM/TSP (HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis) patients and was not found at all in asymptomatic carriers, whereas patients with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) carry the p12R allele. To extend these observations and verify whether the p12K mutation could be used as a marker of progression to HAM/TSP, we analyzed 37 HAM/TSP patients and 40 asymptomatic carriers at different stages of infection. In our cohort, only one HAM/TSP patient carried the p12K phenotype, which accounted for a frequency of 2.7% (1 of 37). We also found, among the 40 asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers, one who presented the p12K phenotype, contrasting with previous publications. Thus, p12K does not seem to be universally diagnostic for HTLV-1-associated neurological disease.

Overnutrition is also, but less commonly, associated with chronic illness. In most diseases malnutrition arises because energy intake does not match energy output. Traditionally, the focus of research has been on abnormalities in energy expenditure, in the belief that these factors were the main determinants of energy imbalance. Recent studies using the doubly-labelled-water method to measure total energy expenditure, combined with more complex study design, have suggested an alternative conclusion. In many chronic diseases patient behaviour, and particularly energy intake, is responsible for energy imbalance and malnutrition. Energy balance studies have therefore provided a useful foundation for the design of strategies aimed at preventing or managing chronic malnutrition. However, modifying patient behaviour is an ambitious undertaking which may not be within the scope of existing clinical nutrition services. A number of non-traditional models of managing chronic malnutrition in children and the elderly are promising. Increasing recognition of the value of systematic review will also provide improved strategies for prevention and management of chronic malnutrition.","['Reilly, John J']",['Reilly JJ'],"['University of Glasgow Department of Human Nutrition, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Dalnair Street, UK. jjr2y@clinmed.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Lecture'],,England,Proc Nutr Soc,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,7505881,IM,,"['Aged', 'Awards and Prizes', 'Basal Metabolism', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cystic Fibrosis/complications/metabolism', 'Energy Intake/*physiology', 'Energy Metabolism/*physiology', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nutrition Disorders/*etiology/metabolism', 'Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/metabolism', 'Protein-Energy Malnutrition/etiology/metabolism', 'United Kingdom']",2002/09/17 10:00,2002/12/20 04:00,['2002/09/17 10:00'],"['2002/09/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1079/PNS2002164 [doi]', 'S0029665102000290 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Nutr Soc. 2002 Aug;61(3):321-7. doi: 10.1079/PNS2002164.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, individuals may be measured at irregular intervals, with those having a history of poorer health outcomes being measured with somewhat greater frequency and regularity; i.e., those individuals with poorer health outcomes may have more frequent follow-up measurements and the intervals between their repeated measurements may be shorter. In this article, we consider estimation of regression parameters in models for longitudinal data where the follow-up times are not fixed by design but can depend on previous outcomes. In particular, we focus on general linear models for longitudinal data where the repeated measures are assumed to have a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We consider assumptions regarding the follow-up time process that result in the likelihood function separating into two components: one for the follow-up time process, the other for the outcome process. The practical implication of this separation is that the former process can be ignored when making likelihood-based inferences about the latter; i.e., maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the regression parameters relating the mean of the longitudinal outcomes to covariates does not require that a model for the distribution of follow-up times be specified. As a result, standard statistical software, e.g., SAS PROC MIXED (Littell et al., 1996, SAS System for Mixed Models), can be used to analyze the data. However, we also demonstrate that misspecification of the model for the covariance among the repeated measures will, in general, result in regression parameter estimates that are biased. Furthermore, results of a simulation study indicate that the potential bias due to misspecification of the covariance can be quite considerable in this setting. Finally, we illustrate these results using data from a longitudinal observational study (Lipshultz et al., 1995, New England Journal of Medicine 332, 1738-1743) that explored the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin chemotherapy for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children.","['Lipsitz, Stuart R', 'Fitzmaurice, Garrett M', 'Ibrahim, Joseph G', 'Gelber, Richard', 'Lipshultz, Steven']","['Lipsitz SR', 'Fitzmaurice GM', 'Ibrahim JG', 'Gelber R', 'Lipshultz S']","['Department of Biometry and Epidemiology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425, USA. lipsitzs@musc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', '*Biometry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Regression Analysis']",2002/09/17 10:00,2003/04/08 05:00,['2002/09/17 10:00'],"['2002/09/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.0006-341x.2002.00621.x [doi]'],ppublish,Biometrics. 2002 Sep;58(3):621-30. doi: 10.1111/j.0006-341x.2002.00621.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,"['CA 55576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 70101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 74015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 29745/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH 17119/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Forty-two patients were treated for BOT with a procedure that included lymphadenectomy. Twenty-four patients underwent a pelvic lymphadenectomy, 6 a paraaortic lymphadenectomy, and 12 both procedures. Thirty-two patients underwent systematic lymphadenectomy, five because of associated cancer (uterine cervix or corpus) and five because of bulky nodes discovered during the surgical procedure. RESULTS: An endosalpingiosis was present in 11 (26%) patients who underwent lymphadenectomy. Eight patients had nodal involvement related to the BOT. All patients with nodal involvement had serous BOT with peritoneal implants. None of the patients with a mucinous tumor had nodal involvement. None of the patients with early-stage disease (without peritoneal disease) had nodal involvement discovered after routine lymphadenectomy. None of the patients with nodal involvement died of borderline tumor. One patient died of a complication of adjuvant therapy (leukemia after chemotherapy). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with borderline tumors of the ovary and nodal involvement is excellent. Routine lymphadenectomy should not be performed in patients with early-stage disease. This procedure should be carried out in patients with serous tumor and enlarged lymph nodes.","['Camatte, Sophie', 'Morice, Philippe', 'Atallah, David', 'Pautier, Patricia', 'Lhomme, Catherine', 'Haie-Meder, Christine', 'Duvillard, Pierre', 'Castaigne, Damienne']","['Camatte S', 'Morice P', 'Atallah D', 'Pautier P', 'Lhomme C', 'Haie-Meder C', 'Duvillard P', 'Castaigne D']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Am Coll Surg,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,9431305,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Endometrioid/pathology/therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cystadenoma, Mucinous/pathology/therapy', 'Cystadenoma, Serous/pathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymph Node Excision', '*Lymphatic Metastasis/diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Complex and Mixed/pathology/therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2002/09/17 10:00,2002/10/17 04:00,['2002/09/17 10:00'],"['2002/09/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1072-7515(02)01250-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s1072-7515(02)01250-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Coll Surg. 2002 Sep;195(3):332-8. doi: 10.1016/s1072-7515(02)01250-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on a female infant with minimally differentiated acute leukemia (M 0) which underwent a lineage switch on relapse. In March 1997, a 1-year-8-month old girl was admitted to our hospital with a high-grade fever and generalized purpura. Bone marrow showed 84% blasts. The blasts were negative for peroxidase, periodic acid-Schiff and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase. Immunophenotypic analyses of the blast cells were positive for CD 13, CD 33 antigens, as well as CD 34. Lymphoid markers all were negative. Though some blasts morphologically demonstrated cytoplasmic blebs, CD 41 was negative and ultrastructural platelet peroxidase was absent. Based on these hematological features, the patient was diagnosed as having AML-M 0. She was treated according to the Children's Cancer and Leukemia Study Group schedule and a complete remission was achieved 1.5 months after starting induction therapy. However, she relapsed in spite of continued chemotherapy in July 1997, when the cytomorphological pattern changed and the patient was diagnosed both morphologically and immunologically as having M 7. Electron microscopy revealed platelet peroxidase (+) and CD 41 (+). Cytogenetic studies on relapse demonstrated inv(3) (q 21 p 25). We attempted aggressive reinduction therapy, but without effect. The patient simultaneously developed severe pneumonia and died in February, 1998.

One hundred twenty three patients at a variety of remission stages were eligible for study participation. Eighty-nine were transplanted with allogeneic grafts and 34 patients with autologous grafts (23 cases with bone marrow and 11 cases with peripheral blood stem cells). Conditioning regimens used were as follows: (A) melphalan and busulfan for 40 patients, (B) melphalan, busulfan and TBI for 44 patients, (C) other regimens for 39 patients. To accelerate engraftment G-CSF (lenograstim) was administered as a 1-hour or 24-hour drip infusion daily at 5 micrograms/kg from day 5 until hematological recovery. The five year disease free survival (DFS) was 63% for 42 patients at CR 1, 41% for 41 patients at CR 2 and 33% for 40 patients at other stages. There was no significant difference in the DFS between allogeneic-transplantation and autologous-transplantation in all disease stages.

This pilot study is a preliminary exploration of the effectiveness of interactive music therapy in reducing anxiety and increasing the comfort of hospitalized children with cancer. METHODS: Pre- and post-music therapy measures were obtained from children (N = 65) and parents. The measures consisted of children's ratings of mood using schematic faces, parental ratings of the child's play performance, and satisfaction questionnaires completed by parents, children and staff. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in children's ratings of their feelings from pre- to post-music therapy. Parents perceived an improved play performance after music therapy in pre-schoolers and adolescents but not in school-aged children. Qualitative analyses of children's and parents' comments suggested a positive impact of music therapy on the child's well-being. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings are encouraging and suggest beneficial effects of interactive music therapy with hospitalized pediatric hematology/oncology patients. In future studies replicating these findings should be conducted in a randomized control trial.","['Barrera, Maru E', 'Rykov, Mary H', 'Doyle, Sandra L']","['Barrera ME', 'Rykov MH', 'Doyle SL']","['Department of Psychology, The Hospital for Sick Children & University of Toronto, On, Canada. maru.barrera@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Hospitalized/*psychology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/psychology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/psychology/therapy', 'Male', '*Music Therapy', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy', 'Pain Measurement', '*Sick Role', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/09/14 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/14 10:00'],"['2002/09/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.589 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2002 Sep-Oct;11(5):379-88. doi: 10.1002/pon.589.,,,"['Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventeen (57%) breakpoints were mapped at five breakpoint cluster sites, BCS-LL1 to LL5, each of <15 bp. Two breakpoint cluster sites were located within the ARF and CDKN2B loci, respectively, whereas the remaining three were located >100 kb distal to the CDKN2A, ARF, and CDKN2B loci. The sequences of breakpoint junctions indicated that deletions in the 11 (73%) cell lines were mediated by illegitimate V(D)J recombination targeted at the five BCS-LL and six other sites, which contain sequences similar to recombination signal sequences for V(D)J recombination. An extrachromosomal V(D)J recombination assay indicated that BCS-LL3, at which the largest number of breakpoints (i.e. five breakpoints) was clustered, has a V(D)J recombination potential 150-fold less than the consensus recombination signal sequence. Three other BCS-LLs tested also showed V(D)J recombination potential, although it was lower than that of BCS-LL3.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients were treated with intravenous alemtuzumab at six centers in the United States. The target dose of 30 mg over 2 hours, three times weekly, was administered for up to 16 weeks. Responses were evaluated by an independent panel of experts using 1996 National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group criteria. Safety assessments included analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was not mandatory. RESULTS: Eight patients (33%) achieved a major response (all partial remissions), with a median time to response of 3.9 months (range, 1.6 to 5.3 months). The median duration of response was 15.4 months (range, 4.6 to >or= 38.0 months), the median time to disease progression was 19.6 months (range, 7.7 to >or= 42.0 months), and the median survival time was 35.8 months (range, 8.8 to >or= 47.1 months). Acute infusion-related events, mainly grades 1 and 2, were most common and most severe in the first week. Ten patients (eight nonresponders and two responders) experienced major infections on-study. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was reported in two patients on-study; neither had received prophylaxis. Median CD4+ and CD8+ counts decreased and then began to increase by the end of the study, with further recovery by 1-month follow-up. One of 53 samples obtained from 10 patients had a low titer of alemtuzumab antibodies. CONCLUSION: Alemtuzumab has significant activity in poor-prognosis, fludarabine-treated CLL patients. However, because of a relatively high incidence of opportunistic infections accompanying profound lymphopenia, future protocols should include mandatory prophylaxis.","['Rai, K R', 'Freter, C E', 'Mercier, R J', 'Cooper, M R', 'Mitchell, B S', 'Stadtmauer, E A', 'Santabarbara, P', 'Wacker, B', 'Brettman, L']","['Rai KR', 'Freter CE', 'Mercier RJ', 'Cooper MR', 'Mitchell BS', 'Stadtmauer EA', 'Santabarbara P', 'Wacker B', 'Brettman L']","['Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, NY 11040, USA. rai@lij.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Pilot Projects', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",2002/09/14 10:00,2002/10/17 04:00,['2002/09/14 10:00'],"['2002/09/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.06.119 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Sep 15;20(18):3891-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.06.119.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of patients enrolled onto an intergroup CLL trial were examined for this complication. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 544 previously untreated B-cell CLL patients were enrolled onto a randomized intergroup study comparing treatment with chlorambucil, fludarabine, or fludarabine plus chlorambucil. Case report forms from 521 patients were reviewed for t-AML. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 4.2 years, six patients (1.2%) to date have developed therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS; n = 3), t-AML (n = 2), or t-MDS evolving to t-AML (n = 1), from 27 to 53 months (median, 34 months) after study entry. This included five (3.5%) of 142 patients treated with fludarabine plus chlorambucil and one (0.5%) of 188 receiving fludarabine; no chlorambucil-treated patients developed t-MDS or t-AML (P =.007). At study entry, the median age among these six patients was 56 years (range, 44 to 72 years); three were male; the CLL Rai stage was I/II (n = 4) or III/IV (n = 2). Response to CLL therapy was complete (n = 4) or partial remission (n = 1) and stable disease (n = 1). Marrow cytogenetics, obtained in three of six cases at diagnosis of t-MDS or t-AML, were complex, with abnormalities in either or both chromosomes 5 and 7. Other abnormalities involved chromosomes X, 1, 8, 12, 17, and 19. Median survival after diagnosis of t-MDS/AML was 3.5 months (range, 0.5 to 10.1 months). CONCLUSION: Our findings raise the possibility that alkylator-purine analog combination therapy may increase the risk of therapy-related myeloid malignancies, which is of particular relevance with regard to ongoing trials using these combination therapies.","['Morrison, Vicki A', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Peterson, Bercedis L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Elias, Laurence', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Hines, John D', 'Shepherd, Lois', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Schiffer, Charles A']","['Morrison VA', 'Rai KR', 'Peterson BL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Elias L', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Hines JD', 'Shepherd L', 'Larson RA', 'Schiffer CA']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN 55417, USA. morri002@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,['J Clin Oncol. 2003 Oct 1;21(19):3709; author reply 3709-10.

Another threat represents the consequence of the protective upbringing and inactive lifestyle. The aim of present study was to assess the exercise cardiorespiratory indexes and anthropometric variables in previously treated children without clinical, ECG and echocardiographic signs of cardiotoxicity, who had been motivated to physical activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: 29 children (12.3 +/- 2.7 years old) previously treated for ALL with anthracyclines were examined. The cumulative dosis of anthracyclines was 224 +/- 39.4 mg/m2. The treatment was finished before 4.8 +/- 2.1 years and after this period no signs of the late cardiotoxicity were detectable. Both children and their parents were encouraged to the regular physical activity of submaximal intensity. 29 age- and sex-matched control subjects were healthy children, never limited in their activities, but without special physical training. As soon as the basic anthropometric data had been verified, both groups completed a progressive exercise test with the assessment of submaximal and maximal spiroergometric indexes. In all parameters followed we failed to prove any significant differences between the two groups. The treated children exhibited only slightly lower body height, higher body weight and higher percentage of body fat. They reached lower respiratory exchange ratio (R), with higher oxygen uptake on both submaximal and maximal load levels. CONCLUSIONS: When sufficiently motivated, children surviving five years after the treatment with anthracycline for ALL, who have no signs of cardiotoxic effects, have their functional cardiorespiratory capacity approximately comparable to that of healthy children.","['Vizinova, H', 'Malincikova, J', 'Klaskova, E', 'Wiedermann, J']","['Vizinova H', 'Malincikova J', 'Klaskova E', 'Wiedermann J']","['Klinika rehabilitacniho a telovychovneho lekarstvi LF UP, Olomouc. helena.vizinova@fnol.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Exercise Test', '*Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', '*Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/physiopathology/rehabilitation', '*Respiratory Mechanics']",2002/09/14 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/09/14 10:00'],"['2002/09/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2002 Aug 2;141(15):491-3.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",,,,,Zatezove kardiorespiracni parametry u deti motivovanych k pohybove aktivite po prelecene akutni lymfoblasticke leukemii.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether these two activities interact to regulate cell survival remains to be tested. Here we have analysed survival of inducible c-Myc-overexpressing cell lines derived from U2OS human osteosarcoma cells, which carry wild-type pRb and p53 and are deficient for p16 and ARF expression. Induced U2OS-Myc cells neither underwent apoptosis spontaneously nor upon reconstitution of the ARF-p53 axis and/or serum-starvation. However, they died massively when concomitantly exposed to inhibitors of E2F activity, including a constitutively active pRb (RbDeltacdk) mutant, p16, a stable p27 (p27T187A) mutant, a dominant-negative (dn) CDK2, or dnDP-1. Similar apoptotic effect was observed upon down-modulation of endogenous E2Fs through overexpression of E2F binding site oligonucleotides in U2OS-Myc cells, upon expression of RbDeltacdk or dnDP-1 in the Myc-amplified HL-60 (ARF-; p53-) human leukemia cells, and upon co-transfection of Myc and RbDeltacdk in SAOS-2 (ARF+; p53-) human osteosarcoma cells but not in human primary fibroblasts. Consistent with these results, a dnp53 mutant did not abrogate the Myc-induced apoptotic phenotype, which instead strictly depended on caspase-3-like proteases and on Myc transcriptional activity. Our data indicate that in contrast to normal cells, Myc-overexpressing human cancer cells need E2F activity for their survival, regardless of their ARF and p53 status, a notion that may have important implications for antineoplastic treatment strategies.","['Santoni-Rugiu, Eric', 'Duro, Dominique', 'Farkas, Thomas', 'Mathiasen, Ida S', 'Jaattela, Marja', 'Bartek, Jiri', 'Lukas, Jiri']","['Santoni-Rugiu E', 'Duro D', 'Farkas T', 'Mathiasen IS', 'Jaattela M', 'Bartek J', 'Lukas J']","['Department of Cell Cycle and Cancer, Institute of Cancer Biology, Danish Cancer Society, 2100 Copenhagen E., Denmark. bartek@biobase.dk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Genes, Dominant/physiology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Oligonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Osteosarcoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2002/09/13 10:00,2002/10/02 04:00,['2002/09/13 10:00'],"['2002/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2002/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/02 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1205828 [doi]', '1205828 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Sep 19;21(42):6498-509. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205828.,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To establish a case definition, to describe management, and to identify risk factors for fludarabine-related pulmonary toxicity. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary-care US Army teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Individuals treated with fludarabine at our institution between January 1989 and June 2000. MEASUREMENTS: Cases of fludarabine-related pulmonary toxicity were defined as follows: dyspnea, fever, hypoxemia, and radiographic infiltrates seen in a patient treated with fludarabine; cases were excluded if there was evidence of pulmonary infection or progression of underlying lymphoproliferative disease affecting the lungs. For each case, demographic data, medical history, radiographic information, available bronchoscopy and pathology data, and details of treatment were reviewed. Cases were compared with fludarabine-treated control subjects to identify potential risk factors. Comparisons were made with regard to age, gender, history of underlying lung disease, lymphoproliferative diagnosis, prior chemotherapy, fludarabine treatment regimen, and pretreatment chest radiograph. RESULTS: During the study period, 105 patients were treated with fludarabine. The incidence of fludarabine-related pulmonary toxicity using our definition was 8.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2 to 13.9%). One patient died before this entity was suspected; the remainder of the patients underwent bronchoscopy to exclude infection. Patients were treated with corticosteroids with subjective and objective benefits. One patient later died of apparent infection during steroid therapy. One patient was retreated with fludarabine and symptoms of lung toxicity developed again. Patients (n = 9) were similar to control subjects (n = 96) with respect to age, gender, history of underlying lung disease, previous chemotherapy, and fludarabine regimen. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were 13.3 (95% CI, 1.6 to 300.6) times more likely to have toxicity develop than patients treated with fludarabine for other diagnoses. There was a trend toward an increased incidence in patients with interstitial infiltrates apparent on prefludarabine chest radiographs. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of lung conditions arise in patients treated with fludarabine; however, this agent seems to cause direct pulmonary toxicity. After performing an appropriate evaluation to exclude infection, corticosteroids are an effective therapy.

Through 1998, 261 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (137 diffuse, 58 follicular, and 32 small lymphocytic lymphomas) and 63 cases of B-CLL were identified by linkage to the Iowa Cancer Registry. Height, weight, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, and physical activity were not associated with risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma overall or with diffuse or follicular lymphoma in particular. After adjustment for other non-Hodgkin's lymphoma risk factors, there was an inverse association of baseline body mass index (relative risks (RRs) across quartiles: 1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.3; p trend = 0.03) with risk of small lymphocytic lymphoma. In contrast, for B-CLL there were suggestive positive associations with body mass index at age 50 years (RRs across quartiles: 1, 1.9, 1.5, 2.7; p trend = 0.03) and (more weakly) baseline body mass index (RRs across quartiles: 1, 1.1, 1.6, 1.3; p trend = 0.3). In summary, we found no evidence that height, weight, body mass, or physical activity plays an important role in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma overall or in diffuse or follicular lymphoma in particular. The opposite associations of body mass index with small lymphocytic lymphoma versus B-CLL may be a chance finding but, if confirmed, would suggest different etiologies for these malignancies.","['Cerhan, James R', 'Janney, Carol A', 'Vachon, Celine M', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Potter, John D', 'Sellers, Thomas A', 'Folsom, Aaron R']","['Cerhan JR', 'Janney CA', 'Vachon CM', 'Habermann TM', 'Kay NE', 'Potter JD', 'Sellers TA', 'Folsom AR']","['Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. cerhan.james@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,['Am J Epidemiol. 2003 Jul 15;158(2):190.

The authors examined associations of first-degree family history of cancer with adult acute leukemia incidence by using data on 811 patients (or their proxies) identified at diagnosis and 637 population-based controls in the United States and Canada during 1986-1990. For proxy-interviewed patients, relative risks were elevated for family history of any cancer (relative risk = 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 2.4), hematopoietic cancer (relative risk = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1, 3.0), leukemia (relative risk = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3, 4.6), and breast cancer (relative risk = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.0) but not for colorectal, prostate, or lung cancer. For self-interviewed patients, family history of hematopoietic cancer was inversely associated with leukemia incidence (relative risk = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4, 1.1). Regardless of patient interview type, history of breast cancer in sisters was positively associated with adult acute leukemia, whereas history of breast cancer in mothers was not. The role of family history of cancer in leukemia etiology is unclear because of differential reporting by patients and proxies. Specifically, self-interviewed patients may underreport cancer in their first-degree relatives. Associations between family history of breast cancer and leukemia incidence may be the result of unmeasured, shared etiologies specific to these cancers.","['Rauscher, Garth H', 'Sandler, Dale P', 'Poole, Charles', 'Pankow, James', 'Mitchell, Beverly', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Olshan, Andrew F']","['Rauscher GH', 'Sandler DP', 'Poole C', 'Pankow J', 'Mitchell B', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Olshan AF']","['Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Illinois-Chicago, Chicago, IL 60612, USA. garthr@uic.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', '*Medical History Taking', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Family', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Proxy', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment']",2002/09/13 10:00,2002/09/25 06:00,['2002/09/13 10:00'],"['2002/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2002/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/aje/kwf075 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2002 Sep 15;156(6):517-26. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwf075.,,,,"['CA09330-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57699-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to TcdB-10463, which inhibits RhoA/Rac1/Cdc42, or to C3 toxin, which inhibits RhoA, -B, -C, resulted in apoptosis, whereas inactivation of Rac1/Cdc42 with TcdB-1470 was without effect, suggesting that Rho inhibition was responsible for endothelial apoptosis. Disruption of endothelial microfilaments as well as inhibition of p160ROCK did not induce endothelial apoptosis. Exposure to TcdB-10463 resulted in activation of caspase-9 and -3 but not caspase-8 in HUVEC. Moreover, Rho inhibition reduced expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and increased proapoptotic Bid but had no effect on Bax or FLIP protein levels. Caspase-3 activity and apoptosis induced by TcdB-10463 were abolished by cAMP elevation.

To identify new LAA, we used the method of serologic screening of cDNA expression libraries (SEREX). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A SEREX library of the cell line K562 was subjected to allogeneic screening with sera from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) vs sera from healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The receptor for hyaluronan acid-mediated motility (RHAMM) involved in cell growth and metastasis was identified as a new LAA. Serologic responses to RHAMM were observed in patients with AML (42%), CML (31%), melanoma (83%), renal cell carcinoma (40%), breast cancer (67%), and ovarian carcinoma (50%), but not in HV or patients with autoimmune diseases. RHAMM mRNA was detectable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMN) of 60% of newly diagnosed AML patients. Western blotting stained positive for RHAMM protein in 70% of AML patients. mRNA expression of RHAMM also was found in patients with CML (40%), renal cell carcinoma (73%), breast carcinoma (60%), and ovarian carcinoma (50%). In melanoma, RHAMM mRNA expression was detected in metastases (80%) but not in primary tumors. RHAMM is differentially expressed: significant mRNA expression was not found in normal tissues, except from testis, placenta, and thymus, or in PBMN- and CD34-separated cell samples of healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: RHAMM is an immunogenic antigen in leukemias and solid tumors and might be a potential target structure for cellular immunotherapies and antibody therapies.","['Greiner, Jochen', 'Ringhoffer, Mark', 'Taniguchi, Masanori', 'Schmitt, Anita', 'Kirchner, Dieter', 'Krahn, Gertraud', 'Heilmann, Volker', 'Gschwend, Jurgen', 'Bergmann, Lothar', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Greiner J', 'Ringhoffer M', 'Taniguchi M', 'Schmitt A', 'Kirchner D', 'Krahn G', 'Heilmann V', 'Gschwend J', 'Bergmann L', 'Dohner H', 'Schmitt M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Carcinoma/metabolism', 'Computer Systems', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'K562 Cells/metabolism', 'Kidney Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Melanoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/09/13 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/13 10:00'],"['2002/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02008743 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00874-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Sep;30(9):1029-35. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00874-3.,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both cases the patients inherited a maternal haplotype that is the result of a recombination event between the mother's HLA-DRB1 and -B genes on their chromosomes. Based on linkage disequilibrium it is likely that the recombinant haplotypes are present in the patients rather than their brothers.

We examined the expression of NADPH oxidase components in ML-1 cells treated with ATRA, GM-CSF, or a combination of ATRA and GM-CSF. Expression of p47phox and gp91phox proteins increased markedly after treatment with both reagents. p47phox expression was increased by ATRA alone, and the expression was increased synergistically by the combination of ATRA with GM-CSF. gp91phox was increased by ATRA or GM-CSF alone. The expression of p47phox and gp91phox mRNA underwent similar changes to those seen in protein level.

We speculate that the remarkable induction of gp91phox and p47phox protein is associated with an increase in superoxide-generating activity due to the synergistic effect of ATRA plus GM-CSF.","['Shimizu, Takahisa', 'Kodama, Reiko', 'Tsunawaki, Shohko', 'Takeda, Ken']","['Shimizu T', 'Kodama R', 'Tsunawaki S', 'Takeda K']","['Department of Hygiene Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Science University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/13 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/13 10:00'],"['2002/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['1o627 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01627.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2002 Jun;68(6):382-8. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01627.x.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the long-term results of a randomised study performed by the Leukaemia Group of Middle Sweden during 1984-88 comparing two intensive chemotherapeutic drug combinations. Ninety patients >or=60-yr old with untreated AML were randomly allocated to treatment with daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), and thioguanine (TAD) (43 patients) or a combination in which aclarubicin was substituted for daunorubicin (TAA) (47 patients). Forty-four patients (49%) entered complete remission (CR), 22/43 (51%) in the TAD group and 22/47 (47%) in the TAA group (ns). The CR rate in patients <or=70 yr of age was 30/42 (71%) and in patients >70 yr 14/48 (29%) (P<0.0001). Early death within 30 d after treatment initiation was more often seen in patients >70 yr than in patients <or=70 yr of age, 40% and 12%, respectively (P<0.005). The median cause-specific survival time was 178 d in the total patient group, and the 2-, 5-, and 10-yr survivals were 22%, 11%, and 8%, respectively. The cause-specific survival was not significantly different between the two treatment arms. At long-term follow-up >or=10 yr after inclusion of the last patient, 5/90 patients (one in the TAD group and four in the TAA group, respectively) were still alive, four in continuous complete remission and one in second complete remission. Thus, both treatment regimens appear to have similar efficacy, with a relatively high complete remission rate, and a reasonable survival as compared to other studies including some long-term survivors. However, early deaths are still numerous, particularly in patients above 70 yr of age, and the relapse rate is substantial.","['Oberg, G', 'Killander, A', 'Bjoreman, M', 'Gahrton, G', 'Grimfors, G', 'Gruber, A', 'Hast, R', 'Lerner, R', 'Liliemark, J', 'Mattson, S', 'Paul, C', 'Simonsson, B', 'Stalfelt, A-M', 'Stenke, L', 'Tidefelt, U', 'Uden, A-M', 'Bjorkholm, M']","['Oberg G', 'Killander A', 'Bjoreman M', 'Gahrton G', 'Grimfors G', 'Gruber A', 'Hast R', 'Lerner R', 'Liliemark J', 'Mattson S', 'Paul C', 'Simonsson B', 'Stalfelt AM', 'Stenke L', 'Tidefelt U', 'Uden AM', 'Bjorkholm M']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.

Prolongation of survival time of animals receiving drugs in combination compared to mice treated with drugs in monotherapy was tested. We have also evaluated interactions of the cytostatics on murine leukemias in vitro by measuring their inhibitory effects on P388 and L1210 cell proliferation. We have observed a synergistic effect of MIT and IDA in combination with 2-CdA on P388 leukemia resulting in an increase of life span (ILS)=226% in case of MIT+2-CdA and ILS=126% in the case of IDA+2-CdA, whereas 2-CdA used as a sole drug resulted in an ILS=47%. The survival time of animals inoculated with P388 leukemic cells and treated with DOX+ 2-CdA was similar to ILS gained by DOX monotherapy (178% and 200% respectively). The mice bearing L1210 leukemia receiving combined chemotherapy lived significantly longer than the animals on single agent regimens. The animals treated with schedule 2-CdA+MIT lived significantly longer (P=0.004) as compared to the groups receiving drugs in monotherapy (ILS of 2-CdA+MIT group=60%, ILS of MIT group 33%, and 2-CdA group 33%). Finally, combination of DOX or IDA with 2-CdA resulted in ILS =73% (2-CdA+DOX regimen), and ILS=60% in case of 2-CdA+IDA regimen, which is significantly higher than ILS gained on monotherapy schedules. In vitro tests revealed that all tested anthracyclines enhance the antiproliferative activity of 2-CdA against L1210 and P388 leukemic cells (P<0.05). Our study has shown that all anthracyclines potentiate 2-CdA antileukemic activity, both in vivo and in vitro. It failed however to point the best one to be combined with cladribine. We suggests that further clinical trials with such combinations are needed.","['Szmigielska-Kaplon, Anna', 'Ciesielska, Ewa', 'Szmigiero, Leszek', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Szmigielska-Kaplon A', 'Ciesielska E', 'Szmigiero L', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, 93-513 Lodz, ul Pabianicka 62, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cladribine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/13 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/13 10:00'],"['2002/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['1o598 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01598.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2002 Jun;68(6):370-5. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.01598.x.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-2R is a member of the common gamma-chain (gammac)-receptor family and shares gamma with IL-4R, IL-7R, IL-9R, and IL-15R. In addition to IL-2R, ATL cells express IL-15R and respond to IL-15. In the present study, we examined other members of this receptor family. ATL cells showed various levels of IL-4Ralpha (CD124) and IL-7Ralpha (CD127) expression, and responded to these cytokines. In contrast, ATL cells hardly responded to IL-9. As primary samples were a mixed population and the results may have been modified by contaminating normal cells, we used ATL cell lines as pure ATL cell populations. Here, we report that IL-2-dependent ATL cell lines also express IL-4Ralpha and respond to IL-4, which was verified by the activation of cytoplasmic transcriptional activator Stat6 protein. Moreover, a novel ATL cell line that grows stably in an IL-7-dependent manner was established from one of the cell lines, and IL-7 induced Stat5 activation in this cell line. These results indicated that ATL cells have the potential to express all gammac-receptors except IL-9R. Overlapping and switching of cytokine receptors supported the idea that ATL cells can rapidly select the appropriate gammac-receptor according to conditions.","['Baba, Hirofumi', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Mori, Naoki', 'Hayashibara, Toshihisa', 'Harasawa, Hitomi', 'Tsuruda, Kazuto', 'Sugahara, Kazuyuki', 'Soda, Hiroshi', 'Takasaki, Yumi', 'Tawara, Masayuki', 'Hirakata, Yoichi', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Baba H', 'Yamada Y', 'Mori N', 'Hayashibara T', 'Harasawa H', 'Tsuruda K', 'Sugahara K', 'Soda H', 'Takasaki Y', 'Tawara M', 'Hirakata Y', 'Tomonaga M', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/13 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/13 10:00'],"['2002/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['0o653 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.00653.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2002 Jun;68(6):362-9. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2002.00653.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the liposomal preparation of daunorubicin (DNR) (DaunoXome, or DNX) is expected to be less toxic than conventional DNR, we tested DNX combined with high-dose arabinosyl cytosine (HDAC) in 42 adult poor-risk acute leukemia patients. Thirty-one patients had acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Of these, 12 patients were newly diagnosed but were not eligible for standard induction treatment, 13 were in first relapse, and 6 were in second or subsequent relapse. Eleven patients had acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), in first (eight cases) or second (three cases) relapse. DNX was given i.v. in three doses of 80 or 100 mg/m(2) each (days 1-3) by a 60-min infusion in glucose 5%, followed by a 4-h infusion of HDAC 2 g/m(2) (days 1-5).

The response rate was not affected by the overexpression of MDR-related proteins (PgP, MRP-1, and LRP). Non-hemopoietic toxicity was negligible, with no intestinal toxicity and only one case of gram-negative bacteremia. We conclude that DNX, in combination with HDAC, is an effective treatment for poor-risk adult AL.

As impacts during the conditioning regimen may predict later transplantation-associated complications, we investigated changes in platelet membrane glycoproteins (GP) and the liberation of microparticles. Platelet receptors and granules of 49 patients undergoing HSCT were evaluated by flow cytometric analysis before and after the different phases of the conditioning regimen [chemotherapy, total body irradiation (TBI), therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG)] and final transplantation. Following chemotherapy a high surface expression of CD62P, a low mepacrine staining, and a reduced surface expression of CD42b (part of the GP Ib/V/IX complex) were found, indicating an irreversible activation of platelets. In addition, elevated levels of circulating microparticles were observed, which may reinforce the thrombosis risk in these patients. Treatment with ATG leads to an elevated surface expression of PAC-1 epitopes, which are neoepitopes appearing after activation of GP IIb/IIIa. However, a significant degranulation was not detectable, which may be the consequence of inhibitory influences on platelets during ATG-induced cytokine release syndrome. TBI and transplantation itself had no influence on platelets. This study was able to demonstrate activating effects on platelets by certain phases of the conditioning regimen in patients receiving HSCT. Chemotherapy, in particular, leads to a strong and irreversible platelet activation and a generation of microparticles, which may cause an increased thrombosis risk.

The main prescriptions for this treatment are primary non-curable by blood letting hemochromatosis, secondary hemosiderosis, and aluminum intoxication associated with chronic kidney failure. Since the early 1980s, ocular toxicity has been documented in several publications. OBSERVATIONS: We recorded three clinical observations of patients presenting symptoms of an ocular toxicity caused by deferoxamine. The prescription of this treatment related to the presence of secondary hemosiderosis (a case of primitive myelofibrosis and a case of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia treated by blood transfusion) and an aluminum intoxication affecting a patient with chronic kidney failure. All three patients presented a gradual loss of visual acuity. The following were predominantly observed at the fundus examination which showed pigmentary anomalies near the macula such as mottling and dispersion affecting the electrophysiological studies. The termination of the treatment did not result in an improvement in the symptomatology. DISCUSSION: Considering the latest literature on the subject, the indications as well as the pharmaceutical properties of deferoxamine, the ophthalmological symptoms of this intoxication, the additional investigations and the anatomicopathological analyses are restated, together with the current pathogenical hypothesis. CONCLUSION: Deferoxamine can cause ocular toxicity resulting in severe and permanent lesions of the retinal pigment epithelium. The occurrence of disorders of the fundus and visual acuity requires, before and during the treatment, regular ophthalmological monitoring combined with electrophysiological explorations. This allows early treatment of the hematological or kidney disorder.","['Szwarcberg, J', 'Mack, G', 'Flament, J']","['Szwarcberg J', 'Mack G', 'Flament J']","[""Clinique Ophtalmologique, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, 1, place de l'hopital, 67091 Strasbourg cedex.

We have addressed the stimulation of galectin-9 expression in endothelial cells. Galectin-9 was detected in membrane and cytosolic fractions of human umbilical vein endothelial cells stimulated with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). IFN-gamma also enhanced the adhesion of human eosinophilic leukemia-1 cells to endothelial monolayers, and it was inhibited by the presence of lactose. Interleukin-4, which induces eotaxin expression, did not affect the expression of galectin-9. The in situ endothelium from patients with inflammatory diseases was found to express galectin-9. IFN-gamma-induced production of galectin-9 by endothelial cells may play an important role in immune responses by regulating interactions between the vascular wall and eosinophils.","['Imaizumi, Tadaatsu', 'Kumagai, Mika', 'Sasaki, Naoko', 'Kurotaki, Hidekachi', 'Mori, Fumiaki', 'Seki, Masako', 'Nishi, Nozomu', 'Fujimoto, Koji', 'Tanji, Kunikazu', 'Shibata, Takeo', 'Tamo, Wakako', 'Matsumiya, Tomoh', 'Yoshida, Hidemi', 'Cui, Xue-Fan', 'Takanashi, Shingo', 'Hanada, Katsumi', 'Okumura, Ken', 'Yagihashi, Soroku', 'Wakabayashi, Koichi', 'Nakamura, Takanori', 'Hirashima, Mitsuomi', 'Satoh, Kei']","['Imaizumi T', 'Kumagai M', 'Sasaki N', 'Kurotaki H', 'Mori F', 'Seki M', 'Nishi N', 'Fujimoto K', 'Tanji K', 'Shibata T', 'Tamo W', 'Matsumiya T', 'Yoshida H', 'Cui XF', 'Takanashi S', 'Hanada K', 'Okumura K', 'Yagihashi S', 'Wakabayashi K', 'Nakamura T', 'Hirashima M', 'Satoh K']","['Department of Vascular Biology, Institute of Brain Science, Hirosaki University School of Medicine, Japan. timaizum@cc.hirosaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,,"['Autoimmune Diseases/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL11', 'Chemokines, CC/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Eosinophils/cytology', '*Galectins', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/pathology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Lactose/pharmacology', 'Lectins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nasal Polyps/chemistry', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal/metabolism/pathology', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/metabolism/pathology"", 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'Umbilical Veins']",2002/09/12 10:00,2002/10/18 04:00,['2002/09/12 10:00'],"['2002/09/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/12 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2002 Sep;72(3):486-91.,"['0 (CCL11 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL11)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Galectins)', '0 (LGALS9 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'J2B2A4N98G (Lactose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL-associated chromosomal rearrangements usually occur in tumours of specific haematological lineages, suggesting a crucial role for the MLL fusion partner in determining disease phenotype (or tumour tropism). The MLL gene is homologous to Drosophila trithorax, and is likewise involved in embryo pattern formation. Common themes linking several of the MLL partners include a possible involvement in embryo patterning via Hox gene regulation and chromatin remodelling.

The major cleavage site is located C-terminally of Arg-100; alternative cleavage sites are also present. Since the cleavage process is still unclear, we looked for proteases involved in TfR ectodomain release. In the supernatant of U937 histiocytic cells we detected alternatively cleaved TfR (at Glu-110). In membrane fractions of these cells we identified two distinct proteolytic activities responsible for TfR cleavage within the stalk at either Val-108 or Lys-95. Both activities could be inhibited by serine protease inhibitors, but not by inhibitors of any other class of proteases. Protein purification yielded a 28 kDa protein that generated the Val-108 terminus. The protease activity could be ascribed to neutrophil elastase according to the substrate specificity determined by amino acid substitution analysis of synthetic peptides, an inhibitor profile, the size of the protease and the use of specific antibodies. The results of analogous experiments suggest that the second activity is represented by another serine protease, cathepsin G. Thus, membrane-associated forms of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G may be involved in alternative TfR shedding in U937 cells.","['Kaup, Matthias', 'Dassler, Katrin', 'Reineke, Ulrich', 'Weise, Christoph', 'Tauber, Rudolf', 'Fuchs, Hendrik']","['Kaup M', 'Dassler K', 'Reineke U', 'Weise C', 'Tauber R', 'Fuchs H']","['Institut fur Klinische Chemie und Pathobiochemie, Universitatsklinikum Benjamin Franklin, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biotin/metabolism', 'Cathepsin G', 'Cathepsins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endopeptidases/analysis/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Elastase/*metabolism', 'Membranes/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Transferrin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases']",2002/09/12 10:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2002/09/12 10:00'],"['2002/09/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/BC.2002.108 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Chem. 2002 Jun;383(6):1011-20. doi: 10.1515/BC.2002.108.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That these same autoantibodies are causative of chronic urticaria is highly probable, but not entirely proven, since no animal model of chronic urticaria has been devised using these autoantibodies. However we know that intradermal injection of anti-FceR1 IgG in healthy volunteers does cause an urticarial reaction. The concept of chronic urticaria as a disease caused by autoantibodies activating the normal function of target cells (mast cells) by combination with a receptor epitope is intriguing, although not entirely unique, since a similar mechanism appears to underlie some types of autoimmune hyperthyroidism. The detection of patients with these antibodies is usually not possible by clinical assessment alone. Unfortunately no convenient or reliable immunoassays have been developed to detect the autoantibodies, and the gold standard remains the basophil mediator release assay, using normal human donor basophils or a basophil leukemia cell line. The autologous serum skin test has proved to be a useful screening test for autoimmune urticaria. Identification of patients with autoimmune urticaria is of some importance because, apart from obviating the necessity for irrelevant tests, immunotherapy, using cyclosporin, intravenous immunoglobulin or even plasmapheresis can be contemplated in severely affected treatment-resistant patients.","['Greaves, Malcolm']",['Greaves M'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,9504368,IM,,"['Autoantibodies/analysis/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology/*immunology/therapy', 'Autoimmunity/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Urticaria/*etiology/*immunology/therapy']",2002/09/12 10:00,2003/04/10 05:00,['2002/09/12 10:00'],"['2002/09/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['CRIAI:23:2:171 [pii]', '10.1385/CRIAI:23:2:171 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Rev Allergy Immunol. 2002 Oct;23(2):171-83. doi: 10.1385/CRIAI:23:2:171.,['0 (Autoantibodies)'],40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, these AMLs displayed the clinical features that have previously been described as characteristic for this disease entity: low median age, hyperleukocytosis, M4Eo morphology, and a favorable prognosis. However, CNS leukemia was only seen in relapse in one patient diagnosed in 1980, whereas the most common EML manifestation in our series was lymphadenopathy (5/27, 19%), most often cervical with or without gross tonsillar enlargement. A review of previously published, clinically informative cases corroborates that lymphadenopathy, with preference for the cervical region, is the most common EML at diagnosis in inv(16)-positive AML (58/175, 33%). CNS leukemia, on the other hand, has been reported in only 17% of the cases, mostly in the relapse setting, with a diminishing frequency over time, possibly due to protective effects of high-dose cytarabine. Other reported EML sites include the scalp, ovaries, and the intestine. Cervicotonsillar EML was in our series associated with a shorter duration of first remission, (P < 0.05), and may hence prove to be an important clinical parameter when deciding treatment strategies in AML with inv(16)/t(16;16).","['Billstrom, R', 'Ahlgren, T', 'Bekassy, A N', 'Malm, C', 'Olofsson, T', 'Hoglund, M', 'Mitelman, F', 'Johansson, B']","['Billstrom R', 'Ahlgren T', 'Bekassy AN', 'Malm C', 'Olofsson T', 'Hoglund M', 'Mitelman F', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Hematology, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. rolf.billstrom@skane.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*epidemiology/genetics/pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Palatine Tonsil/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/09/11 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/09/11 10:00'],"['2002/09/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10170 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2002 Sep;71(1):15-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10170.,,32,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of TRAIL in HFRPE induced apoptosis was evaluated. METHODS: Pure cultures of HFRPE cells were isolated. The expression of TRAIL protein and mRNA in non-activated and IFN-gamma activated HFRPE cells was evaluated with RT-PCR. The role of TRAIL in HFRPE induced apoptosis was assessed by incubating HFRPE cells with human T-cell leukemia line Jurkat (Jkt) in the presence or absence of neutralizing TRAIL antibodies. Cultures were pulsed with [(3)H]-thymidine to measure Jkt cell proliferation. The role of TRAIL was further examined by western blott evaluating the cleavage of caspases 8 and 10 in Jkt cells after their incubation with HFRPE cells. RESULTS: HFRPE cells expressed TRAIL mRNA. The expression of TRAIL mRNA and protein was up-regulated by IFN-gamma activation. However, anti-TRAIL antibodies were not able to prevent the HFRPE induced suppression of Jkt cell proliferation.

Activation of these GTPases is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which promote GDP to GTP exchange. In this study we have characterized XPLN, a Rho family GEF. Like other Rho GEFs, XPLN contains a tandem Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology domain topography, but lacks homology with other known functional domains or motifs. XPLN protein is expressed in the brain, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, platelets, and macrophage and neuronal cell lines. In vitro, XPLN stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange on RhoA and RhoB, but not RhoC, RhoG, Rac1, or Cdc42. Consistent with these data, XPLN preferentially associates with RhoA and RhoB. The specificity of XPLN for RhoA and RhoB, but not RhoC, is surprising given that they share over 85% sequence identity. We determined that the inability of XPLN to exchange RhoC is mediated by isoleucine 43 in RhoC, a position occupied by valine in RhoA and RhoB. When expressed in cells, XPLN activates RhoA and RhoB, but not RhoC, and stimulates the assembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions in a Rho kinase-dependent manner. We also found that XPLN possesses transforming activity, as determined by focus formation assays. In conclusion, here we describe a Rho family GEF that can discriminate between the closely related RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC, possibly giving insight to the divergent functions of these three proteins.","['Arthur, William T', 'Ellerbroek, Shawn M', 'Der, Channing J', 'Burridge, Keith', 'Wennerberg, Krister']","['Arthur WT', 'Ellerbroek SM', 'Der CJ', 'Burridge K', 'Wennerberg K']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20020906,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Focal Adhesions/physiology', 'Gene Library', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transfection', 'ras Proteins', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'rhoB GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'rhoC GTP-Binding Protein']",2002/09/11 10:00,2003/02/07 04:00,['2002/09/11 10:00'],"['2002/09/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M207401200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71892-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Nov 8;277(45):42964-72. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M207401200.

We report here a crystallographic study of fragments of Ets-1 that provide structural details of the inhibitory module and the structural transition that accompanies DNA binding.

We report here that telomere maintenance in the telomerase-positive human ovarian SKOV-3 cells was not affected by inhibition of telomerase. For comparison, the effect of telomerase inhibitors on telomere maintenance in another telomerase-positive cell line (i.e. human pharynx FaDu cells) and the telomerase-negative human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells was examined. Telomerase activity was measured using a modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol and telomere length was measured using a solution hybridization-based method and fluorescence in situ hybridization. A reverse transcriptase inhibitor (3'-azido-deoxythymidine or AZT) and an antisense against a component of human telomerase RNA (antisense hTR) were used to inhibit telomerase. FaDu and SKOV-3 cells showed comparable baseline telomerase activity. Telomerase activity in both cells was inhibited about equally by AZT (maximal inhibition of approximately 80%) and by expression of antisense hTR (complete inhibition in SKOV-3 cells and maximal inhibition of approximately 80% in FaDu cells). However, treatment with telomerase inhibitors resulted in approximately 50% telomere shortening in FaDu cells but had no effect on SKOV-3 nor Saos-2 cells. SKOV-3 cells did not show the characteristic features of ALT (i.e. heterogeneous telomere length and promyelocytic leukemia bodies), whereas these ALT features were observed in Saos-2 cells.

At permissive temperature, clone 1-5 cells differentiated along the erythroid pathway, and clone 3-2 cells that produced greater levels (3.5-fold) of p53 underwent apoptosis. Apoptosis of 3-2 cells was accompanied by mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation as well as by cleavage of caspase substrates.

Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of benomyl and carbendazim.,1-35,"The known aneuploidogens, benomyl and its metabolite, carbendazim (methyl 2-benzimidazole carbamate (MBC)), were selected for the third in a series of ongoing projects with selected pesticides. Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity data submitted to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (US EPA's) Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) as part of the registration process are examined along with data from the open literature. Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity profiles are developed to provide a complete overview and to determine whether an association can be made between benomyl- and MBC-induced mouse liver tumors and aneuploidy. Since aneuploidogens are considered to indirectly affect DNA, the framework adopted by the Agency for evaluating any mode of action (MOA) for carcinogenesis is applied to the benomyl/MBC data. Both agents displayed consistent, positive results for aneuploidy induction but mostly negative results for gene mutations. Non-linear dose responses were seen both in vitro and in vivo for aneuploidy endpoints. No evidence was found suggesting that an alternative MOA other than aneuploidy may be operative. The data show that by 14 days of benomyl treatment, events associated with liver toxicity appear to set in motion the sequence of actions that leads to neoplasms. Genetic changes (as indicated by spindle impairment leading to missegregation of chromosomes, micronucleus induction and subsequent aneuploidy in bone marrow cells) can commence within 1-24h after dosing, well within the time frame for early key events. Critical steps associated with frank tumor formation in the mouse liver include hepatotoxicity, increased liver weights, cell proliferation, hypertrophy, and other steps involving hepatocellular alteration and eventual progression to neoplasms. The analysis, however, reveals weaknesses in the data base for both agents (i.e. no studies on mouse tubulin binding, no in vivo assays of aneuploidy on the target tissue (liver), and no clear data on cell proliferation relative to dose response and time dependency). The deficiencies in defining the MOA for benomyl/MBC introduce uncertainties into the analysis; consequently, benomyl/MBC induction of aneuploidy cannot be definitively linked to mouse liver carcinogenicity at this time.","['McCarroll, Nancy E', 'Protzel, Alberto', 'Ioannou, Yiannakis', 'Frank Stack, H Frank', 'Jackson, Marcus A', 'Waters, Michael D', 'Dearfield, Kerry L']","['McCarroll NE', 'Protzel A', 'Ioannou Y', 'Frank Stack HF', 'Jackson MA', 'Waters MD', 'Dearfield KL']","['US Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pesticide Programs, Health Effects Division (7509C), Washington, DC 20460, USA. mccarroll.nancy@epa.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,,"['Animals', 'Benomyl/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Biotransformation', 'CHO Cells/drug effects', '*Carbamates', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Carcinoma/chemically induced', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fungicides, Industrial/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Herbicides/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/drug effects', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2002/09/11 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/09/11 10:00'],"['2002/09/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1383574202000261 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5742(02)00026-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2002 Sep;512(1):1-35. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5742(02)00026-1.,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Fungicides, Industrial)', '0 (Herbicides)', 'H75J14AA89 (carbendazim)', 'TLW21058F5 (Benomyl)']",174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra)-deficient mice develop autoimmunity and arthritis spontaneously. These observations suggest that excess IL-1 signaling the causes autoimmunity.

Furthermore, TEL/AML1 has been shown to interfere with AML1-mediated transactivation on the CR1 gene. To understand the mechanism of the TEL/AML1-mediated repression, we used transient-transfection assay and immunofluorescence to monitor subcellular localization of TEL/AML1.

MATERIAL/METHODS: Mice were engrafted intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 106 P388 leukemia cells on day 0 of each step of the two-step experiment. All treatments were initiated on the next day (day 1) as daily i.p. injections and lasted for five consecutive days. In the first part of the experiment, designed to establish the antileukemic effect of CsA, the mice received 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 mg/kg of CsA. In the second part, where the interaction between CsA and 2-CdA was examined, the animals were administered CsA at a dose of 15 mg/kg, or 2-CdA at a dose of 20 mg/kg, or CsA combined with 2-CdA at the same doses as in monotherapy. RESULTS: CsA did not influence the survival time of mice with P388 leukemia at any dose. CsA was used for the interaction study at a dosage of 15 mg/kg, as this was best tolerated by the animals. The mice treated with combination therapy using CsA and 2-CdA survived longer than those treated with 2-CdA monotherapy (p=0.00015). CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that CsA alone does not increase the survival time of mice with P388 leukemia, but it augments the antileukemic effect of 2CdA.","['Jozefowicz-Okonkwo, Grazyna', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon, Anna', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Jozefowicz-Okonkwo G', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon A', 'Robak T']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Physiology, Medical University of Lodz.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/10 10:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['2158 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2002 Sep;8(9):BR373-7.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Purines)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'W60KTZ3IZY (purine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the resorptive effects of these agents and their regulation of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL), RANK, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were studied in neonatal mouse calvaria. When tested separately, neither human (h) IL-6 nor the human soluble IL-6R (shIL-6R) stimulated bone resorption, but when hIL-6 and the shIL-6R were combined, significant stimulation of both mineral and matrix release from bone explants was noted. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that hIL-6 plus shIL-6R enhanced the expression of RANKL and OPG in calvarial bones, but decreased RANK expression. Human LIF, hOSM, and mouse OSM (mOSM) also stimulated 45Ca release and enhanced the mRNA expression of RANKL and OPG in mouse calvaria, but had no effect on the expression of RANK. In agreement with the RT-PCR analyses, ELISA measurements showed that both hIL-6 plus shIL-6R and mOSM increased RANKL and OPG proteins. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3) also increased the RANKL protein level, but decreased the protein level of OPG. OPG inhibited 45Ca release stimulated by RANKL, hIL-6 plus shIL-6R, hLIF, hOSM, mOSM, and D3. An Ab neutralizing mouse gp130 inhibited 45Ca release induced by hIL-6 plus shIL-6R.

Priming neonatal mice with a low dose of Cas-Br-E murine leukemia virus (Cas) results in adult-like, type 1 protective responses. However, other studies suggest that Ag priming of neonates leads to an increase in type 2 secondary responses even when primary responses were type 1. We assessed whether type 1 CD8+ T cell-mediated responses developed in murine neonates are maintained after secondary challenge with Cas in adulthood. Despite the induction of significant anti-viral CD8+-mediated cytotoxic T lymphocyte and IFN-gamma responses, initial neonatal priming led to a lower frequency of virus-specific T cells compared with adult priming. Adult frequencies were reached in mice primed as neonates only after secondary challenge in adulthood. A nonspecific and transient CD4+-mediated IL-4 response was present in all groups after secondary challenge with Cas or medium, indicating that this rise in type 2 cytokine production was not unique to mice that had been primed as neonates. Rather, type 1 anti-viral memory CD8+ T cell responses developed in neonatal mice are stable, protective, and enhanced after secondary challenge.","['Fadel, Shaza A', 'Ozaki, Daniel A', 'Sarzotti, Marcella']","['Fadel SA', 'Ozaki DA', 'Sarzotti M']","['Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Aging/immunology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/growth & development/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Immunization, Secondary/methods', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/prevention & control', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/virology', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology']",2002/09/10 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.6.3293 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Sep 15;169(6):3293-300. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.6.3293.,['0 (Viral Vaccines)'],,,['CA65338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant numbers of Ag-specific CD4+ T cells are detected both in lymphoid organs and in retrovirus-induced lesions early during infection, and they express the 1B11-reactive activation-induced isoform of CD43 that was recently shown to define effector CD8+ T cell populations. Comparison of the kinetics of the MoMSV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses reveals a pronounced shift toward CD8+ T cell immunity at the site of MoMSV infection during progression of the immune response. Consistent with an important early role of Ag-specific CD4+ T cell immunity during MoMSV infection, CD4+ T cells contribute to the generation of virus-specific CD8+ T cell immunity within the lymphoid organs and are required to promote an inflammatory environment within the virus-infected tissue.","['Schepers, Koen', 'Toebes, Mireille', 'Sotthewes, Gitte', 'Vyth-Dreese, Florry A', 'Dellemijn, Trees A M', 'Melief, Cornelis J M', 'Ossendorp, Ferry', 'Schumacher, Ton N M']","['Schepers K', 'Toebes M', 'Sotthewes G', 'Vyth-Dreese FA', 'Dellemijn TA', 'Melief CJ', 'Ossendorp F', 'Schumacher TN']","['Department of Immunology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution/immunology', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology/*metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/*immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/metabolism', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",2002/09/10 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.6.3191 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Sep 15;169(6):3191-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.6.3191.,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IRF-4 expression is tightly regulated in resting primary T cells and is transiently induced at the mRNA and protein levels after activation by Ag-mimetic stimuli such as TCR cross-linking or treatment with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore (PMA/ionomycin). However, IRF-4 is constitutively upregulated in human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) infected T cells as a direct gene target for the HTLV-I Tax oncoprotein. In this study we demonstrate that chronic IRF-4 expression in HTLV-I-infected T lymphocytes is associated with a leukemic phenotype, and we examine the mechanisms by which continuous production of IRF-4 is achieved in HTLV-I-transformed T cells. IRF-4 expression in HTLV-1-infected cells is driven through activation of the NF-kappaB and NF-AT pathways, resulting in the binding of p50, p65, and c-Rel to the kappaB1 element and p50, c-Rel, and NF-ATp to the CD28RE element within the -617 to -209 region of the IRF-4 promoter. Furthermore, mutation of either the kappaB1 or CD28RE sites blocks Tax-mediated transactivation of the human IRF-4 promoter in T cells.

Understanding the mechanisms by which class II Ag expression is regulated in L1210 lymphoma may facilitate the development of immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of some types of lymphoma and leukemia. This study demonstrates that the variation in MHC class II Ag expression among clones of L1210 lymphoma is due to differences in the expression of the class II transactivator (CIITA). Analysis of stable hybrids suggests that CIITA expression is repressed by a dominant mechanism in class II-negative L1210 clones. DNA-alkylating agents such as ethyl methanesulfonate and the chemotherapeutic drug melphalan activate CIITA and class II expression in class II negative L1210 cells, and this effect appears to be restricted to transformed cell lines derived from the early stages of B cell ontogeny. Transient transfection assays demonstrated that the CIITA type III promoter is active in class II(-) L1210 cells, despite the fact that the endogenous gene is not expressed, which suggests that these cells have all of the transacting factors necessary for CIITA transcription. An inverse correlation between methylation of the CIITA transcriptional regulatory region and CIITA expression was observed among L1210 clones. Furthermore, 5-azacytidine treatment activated CIITA expression in class II-negative L1210 cells. Collectively, our results suggest that 1) CIITA gene expression is repressed in class II(-) L1210 cells by methylation of the CIITA upstream regulatory region, and 2) treatment with DNA-alkylating agents overcomes methylation-based silencing of the CIITA gene in L1210 cells.","['Murphy, Shawn P', 'Holtz, Renae', 'Lewandowski, Nicole', 'Tomasi, Thomas B', 'Fuji, Hiroshi']","['Murphy SP', 'Holtz R', 'Lewandowski N', 'Tomasi TB', 'Fuji H']","['Department of Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. shawn.murphy@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/drug effects"", 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Ethyl Methanesulfonate/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects', 'Genes, MHC Class II/*drug effects', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/biosynthesis', 'Hybridomas', 'Leukemia L1210/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/10 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.6.3085 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Sep 15;169(6):3085-93. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.6.3085.,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (MHC class II transactivator protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9H154DI0UP (Ethyl Methanesulfonate)']",,,"['R01 HD37464/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD17013/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD017013/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD037464/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 26479/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further interactions have been suggested with additional proteins during Ag loading. We explored the much stronger processing/presentation of full-length recombinant human acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit to a specific T cell clone by APC from DRB1*0401+ than *0408+ donors. Using DR*04 transfectants, we show that this difference results largely from the single Lys71<-->Arg interchange (0401<-->0408), which scarcely affects epitope binding, rather than from any other associated polymorphism. Furthermore, we proved our recombinant polypeptides to contain the Escherichia coli 70-kDa heat shock protein molecule DnaK and its requirement for efficient processing and presentation of the epitope by DRB1*0401+ cells. According to a recent report, 70-kDa heat shock protein chaperones preferentially bind to the QKRAA, rather than the QRRAA, motif. Variations between the shared epitope motifs QKRAA and QRRAA are emphasized by underlining. We propose that such interactions enhance the intracellular epitope loading of *0401 molecules. They may thus broaden immune responses to pathogens and at least partially explain the distinct contributions of DRB1*0401 and other alleles to disease predisposition.","['Roth, Sabine', 'Willcox, Nicholas', 'Rzepka, Rita', 'Mayer, Matthias P', 'Melchers, Inga']","['Roth S', 'Willcox N', 'Rzepka R', 'Mayer MP', 'Melchers I']","['Clinical Research Unit for Rheumatology, Albert Ludwigs University, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Amino Acid Substitution/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/*genetics', 'Arginine/genetics', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*genetics/*immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology/metabolism', '*Escherichia coli Proteins', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics/metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Leukemia P388', 'Lysine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Protein Subunits', 'Receptors, Cholinergic/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/analysis/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/10 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.6.3015 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Sep 15;169(6):3015-20. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.6.3015.,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptors, Cholinergic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (dnaK protein, E coli)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PDI is present at the surface of HIV-1 target cells and reduces disulfide bonds in a model peptide attached to the cell membrane. Here we show that soluble PDI cleaves disulfide bonds in recombinant envelope glycoprotein gp120 and that gp120 bound to the surface receptor CD4 undergoes a disulfide reduction that is prevented by PDI inhibitors. Concentrations of inhibitors that prevent this reduction and inhibit the cleavage of surface-bound disulfide conjugate prevent infection at the level of HIV-1 entry. The entry of HIV-1 strains differing in their coreceptor specificities is similarly inhibited, and so is the reduction of gp120 bound to CD4 of coreceptor-negative cells. PDI inhibitors also prevent HIV envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion but have no effect on the entry of HIV-1 pseudo-typed with murine leukemia virus envelope. Importantly, PDI coprecipitates with both soluble and cellular CD4. We propose that a PDI.CD4 association at the cell surface enables PDI to reach CD4-bound virus and to reduce disulfide bonds present in the domain of gp120 that binds to CD4. Conformational changes resulting from the opening of gp120-disulfide loops may drive the processes of virus-cell and cell-cell fusion.

Classification or discrimination of more than two groups or classes (multi-class) is also needed. The need for multi-class discrimination methodologies is apparent in many microarray experiments where various cancer types are considered simultaneously. RESULTS: Thus, in this paper we present the extension to the classification methodology proposed earlier Nguyen and Rocke (2002b; Bioinformatics, 18, 39-50) to classify cancer samples from multiple classes. The methodologies proposed in this paper are applied to four gene expression data sets with multiple classes: (a) a hereditary breast cancer data set with (1) BRCA1-mutation, (2) BRCA2-mutation and (3) sporadic breast cancer samples, (b) an acute leukemia data set with (1) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), (2) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and (3) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) samples, (c) a lymphoma data set with (1) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), (2) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL) and (3) follicular lymphoma (FL) samples, and (d) the NCI60 data set with cell lines derived from cancers of various sites of origin. In addition, we evaluated the classification algorithms and examined the variability of the error rates using simulations based on randomization of the real data sets. We note that there are other methods for addressing multi-class prediction recently and our approach is along the line of Nguyen and Rocke (2002b; Bioinformatics, 18, 39-50).

Additionally, tissue sample availability poses further constraints on the number of arrays that can be analyzed in connection with a particular disease or state of interest. It is therefore important to provide a method for the determination of the minimum number of microarrays required to separate, with statistical reliability, distinct disease states or other physiological differences. RESULTS: Power analysis was applied to estimate the minimum sample size required for two-class and multi-class discrimination. The power analysis algorithm calculates the appropriate sample size for discrimination of phenotypic subtypes in a reduced dimensional space obtained by Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA). This approach was tested by applying the algorithm to existing data sets for estimation of the minimum sample size required for drawing certain conclusions on multi-class distinction with statistical reliability. It was confirmed that when the minimum number of samples estimated from power analysis is used, group means in the FDA discrimination space are statistically different.

Antigens which are either mutated or selectively or abundantly expressed in malignant, but not in normal, cells are considered as TAA. Each patient's B-cell malignancy is usually derived from a single expanded B-cell clone, which expresses an immunoglobulin (Ig) with a unique idiotype (Id, variable regions of Ig). Therefore, Id can be regarded as a TAA and a potential target in clinical vaccination approaches. Although use of tumor-derived Id as an immunogen to elicit antitumor immunity against B-cell malignancies is an attractive idea, the broader use of idiotypic vaccines has been hampered by the fact that autologous Id is not only a weakly immunogenic, self antigen, but is also patient-specific so that the vaccine must be individually prepared for each patient. In this review we will first summarize the latest data from the clinical tests of experimental idiotypic vaccines and discuss issues relevant to the clinical application of cancer vaccines in general; we will then critically review new trends and achievements in the development of the second generation vaccine formulations. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The authors of the present review are currently working in the field of B-cell tumor immunotherapy and have contributed original papers to peer-reviewed journals. The material analyzed in the present review includes articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. STATE OF ART: The results from a number of experimental models and clinical trials have demonstrated that vaccination with tumor-derived Id can induce immune responses directed against the tumor. Idiotypic vaccines can be divided into two types, although both are at the experimental stage: traditional and second generation, based on the methods of production and vaccine delivery. Second generation vaccines utilizing genetically engineered protein and DNA formulations have, for the first time, opened up the possibility of streamlining production of simpler and effective custom-made idiotypic vaccines. The use of various adjuvants and exogenous carriers is being replaced by more potent genetic carriers which target Id and various co-stimulatory molecules to professional antigen presenting cells (APC), particularly dendritic cells (DC). PERSPECTIVES: Id is the only widely accepted tumor marker and is a promising therapeutic target for immunotherapy of B-cell malignancies. It has been unequivocally established that Id vaccination of patients with follicular lymphoma administered when patients have minimal residual disease, has antitumor effect and potential to improve the clinical outcome. Consequently, the applicability of Id vaccines for other B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma needs to be tested. Idiotypic vaccines should be tailored to target preferentially various subsets of immune cells, such as DCs, which would up take and properly process and present Id, activating both arms of the immune system, humoral and cellular. Moreover, the vaccine should induce the production of a milieu of inflammatory cytokines and lymphokines at the delivery site to elicit a T helper type 1 (Th1) immune response. Components of the inflammatory response can be used to target DCs in vivo, activating the so-called danger signal for circumventing the poor immunogenicity of self-tumor antigens. For example, chemotactic factors of innate immunity are able to deliver Id to APC and render this otherwise non-immunogenic antigen immunogenic. The strategies developed for Id vaccines can be used as a general strategy for eliciting T-cell immunity to other weakly immunogenic, clinically relevant self-tumor antigens.","['Ruffini, Pier Adelchi', 'Neelapu, Sattva S', 'Kwak, Larry W', 'Biragyn, Arya']","['Ruffini PA', 'Neelapu SS', 'Kwak LW', 'Biragyn A']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Models, Immunological']",2002/09/10 10:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Sep;87(9):989-1001.,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)']",110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine patients were autografted in CR and showed a longer response duration than the 9 patients in CR who did not receive further therapy after FAND (53 vs 30% at 41 months; p = 0.05). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: FAND associated with extensive infection prophylaxis and G-CSF support is a highly cytoreductive and well-tolerated treatment for CLL patients and in most cases does not hamper subsequent stem cell mobilization.","['Mauro, Francesca R', 'Foa, Robin', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Giammartini, Elena', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Rapanotti, Maria Cristina', 'de Fabritiis, Paolo', 'Mandelli, Franco']","['Mauro FR', 'Foa R', 'Meloni G', 'Gentile M', 'Giammartini E', 'Giannarelli D', 'De Propris MS', 'Rapanotti MC', 'de Fabritiis P', 'Mandelli F']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University La Sapienza, via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy. mauro@bce.med.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Adult', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",2002/09/10 10:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Sep;87(9):926-33.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was the objective of this study to define the contribution of the different mechanisms of action of rituximab on primary normal and malignant B-cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: Primary human B-lymphocytes and effector cell fractions were isolated from peripheral blood of normal donors using an immunomagnetic separation technique. Blood samples from 20 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were studied and the B-lymphoblastoid Daudi cell line was used as a control. B-cells were cultured in the presence or absence of rituximab adding a secondary hyper-crosslinking antibody, serum as source of complement or different effector cell fractions. The cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In contrast to the B-lymphoblastoid Daudi cell line, the number of highly purified normal peripheral blood CD19+ cells was only minimally affected by rituximab in the presence of autologous serum. A significant reduction in the number of B-cells was observed when mononuclear cells from peripheral blood were added back. To identify the cell type which mediates this effect, CD3+ T-cells, CD56+ cells, and CD14+ monocytes were added to selected CD22+ B-cells. A marked B-cell decrease was only observed in the presence of CD56+ and CD14+ cells in an effector to target ratio of 10:1. The experiments with mononuclear cells from patients with CLL showed a B-cell reduction by rituximab, which was significantly enhanced following addition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data support the important role of cell-mediated mechanisms in the B-cell-depleting action of rituximab and suggest that pre-treatment with GM-CSF could improve the response to rituximab in patients with CLL.","['Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Pantel, Gitta', 'Rutella, Sergio', 'Weis, Mirjam', ""D'Alo, Francesco"", 'Urbano, Raffaella', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Hohaus, Stefan']","['Voso MT', 'Pantel G', 'Rutella S', 'Weis M', ""D'Alo F"", 'Urbano R', 'Leone G', 'Haas R', 'Hohaus S']","['German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. mtvoso@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/pathology', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Rituximab']",2002/09/10 10:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Sep;87(9):918-25.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given that expression of Hrk is sufficient to induce apoptosis, we studied the expression of this apoptotic protein and its regulatory mechanism in human leukemia cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells were treated with STI571, a Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor, and the Jurkat T-cell leukemia cell line was incubated with agonistic anti-Fas antibodies. Following treatment, we correlated the expression of Hrk protein with the DNA binding capacity of DREAM, and the induction of apoptosis. RESULTS: We show that treatment of K562 with STI571 blocks the binding of DREAM to the Hrk gene and allows the expression of Hrk, which correlates with the induction of apoptosis. Similarly, treatment of Jurkat cells with agonistic anti-Fas antibodies triggers the expression of Hrk through DREAM inactivation. Interestingly, inhibition of caspases, by culturing Jurkat cells in the presence of z-VAD-fmk, abrogates Fas-mediated hrk expression and apoptosis. Furthermore, in vitro analysis shows that active recombinant caspase-3 releases a fragment from the DREAM protein, suggesting that caspase-3 may be upstream of DREAM. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that apoptosis inducers as diverse as oncoprotein inhibitors and cell death receptor activators trigger Hrk expression via blockade of DREAM in leukemia cells, and this apoptotic pathway may be regulated, at least in some systems, by the proteolytic activity of caspase-3.","['Sanz, Cristina', 'Horita, Machiko', 'Fernandez-Luna, Jose Luis']","['Sanz C', 'Horita M', 'Fernandez-Luna JL']","['Unidad de Genetica Molecular, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', '*Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Kv Channel-Interacting Proteins', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2002/09/10 10:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Sep;87(9):903-7.,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (KCNIP3 protein, human)', '0 (Kv Channel-Interacting Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genes for RUNX1, also termed acute myeloid leukemia protein 1, AML1, and its dimerization partner core-binding factor beta, CBFbeta, are essential for hematopoietic development and are together the most common targets for gene rearrangements in acute human leukemias. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the uncomplexed RUNX1 Runt domain at 1.25A resolution and compare its conformation to previously published structures in complex with DNA, CBFbeta or both. We find that complex formation induces significant structural rearrangements in this immunoglobulin (Ig)-like DNA-binding domain. Most pronounced is the movement of loop L11, which changes from a closed conformation in the free Runt structure to an open conformation in the CBFbeta-bound and DNA-bound forms. This transition, which we refer to as the S-switch, and accompanying structural movements that affect other parts of the Runt domain are crucial for sustained DNA binding. The closed to open transition can be induced by CBFbeta alone; suggesting that one role of CBFbeta is to trigger the S-switch and to stabilize the Runt domain in a conformation enhanced for DNA binding.A feature of the Runt domain hitherto unobserved in any Ig-like DNA-binding domain is the presence of two specifically bound chloride ions. One chloride ion is coordinated by amino acid residues that make direct DNA contact. In a series of electrophoretic mobility-shift analyses, we demonstrate a chloride ion concentration-dependent stimulation of the DNA-binding activity of Runt in the physiological range. A comparable DNA-binding stimulation was observed for negatively charged amino acid residues. This suggests a regulatory mechanism of RUNX proteins through acidic amino acid residues provided by activation domains during cooperative interaction with other transcription factors.","['Backstrom, Stefan', 'Wolf-Watz, Magnus', 'Grundstrom, Christine', 'Hard, Torleif', 'Grundstrom, Thomas', 'Sauer, Uwe H']","['Backstrom S', 'Wolf-Watz M', 'Grundstrom C', 'Hard T', 'Grundstrom T', 'Sauer UH']","['Biocrystallography Group, Umea Centre for Molecular Pathogenesis (UCMP), Umea University, SE-901 87 Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chlorides/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Movement', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Static Electricity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/09/10 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0022283602007027 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-2836(02)00702-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2002 Sep 13;322(2):259-72. doi: 10.1016/s0022-2836(02)00702-7.,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,"['PDB/1E50', 'PDB/1EAN', 'PDB/1EAO', 'PDB/1EAQ', 'PDB/1H9D', 'PDB/1HJB', 'PDB/1HJC', 'PDB/1IO4']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3), a tumor analogue of mucosal mast cells (MMC), express at least four distinct Syt homologues, including Syt II, Syt III, Syt V and Syt IX. Synaptotagmin II is located at the late/endosomal/lysosomal compartment, where it negatively regulates lysosomal exocytosis. Mast cells may contribute to immune defense mechanisms by presenting MHC class II/antigen complexes and triggering T cell-dependent immune responses. We now demonstrate that RBL-2H3 mast cells, which express reduced levels of Syt II (<5%) by transfection with Syt II antisense cDNA, are able to release MHC class II molecules. We further show that release of both MHC class II molecules and of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D is stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 microg/ml, 48h). We show further that LPS reduces by >40% the level of Syt II expression in both RBL-2H3 and bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC). This effect is both dose and time-dependent. These results indicate that Syt II can be down-regulated by external inflammatory signals, resulting in the amplification of mast cell function. Finally, our results implicate Syt II as an important and novel regulator of MHC class II presentation.","['Baram, Dana', 'Peng, Ze', 'Medalia, Ora', 'Mekori, Yoseph A', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, Ronit']","['Baram D', 'Peng Z', 'Medalia O', 'Mekori YA', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, 69978, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,IM,,"['Animals', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Cathepsin D/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Exocytosis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Synaptotagmin II', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/10 10:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['S016158900200086X [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00086-x [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2002 Sep;38(16-18):1347-52. doi: 10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00086-x.,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Synaptotagmin II)', '0 (Syt2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Syt2 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.23.5 (Cathepsin D)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A great deal of research has focused on the earliest steps in this signaling cascade resulting in models which include the participation of lyn, syk, phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC) and intracellular calcium mobilization. In an effort to look at pathways downstream of calcium mobilization, ionomycin-mediated granule release was studied. The kinase inhibitors PP1 (src family), GF109203X (PKC), PD98059 (MEK1/2), and U0126 (MEK1/2) substantially inhibited ionomycin-mediated granule release, while the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 did not. Both p38 and erk were phosphorylated upon ionomycin treatment, but only extracellular regulated kinase (erk) activation was completely inhibited by PP1 treatment and partially inhibited by the MEK inhibitors, thus, correlating with the granule release data. Interestingly, while GF109203X alone had no affect on erk activation, combining it with U0126 completely blocked this response. This suggests the existence an alternate pathway for erk activation that is MEK independent and PKC dependent. Experiments in which ionomycin and PP1 were titrated (independently) demonstrated a correlation between erk phosphorylation and granule release, implicating erk in a PP1-inhibitable pathway operating downstream of calcium and controlling mast cell degranulation.","['Hanson, Dennis A', 'Ziegler, Steven F']","['Hanson DA', 'Ziegler SF']","['Virginia Mason Research Center, 1201 Ninth Avenue, Seattle, WA 98105, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,IM,,"['Animals', 'Basophils/drug effects/enzymology/*immunology', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', '*Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Ionomycin/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Ionophores/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2002/09/10 10:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0161589002000834 [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00083-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2002 Sep;38(16-18):1329-35. doi: 10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00083-4.,"['0 (4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(tert-butyl)pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (U 0126)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many surface receptors are constitutively or inducibly associated with lipid rafts, and it has been suggested that the rafts function as platforms regulating the induction of signaling pathways. The signaling capacity of lipid rafts has been extensively studied in rat basophilic leukemia cells. An aggregation of lipid raft components, such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoproteins (Thy-1 or TEC-21), triggers cell activation events which are similar to, but not identical with activation via the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI). Although FcepsilonRI in resting cells is not associated with lipid rafts, its aggregation induces a weak association with rafts and subsequent activation events. The properties of lipid rafts as well as the molecular mechanisms of their involvement in signal transduction are poorly understood. This review presents a critical analysis of recent results on structure-function relationship of lipid rafts and their regulatory role in signal transduction in mast cells.","['Draber, Petr', 'Draberova, Lubica']","['Draber P', 'Draberova L']","['Department of Mammalian Genes Expression, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, 142 20 4, Prague, Czech Republic. draberpe@biomed.cas.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cholesterol/physiology', 'Detergents/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry/drug effects/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Thy-1 Antigens/analysis', 'src-Family Kinases/analysis']",2002/09/10 10:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0161589002000718 [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00071-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2002 Sep;38(16-18):1247-52. doi: 10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00071-8.,"['0 (Detergents)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mast cells are known to be the main effector cells in eliciting IgE-mediated allergic response. These cells secrete various substances that perpetuate inflammation and provoke airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction. A newly recognized addition to the repertoire of FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling events is the activation of sphingosine kinase leading to the generation of the potent sphingolipid mediator, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) from sphingosine. S1P secretion by the lung significantly increases after challenge with an allergen, adding this sphingolipid metabolite to the variety of mediators that are released during an allergic reaction [FASEB J. 15 (2001) 1212]. Indeed, similar to previous reports, we found that FcepsilonRI cross-linking not only increased cellular levels of S1P, it also markedly enhanced its secretion from rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. Moreover, S1P induced degranulation of RBL and bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs) cells as determined by hexosaminidase release. Treatment of BMMCs with the sphingosine kinase inhibitors, DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine and dimethylsphingosine, reduced IgE/Ag stimulated histamine release. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that these mast cells express S1P receptors EDG-1 and EDG-5 but not EDG-3, EDG-6 or EDG-8 transcripts. Further studies are needed to determine whether IgE triggering results in transactivation of EDG-1 or EDG-5 present on mast cells and whether this is a critical event for mast cell activation.","['Jolly, Puneet S', 'Rosenfeldt, Hans M', 'Milstien, Sheldon', 'Spiegel, Sarah']","['Jolly PS', 'Rosenfeldt HM', 'Milstien S', 'Spiegel S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Georgetown University Medical Center, 3900 Reservoir Road NW, Washington, DC 20007, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,IM,,"['Airway Obstruction/immunology', 'Animals', 'Asthma/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Lung/cytology/physiopathology', '*Lysophospholipids', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Models, Immunological', 'Muscle, Smooth/physiopathology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingolipids/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/*physiology']",2002/09/10 10:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2002/09/10 10:00'],"['2002/09/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0161589002000706 [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00070-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2002 Sep;38(16-18):1239-45. doi: 10.1016/s0161-5890(02)00070-6.,"['0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",45,,['AIS0094/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the involvement of Ca(2+) in DADS-induced apoptotic cell death of HCT-15, human colon cancer cell line. DADS induced the elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) by biphasic pattern; rapid Ca(2+) peak at 3 min and following slow and sustained elevation till 3 h after the addition of DADS. Production of H(2)O(2) was also observed with its peak value at 4 h. Apoptotic pathways including the sequence of caspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and DNA fragmentation by DADS were completely blocked by various inhibitors such as specific caspase-3 inhibitor, free radical scavenger, and intracellular Ca(2+) chelator. N-acetylcystein and catalase treatment prevented the accumulation of H2O2 and later caspase-3 dependent apoptotic pathway. However, these radical scavengers did not block the elevation of intracellular Ca(2+). Treatment of cells with 1, 2-bis (2-aminophenoxyethane)-N, N, N-tetraacetic acid tetrakis -acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), cellular Ca(2+) chelator, resulted in a complete blockage of the caspase-3 dependent apoptotic pathway of HCT-15 cells. It abolished the elevation of intracellular Ca(2+), and furthermore, completely inhibited the production of H(2)O(2). These results indicate that cytosolic Ca(2+) elevation is an earlier signaling event in apoptosis of HCT-15 cells.

Recent quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies on phenols show that substituted phenols with electron-releasing groups can form potentially toxic phenoxyl-free radicals. In contrast, substituted phenols with electron-withdrawing groups do not form phenoxyl-free radicals but exert their toxicity primarily through lipophilicity. The chemical structures of 253 different substituted phenols reported in MS have been described in sufficient detail to allow identification of the individual compounds. From a laterally validated equation based on published data on the toxic effects of phenols on cultured cells, the relative toxicity, on a molar basis, of the 253 MS phenols has been determined. Based on this scheme, the most toxic phenols in MS include, in descending order of toxicity, 2-(dimethylamino)-phenol, 2-ethyl-6-methyl-1,4-benzenediol, 2-methoxy-1,4-benzenediol, and 4-ethyl-2-methoxy-6-methylphenol. The least toxic phenols include, in ascending order of toxicity, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 3-hydroxybenzenepropanoic acid. In the human exposure situation, the toxicity of MS phenols is a complex interaction, with contributions made by the following factors: toxicity per mole; MS concentration; synergistic, additive or antagonistic interactions with other MS components; host susceptibility; metabolism; and individual smoking behavior and inhalation patterns. In the absence of data to the contrary, reduction in the number and concentration of toxic MS smoke components may be considered to be advantageous.

CONCLUSION: Mcl-1,instead of Bcl-2 and Bcl-kappa(L), plays an important role in IL-6 deprivation induced apoptosis in XG-7 human myeloma cells.","['Song, Lun', 'Li, Yan', 'Sun, Yingxun', 'Shen, Beifen']","['Song L', 'Li Y', 'Sun Y', 'Shen B']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100850, China. lunsong@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/09/07 10:00,2003/01/29 04:00,['2002/09/07 10:00'],"['2002/09/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/07 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2002 Aug;115(8):1241-3.,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies suggest that the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein induces oxidative stress and apoptotic T-cell death. Activation of the T-cell receptor/CD3 pathway enhances the Tax-mediated oxidative and apoptotic effects. Tax-mediated apoptosis and oxidative stress as well as activation of nuclear factor-kappaB can be potently suppressed by antioxidants. This review focuses on Tax-dependent changes in the intracellular redox status and their role in Tax-mediated DNA damage and apoptosis.

Low concentrations of menadione (10-20 microM) and H(2)O(2) (10-50 microM) induced cell death accompanying low (menadione: <5%) or moderate (H(2)O(2): 10-15%) levels of DNA fragmentation in Jurkat cells. These concentrations of menadione (10 microM) and H(2)O(2) also caused membrane (necrotic) cell death at unproportionally high (80%) and proportional (10-30%) levels, respectively. Higher concentrations (100-5,000 microM) of H(2)O(2) exclusively induced membrane cell death. Unexpectedly, 30-300 microM menadione induced ever-decreasing levels of necrotic cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. An in vitro kinase assay showed that 20-50 microM, but not >100 microM, menadione induced activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), whereas a striking activation of JNK was induced by 500-5,000 microM H(2)O(2). Induction of cell death by a low concentration of menadione was partially inhibited in dominant negative JNK gene-transfected Jurkat/VPF cells. A high concentration (300 microM) of menadione was found to inhibit cell-death induction by high concentrations (200-5,000 microM) of H(2)O(2). The JNK inhibitory activity of menadione was also demonstrated in a cell-free system. However, menadione did not activate JNK in vitro. These results suggest that JNK is required for induction of not only apoptotic cell death, but also necrotic cell death in Jurkat T cells and that menadione biphasically controls this JNK-linked signal for inducing cell death.","['Ma, Xiuyang', 'Du, Jun', 'Nakashima, Izumi', 'Nagase, Fumihiko']","['Ma X', 'Du J', 'Nakashima I', 'Nagase F']","['Department of Medical Technology, Nagoya University School of Health Sciences, Nagoya 461-8673, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell-Free System', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidants/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Vitamin K 3/*pharmacology']",2002/09/07 10:00,2003/02/28 04:00,['2002/09/07 10:00'],"['2002/09/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/15230860260196173 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2002 Jun;4(3):371-8. doi: 10.1089/15230860260196173.,"['0 (Oxidants)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We simultaneously performed nested RT-PCR and iFISH for all samples. False-positive cells were detected in 2.48% +/- 0.93% (mean +/- SD) of PB samples and 2.75% +/- 0.83% of BM samples. The iFISH results for PB and BM ranged from 1.4% to 92.8% and 1.0% to 93.8%, respectively. Correlation analysis of iFISH results for PB versus BM samples showed a strong relation (r = .993). A significant correlation (P < .05) was also found between iFISH and first-round RT-PCR. The sensitivity of BCR-ABL iFISH was similar to that of first-round RT-PCR, and iFISH results for PB and BM were also well correlated.

This combined approach provides a pathognomonic clue to each of the different subtypes of Ph(1-)-MPDs and further enables recognition of the various steps in the evolution of the myeloproliferative process Increase and clustering of giant to large megakaryocytes with mature cytoplasm and multilobulated staghorn-like nuclei in a normal or only slightly increased cellular bone marrow represent major hallmarks of ET. Loose assemblies of small to giant pleiomorphic megakaryocytes containing deeply lobulated nuclei together with a proliferation of erythro- and granulopoiesis (panmyelosis) are the specific lesions of PV. The initial prefibrotic and the overt and more advanced myelofibrotic stages of IMF/AMM show a pronounced proliferation of an abnormal megakaryo- and granulopoiesis dominated by clustered atypical medium-sized to giant megakaryocytes with cloud-like, bulbous, and often hyperchromatic nuclei, which are not seen in allied subtypes of MPDs including chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph(1+)-CML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The presented clinical and pathological criteria modify the Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG) proposals for the Ph(1-)-MPDs by including bone marrow histopathology and are in keeping with features outlined in the new World Health Organization classification. The latter allows the differentiation of true ET from reactive thrombocytosis and from thrombocythemias as an eventually presenting finding in PV, IMF/AMM, MDS, and Ph(1+)-CML. Moreover, these diagnostic guidelines are able to separate latent and early PV from secondary erythrocytosis and to detect the prefibrotic and early stages of IMF/AMM. Myelofibrosis is not a feature of ET and is rarely observed in PV at time of diagnosis, but it becomes apparent during long-term follow-up and constitutes a prominent lesion during the course of IMF/ AMM. Life expectancy is almost normal in ET and is also not significantly altered during the first, but compromised during the second, decade of follow-up in PV. On the other hand, survival is substantially shortened in IMF/AMM, even for patients with thrombocythemia as a frequent finding of prefibrotic and early stage IMF/AMM.","['Michiels, Jan Jacques', 'Thiele, Juergen']","['Michiels JJ', 'Thiele J']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Antwerp, University of Antwerp, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/pathology']",2002/09/07 10:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2002/09/07 10:00'],"['2002/09/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982575 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2002 Aug;76(2):133-45. doi: 10.1007/BF02982575.,,101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative and semiquantitative WT1 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols have limitations in discriminating physiologic from pathologic overall WT1 expression levels in mononuclear cell preparations. Because of these limitations, reports conflict on the usefulness of long-term monitoring of WT1 expression in patients with acute leukemia. Real-time quantitative WT1 RT-PCR protocols, however, have been developed and tested in small series of patients with acute leukemia. Such protocols hold promise to enable evaluation of the individual treatment response (short-term monitoring) and early diagnosis of imminent relapse through the detection and long-term monitoring of minimal residual disease in patients with acute leukemia.

It was also found to be a potent inducer of differentiation in human leukemia derived HL-60 cells through the examination of differentiation markers, as assessed by the reduction of nitroblue-tetrazolium, the increase in esterase activities and phagocytic activity, morphology change and the expression of CD14 and CD66b surface antigens. These results, accompanied by a decline in the expression of c-myc protein, suggest that costunolide induces differentiation of human leukemia cells to granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages lineage.","['Choi, Jung-Hye', 'Seo, Bo-Rim', 'Seo, Seong-Hoon', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae', 'Park, Jae-Hoon', 'Park, Hee-Juhn', 'Choi, Jong-Won', 'Itoh, Yoshie', 'Miyamoto, Ken-ichi']","['Choi JH', 'Seo BR', 'Seo SH', 'Lee KT', 'Park JH', 'Park HJ', 'Choi JW', 'Itoh Y', 'Miyamoto K']","['College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,IM,,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology']",2002/09/07 10:00,2003/03/19 04:00,['2002/09/07 10:00'],"['2002/09/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02976606 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2002 Aug;25(4):480-4. doi: 10.1007/BF02976606.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CEACAM8 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '4IK578SA7Z (costunolide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its irritant properties, the compound exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects.

In the present work, we have found that capsaicin suppresses TPA-stimulated activation of NF-kappaB through inhibition of IkappaB alpha degradation and blockade of subsequent nuclear translocation of p65 in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Methylation of the phenolic hydroxyl group of capsaicin abolished its inhibitory effect on NF-kappaB DNA binding.

The cellular responsiveness to these cytokines is largely determined by the expression of the appropriate receptor proteins. The receptor expression profile for each cell type is established during differentiation and is often altered during oncogenic transformation. Since inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDAC) has the potential to re-activate epigenetically silenced genes, we asked whether inhibition of HDAC enhances the expression of IL-6 cytokine receptors and, thus, increase desirable cytokine responses. We demonstrate that treatment with FR901228 (FR), an HDAC inhibitor, increases the responsiveness to LIF in different cell types, including normal fibroblasts, epithelial cells, macrophages and splenocytes, as well as various tumor cell lines. Depending on the cell type, FR treatment also enhances the responsiveness to OSM and IL-6. These effects involve a transcriptional induction of the cytokine receptor subunits LIFRalpha, OSMRbeta, gp130, or the transcription factor STAT3. FR-specific induction of LIFRalpha occurs independently of de novo protein synthesis and cell proliferation and is mediated in part by the CBP/p300 coactivator. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the expression of LIFRalpha and gp130 genes correlates with the level of acetylated histone 3 associated with the receptor promoter regions. The FR-stimulated expression of IL-6-type cytokine receptors in certain tumor cells also provided improved conditions for suppression of cell growth by taking advantage of the growth inhibitory effect of these cytokines.","['Blanchard, Frederic', 'Kinzie, Erin', 'Wang, Yanping', 'Duplomb, Laurence', 'Godard, Anne', 'Held, William A', 'Asch, Bonnie B', 'Baumann, Heinz']","['Blanchard F', 'Kinzie E', 'Wang Y', 'Duplomb L', 'Godard A', 'Held WA', 'Asch BB', 'Baumann H']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, NY 14263, USA. fblan@nantes.inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Depsipeptides', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Peptides, Cyclic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/06 10:00,2002/09/20 10:01,['2002/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2002/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205777 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Sep 12;21(41):6264-77. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205777.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)']",,,"['CA 16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 85580/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 38866/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, DOX still protects a subset of tumor cell lines lacking wt p53 (HL60 and Jurkat leukemia cells), thus limiting the utility of protection of cells with wt p53 (e.g., normal cells). The present work overcomes this obstacle by adding an abrogator of p53-independent checkpoint (e.g., UCN-01) to the DOX-PTX sequence. By inhibiting a p53-independent pathway, UCN-01 overrode DOX-induced G2 arrest and instead induced G1 arrest in HL60 and Jurkat, thus propelling these p53-deficient cells from G2 to G1. Once they entered mitosis, cells were killed by PTX. Induction of G2 arrest with sequential abrogation of a p53-independent checkpoint allows pharmacological manipulation of Raf-1/Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation, PARP and Rb cleavage and cell death caused by PTX in p53-deficient cells. Unlike previous approaches, this strategy is intended to increase selectivity, not the cytotoxicity of PTX. This rational sequence of agents that induces p53-dependent and abrogates p53-independent arrest represents a cancer-selective strategy for treatment of p53-deficient tumors.","['Blagosklonny, Mikhail V']",['Blagosklonny MV'],"['Department of Medicine, New York Medical College, Brander Cancer Research Institute, Hawthorne, New York, NY 10532, USA.

Additionally, rFVIIa has been considered as a universal haemostatic agent, prompting its use in the management of severe uncontrolled surgical bleeding in patients without pre-existing coagulopathies. Recombinant FVIIa has been used in 5 patients (aged 2.5 to 73.0 years; median 48 years) with uncontrolled bleeding during or after open-heart surgery. Satisfactory haemostasis was achieved with a single dose or rFVIIa 30 microg/kg, that resulted in reduction of blood loss from a mean of 4,170 ml (650-8,000 ml) to 262.5 ml (220-334 ml). No significant adverse events were reported. Recombinant FVIIa was also successfully used in controlling post-surgical bleeding in two patients with Crohn's disease, one patient with bleeding duodenal ulcer and another with false thoracic aneurysm. It was also effective in controlling bleeding post-splenectomy in a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia, and following anterior exenteration in a patient with cervical carcinoma. A randomised study comparing the efficacy of a single perioperative dose of rFVIIa with placebo in patients undergoing transabdominal prostatectomy was conducted by Levi and colleagues [6]. An interim analysis showed a significant reduction in mean blood loss from 2,450 +/- 350 ml to 1,400 +/- 190 ml between placebo and rFVIIa groups respectively (p = 0.007). Among trauma patients, Kenet et al. reported success in treating uncontrolled bleeding from a gun-shot wound to the inferior vena cava, using two doses of rFVIIa 60 microg/kg [7]. This treatment has subsequently been used in 6 surgical patients with uncontrolled bleeding and in 7 cases of traumatic bleeding, with remarkable results. In conclusion, rFVIIa appears to be effective and safe in the management of uncontrolled surgical and traumatic haemorrhage in patients not known to have inherited coagulopathy.","['Aldouri, Maadh']",['Aldouri M'],"['Consultant Haematologist, Medway Maritime Hospital, Gillingham, UK. mdouri@doctors.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Pathophysiol Haemost Thromb,Pathophysiology of haemostasis and thrombosis,101142710,IM,,"['Aged', 'Blood Loss, Surgical/*prevention & control', 'Cardiac Surgical Procedures', 'Factor VII/*administration & dosage', 'Factor VIIa', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Perioperative Care', 'Recombinant Proteins/*administration & dosage', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative']",2002/09/06 10:00,2003/06/14 05:00,['2002/09/06 10:00'],"['2002/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/14 05:00 [medline]', '2002/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['57301 [pii]', '10.1159/000057301 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathophysiol Haemost Thromb. 2002;32 Suppl 1:41-6. doi: 10.1159/000057301.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9001-25-6 (Factor VII)', 'AC71R787OV (recombinant FVIIa)', 'EC 3.4.21.21 (Factor VIIa)']",10,"['Copyright 2002 S.

We previously showed that MAT1 (menage a trois 1), an assembly factor and targeting subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK), modulates CAK activities to regulate G(1) exit. Here we find that the retinoid-induced G(1) arrest and differentiation activation of cultured human leukemic cells are associated with a switch to CAK hypophosphorylation of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) from CAK hyperphosphorylation of RARalpha. The switch to CAK hypophosphorylation of RARalpha is accompanied by decreased MAT1 expression and MAT1 fragmentation that occurs in the differentiating cells through the all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated proteasome degradation pathway. Because HL60R cells that harbor a truncated ligand-dependent AF-2 domain of RARalpha do not demonstrate any changes in MAT1 levels or CAK phosphorylation of RARalpha following ATRA stimuli, these biochemical changes appear to be mediated directly through RARalpha. These studies indicate that significant changes in MAT1 levels and CAK activities on RARalpha phosphorylation accompany the ATRA-induced G(1) arrest and differentiation activation, which provide new insights to explore the inversely coordinated P/D transition at G(1) exit.","['Wang, Jiwei', 'Barsky, Lora W', 'Shum, Chung H', 'Jong, Ambrose', 'Weinberg, Kenneth I', 'Collins, Steven J', 'Triche, Timothy J', 'Wu, Lingtao']","['Wang J', 'Barsky LW', 'Shum CH', 'Jong A', 'Weinberg KI', 'Collins SJ', 'Triche TJ', 'Wu L']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Research Immunology/Bone Marrow Transplant, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles Research Institute, Los Angeles, California 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20020903,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Bone Neoplasms', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/drug effects/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/06 10:00,2003/02/07 04:00,['2002/09/06 10:00'],"['2002/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M206792200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71942-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Nov 8;277(45):43369-76. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M206792200.

The most common imbalances in CLL at diagnosis were gains in chromosome 12 (30%), and losses in chromosomes 13 (17%), 17p (17%), 8p (7%), 11q (7%), and 14q (7%). The analysis of sequential samples showed an increased number of chromosomal imbalances in 6 of 10 (60%) patients with clinical progression and in 2 patients with stable stage C disease. No karyotypic evolution was observed in four cases with stable stage A disease and in one RS clonally unrelated to the previous CLL. Gains of 2pter, and 7pter, and losses of 8p, 11q, and 17p were recurrent alterations associated with karyotype progression. RS showed a higher number of gains, losses, total alterations, and losses of 8p and chromosome 9 than CLL at diagnosis. 17p losses were associated with p53 gene mutations and with a significantly higher number of chromosomal imbalances than tumors with normal chromosome 17 profile. However, no relationship was observed between 9p deletions and p16(INK4a) gene alterations. Losses of 17p and an increased number of losses at diagnosis were significantly associated with a shorter survival.

This strategy has been used successfully in the development of STI571 (gleevec), an inhibitor of bcr-abl tyrosine kinase that has been used successfully in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. STI571 also shows activity against c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRbeta) tyrosine kinase signaling, thus potentially expanding the number of tumors that may respond to it. We describe a simple and rapid method to assess functional activity of tyrosine kinase signaling that is broadly applicable to tumor types. As proof of principle, we have applied it to cells that serve as models of the autosomal-dominant tumor syndrome tuberous sclerosis (TS). We found that TS model cells derived from tuberin heterozygous mice and from a human renal angiomyolipoma are highly sensitive to PDGFR antagonists and that these cells express PDGFRbeta. Given that PDGFRbeta signaling is inhibited by STI571, we found that SV7tert human angiomyolipoma cells are sensitive to STI571. Thus, we describe a novel but simple method of determining the functional tyrosine kinase profile of a neoplastic cell and our results suggest that STI571 might be useful in the treatment of neoplasms commonly seen in patients with TS.","['Arbiser, Jack L', 'Govindarajan, Baskaran', 'Bai, Xianhe', 'Onda, Hiroaki', 'Kazlauskas, Andrius', 'Lim, So Dug', 'Amin, Mahul B', 'Claesson-Welsh, Lena']","['Arbiser JL', 'Govindarajan B', 'Bai X', 'Onda H', 'Kazlauskas A', 'Lim SD', 'Amin MB', 'Claesson-Welsh L']","['Department of Dermatology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA. jarbise@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,,"['Benzamides', '*Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*analysis/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tuberous Sclerosis/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/09/06 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/09/06 10:00'],"['2002/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)64237-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9440(10)64237-x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2002 Sep;161(3):781-6. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9440(10)64237-x.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",,,"['P30 AR042687/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR047901/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30AR42687/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR47901/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1867243,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Necrotizing arteritis occurred in lethally irradiated nontransgenic rats reconstituted by env-pX spleen cells, thus indicating that the env-pX transgene in affected vessels may not be essential for the development of arteritis. In contrast, arteritis was not induced in nontransgenic recipients by adoptive transfers of env-pX bone marrow cells, which suggested that T cells derived from the env-pX thymus may play a role in the development of arteritis. To clarify if the process of differentiation of T cells in the env-pX thymus is crucial to develop necrotizing arteritis, reciprocal exchange of thymus frameworks was done between env-pX and nontransgenic rats. Necrotizing arteritis occurred in nontransgenic rats with an env-pX thymus framework, whereas development of arteritis was suppressed in env-pX rats in which the thymus framework was replaced with a nontransgenic one.

In this study, we show that DBP can induce apoptosis in MO7e and U937 leukemia cell lines. Treatment of these cells with DBP up-regulates cellular activity of caspase-3/CPP32 and causes apoptosis rapidly as determined by cell viability and dUTP nick end labeling assay. Activation of caspase-3/CPP32 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were determined in DBP-induced apoptosis of leukemia cells. However, DBP treatment did not induce the expression of fas. Two caspase inhibitors, z-VAD-fmk and N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde partly blocked the cell death of MO7e cells induced by DBP.

METHODS: Proliferation of HL-60 cells was determined by semi-solid colony culture and 3H-TdR incorporation. The typical NBT reduction was used to check cell differentiation. Intracellular cAMP and calcium concentration were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography(HPLC) and fluorescence method, respectively. RESULTS: When HL-60 cells were pretreated with 10(-8) mol.L-1 4-MH for 24 hrs, the cytotoxicity of Ara-C[10(-8)-10(-4)mol.L-1] for HL-60 leukemia cells was significantly decreased both in liquid and semisolid culture.

Therefore, the potency of Ara-C was reduced nearly 80 times according to IC50 doses. It is interesting that 10(-6)mol.L-1 ranitidine, an antagonist of H2 receptor, can elaborate the negative effect of 4-MH on cytotoxicity of Ara-C for HL-60 cells.

We therefore suggest that the patients with such leukocyte levels (that is, 5.0 x 10(9).L-1 on the 6th day, 10.0 x 10(9).L-1 on the 10th day, 15.0 x 10(9).L-1 on the 15th day) can be used as guidelines for starting chemotherapy(homoharringtonine); before ATRA treatment, while leukocyte counts are > 10 x 10(9).L-1, the patients only receive homoharringtonine; when leukocyte counts are < or = 5.0 x 10(9).L-1, the patients receive a combination of homoharringtonine and ATRA. Retinoic acid syndrome is a distinctive complication of ATRA therapy in the patients with APL. While the syndrome occurs, the treatment of ATRA must be stopped and corticosteroids must be used.","['Han, Z P', 'Lu, H B', 'Shen, Z S']","['Han ZP', 'Lu HB', 'Shen ZS']","['Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Hunan Medical University, Changsha 410011.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Hunan Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Hunan yi ke da xue xue bao = Hunan yike daxue xuebao = Bulletin of Hunan Medical University,9424769,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Harringtonines/administration & dosage', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Hypertension/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemoid Reaction/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects']",2002/09/06 10:00,2003/01/14 04:00,['2002/09/06 10:00'],"['2002/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hunan Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2000 Jun 28;25(3):283-4.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We suggest that the muscle damage might be related to the known ability of cytarabine to trigger the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, which could lead to uncoupling of the oxidative phosphorylation with subsequent depletion of ATP reserves at the skeletal muscle and rhabdomyolysis.","['Truica, Cristina I', 'Frankel, Stanley R']","['Truica CI', 'Frankel SR']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-7602, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Acute Kidney Injury/etiology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatitis/etiology', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/etiology', 'Rhabdomyolysis/*chemically induced/drug therapy/etiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10152 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2002 Aug;70(4):320-3. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10152.,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],14,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The etiology is diverse, and malignancy, especially hematopoietic in origin, is the most common underlying disease of BMN. In this retrospective analysis, cases with BMN were re-evaluated for etiology, histopathologic details, and clinical manifestations. In the last 8 years, 23 cases of BMN were detected among the 1,083 bone marrow (BM) biopsies, and the prevalence was found to be 2.2%. Three of these 23 cases with BMN were children, and 20 cases were in adults. Sixteen of these cases (80%) had underlying malignant disease, and four (20%) had nonmalignant disease. Among the malignant cases, three cases had acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), four had relapsed Hodgkin's disease (R-HD), one had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), two had chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), two had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), three had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated with metastatic solid tumor, and one had myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative syndrome (MDS/MPS). Among the nonmalignant cases, two had tuberculosis infection, one had anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS), and one had a history of drug ingestion. The most common symptoms were bone pain, fever, fatigue, and jaundice. The most common laboratory findings were variable and associated with underlying disease, but anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and high LDH and alkaline phosphatase levels were detected in the majority of the cases, as was also seen in other series. BMN was graded according to the extent of necrosis in the BM biopsy, and necrosis was extensive in 12 cases, moderate in five cases, and mild in three cases. Increased reticulin was found in 16 cases; four cases had severe, eight had moderate, and four had mild fibrosis, and this was found to be an interesting accompanying finding in BMN. In conclusion malignancy is the most common cause of BMN but some nonmalignant conditions such as tuberculosis and APS may be the underlying cause of BMN.","['Paydas, Semra', 'Ergin, Melek', 'Baslamisli, Fikri', 'Yavuz, Sinan', 'Zorludemir, Suzan', 'Sahin, Berksoy', 'Bolat, Filiz A']","['Paydas S', 'Ergin M', 'Baslamisli F', 'Yavuz S', 'Zorludemir S', 'Sahin B', 'Bolat FA']","['Department of Oncology, Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine, Balcal, Adana, Turkey. sepay@mail.cu.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/diagnosis/pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10114 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2002 Aug;70(4):300-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10114.,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most studies with As(2)O(3) involve patients with APML who have relapsed following standard therapy. Between January 1998 and July 2000, 14 patients were recruited for an ongoing trial of As(2)O(3) in the treatment of newly diagnosed APML. Arsenic trioxide was administered at a dose of 10 mg/day until complete remission (CR) was achieved. Afterward, a consolidation course and a maintenance schedule consisting of As(2)O(3) as a single agent were administered over 6 months. There were 3 early deaths related to intra-cerebral hemorrhage: two on day 3 and one on day 4. Of the 11 evaluable patients, one died on day 21 secondary to uncontrolled sepsis, while the remaining 10 (91%) have attained CR. The average time to CR was 52.3 days (range: 34-70 days). One patient developed an isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse and subsequently went into a second CR following therapy with triple intrathecal chemotherapy, cranial irradiation, and an additional 4-week course of systemic As(2)O(3). This patient, as well as the remaining nine, has continued to remain in CR at a median follow up of 15 months (range: 2-33 months). Eight out of 10 patients achieved molecular remission at variable periods during their consolidation and maintenance schedules. One patient developed an ATRA syndrome and was administered daunorubicin (40 mg/day) for 2 days. The side effects with this therapy were minimal and did not require cessation of therapy in any patient. There was no significant hepatic toxicity. In our experience, arsenic trioxide is effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with APML with minimal side effects.

The first source, V(P-W), is the voltage due to current in the grounding wire, which extends from the service panel neutral to the water service line. This voltage can cause contact current to flow upon simultaneous contact with a metallic part of the water system, such as the faucet, and the frame of an appliance, which is connected to the panel neutral through the equipment-grounding conductor. The second is V(W-E), the voltage between the water pipe and earth, attributable to ground currents in the water system and magnetic induction from nearby power lines. In homes with conductive water systems and drains, V(W-E) can produce a voltage between the faucet and drain, which may produce contact current into an individual contacting the faucet while immersed in a bathtub. V(P-W) was not strongly correlated to the magnetic field (both log transformed) (r = 0.28; P < 0.1). On the other hand, V(W-E) was correlated to the residential magnetic field (both log transformed) (r = 0.54; P < 0.001), with the highest voltages occurring in homes near high voltage transmission lines, most likely due to magnetic induction on the grounding system. This correlation, combined with both frequent exposure opportunity for bathing children and substantial dose to bone marrow resulting from contact, lead us to suggest that contact current due to V(W-E) could explain the association between high residential magnetic fields and childhood leukemia.","['Kavet, Robert', 'Zaffanella, Luciano E']","['Kavet R', 'Zaffanella LE']","['Environment Department, EPRI, Palo Alto, California 94303, USA. rkavet@epri.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,IM,,"['Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure', '*Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Magnetics/*adverse effects', 'Massachusetts', 'Risk Factors', 'Sanitary Engineering']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bem.10038 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 2002 Sep;23(6):464-74. doi: 10.1002/bem.10038.,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is commonly utilized for the diagnosis of pulmonary complications in the immunocompromised child. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively reviewed 53 BAL procedures performed in pediatric cancer patients with pulmonary disease between 1988 and 1998 to determine the diagnostic and clinical utility of BAL. Patients who had undergone prior myeloablative therapy were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: The majority of patients (83%) had an underlying diagnosis of acute leukemia or lymphoma. BAL yielded a specific diagnosis in 16 patients (30%), including 15 infections and 1 malignant infiltration. Medical management was altered in an additional 14 patients (26%) as a consequence of a negative BAL result. Severe but transient complications associated with the BAL procedure occurred in four patients (8%). Minor complications following the BAL occurred in 21 patients (40%) and included transiently increased oxygen requirement and anesthesia-related gastrointestinal complaints. The mortality from lung disease in this patient population was 7.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Both positive and negative BAL results contribute to the management of pediatric cancer patients with pulmonary disease. The low incidence of significant complications associated with BAL and the high mortality rate in this patient population support the choice of BAL as an initial diagnostic test in pediatric cancer patients with pulmonary disease.","['Park, Julie R', 'Fogarty, Shana', 'Brogan, Thomas V']","['Park JR', 'Fogarty S', 'Brogan TV']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, University of Washington Medical School, Seattle, Washington 98105, USA. ipark2@chmc.org""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,,"['Adolescent', '*Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lung Diseases/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/09/18 10:01,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10130 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2002 Sep;39(3):175-80. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10130.,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the causes of most cancers in teenagers are still unknown, health education and promotion and public health programs offer some scope for prevention among people of this age group. Reduction in sun exposure should lead to a reduction in incidence of melanoma, and elimination of hepatitis B in regions where it is endemic should result in a decrease in hepatic carcinoma. Five-year survival of patients diagnosed around 1990 exceeded 70% in the USA and UK. Entry to clinical trials appears to be much less frequent for adolescents with cancer than for children.

Analysis of gene expression changes at the RNA level using cDNA against an array of 6033 human genes showed that 5950 (98.6%) of the genes were expressed in the HL-60 cells. A total of 624 genes (10.5%) were found to be regulated during HL-60 cell differentiation. Most of these genes have not been previously associated with HL-60 cells and include genes encoded for secreted proteins as well as genes involved in cell adhesion, signaling transduction, and metabolism. Protein analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed a total of 682 distinct protein spots; 136 spots (19.9%) exhibited quantitative changes between HL-60 control and macrophages. These differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. We developed a bioinformatics program, the Bulk Gene Search System (BGSS, http://www.sinica.edu.tw:8900/perl/genequery.pl) to search for the functions of genes and proteins identified by cDNA microarrays and proteomics.

However, there has been no report about the antitumoral effect of monensin on acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Here, we investigated the antiproliferative effect of monensin on AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Monensin efficiently inhibited the proliferation of all of 10 AML cell lines, with IC(50) of about 0.5 microM. DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that monensin induced a G(1) and/or a G(2)-M phase arrest in these cell lines. To address the mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of monensin, we examined the effect of monensin on cell cycle-related proteins in HL-60 cells. The levels of CDK6, cyclin D1 and cyclin A were decreased. In addition, monensin not only increased the p27 level but also enhanced its binding with CDK2. Furthermore, the activities of CDK2- and CDK6-associated kinases reduced by monensin were associated with hypophosphorylation of Rb protein. Monensin also induced apoptosis in AML cells including HL-60 cells. The apoptotic process of HL-60 cells was associated with changes in Bax, caspase-3, caspase-8 and mitochondria transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(m)). In particular, monensin (i.p. at a dose of 8 mg/kg thrice weekly) significantly reduced the tumor size of BALB/c mice that were inoculated s.c. with its derived cell line, WEHI-3BD cells (69% growth inhibition relative to control group; p < 0.05). Tumors from monensin-treated mice exhibited increased apoptosis, and these tumor were immunohistochemically more stained with Bax, Fas and p53 antibodies than control tumors. In conclusion, this is the first report that monensin potently inhibits the proliferation of AML cells.","['Park, Woo H', 'Lee, Myung S', 'Park, Keunchil', 'Kim, Eun S', 'Kim, Byoung K', 'Lee, Young Y']","['Park WH', 'Lee MS', 'Park K', 'Kim ES', 'Kim BK', 'Lee YY']","['Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Ionophores/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Monensin/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.10592 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2002 Sep 20;101(3):235-42. doi: 10.1002/ijc.10592.,"['0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One option for patients with recurrent/refractory disease is to administer a reinduction regimen that employs a dose-intense combination of anthracycline and cytarabine. These salvage regimens are relatively distinct from the traditional vincristine/prednisone-based programs that are used typically as primary induction therapy. The authors studied a regimen that contained high-dose cytarabine and a single high dose of idarubicin as salvage induction therapy for patients with recurrent or refractory lymphoblastic disease. METHODS: Twenty-nine previously treated adult patients with recurrent or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia were treated with a new intensive regimen. Eight patients had primary refractory disease. Twenty-one patients had recurrent disease, and 16 of these patients developed recurrent disease while they were still receiving their primary therapy. The treatment regimen consisted of cytarabine 3.0 g/m(2) by 3-hour infusion daily for 5 days and idarubicin 40 mg/m(2) given as a single dose on Day 3. Filgrastim (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) 5 microg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours was started on Day 7 and was continued until the absolute neutrophil count was > 5000/microL. Response was assessed using standard criteria. RESULTS: There were 11 complete responses (38%; 95% confidence interval, 20-56%). Four patients subsequently underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Moderate but acceptable toxicity was observed given the severely myelosuppressive nature of the regimen. There was only one treatment-related death (3%). Two patients, both with significant prior exposure to anthracyclines, suffered reductions in left ventricular function to the 20-30% range during episodes of severe systemic infection. After recovery from infection, the ejection fraction in one patient improved to 50%. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that this regimen has moderate activity and a relatively low incidence of mortality for this high-risk group of patients. This regimen may be most suitable for patients who can undergo potentially curative allogeneic bone marrow transplantation if they achieve a complete response.","['Weiss, Mark A', 'Aliff, Timothy B', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Frankel, Stanley R', 'Kalaycio, Matt E', 'Maslak, Peter G', 'Jurcic, Joseph G', 'Scheinberg, David A', 'Roma, Todd E']","['Weiss MA', 'Aliff TB', 'Tallman MS', 'Frankel SR', 'Kalaycio ME', 'Maslak PG', 'Jurcic JG', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Roma TE']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cognition/drug effects', 'Conjunctivitis/chemically induced', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Heart/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Hematemesis/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10707 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 Aug 1;95(3):581-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10707.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],['5T32 CA 09207-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, IL-6 plasma levels increased in a stage-dependent manner, suggesting that IL-6 may be a useful prognostic marker. The purpose of this study is to fully assess the prognostic value of IL-6 in CLL patients. METHODS: We measured the plasma levels of IL-6 in 100 CLL patients using an enzyme-linked immunoassay method. RESULTS: Increasing levels of IL-6 significantly correlated with patient age, severity of anemia, Rai stage, white cell count, and beta-2-microglobulin (beta-2M). Although CLL patients did not differ significantly from the normal controls in the median IL-6 plasma level (P = 0.38), patients with advanced diseases (defined by Rai stage III/IV or beta-2M > 3.5) had a significantly higher median IL-6 plasma level than the normal controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, in patients with advanced diseases, Cox regression hazards model showed that a higher IL-6 level correlated with shorter survival (P = 0.0001). Using IL-6 level of 3 pg/mL as a cutoff, patients with low IL-6 levels had a significantly longer overall survival than those with high IL-6 levels (log rank test, P = 0.002). In patients with CD38-positive CLL, patients with high IL-6 levels (> 3 pg/mL) had significantly shorter survival (P = 0.03). To conclude, IL-6 is a particularly useful predictor for survival in CLL patients with advanced diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients with advanced-stage CLL as well as high IL-6 plasma levels may require aggressive therapeutic approaches and special consideration for experimental therapy.","['Lai, Raymond', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Maushouri, Taghi', 'Rogers, Anna', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Keating, Micheal', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Lai R', ""O'Brien S"", 'Maushouri T', 'Rogers A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating M', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

However, prior studies that have attempted to compare protocol therapy with standard therapy have been difficult to interpret because of the assortment of malignancies studied and the lack of suitable control groups of patients who received standard therapy. METHODS: In the current study, the authors conducted a retrospective review of the financial charges associated with protocol or nonprotocol (standard) chemotherapy in patients with a single malignancy, newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), who received their initial course of chemotherapy (""induction"") at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) between 1996 and 1999. Protocol and nonprotocol groups were analyzed according to clinical characteristics and standard prognostic features to determine whether the two groups were comparable. Median charges for all patients were determined using a database that linked clinical information, financial data, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 353 patients with newly diagnosed AML were registered at MSKCC during the time period studied; of these, 79 patients (22%) received all of their care at the institution. Thirty patients (38%) received treatment on an investigational protocol. Forty-nine patients (62%) did not receive protocol therapy for the following reasons: 10 patients (20%) did not meet eligibility criteria, 4 patients (8%) were eligible for protocol therapy but declined, and 35 patients (71%) met protocol criteria but were not offered protocol therapy based on the judgment of their primary oncologist. The groups were not comparable because patients treated with standard therapy were older and had a poorer initial Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. Overall median charges for patients in the nonprotocol group were higher than for patients treated on a protocol although charges were not related to age, initial ECOG performance status, or cytogenetic risk group. CONCLUSIONS: Although charges for the nonprotocol group were higher, specific factors responsible for this difference were not identified.

In part of a larger study to test the magnitude of these barriers to entering eligible older patients with carcinoma of the breast into clinical trials (Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] trial 9670), barriers to accruing eligible older patients to clinical trials were obtained from the physician's perspective. METHODS: One hundred fifty-six physicians (85% oncologists) who treated patients with breast carcinoma at 10 CALGB institutions completed a questionnaire concerning what they perceived as barriers to enrolling older patients with breast carcinoma on clinical trials and possible interventions that may improve accrual. RESULTS: Physicians' perceptions of the most important barriers to accrual of older patients were: 1) elderly patients have significant comorbid conditions that are not excluded by the protocol but that may affect how they would respond to treatment (16%); elderly patients have difficulty understanding what is required in a complicated treatment trial, resulting in poor compliance (16%); treatment toxicity (14%); and elderly patients often do not meet the eligibility criteria (15%). Oncologists most frequently suggested that the most effective interventions for improving the accrual of elderly patients to trials included making personnel available in the clinic to explain clinical trials to older patients and their families (25%) and providing physicians with educational materials concerning treatment toxicity in the elderly (18%). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians viewed barriers to accruing older patients with breast carcinoma to clinical trials as multidimensional, with the most important involving protocol requirements, treatment specific issues, and older patients' medical and cognitive characteristics. Thus, a variety of interventions would be needed to improve accrual of older patients to clinical trials, including increasing physicians' knowledge concerning treatment toxicity in the elderly, simplifying protocol requirements, and reducing treatment toxicity.","['Kornblith, Alice B', 'Kemeny, Margaret', 'Peterson, Bercedis L', 'Wheeler, Judith', 'Crawford, Jeffrey', 'Bartlett, Nancy', 'Fleming, Gini', 'Graziano, Stephen', 'Muss, Hyman', 'Cohen, Harvey Jay']","['Kornblith AB', 'Kemeny M', 'Peterson BL', 'Wheeler J', 'Crawford J', 'Bartlett N', 'Fleming G', 'Graziano S', 'Muss H', 'Cohen HJ']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. alice_kornblith@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Aging', 'Breast Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Comorbidity', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Compliance', '*Patient Selection', 'Perception', 'Risk Factors']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/09/18 10:01,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.10792 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2002 Sep 1;95(5):989-96. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10792.,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,,,

Fewer than 5% of patients with DFSP develop metastatic sarcoma, with a poor subsequent prognosis. Imatinib (STI-571) was developed as an inhibitor of the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase and has proven clinical activity against chronic myelogenous leukemia (expressing bcr-abl) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (expressing c-kit). We describe 2 patients with metastatic and unresectable metastases from DFSP treated with imatinib. After confirmation of negative CD117 status of 2 sarcomas arising from DFSP, patients were given imatinib 400 mg po qd and assessed at regular intervals for their tolerance and response to therapy. One patient had a transient response, then progressed rapidly and died of disease. Another patient showed a partial response to therapy after 2 months, with resolution of superior vena cava syndrome and shrinking of metastatic lung lesions. His response is ongoing after 6 months of therapy. These clinical data confirm findings from models of DFSP and support the use of imatinib in the rare setting of metastatic DFSP. Imatinib may be useful for patients with locally advanced DFSP, when other options for local therapy are limited.","['Maki, Robert G', 'Awan, Rashid A', 'Dixon, Richard H', 'Jhanwar, Suresh', 'Antonescu, Cristina R']","['Maki RG', 'Awan RA', 'Dixon RH', 'Jhanwar S', 'Antonescu CR']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021-6007, USA. makir@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Dermatofibrosarcoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Recurrence', 'Sarcoma/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.10535 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2002 Aug 20;100(6):623-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.10535.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['P01 CA 47179-10A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent clinical studies even suggest that antiangiogenic therapy can induce disease control in patients with AML relapse. In this context we have investigated the profile of the systemic component of angiogenic regulation in AML by characterizing the serum levels of (i) the angiogenic regulators angiogenin, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and endostatin; (ii) the endothelial cell marker soluble (s) E-selectin. Patients with untreated AML had increased levels of angiogenin, endostatin and sE-selectin, whereas the levels of bFGF were not significantly altered. The systemic levels of the proangiogenic bFGF, the antiangiogenic endostatin and the endothelial cell marker sE-selectin showed significant correlations, whereas angiogenin and sE-selectin levels were not correlated. Furthermore, intensive chemotherapy resulted in decreased systemic levels of the 2 proangiogenic mediators angiogenin and bFGF, whereas endostatin levels remained high after treatment. Although angiogenin normally is a part of the acute phase reaction, its systemic levels were not altered when patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia developed complicating bacterial infections.

We evaluated the hypothesis that TREC values would be lower in childhood T-cell hematopoietic malignancies than in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or healthy controls because the former category may reflect compromised thymic function. From the Greek national childhood leukemia/lymphoma database we obtained all 30 available T-cell leukemia/non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases, 30 age- and sex-matched childhood B-cell origin cases of ALL and 60 healthy hospital controls. We compared TREC levels in PBMCs using a real-time PCR assay. There was highly significant reduction of TREC values in children with T-cell malignancies (median 3,100 TRECs/10(6) PBMCs), whereas children with B-cell origin ALL had slightly but nonsignificantly lower TREC values compared to healthy children (medians 19,300 and 22,500 TRECs/10(6) PBMCs, respectively). During a median follow-up period of about 19 months, only 4 children died. All of them had a T-cell hematopoietic malignancy and relatively low TREC values. The number of TRECs was higher among healthy girls than among healthy boys, and a similar pattern was evident in T-cell malignancies. It appears that there is a pattern of concordance of high TREC values with better disease prognosis in hematologic childhood malignancies. This applies to specific disease entities with better prognosis (B-cell origin ALL having higher TREC values than T-cell leukemia/lymphoma) and to gender, another important predictor of prognosis conditional on disease entity (girls having higher TREC values than boys); however, it may also be true for the survival of individual patients. These preliminary findings can be used as hypothesis-generating indications that should be confirmed in larger data sets.","['Petridou, Eleni', 'Klimentopoulou, Alexandra E', 'Moustaki, Maria', 'Kostrikis, Leontios G', 'Hatzakis, Angelos', 'Trichopoulos, Dimitrios']","['Petridou E', 'Klimentopoulou AE', 'Moustaki M', 'Kostrikis LG', 'Hatzakis A', 'Trichopoulos D']","['Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Athens University Medical School, Greece. epetrid@med.uoa.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,,"['Age of Onset', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', '*Cell Movement', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*immunology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Thymus Gland/*pathology']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/09/24 06:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.10568 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2002 Sep 1;101(1):74-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.10568.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['R01 AI43868/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) via its interaction with a cell surface receptor is thought to initiate a cascade of events that lead to refolding of the Env glycoprotein into its stable fusion-active conformation. While the fusion-active conformation of the TM subunit has been described in detail for several retroviruses, little is known about the fusion-competent structure of the retroviral glycoproteins or the molecular events that mediate the transition between the two conformations. By characterizing Env chimeras between the ecotropic and amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) SUs as well as a set of point mutants, we show that alterations of the conformation of the SU glycoprotein strongly elevate Env fusogenicity by disrupting the stability of the Env complex. Compensatory mutations that restored both Env stability and fusion control were also identified, allowing definition of interactions within the Env complex that maintain the stability of the native Env complex. We show that, in the receptor-unbound form, structural interactions between the N terminus of the viral RBD (NTR domain), the proline-rich region (PRR), and the distal part of the C-terminal domain of the SU subunit maintain a conformation of the glycoprotein that is fusion inhibitory. Additionally, we identified mutations that disrupt this fusion-inhibitory conformation and allow fusion activation in the absence of viral receptors, provided that receptor-activated RBD fragments are added in trans during infection. Other mutations were identified that allow fusion activation in the absence of receptors for both the viral glycoprotein and the trans-acting RBD. Finally, we found mutations of the SU that bypass in cis the requirement for the NTR domain in fusion activation. All these different mutations call for a critical role of the PRR in mediating conformational changes of the Env glycoprotein during fusion activation. Our results suggest a model of MLV Env fusion activation in which unlocking of the fusion-inhibitory conformation is initiated by receptor binding of the viral RBD, which, upon disruption of the PRR, allows the NTR domain to promote further events in Env fusion activation. This involves a second type of interaction, in cis or in trans, between the receptor-activated RBD and a median segment of the freed C-terminal domain.","['Lavillette, Dimitri', 'Ruggieri, Alessia', 'Boson, Bertrand', 'Maurice, Marielle', 'Cosset, Francois-Loic']","['Lavillette D', 'Ruggieri A', 'Boson B', 'Maurice M', 'Cosset FL']","['Laboratoire de Vectorologie Retrovirale et Therapie Genique, INSERM U412, IFR 74, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*chemistry', 'Membrane Fusion/*physiology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/physiology']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/10/02 04:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/02 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.19.9673-9685.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Oct;76(19):9673-85. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.19.9673-9685.2002.,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,PMC136517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rate of retroviral intramolecular recombination is high. Previous studies showed that, after a single round of replication, 50 to 60% of retroviral recombinations occur between two identical sequences within a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vector. Recombination can occur at any polymerization step within the retroviral replication cycle. Although reverse transcriptase is assumed to contribute to the template switches, previous studies could not distinguish between changes introduced by host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) or by reverse transcriptase. A cell culture system has been established to detect the individual contribution of host RNA Pol II, host DNA polymerase or viral reverse transcriptase, as well as the recombination events taking place during minus-strand DNA synthesis and plus-strand DNA synthesis in a single round of viral intramolecular replication. Studies in this report demonstrate that intramolecular recombination between two identical sequences during transcription by host RNA Pol II is minimal and that most recombinations occur during minus-strand DNA synthesis catalyzed by viral reverse transcriptase.","['Li, Ting', 'Zhang, Jiayou']","['Li T', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536-0096, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Animals', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Dogs', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/physiology', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/10/02 04:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/02 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.19.9614-9623.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Oct;76(19):9614-23. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.19.9614-9623.2002.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",,,['CA70407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC136483,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here an interaction between CXCR4 and the Src-related kinase, Lyn, in normal progenitors. We demonstrate that CXCR4-dependent stimulation of Lyn is associated with the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). This chemokine signaling, which involves a Src-related kinase and PI3-kinase, appears to be a target for BCR/ABL, a fusion oncoprotein expressed only in leukemia cells. We show that the binding of phosphorylated BCR/ABL to Lyn results in the constitutive activation of Lyn and PI3-kinase, along with a total loss of responsiveness of these kinases to SDF-1 stimulation. Inhibition of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase with STI571 restores Lyn responsiveness to SDF-1 signaling. Thus, BCR/ABL perturbs Lyn function through a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism. Accordingly, the blockade of Lyn tyrosine kinase inhibits both BCR/ABL-dependent and CXCR4-dependent cell movements. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that Lyn-mediated pathological crosstalk exists between BCR/ABL and the CXCR4 pathway in leukemia cells, which disrupts chemokine signaling and chemotaxis, and increases the ability of immature cells to escape from the marrow. These results define a Src tyrosine kinases-dependent mechanism whereby BCR/ABL (and potentially other oncoproteins) dysregulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling and function of mammalian precursors.","['Ptasznik, Andrzej', 'Urbanowska, Elzbieta', 'Chinta, Suneetha', 'Costa, Melinda A', 'Katz, Benjamin A', 'Stanislaus, Marisha A', 'Demir, Gokhan', 'Linnekin, Diana', 'Pan, Zhixing K', 'Gewirtz, Alan M']","['Ptasznik A', 'Urbanowska E', 'Chinta S', 'Costa MA', 'Katz BA', 'Stanislaus MA', 'Demir G', 'Linnekin D', 'Pan ZK', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6100, USA. andrzejp2@cs.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptor Cross-Talk', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'src-Family Kinases/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/10/11 04:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.20020519 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 2002 Sep 2;196(5):667-78. doi: 10.1084/jem.20020519.,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,['1P01DK52558-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2193994,,,,,,['NASA'],['Non-programmatic'],,,,,,,,,

Using V(H)DJ(H) cDNA single strand conformation polymorphism analyses, we detected intraclonal mobility variants in 11 of 18 CLL cases. cDNA sequence analyses indicated that these variants represented unique point-mutations (1-35/patient). In nine cases, these mutations were unique to individual submembers of the CLL clone, although in two cases they occurred in a large percentage of the clonal submembers and genealogical trees could be identified. The diversification process responsible for these changes led to single nucleotide changes that favored transitions over transversions, but did not target A nucleotides and did not have the replacement/silent nucleotide change characteristics of antigen-selected B cells. Intraclonal diversification did not correlate with the original mutational load of an individual CLL case in that diversification was as frequent in CLL cells with little or no somatic mutations as in those with considerable mutations. Finally, CLL B cells that did not exhibit intraclonal diversification in vivo could be induced to mutate their V(H)DJ(H) genes in vitro after stimulation.

Therefore, 405 acute myeloid leukemia patients were investigated for somatic genotypes of the three most frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exons 12, 21, and 26. In all three loci, homozygous wild-type alleles were classified as genotype A, heterozygous as B, and homozygous mutant (alternative) allele as C. Patients with the C genotype in exons 12 and 26 showed a lower median age (both P < 0.05). Additionally, the C genotype in exons 12 and 26 was associated with cytogenetic poor risk aberrations (both P < 0.05). A possible regulatory impact of the SNPs on MDR1 mRNA expression was investigated by a Real time-PCR assay. MDR1 expression was strongly correlated with a decreased complete remission rate (P = 0.01) but failed to predict decreased overall survival (OS). There was a significant association of the A genotype in exons 21 (P = 0.05) and 26 (P < 0.05) with lower MDR1 expression, whereas the B variants showed highest MDR1 values at all three investigated gene loci. The A genotype in exon 26 was associated with lower OS (P < 0,01). In these patients, worse OS is likely attributable to an increased risk of relapse (P < 0.001). We were able to detect a linkage disequilibrium of the investigated SNPs, indicating combined polymorphisms that could affect the regulation of MDR1 expression. The A genotype of all SNPs demonstrated both lowest MDR1 values and significantly decreased OS (P < 0.05) with a high probability of relapses (P < 0.01). These observations indicate that allelic variants of the MDR1 gene may influence therapy outcome by additional mechanisms, different from P-gp expression on acute myeloid leukemia blasts, possibly involving pharmacokinetic effects of P-gp.","['Illmer, Thomas', 'Schuler, Ulrich S', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Schwarz, Ute I', 'Kim, Richard B', 'Gotthard, Sebastian', 'Freund, Daniel', 'Schakel, Ulrike', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Schaich, Markus']","['Illmer T', 'Schuler US', 'Thiede C', 'Schwarz UI', 'Kim RB', 'Gotthard S', 'Freund D', 'Schakel U', 'Ehninger G', 'Schaich M']","['Medical Clinic and Polyclinic I, University Hospital of the Technical University, 01307 Dresden, Germany. illmer@mk1.med.tu-dresden.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Exons', 'Genes, MDR/*genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Survival Rate']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/10/04 04:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Sep 1;62(17):4955-62.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: Routine histologic and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on the retinal biopsy specimen before referral to the National Eye Institute. Lymphoid cells associated with granulomatous inflammation infiltrating the retina and surrounding retinal blood vessels were microdissected from the paraffin sections of the retinal biopsy specimen. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using primers for the TCR gene and HTLV-1 pol and gag genes. RESULTS: Microscopic examination showed a necrotizing granulomatous retinal vasculitis with a predominant T-cell infiltrate detected by immunohistochemistry. Molecular analysis demonstrated a clonal rearrangement of the TCR and the presence of the HTLV-1 pol gene in the microdissected lymphoid cells diagnostic of ATL. CONCLUSIONS: Necrotizing retinitis and retinal vasculitis are rare manifestations of ATL.

Our analysis establishes that the global dynamics of T cells are completely determined by a basic reproduction number R(0). If R(0)< or =1, infected T cells always die out. If R(0)>1, HTLV-I infection becomes chronic, and a unique endemic equilibrium is globally stable in the interior of the feasible region.

It was suggested that the polymerization of Fas antigen, which was the essential process for the efficient induction of apoptosis, was interfered by the alteration of CRD1, and that this portion, named the ""histidine-rich region,"" played a critical role in Fas assembly.","['Maeda, Takahiro', 'Nakayama, Susumu', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Sugahara, Kazuyuki', 'Isomoto, Hajime', 'Tawara, Masayuki', 'Yamasaki, Reishi', 'Onimaru, Yasuyuki', 'Matsushita, Tetsuro', 'Ohzono, Yoshiyuki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Maeda T', 'Nakayama S', 'Yamada Y', 'Sugahara K', 'Isomoto H', 'Tawara M', 'Yamasaki R', 'Onimaru Y', 'Matsushita T', 'Ohzono Y', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of General Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, 852-8501, Nagasaki, Japan. tmaeda@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*chemistry/genetics']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X02020399 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02039-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Sep 6;296(5):1251-6. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02039-9.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

APL can be effectively treated with the cell differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). NB4 cells, an acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line, have the t(15;17) translocation and differentiate in response to ATRA, whereas HL-60 cells lack this chromosomal translocation, even after differentiation by ATRA. To identify changes in the gene expression patterns of promyelocytic leukemia cells during differentiation, we compared the gene expression profiles in NB4 and HL-60 cells with and without ATRA treatment using a cDNA microarray containing 10,000 human genes. NB4 and HL-60 cells were treated with ATRA (10(-6)M) and total RNA was extracted at various time points (3, 8, 12, 24, and 48h). Cell differentiation was evaluated for cell morphology changes and CD11b expression. PML/RARalpha degradation was studied by indirect immunofluoresence with polyclonal PML antibodies. Typical morphologic and immunophenotypic changes after ATRA treatment were observed both in NB4 and HL-60 cells. The cDNA microarray identified 119 genes that were up-regulated and 17 genes that were down-regulated in NB4 cells, while 35 genes were up-regulated and 36 genes were down-regulated in HL60 cells. Interestingly, we did not find any common gene expression profiles regulated by ATRA in NB4 and HL-60 cells, even though the granulocytic differentiation induced by ATRA was observed in both cell lines. These findings suggest that the molecular mechanisms and genes involved in ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells may be different and cell type specific. Further studies will be needed to define the important molecular pathways involved in granulocytic differentiation by ATRA in APL cells.","['Lee, Ki-Hwan', 'Chang, Mi-Yoon', 'Ahn, Joon-Ik', 'Yu, Dong-Hyun', 'Jung, Sung-Soo', 'Choi, Jung-Hye', 'Noh, Yun-Hee', 'Lee, Yong-Sung', 'Ahn, Myung-Ju']","['Lee KH', 'Chang MY', 'Ahn JI', 'Yu DH', 'Jung SS', 'Choi JH', 'Noh YH', 'Lee YS', 'Ahn MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/classification/genetics/physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/09/05 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/09/05 10:00'],"['2002/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X02020430 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02043-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Sep 6;296(5):1125-33. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02043-0.,"['0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, treatment is less well tolerated as there is an increased incidence of comorbidity in the elderly. The outlook for most patients is poor (4% survival at 5 years). However, it is possible to select a group of patients who are fit, with no pre-existing problems and good performance status who will respond well to intensive chemotherapy, and these patients should be treated aggressively.

The development of such unresponsiveness has been suggested as one of the mechanisms that regulate peripheral tolerance to self-antigens and hamper the capacity of tumor antigen-specific T cells to eliminate cancerous cells. In the attempt to enhance the effector function of CD4(+) T lymphocytes and their resistance to clonal anergy induction, we have transduced primary T cells with a retroviral vector encoding active p21(ras) (Ras(Leu61)). Here we show that Ras(Leu61) elicited TCR-independent activation of the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway and conferred primary T cells with the ability to secrete IL-2 in response to stimulation with a Ca(2+) ionophore alone, without altering antigen-, CD3/CD28- and PMA/ionomycin-driven IL-2 secretion and T cell proliferation in vitro. However, chronic engagement of the TCR onthe surface of Ras(Leu61) T cells still led to an inability of the cells to produce IL-2 upon restimulation. These results indicate that enforced p21(ras) functionality enhances primary T cells responses to calcium-generated signals, but is insufficient to prevent TCR-driven T cell unresponsiveness and suggest that additional biochemical mechanisms, independent of p21(ras), negatively regulate IL-2 production in unresponsive T cells.","['Crespi, Daniela', 'Massa, Stefania', 'Basso, Veronica', 'Colombetti, Sara', 'Mueller, Daniel L', 'Mondino, Anna']","['Crespi D', 'Massa S', 'Basso V', 'Colombetti S', 'Mueller DL', 'Mondino A']","['Cancer Immunotherapy and Gene Therapy Program, DIBIT/H.

Epidemiological studies have identified risk factors associated with antifungal drug resistance. Selection pressure due to the continuous exposure to azoles seems to have an essential role in developing resistance to fluconazole in Candida species. Haematological malignancies, especially acute leukaemia with severe and prolonged neutropenia, seem to be the main risk factors for acquiring deep-seated mycosis caused by resistant filamentous fungi, such us Fusarium species, Scedosporium prolificans, and Aspergillus terreus. The still unacceptably high mortality rate associated with some resistant mycosis indicates that alternatives to existing therapeutic options are needed. Potential measures to overcome antifungal resistance ranges from the development of new drugs with better antifungal activity to improving current therapeutic strategies with the present antifungal agents. Among the new antifungal drugs, inhibitors of beta glucan synthesis and second-generation azole and triazole derivatives have characteristics that render them potentially suitable agents against some resistant fungi. Other strategies including the use of high doses of lipid formulations of amphotericin B, combination therapy, and adjunctive immune therapy with cytokines are under investigation.

Among a series of control mechanisms exerted at the translational level, the use of alternative codons provides a very subtle means of increasing gene diversity by expressing several proteins from a single mRNA. The internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) act as specific translational enhancers that allow translation initiation to occur independently of the classic cap-dependent mechanism, in response to specific stimuli and under the control of different trans-acting factors. It is striking to observe that the two processes mostly concern genes coding for control proteins such as growth factors, protooncogenes, angiogenesis factors, and apoptosis regulators. Here, we focus on the translational regulation of four mRNAs, with both IRESs and alternative initiation codons, which are the messengers of retroviral murine leukemia virus, fibroblast growth factor 2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and protooncogene c-myc. Four of them are involved in cell transformation and/or angiogenesis, with important consequences for such translation regulations in these pathophysiological processes.","['Prats, Anne-Catherine', 'Prats, Herve']","['Prats AC', 'Prats H']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U397, Endocrinologie et Communication Cellulaire, CHU Rangueil Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol,Progress in nucleic acid research and molecular biology,0102753,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Codon, Initiator', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/chemistry/genetics', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Lymphokines/chemistry/genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'RNA Caps', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2002/09/11 10:00,2002/10/10 04:00,['2002/09/11 10:00'],"['2002/09/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0079-6603(02)72075-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol. 2002;72:367-413. doi: 10.1016/s0079-6603(02)72075-8.,"['0 (Codon, Initiator)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA Caps)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bank inventory consists of precious non-renewable patient material (such as frozen diagnostic blood or bone marrow), which can be linked to both clinical data and long term follow-up information. Case-control studies, where cases represent clinical failures and controls clinical successes, are ideal for rapidly learning if a laboratory marker might have prognostic significance. While group sequential (multi-stage) methods are widely used in clinical trials, they have rarely been applied in case-control studies. Further, unlike clinical trials where safety and efficiency may actually be in conflict, case-control studies can focus on efficiency. Hence, minimizing the expected sample size is a desirable goal in such a setting. Since the true effect size is never known, and since no prior distribution can be postulated for the effect size, we have opted for the minimax solution. A strategy is developed to determine amongst all two-stage designs with given type I and type II errors, the one for which the maximum expected sample size is minimized. The user is provided with simple tables, whereby one can determine everything necessary to conduct the study from the corresponding calculation for a single-stage design. A matched pair example is given where the suggested design can be modified, to obtain a superior 'two-plus' stage design. The basic idea is to conduct the first stage as planned, but use the estimate of variance to redesign the study, without using the estimate of effect size in the redesign.","['Shuster, Jonathan', 'Link, Michael', 'Camitta, Bruce', 'Pullen, Jeanette', 'Behm, Fredrick']","['Shuster J', 'Link M', 'Camitta B', 'Pullen J', 'Behm F']","[""Department of Statistics, University of Florida, and Research Data Center, Children's Oncology Group (COG), 104 North Main Street, Suite 600, Gainesville, FL 32601-3330, USA. jon@cog.ufl.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', '*Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted', '*Research Design', 'Sample Size', '*Tissue Banks']",2002/09/03 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/09/03 10:00'],"['2002/09/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.1198 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2002 Sep 15;21(17):2479-93. doi: 10.1002/sim.1198.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,"['Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A case-control study, nested in a cohort of all male seafarers (n = 30 940) who, according to the files of the Seamen's Pension Fund, had worked on board Finnish ships for any time during the period 1960-80. Cases of cancer of the lung, nervous system, kidney, and pancreas, leukaemia, lymphoma, and all cases histologically defined as mesotheliomas were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1967-92. The preceding numbers of years at sea in various occupational categories were collected according to the type of ship (dry cargo ship, tanker, passenger vessel, icebreaker, other vessel). RESULTS: The incidence for lung cancer among engine crew increased with the increase in employment time, the odds ratio (OR) after three years being 1.68 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.41). The OR of lung cancer for deck officers was 0.42 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.61). Deck personnel on icebreakers had a significantly increased risk of lung cancer > or =20 years after first employment (OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.23 to 9.49). The OR for mesothelioma among engine crew with a latency of 20 years was 9.75 (95% CI 1.88 to 50.6). The OR for renal cancer among deck officers after three years employment was 2.15 (95% CI 1.14 to 4.08), but there was no increase by employment time or by latency. A rise of OR for lymphoma was detected among deck personnel on tankers, if the employment had lasted over three years (OR 2.78, 95% CI 0.98 to 7.92). The risk pattern for leukaemia was similar to that of lymphoma, the OR among deck personnel on tankers varying from 2.26 (95% CI 1.01 to 5.06) to 6.86 (95% CI 1.62 to 28.8) depending on the length of employment. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that occupational exposures of deck crews on tankers add to their risk of renal cancer, leukaemia, and possibly lymphoma.

The mixed lineage leukemia protein (MLL) activation domain binds to an allosteric site on the KIX domain.,43168-74,"The interactions between cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and gene-specific transcription factors play an important role in activation of transcription from numerous genes. Cooperative interactions between CBP and multiple transcriptional activators may provide a mechanism for synergistic increases in transcriptional activation. Here we report the characterization of ternary complexes formed by the KIX domain of CBP and the transactivation domain of the trithorax group protein mixed lineage leukemia protein (MLL), together with either the phosphorylated kinase-inducible domain (pKID) of CREB or the activation domain from c-Myb. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments show that KIX in complex with the MLL activation domain binds the c-Myb activation domain and pKID domain with 2-fold higher affinity than does the KIX domain alone. Thus, the activation domains of Myb and MLL or of pKID and MLL bind cooperatively to KIX. The thermodynamics of these interactions imply different mechanisms of binding cooperativity for the two ternary complexes; the KIX.MLL.pKID complex is stabilized by entropy increases, whereas the enhancement of Myb binding in the presence of the MLL activation domain is due to more favorable enthalpy. NMR experiments show that the MLL-binding site on KIX is distinct from the surface that binds the pKID and c-Myb activation domains. Our data indicate that KIX can directly mediate cooperative interactions between pairs of transcriptional regulatory proteins. In the case of MLL and c-Myb, both proteins are involved in proliferation of hematopoietic cells and leukemogenesis, and synergistic interactions mediated by CBP may play a functional role.","['Goto, Natalie K', 'Zor, Tsaffrir', 'Martinez-Yamout, Maria', 'Dyson, H Jane', 'Wright, Peter E']","['Goto NK', 'Zor T', 'Martinez-Yamout M', 'Dyson HJ', 'Wright PE']","['Department of Molecular Biology and the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20020829,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Allosteric Site', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Zinc Fingers']",2002/09/03 10:00,2003/02/07 04:00,['2002/09/03 10:00'],"['2002/09/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M207660200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71919-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Nov 8;277(45):43168-74. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M207660200.

This increase may result from increased recruitment, increased proliferation, or reduced cell death. Apoptosis regulates inflammatory cell survival, and p21(CIP1/WAF1) is an important inhibitory regulator of cycle progression after oxidative stress. We have investigated whether chronic smoke exposure influences the expression and localization of cell cycle and apoptotic proteins in AM and bronchial epithelial cells in vivo. The increased numbers of AMs seen in smokers were only partially due to enhanced proliferation. p21(CIP1/WAF1) protein expression was increased in AMs and biopsies isolated from smokers and was found predominantly within the cytoplasm. In addition, B cell lymphoma leukemia (Bcl)-x(L), an antiapoptotic regulator, was also highly expressed in macrophages from smokers compared with nonsmokers and subjects with asthma. Hydrogen peroxide, an oxidative stress, induced cytoplasmic expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and failed to induce apoptosis in an in vitro model. These results suggested that AM and bronchial epithelial cells from smokers, in contrast to those from normal subjects and subjects with asthma, have reduced cell death. Thus, oxidative stress induced by cigarette smoking may contribute to the chronicity of inflammation in the airway, through a reduction of apoptosis.","['Tomita, Katsuyuki', 'Caramori, Gaetano', 'Lim, Sam', 'Ito, Kazuhiro', 'Hanazawa, Toyoyuki', 'Oates, Timothy', 'Chiselita, Irena', 'Jazrawi, Elen', 'Chung, K Fan', 'Barnes, Peter J', 'Adcock, Ian M']","['Tomita K', 'Caramori G', 'Lim S', 'Ito K', 'Hanazawa T', 'Oates T', 'Chiselita I', 'Jazrawi E', 'Chung KF', 'Barnes PJ', 'Adcock IM']","['Department of Thoracic Medicine, National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College School of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,9421642,IM,['Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2002 Sep 1;166(5):637-8.

The ORs for exposure to insecticides during the 3 months before pregnancy, pregnancy, and years 1, 2, and 3 were 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-3.1), 2.1 (95% CI, 1.3-3.5), 1.7 (95% CI, 1.0-2.9), 1.6 (95% CI, 1.0-2.7), and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.7-2.1), respectively. Insecticide exposures early in life appear to be more significant than later exposures, and the highest risk was observed for exposure during pregnancy. Additionally, more frequent exposure to insecticides was associated with a higher risk. In contrast to insecticides, the association between herbicides and leukemia was weak and nonsignificant. Pesticides were also grouped based on where they were applied. Exposure to indoor pesticides was associated with an increased risk, whereas no significant association was observed for exposure to outdoor pesticides. The findings suggest that exposure to household pesticides is associated with an elevated risk of childhood leukemia and further indicate the importance of the timing and location of exposure.","['Ma, Xiaomei', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Gunier, Robert B', 'Dahl, Gary', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Reinier, Kyndaron', 'Reynolds, Peggy']","['Ma X', 'Buffler PA', 'Gunier RB', 'Dahl G', 'Smith MT', 'Reinier K', 'Reynolds P']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California 24720, USA. xma@uclink4.berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'California', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Household Products', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pest Control', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', '*Registries', 'Risk Assessment']",2002/09/03 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/09/03 10:00'],"['2002/09/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['sc271_5_1835 [pii]', '10.1289/ehp.02110955 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2002 Sep;110(9):955-60. doi: 10.1289/ehp.02110955.,['0 (Pesticides)'],,,"['PS42 ES04705/PS/NCHHSTP CDC HHS/United States', 'R01 ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T01/CCT917644-01/CC/ODCDC CDC HHS/United States']",PMC1240997,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, GnRH increases the proliferative activity of lymphoid tissues and cells, which suggests that GnRH is also an important immunomodulator. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the colony-forming efficiencies of HHUA (derived from human endometrial carcinoma) and Jurkat (derived from human mature leukemia) cells are affected by the GnRH agonist Buserelin, and that the conditioned media of HHUA and Jurkat cells severely affect the Buserelin activity. The latter finding suggests that substances in the culture medium have some relation to the GnRH activity. Therefore, in the present study, to evaluate the effect of serum supplements on the colony-forming efficiency assay, the assay was performed using 3 lots of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 lots of Nu-Serum I, a semi-synthetic serum supplement. The results showed that the colony-forming efficiencies of HHUA and Jurkat cells fluctuated greatly depending on the lot of FBS. In contrast, Buserelin significantly affected the colony-forming efficiency to similar extents in the media containing both the lots of Nu-Serum I. These results strongly suggest that the constituents of the serum supplements also influence the effect of GnRH on cell proliferation. For further studies about the relationship between substances in the culture medium and the GnRH effects on cell proliferation, it will be necessary to use a completely defined medium, and that a semi-synthetic serum supplement such as Nu-Serum I will also be useful.","['Enomoto, Masahiro', 'Mori, Takao', 'Park, Min']","['Enomoto M', 'Mori T', 'Park M']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo, 113-0033 Tokyo, Japan. m-enmt@eurus.dti.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Buserelin/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/09/03 10:00,2002/10/22 04:00,['2002/09/03 10:00'],"['2002/09/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/22 04:00 [medline]', '2002/09/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0024320502020155 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(02)02015-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2002 Sep 20;71(18):2153-60. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(02)02015-5.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)', 'PXW8U3YXDV (Buserelin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations fell into two groups-those that alter amino acids that directly contact imatinib and those postulated to prevent BCR-ABL from achieving the inactive conformational state required for imatinib binding. Distinct mutations conferred varying degrees of imatinib resistance. Mutations detected in a subset of patients with stable chronic phase disease correlated with subsequent disease progression.

However, primary and acquired resistance occurs in many patients and is associated with reactivation of Bcr-Abl in primary leukemia cells. Studies reported over the past year have begun to elucidate the molecular basis of imatinib resistance, which may involve amplification of BCR-ABL or, more commonly, mutations that introduce amino acid substitutions into the Bcr-Abl kinase.

Our findings further suggest that fusion of MLL to one of the AF4 family members (AF4/LAF4/AF5Q31) might determine a proB-cell phenotype in infant leukemia.","['von Bergh, Anne R M', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Rombout, Paul', 'van Wering, Elisabeth R', 'van Weel, Margreet H', 'Beverstock, Geoffrey C', 'Kluin, Philip M', 'Slater, Rosalyn M', 'Schuuring, Ed']","['von Bergh AR', 'Beverloo HB', 'Rombout P', 'van Wering ER', 'van Weel MH', 'Beverstock GC', 'Kluin PM', 'Slater RM', 'Schuuring E']","['Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,['Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 May;37(1):106-9.

The aim of this study was to analyze in detail the genetic abnormalities in this subgroup of AML. Therefore, 125 AML cases with complex aberrant karyotype detected by G-banding were examined in addition with 24-color FISH and FISH with locus-specific probes for EGR1 (5q31), D7S522 (7q31), and TP53 (17p13), given that these regions are known to be commonly deleted in AML with a complex aberrant karyotype. The number of chromosome abnormalities per case varied from 3 to 30 (median 10). A gain of a whole chromosome was observed 131 times, with +8 (n = 30), +10 (n = 11), and +22 (n = 10) being the most frequent trisomies. A loss of a whole chromosome occurred 128 times. The chromosomes most often lost were 7 (n = 25), 18 (n = 24), and 17 (n = 17). Structural aberrations, leading to a gain or loss of chromosomal material, were detected 104 times and 433 times, respectively. Aberrations including only two chromosomes that seemed to be balanced were found only 19 times. Losses resulting from structural abnormalities most frequently involved 5q (n = 100), 17p (n = 47), and 12p (n = 29), whereas gains of 11q (n = 21), 21q (n = 19), and 8q (n = 11) were observed. Using locus-specific probes, deletions of the EGR1 locus (5q31), of 7q31, and the TP53 gene were observed in 103 (82%), 57 (46%), and 66 (53%) cases, respectively. In conclusion, in AML with a complex aberrant karyotype, loss of chromosomal material was observed much more often than gain. Unbalanced rearrangements leading to loss of chromosomal material are much more frequent than loss of whole chromosomes. These data suggest that in AML with a complex aberrant karyotype, loss of tumor-suppressor genes is a more important mechanism of leukemogenesis than activation of oncogenes, and that gene-dosage effects may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of this AML subtype.","['Schoch, Claudia', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Bursch, Sabina', 'Gerstner, Daniela', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Loffler, Helmut', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang']","['Schoch C', 'Haferlach T', 'Bursch S', 'Gerstner D', 'Schnittger S', 'Dugas M', 'Kern W', 'Loffler H', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*classification', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosome Painting/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ring Chromosomes']",2002/08/31 10:00,2002/12/04 04:00,['2002/08/31 10:00'],"['2002/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/04 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10088 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2002 Sep;35(1):20-9. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10088.,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, molecular genetic studies of CML BC have mainly focused on alterations of well-known tumor-suppressor genes (e.g., TP53, CDKN2A, and RB1) and oncogenes (e.g., RAS and MYC), whereas limited knowledge is available about the molecular genetic correlates of the unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities. Balanced secondary changes are rare in CML AP/BC, but it is not known whether cryptic chromosomal translocations, generating fusion genes, may be responsible for disease progression in a subgroup of CML. To address this issue, we used multicolor combined binary ratio fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which allows the simultaneous visualization of all 24 chromosomes in different colors, verified by locus-specific FISH in a series of 33 CML cases. Two cryptic balanced translocations, t(7;17)(q32-34;q23) and t(7;17)(p15;q23), were found in two of the five cases showing the t(9;22) as the only cytogenetic change. Using several BAC clones, the breakpoints at 17q23 in both cases were mapped within a 350-kb region. In the case with the 7p15 breakpoint, a BAC clone containing the HOXA gene cluster displayed a split signal, suggesting a possible creation of a fusion gene involving a member of the HOXA family. Furthermore, one case with a partially cryptic t(9;11)(p21-22;q23) and an MLL rearrangement as well as a previously unreported t(3;10)(p22;p12-13) were identified. Altogether, a refined karyotypic description was achieved in 12 (36%) of the 33 investigated cases, illustrating the value of using multicolor FISH for identifying pathogenetically important aberrations in CML AP/BC.","['Barbouti, Aikaterini', 'Johansson, Bertil', 'Hoglund, Mattias', 'Mauritzson, Nils', 'Strombeck, Bodil', 'Nilsson, Per-Gunnar', 'Tanke, Hans J', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Mitelman, Felix', 'Fioretos, Thoas']","['Barbouti A', 'Johansson B', 'Hoglund M', 'Mauritzson N', 'Strombeck B', 'Nilsson PG', 'Tanke HJ', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Mitelman F', 'Fioretos T']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.

The high densities of repetitive DNA, such as Alu elements, at some chromosomal translocation breakpoint regions has led to the suggestion that these sequences could provide hot spots for homologous recombination, and could mediate the translocation process and elevate the likelihood of other types of chromosomal rearrangements taking place. The Alu core sequence itself has been suggested to promote DNA strand exchange and genomic rearrangement, and it has striking sequence similarity to chi (which has been shown to stimulate recBCD-mediated recombination in Escherichia coli). Alu repeats have been shown to be involved in the generation of many constitutional gene mutations in meiotic cells, attributed to unequal homologous recombination and consequent deletions and/or duplication events. It has recently been demonstrated that similar deletion events can take place in neoplasia because several types of leukemia-associated chromosomal rearrangements frequently have submicroscopic deletions immediately adjacent to the translocation breakpoint regions. Significantly, these types of deletions appear to be more likely to take place when the regions subject to rearrangement contain a high density of Alu repeats. With the completion of the Human Genome Project, it will soon be possible to create more comprehensive maps of the distribution and densities of repetitive sequences, such as Alu, throughout the genome. Such maps will offer unique insights into the relative distribution of cancer translocation breakpoints and the localization of clusters of repetitive DNA.","['Kolomietz, Elena', 'Meyn, M Stephen', 'Pandita, Ajay', 'Squire, Jeremy A']","['Kolomietz E', 'Meyn MS', 'Pandita A', 'Squire JA']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Princess Margaret Hospital and Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,,"['Alu Elements/*physiology', 'Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Multigene Family/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Recurrence']",2002/08/31 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/08/31 10:00'],"['2002/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10111 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2002 Oct;35(2):97-112. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10111.,,171,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A survey was conducted in 1998 in Europe by The Research Partnership with the objective of determining the incidence of anemia, identifying the hemoglobin triggers that initiated anemia treatment, and the current anemia treatment options available to clinicians. PROCEDURE: The survey was conducted in the 10 largest pediatric oncology centers each in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, and in the 8 largest centers in both Belgium and The Netherlands. Telephone interviews with the most senior physician available in the institution were used to collect data, which included the numbers of patients treated or under follow-up, cancer types, and treatment practices for anemia. RESULTS: Data were collected for 25,093 patients. Over 80% of patients were anemic (WHO: hemoglobin <or= 11 g/dL; EORTC: hemoglobin <or= 12 g/dL) regardless of tumor type; 97% of patients with leukemia, the most prevalent type of cancer (34% of the total population), were anemic. Decreases in hemoglobin levels to between 5.5 and 8.0 g/dL were the most common factor that precipitated anemia treatment. Treatment was almost exclusively blood transfusion; less than 5% of patients received drug treatment (which consisted mostly of folic acid or iron). Very few patients received recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO, epoetin alfa) to treat anemia. CONCLUSIONS: In general, clinicians were not able to give advantages or disadvantages of epoetin alfa as a treatment option for treating anemia in children with cancer, which reflects the limited knowledge of and experience with this agent.","['Michon, Jean']",['Michon J'],"['Institut Curie, Pediatrie Oncologique, Paris, France. jean.michon@curie.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia/drug therapy/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epoetin Alfa', 'Erythropoietin/therapeutic use', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Hematinics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2002/08/31 10:00,2002/09/25 06:00,['2002/08/31 10:00'],"['2002/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10183 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2002 Oct;39(4):448-50. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10183.,"['0 (Hematinics)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '64FS3BFH5W (Epoetin Alfa)']",,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much new information about the nature of the neoplastic cells, including chromosomal and molecular changes as well as mechanisms participating in the survival of the leukemic clone have been published recently, in an attempt to elucidate the biology of the disease and identify prognostic subgroups. For the time being, clinical stage based on Rai and Binet staging systems remains the strongest predictor of prognosis and patients' survival, and therefore it affects treatment decisions. In the early stages treatment may be delayed until progression. When treatment is necessary according to well-established criteria, there are nowadays many different options. Chlorambucil has been the standard regimen for many years. During the last decade novel modalities have been tried with the emphasis on fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine and their combinations with other drugs. Such an approach offers greater probability of a durable complete remission but no effect on overall survival has been clearly proven so far. Other modalities, included in the therapeutic armamentarium, are monoclonal antibodies, stem cell transplantation (autologous or allogeneic) and new experimental drugs.

We describe here a Thr617Asn mutation in the transmembrane domain of the non-tyrosine kinase receptor for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the blast cells of two out of 555 AML patients examined. The mutant receptor conferred growth factor independence on factor-dependent Ba/F3 cells. In the absence of ligand, immunoblotting showed weak phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, ERKs 1 and 2 and the receptor itself, and there was approximately 70% of maximal growth in a proliferation assay. All signals were significantly enhanced in the presence of G-CSF. Retroviral transduction of mutant receptor into primary hematopoietic CD34+ cells induced G-CSF independent myeloid differentiation as assessed by the development of neutrophils and surface expression of CD11b and CD14. These results confirm the importance of the transmembrane domain for receptor function and suggest that introduction of an asparagine residue can cause sufficient stabilization of helix-helix interactions in the absence of ligand to activate downstream signaling pathways involved in directing proliferation and differentiation.","['Forbes, Louisa V', 'Gale, Rosemary E', 'Pizzey, Arnold', 'Pouwels, Karin', 'Nathwani, Amit', 'Linch, David C']","['Forbes LV', 'Gale RE', 'Pizzey A', 'Pouwels K', 'Nathwani A', 'Linch DC']","['Department of Haematology, University College London, London WC1E 6HX, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",2002/08/31 10:00,2002/09/24 06:00,['2002/08/31 10:00'],"['2002/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2002/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205767 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Sep 5;21(39):5981-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205767.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of the soluble TNF receptor, etanercept (p75 TNFR:Fc; Enbrel) in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies. METHODS: Patients were eligible if they had refractory HCL, CLL, AMM, or Philadelphia-negative MPD. Enbrel was administered twice weekly at a dose of 25 mg subcutaneously for a minimum of eight doses, and was continued in patients without overt progression. RESULTS: Among the 26 patients enrolled on study, 25 patients were evaluable. Nine patients had AMM, eight CLL, three HCL, and five Philadelphia-negative MPD. Their median age was 60 years (range 30-83 years). A total of 70 courses consisting of 486 doses of Enbrel were administered. Enbrel was well tolerated, without any overt increase in infectious episodes. Stable disease/no objective response was seen in 22 patients (88%) and progression in 3 patients (12%). Three patients with AMM improved (two showed hematologic improvement, and one showed a reduction in liver and spleen size), and two patients (one with CLL and one with Philadelphia-negative MPD) showed improvement in disease-related symptoms.

Recent evidence indicates that Cl-F-araA has more potent antitumor activity in vitro against human leukemia cell lines than against human solid tumor cell lines originating from different tissue. We analyzed the mechanism of action of Cl-F-araA using a human T-acute lymphocytic leukemia cell line, CCRF-CEM, in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Cl-F-araA exhibited marked antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, and this was correlated with its ability to induce apoptosis, particularly in vivo. To analyze the mechanisms of the apoptotic activity of Cl-F-araA, we sought to determine the effects of the drug on the levels of Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Mcl-1, Bax, Bak) and cell survival signals via Akt. Western blot analysis revealed that Cl-F-araA induced a dose- and time-dependent downregulation of Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 proteins, and a dose- and time-dependent dephosphorylation of Akt and its downstream effectors (Bad, FKHRL1), particularly in vivo. In addition, there was a marked increase in the population of cells in G(1)/S and early S phase. We therefore investigated the changes in the Cdc25A protein to characterize the mechanism involved in the G(1)/S accumulation. Cl-F-araA induced a dose- and time-dependent downregulation of the Cdc25A protein whereas the Cdc25C protein remained unchanged. We further found that in combination with caffeine, Cl-F-araA potentiated apoptosis induction. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings suggest that Cl-F-araA may be an effective drug in vivo.","['Takahashi, Takeshi', 'Shimizu, Makiko', 'Akinaga, Shiro']","['Takahashi T', 'Shimizu M', 'Akinaga S']","['Department of Oncology, Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co.

Because of these properties PNA has the potential to become a powerful therapeutic agent to be used in vivo. Until now, however, the use of PNA in vivo has not been much investigated. Here, we have attempted to reduce the expression of the bcr/abl oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia KYO-1 cells using a 13mer PNA sequence (asPNA) designed to hybridise to the b2a2 junction of bcr/abl mRNA. To enhance cellular uptake asPNA was covalently linked to the basic peptide VKRKKKP (NLS-asPNA). Moreover, to investigate the cellular uptake by confocal microscopy, both PNAs were linked by their N-terminus to fluorescein (FL). Studies of uptake, carried out at 4 and 37 degrees C on living KYO-1 cells stained with hexidium iodide, showed that both NLS-asPNA-FL and asPNA-FL were taken up by the cells, through a receptor-independent mechanism. The intracellular amount of NLS-asPNA-FL was about two to three times higher than that of asPNA-FL. Using a semi-quantitative RT- PCR technique we found that 10 micro M asPNA and NLS-asPNA reduced the level of b2a2 mRNA in KYO-1 cells to 20 +/- 5% and 60 +/- 10% of the control, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that asPNA promoted a significant inhibition of p210(BCR/ABL) protein: residual protein measured in cells exposed for 48 h to asPNA was approximately 35% of the control. Additionally, asPNA impaired cell growth to 50 +/- 5% of the control and inhibited completion of the cell cycle. In summary, these results demonstrate that a PNA 13mer is taken up by KYO-1 cells and is capable of producing a significant and specific down-regulation of the bcr/abl oncogene involved in leukaemogenesis.","['Rapozzi, Valentina', 'Burm, Brigitte E A', 'Cogoi, Susanna', 'van der Marel, Gijs A', 'van Boom, Jacques H', 'Quadrifoglio, Franco', 'Xodo, Luigi E']","['Rapozzi V', 'Burm BE', 'Cogoi S', 'van der Marel GA', 'van Boom JH', 'Quadrifoglio F', 'Xodo LE']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Technologies, School of Medicine, University of Udine, Piazzale Kolbe 4, 33100 Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Antisense/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein/chemistry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/genetics', 'Peptide Nucleic Acids/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",2002/08/31 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/31 10:00'],"['2002/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/gkf451 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Sep 1;30(17):3712-21. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkf451.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Peptide Nucleic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'TPY09G7XIR (Fluorescein)']",,,,PMC137404,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied a dose-dense combination of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, with or without fluorouracil, as adjuvant therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with resected breast cancer were treated if they were node-positive and estrogen receptor-negative, positive for overexpression of Her-2-neu, or had four or more involved nodes. Doxorubicin was given weekly to a total dose of 480 mg/m(2). Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/m(2) was given daily by mouth during the period of doxorubicin treatment. The first 30 patients received fluorouracil at 300 mg/m(2)/wk intravenously concurrently with doxorubicin administration. In the last 22, it was omitted because of symptomatic hand-foot syndrome in the majority of patients. Filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) was administered during chemotherapy every day except the day of intravenous administration and continued until 1 week after the completion of the chemotherapy. RESULTS: Between October 20, 1992, and June 10, 1997, we enrolled 52 patients. The mean delivered dose-intensity for doxorubicin was 18.6 mg/m(2)/wk. Hospitalization was required in 6% of patients for reversible febrile neutropenia. There were no acute treatment-related deaths, but one patient subsequently died of acute leukemia with a characteristic translocation for anthracycline-related exposure. At 5 years, the event-free survival was 86% for all patients (95% confidence interval, 75% to 95%). CONCLUSION: Continuous dose-dense chemotherapy with G-CSF support produced encouraging results, which seem to be superior to those expected with ""standard"" doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. It deserves a test in the form of a randomized trial where this approach to anthracycline-based treatment is compared with intermittent administration.","['Ellis, Georgiana K', 'Livingston, Robert B', 'Gralow, Julie R', 'Green, Stephanie J', 'Thompson, Tove']","['Ellis GK', 'Livingston RB', 'Gralow JR', 'Green SJ', 'Thompson T']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Washington, and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research, Seattle, WA. gellis@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",2002/08/31 10:00,2002/09/19 10:01,['2002/08/31 10:00'],"['2002/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.12.113 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Sep 1;20(17):3637-43. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.12.113.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have examined whether CREB-2 acetylation affects transcriptional activation mediated by Tax. We present evidence that CREB-2 is acetylated in vitro and in vivo. CREB-2 is acetylated in two regions: the basic domain of the bZIP (from amino acid residue 270 to 300) and the short basic domain (from 342 to 351) located downstream from the bZIP. We also demonstrate that CREB-2 is acetylated by p300/CBP but not by p/CAF. Moreover, replacement of lysine by arginine in the basic domains decreases the trans-activating capacity of CREB-2. However, in the presence of Tax, the HTLV-I transcription remains fully activated by these CREB-2 mutants. Although we cannot totally exclude that the mutations could also affect CREB-2 structure and activity independent of acetylation, our results suggest that activation of the viral promoter in the presence of Tax is independent of the CREB-2 acetylation.","['Gachon, F', 'Devaux, C', 'Mesnard, J-M']","['Gachon F', 'Devaux C', 'Mesnard JM']","['Laboratoire Infections Retrovirales et Signalisation Cellulaire, CNRS EP 2104/Universite Montpellier I, Institut de Biologie, 4 Bd Henri IV, 34060 Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,,"['Acetylation', 'Activating Transcription Factor 4', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2002/08/31 10:00,2002/09/20 10:01,['2002/08/31 10:00'],"['2002/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202915011 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.2002.1501 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Aug 1;299(2):271-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.2002.1501.,"['0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the possibility that ES cells can give rise to lung tissue has not been tested. We hypothesized that lung epithelial cells (type II pneumocytes) can be derived in vitro from murine ES cells. After withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and formation of embryoid bodies in maintenance medium for 10, 20, and 30 days, differentiating ES cells were kept in the same medium or transferred to serum-free small airway growth medium (SAGM) for a further 3 or 14 days of culture. The presence of type II pneumocytes in the resulting mixed cultures was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of surfactant protein C (SPC) mRNA, immunostaining of SPC, and electron microscopy of osmiophilic lamellar bodies only at 30 days sampling time. SAGM appeared to be more favorable for type II cell formation than ES medium. No SPC transcripts were found in differentiating cells grown under the same conditions without formation of embryoid bodies. These findings could form the basis for the enrichment of ES cell-derived cultures with type II pneumocytes, and provide an in vitro system for investigating mechanisms of lung repair and regeneration.","['Ali, Nadire N', 'Edgar, Alasdair J', 'Samadikuchaksaraei, Ali', 'Timson, Catherine M', 'Romanska, Hanna M', 'Polak, Julia M', 'Bishop, Anne E']","['Ali NN', 'Edgar AJ', 'Samadikuchaksaraei A', 'Timson CM', 'Romanska HM', 'Polak JM', 'Bishop AE']","['Tissue Engineering Centre, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, Chelsea & Westminster Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Tissue Eng,Tissue engineering,9505538,IM,,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Epithelial Cells/*cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/*cytology', 'Pulmonary Surfactants/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure']",2002/08/31 10:00,2003/01/25 04:00,['2002/08/31 10:00'],"['2002/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/25 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/107632702760240463 [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Eng. 2002 Aug;8(4):541-50. doi: 10.1089/107632702760240463.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Pulmonary Surfactants)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of pretransplant antithymocyte globulin (ATG), although reducing the risk of graft rejection and GVHD, bears the risk of overimmunosuppression, resulting in an increased relapse rate and transplant-related mortality. Therefore, we evaluated in 21 consecutive patients receiving unrelated stem cell grafts from either HLA-matched (38%) or -mismatched (62%) donors whether low-dose rabbit ATG added to cyclosporin A and methotrexate at a total dose of 3.5 mg/kg for HLA-identical and 5.0 mg/kg for HLA-mismatched transplants given in two divided doses on days -2 and -1 provides sufficient immunosuppression for prevention of GVHD and graft rejection but is associated with an acceptable risk of relapse and transplant-related mortality. Stable leukocyte engraftment was achieved in all patients (100%). Overall survival after a median follow-up of 26 (median, range 14-42) months was 56 +/- 26% (95% confidence interval, CI) and the overall relapse rate at 3 years was 24 +/- 21%. Three-year survival for standard-risk patients, i.e., chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in first chronic phase or acute leukemia in first complete remission, was 87% +/- 13% versus 40% +/- 31% for patients with more advanced disease. The incidence of acute GVHD II-IV degrees was 55 +/- 22%; that of severe acute GVHD III-IV degrees was 21 +/- 19%. Chronic GVHD was observed in 5/17 (29%) patients surviving more than 100 days post stem cell transplantation. Transplant-related mortality was 16 +/- 15% (95% CI) at day + 100 and 25 +/- 19% (95% CI) at 1 year after the transplant. The data presented show that pretransplant in vivo T cell depletion with low-dose rabbit ATG results in a low transplant-related mortality due to a low incidence of severe acute and chronic GVHD and a low relapse rate. To find out the optimal rabbit ATG dose in the unrelated stem cell transplantation setting, further dose-finding studies comparing high- and low-dose regimens are necessary.","['Nachbaur, David', 'Eibl, Brigitte', 'Kropshofer, Gaby', 'Meister, Bernhard', 'Mitterschiffthaler, Andrea', 'Schennach, Harald', 'Fischer, Gottfried', 'Kopp, Martin', 'Gunsilius, Eberhard', 'Gastl, Gunther']","['Nachbaur D', 'Eibl B', 'Kropshofer G', 'Meister B', 'Mitterschiffthaler A', 'Schennach H', 'Fischer G', 'Kopp M', 'Gunsilius E', 'Gastl G']","['BMT Unit and Tumor- and Immunobiology Laboratory, Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Innsbruck University Hospital, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria. david.nachbaur@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rabbits', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/*mortality', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology/mortality']",2002/08/31 10:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/08/31 10:00'],"['2002/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/15258160260194884 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2002 Aug;11(4):731-7. doi: 10.1089/15258160260194884.,['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several attempts to show expression of recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) by primary hematopoietic cells and cell lines have failed; this failure was attributed to the inability of HSC to secrete rFVIII. Here we describe the generation of stable, FVIII-secreting hematopoietic cell lines representing different blood-cell types using a bicistronic lentiviral vector encoding for a B-domain-deleted FVIII (FVIII Delta B) and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). Transduced cell lines with erythroid and/or megakaryocytic background, (K562-F8 and TF-1-F8) secrete high levels of FVIII in the order of 76.4 and 41.6 ng FVIII:C/ml, whereas moderate and low levels are observed in B lymphoblastoid Raji-F8 cells and the T leukemia line Jurkat-F8 which secrete 6.73 and 1.83 ng FVIII:C/ml, respectively. The capacity to secrete rFVIII appeared to depend on factors related to the cell lineage rather than on the transduction efficacy. Stimulation of transduced cells with the protein kinase C (PKC)-activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) resulted in a marked augmentation of rFVIII secretion and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Incubation with 0.1 and 1 ng/ml PMA resulted in up to 2.7-fold (K562-F8, Raji-F8) and 1.8-fold (293T-F8) increased rFVIII secretion. The established cell lines should be helpful in further elucidating mechanisms that are able to improve FVIII secretion in hematopoietic cells on a post-translational level and suggest reanalysis of hematopoietic cells as target for gene therapy of hemophilia.","['Tonn, T', 'Herder, C', 'Becker, S', 'Seifried, E', 'Grez, M']","['Tonn T', 'Herder C', 'Becker S', 'Seifried E', 'Grez M']","['Institute for Biomedical Research, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. ttonn@bsdhessen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Factor VIII/analysis/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/classification', 'Lymphoma/blood/classification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/08/31 10:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/08/31 10:00'],"['2002/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/15258160260194848 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2002 Aug;11(4):695-704. doi: 10.1089/15258160260194848.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HIV can frequently infect placental trophoblast but the impact of cytokines produced locally by the placenta and decidua on virus expression and replication is unknown. We comprehensively assayed the cytokines typically present in the placental microenvironment for their potential to modulate HIV transcriptional activation in the isolated trophoblast cells employing a transient transfection assay with luciferase as a reporter gene. Long terminal repeats (LTRs) of two divergent virus strains, HIV-1 LAI and HIV-1 NDK, were used to analyze virus-specific features. Four cytokines, epidermal growth factor (EGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), were found to stimulate promoters of both viruses, whereas interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-beta were found to suppress the transcription driven from both promoters. The differences observed between the two viruses did not reach a statistically significant level. None of the remaining cytokines, including EGF; GM-CSF; insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I); IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma; IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10; leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF); macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF); platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB); transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta); and TNF-alpha, affected transcriptional expression of the promoter constructs.

Our recent studies have revealed that the methanolic extract of A. oxyphylla suppresses mouse skin tumor promotion and induces apoptosis in cultured human promyelocytic leukemia cells. In the present work, we have assessed effects of yakuchinone A and yakuchinone B, phenolic diarylheptanoids derived from A. oxyphylla, on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced inflammation and epidermal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity as well as on skin tumor promotion in female ICR mice. Thus, topical application of 2 or 6 micromol of the diarylheptanoids prior to each topical dose of TPA significantly ameliorated 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-initiated mouse skin tumor formation. In parallel with suppression of tumor promotion, topically applied yakuchinone A and B markedly inhibited TPA-induced epidermal ODC activity and ODC mRNA expression.

However, neither the incidence of HTLV-I/II infection in organ donors nor the risk of transmission of HTLV-I/II by solid organ transplantation has been defined. Further, it is not known if HTLV infection contributes to significant morbidity in solid organ recipients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of HTLV-I/II infection in organ donors in USA and to determine if transplanting these organs resulted in HTLV-related morbidity or mortality. We utilized the UNOS database to: (i) identify organ donors that were positive for HTLV-I or II infection between 1988 and 2000, and (ii) evaluate outcomes in the recipients of these organs. There were 25 HTLV-I/II-positive organ donors reported to UNOS between 1988 and 2000. Based on organ donors with a known HTLV-I/II status, the prevalence of HTLV-I infection in organ donors is 0.027% and the prevalence of HTLV-II is 0.064%. Twenty-two organs were transplanted from these HTLV-positive donors. There have been no reports of HTLV-I/II-related disease in the recipients with a median follow-up of 11.9 months. At our center, over the last 1.5 years there have been four multiorgan donors with false-positive HTLV-I/II screening assays, which resulted in the decision not to use organs from these donors. Based on the minimal chance of HTLV-related disease following transplantation of HTLV-I/II organs in this series, we recommend that careful consideration be given to transplanting organs from HTLV-I/II-positive organ donors.","['Shames, Brian D', ""D'Alessandro, Anthony M"", 'Sollinger, Hans W']","['Shames BD', ""D'Alessandro AM"", 'Sollinger HW']","['Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53792, USA. bd.shames@hosp.wisc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Transplant,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,100968638,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission', 'HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission', 'HTLV-II Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission', '*Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",2002/08/31 10:00,2003/03/29 05:00,['2002/08/31 10:00'],"['2002/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [medline]', '2002/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-6143.2002.20712.x [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Transplant. 2002 Aug;2(7):658-63. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-6143.2002.20712.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histological transformation of FCL is commonly associated with accumulation of secondary genetic alterations. The BCL-6 gene is commonly implicated in the pathogenesis of DLBCL and its expression may be altered by clonal rearrangements and somatic point mutations in its 5' non-translated regulatory region. Recently, somatic mutations of the BCL-6 gene were associated with the transformation process. Here, we examined BCL-6 mRNA expression and BCL-6 mutations in paired biopsies from the same patients obtained at the time of FCL diagnosis and after transformation. BCL-6 mRNA expression markedly increased upon transformation (1.9- to 4.8-fold) in three cases, remained unchanged in one case and decreased compared to the diagnosis FCL specimens in four cases. The three specimens that demonstrated an increase in the BCL-6 mRNA expression upon transformation harbored BCL-6 gene mutations in the 5' region of the first intron that overlapped with the previously reported negative regulatory region of the gene. Accumulation of new mutations in this region was not observed in DLBCL biopsies in which the BCL-6 mRNA expression did not increase. The present study demonstrates that although BCL-6 gene mutations do accumulate during the transformation process and, depending on their location within the first intron, may deregulate BCL-6 mRNA expression, increase in BCL-6 mRNA expression is not uniformly required for transformation from FCL to DLBCL.","['Lossos, I S', 'Warnke, R', 'Levy, R']","['Lossos IS', 'Warnke R', 'Levy R']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA 94305-5306, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402578 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1857-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402578.,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,"['CA33399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and others have previously reported new recurrent breakpoints (3'BCL2 and 5'mcr) which could be easily analyzed. In this study, we characterized the BCL2 breakpoints in 113 untreated patients with t(14;18)-positive FL and correlated their location with the location of JH break and with the clinical features. Breakpoints were respectively located at the major breakpoint region (MBR) in 73 cases (65%), at the minor cluster region (mcr) in 10 cases (9%), at 3'BCL2 in 14 cases (12%) and at 5'mcr in seven cases (6%). Finally, the breakpoint could not be located in nine patients (8%). 5'mcr cases were associated with bulky and high-stage disease, with frequent extranodal involvement and bone marrow infiltration. Survival studies did not show any correlation between breakpoint location and clinical outcome. The joining JH6 segment was the most frequently involved whatever the breakpoint location. In conclusion, unusual BCL2 breakpoints are found in about 20% of newly diagnosed follicular lymphomas and their study should be considered in the investigation of BCL2-JH rearrangement. It was not possible, in this series, to demonstrate any correlation between breakpoint location and either initial characteristics of the disease or survival of the patients.","['Buchonnet, G', 'Jardin, F', 'Jean, N', 'Bertrand, P', 'Parmentier, F', 'Tison, S', 'Lepretre, S', 'Contentin, N', 'Lenain, P', 'Stamatoullas-Bastard, A', 'Tilly, H', 'Bastard, C']","['Buchonnet G', 'Jardin F', 'Jean N', 'Bertrand P', 'Parmentier F', 'Tison S', 'Lepretre S', 'Contentin N', 'Lenain P', 'Stamatoullas-Bastard A', 'Tilly H', 'Bastard C']","['INSERM, EMI 9906, IFRMP No. 23, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/*genetics', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402568 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1852-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402568.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several malignancies show a reciprocal correlation between genetic alterations of single members of the pRb pathway. Therefore, we determined the frequency of Rb deletions and cyclin D1 alterations by fluorescence in situ hybridization as well as 5' CpG island hypermethylation of the p16(INK4A)gene using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow mononuclear cells from 82 individuals with plasma cell disorders. Alterations in at least one of the components of the pathway were found in 75%. Cyclin D1 translocations or amplifications were detected in 14/82 (17.1%), Rb deletions at 13q14 in 23/82 (28%) of the cases, including three (3.6%) homozygous deletions. p16(INK4A) was hypermethylated in 33/57 (57.9%) of the samples. Further analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between cyclin D1 alterations and extramedullar or leukemic myeloma manifestations (P = 0.014; Fisher's test). Whereas Rb deletions seemed to occur alternatively to cyclin D1 alterations, no reciprocal correlation was found between p16(INK4A) hypermethylations and cyclin D1 or Rb locus aberrations. Cyclin D1 locus alterations and Rb deletions were associated with a significantly worse prognosis whereas p16(INK4A) hypermethylation had no impact on survival. We conclude that cyclin D1 and Rb aberrations seem to occur as alternative events in plasma cell malignancies and contribute to clinical course and prognosis. In contrast, although p16(INK4A) hypermethylation is frequent, inactivation of p16(INK4A) seems not to be involved in the pathogenesis of plasma cell disorders.","['Kramer, A', 'Schultheis, B', 'Bergmann, J', 'Willer, A', 'Hegenbart, U', 'Ho, A D', 'Goldschmidt, H', 'Hehlmann, R']","['Kramer A', 'Schultheis B', 'Bergmann J', 'Willer A', 'Hegenbart U', 'Ho AD', 'Goldschmidt H', 'Hehlmann R']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik V, Universitat Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402609 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1844-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402609.,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 12-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates are 24.9% and 3.1%, respectively, and the median survival and EFS are 49 and 17 months, respectively. Only four patients are alive and disease-free 79, 90, 132 and 153 after the first HDT, respectively. Three of them received a subsequent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Three factors significantly influence OS in this series: B2M at diagnosis, age, and the completion of a second HDT. The 10-year survival is 18.9% for the group of patients with B2M level >3 mg/l at diagnosis as compared with 41% for patients with B2M < or =3, with a median survival of 31 months vs 73 (P = 0.01).

However, until recently its use in modern medicine has been restricted to the treatment of a limited number of parasitic infections. In the early 1990s, reports from China described impressive results with arsenic trioxide in patients with de novo, relapsed, and refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Other investigators subsequently confirmed these results leading to approval of its use for relapsed or refractory APL in the United States. Investigations of this agent have demonstrated that its efficacy in APL and preclinical tumor models is dependent upon a number of mechanisms, including induction of apoptosis, effects on cellular differentiation, cell cycling, and tumor angiogenesis. Subsequent preclinical studies showed significant activity of arsenic trioxide in multiple myeloma (MM). Based on this, in a phase II trial, we have evaluated the activity of arsenic trioxide in 14 patients with relapsed MM, refractory to conventional salvage therapy. With the dose and schedule used, treatment with arsenic trioxide produced responses in three patients and prolonged stable disease in a fourth patient, with the longest response lasting 6 weeks. Although treatment was reasonably well tolerated, in these patients with extensive prior therapy, 11 developed cytopenia, five associated with infectious complications and three developed deep vein thromboses. The results of this small trial support further investigation of this novel drug for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MM.","['Munshi, N C', 'Tricot, G', 'Desikan, R', 'Badros, A', 'Zangari, M', 'Toor, A', 'Morris, C', 'Anaissie, E', 'Barlogie, B']","['Munshi NC', 'Tricot G', 'Desikan R', 'Badros A', 'Zangari M', 'Toor A', 'Morris C', 'Anaissie E', 'Barlogie B']","['University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Myeloma and Transplantation Medical Center, Little Rock, AR, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Oxides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402599 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1835-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402599.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transgenic C57BL/6J mice expressing SV40 early region under a myelomonocytic promoter develop histiocytic sarcomas with a latency of 167 days. We used retroviral proviral tagging to accelerate tumorigenesis and to uncover genetic changes that contribute to tumor development. Infection of transgenic mice with Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) shortened the latency of morbidity to 103 days (P< 0.001); this was associated with clonal proviral integrations in tumor DNA. As expected for F-MuLV, proviral insertions occurred at Fli1 in both transgenic and nontransgenic tumors. Four insertions were found at a novel locus, termed Fim4, on chromosome 6. This region is syntenic to human 7q32, a region that is commonly deleted in human myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. A murine BAC containing Fim4 was sequenced and analyzed, and while there was significant human-mouse homology in the area of the insertions, no candidate gene has been identified. Thus we have established a system to identify genes involved in myelomonocytic tumors, and have used it to identify Fim4, a new common site of proviral insertion.

Simultaneous exposure to MTX and cytarabine for 24 h produced antagonistic effects, sequential exposure to MTX for 24 h followed by cytarabine for 24 h produced synergistic effects, and the reverse sequence produced additive effects in both CCRF-CEM and HL-60 cells.

Cells lacking this enzyme are expected to be sensitive to purine synthesis inhibitors and/or methionine starvation. We reported previously that the MTAP gene is deleted in adult T cell leukemia (ATL) cells. In the present study, we expanded our series and used a real-time quantitative PCR assay for accurate diagnosis of the deletion and nine of 65 primary ATL samples (13.8%) were MTAP negative. In spite of this low incidence, ATL cells showed significantly higher sensitivity to L-alanosine, an inhibitor of de novo adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthesis, than normal lymphocytes, suggesting that the MTAP gene is inactivated not only by deletion but also by other mechanisms. Indeed, a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay disclosed that primary ATL cells had significantly lower MTAP mRNA expression than normal lymphocytes. Since MTAP-negative ATL cell lines also showed much higher sensitivity to L-alanosine than MTAP-positive ATL cell lines, we used these cell lines to investigate whether it is possible to develop selective therapy targeting MTAP deficiency. A substrate of MTAP, methylthioadenosine (MTA) or its substitutes rescued concanavalin A (Con A)-activated normal lymphocyte proliferation from L-alanosine toxicity. All the compounds except 5'-deoxyadenosine, however, also caused the undesirable rescue of MTAP-negative ATL cell lines. 5'-Deoxyadenosine had the desired ability to rescue hematopoietic progenitor cells without rescuing ATL cell lines. These results support the rationale for a chemotherapy regimen of L-alanosine combined with 5'-deoxyadenosine rescue in MTAP-deficient ATL.","['Harasawa, H', 'Yamada, Y', 'Kudoh, M', 'Sugahara, K', 'Soda, H', 'Hirakata, Y', 'Sasaki, H', 'Ikeda, S', 'Matsuo, T', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Nobori, T', 'Kamihira, S']","['Harasawa H', 'Yamada Y', 'Kudoh M', 'Sugahara K', 'Soda H', 'Hirakata Y', 'Sasaki H', 'Ikeda S', 'Matsuo T', 'Tomonaga M', 'Nobori T', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adenosine Monophosphate/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*deficiency/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402570 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1799-807. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402570.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain further insight into this topic we report herein a novel approach by analyzing the role of HERG K(+) channels in the regulation of hemopoietic cell proliferation. These channels, encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg), belong to a family of K(+) channels, whose role in oncogenesis has been recently demonstrated. We report here that herg is switched off in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) as well as in circulating CD34(+) cells, however, it is rapidly turned on in the latter upon induction of the mitotic cycle. Moreover, hergappears to be constitutively activated in leukemic cell lines as well as in the majority of circulating blasts from primary AML. Evidence is also provided that HERG channel activity regulates cell proliferation in stimulated CD34(+) as well as in blast cells from AML patients.

To investigate the presumptive unique characteristics of the embryonic hematopoietic microenvironment and its surrounding tissues, we have generated stromal clones from subdissected day 10 and day 11 AGMs, embryonic livers (ELs) and gut mesentery. We here examine the ability of 19 of these clones to sustain extended long-term cultures (LTCs) of human CD34(+) umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells in vitro. The presence of in vitro repopulating cells was assessed by sustained production of progenitor cells (extended LTC-CFC) and cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFC). The embryonic stromal clones differed greatly in their support for human HSCs. Out of eight clones tested in the absence of exogenous cytokines, only one (EL-derived) clone was able to provide maintenance of HSCs. Addition of either Tpo or Flt3-L + Tpo improved the long-term support of about 50% of the tested clones. Cultures on four out of 19 clones, ie the EL-derived clone mentioned, two urogenital-ridge (UG)-derived clones and one gastrointestinal (GI)-derived clone, allowed a continuous expansion of primitive CAFC and CFU-GM with over several hundred-fold more CAFC(week6) produced in the 12th week of culture. This expansion was considerably higher than that found with the FBMD-1 cell line, which is appreciated by many investigators for its support of human HSCs, under comparable conditions.

To address the tissue-specific regulation of the promoter, we isolated sequences 1.2-kb 5' to the transcriptional start site. Sequence analysis demonstrated that this region contains one TATA box and several putative transcription factor binding sites including four G/C-rich sites and one Evi-1-like site. A fragment of the promoter spanning 158-bp upstream of the transcription start site displayed relative specificity for PLZF-expressing myeloid cells. Functional promoter assays revealed that an Evi-1-like site at -140/-130 was essential for full promoter activity in every cell line tested while a G-rich site at -15/-7 was important for tissue specificity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that Evi-1 binds specifically to -140/-130 Evi-1-like site and overexpression of Evi-1 in K562 cells activated the PLZF promoter. UV cross-linking assays showed that the proximal, tissue specific element at -15/-7 bound a novel 28 kDa protein.

Fifty-five adult de novo AML (group A) and 27 elderly AML or AML after myelodysplastic syndrome (AML-MDS) (group B) were tested using probes detecting the following anomalies: -5, -7, +8, deletions of 5q31, 7q31, 12p13/ETV6, 17p13/p53, 20q11. All the patients had a normal karyotype in more than 20 cells and tested negative for the common AML-associated fusion genes. No patient in group A was found to carry occult chromosome anomalies, whereas 8/27 patients in group B (P < 0.0001) showed 5q31 or 7q31 deletion (three cases each), a 17p13/p53deletion or trisomy 8 (one case each) in 33-60% interphase cells.

The majority of blast cells (76-94%) carried the chromosome anomaly in all cases; erythroid involvement in a minority of cells was seen in three patients.

We arrived at the following conclusions: (1) cryptic chromosome deletions in the order of a few hundred kb magnitude may be found in a fraction of elderly AML or MDS-related AML and not in de novo adult AML with normal karyotype; (2) these chromosome lesions are usually represented by submicroscopic rearrangements; (3) they display a specific pattern of cell-lineage involvement arguing in favor of their role in the outgrowth of the leukemic blast cells; (4) they are associated with a history of exposure to myelotoxic agents in the workplace and, possibly, with resistance to induction treatment.","['Cuneo, A', 'Bigoni, R', 'Cavazzini, F', 'Bardi, A', 'Roberti, M G', 'Agostini, P', 'Tammiso, E', 'Ciccone, N', 'Mancini, M', 'Nanni, M', 'De Cuia, R', 'Divona, M', 'La Starza, R', 'Crescenzi, B', 'Testoni, N', 'Rege Cambrin, G', 'Mecucci, C', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Saglio, G', 'Castoldi, G']","['Cuneo A', 'Bigoni R', 'Cavazzini F', 'Bardi A', 'Roberti MG', 'Agostini P', 'Tammiso E', 'Ciccone N', 'Mancini M', 'Nanni M', 'De Cuia R', 'Divona M', 'La Starza R', 'Crescenzi B', 'Testoni N', 'Rege Cambrin G', 'Mecucci C', 'Lo Coco F', 'Saglio G', 'Castoldi G']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Terapie Avanzate - Sezione di Ematologia, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Trisomy/diagnosis']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402605 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1745-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402605.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crosslinking of CD20 (CD20XL) induced apoptosis in Ramos cells, which involved loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), the release of cytochrome-c (cyt-c), and activation of caspases-9 and -3. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence showed that the apoptotic outcome did not depend on these events. First, under circumstances where Ramos cells display resistance to either CD95- or B cell receptor (BCR)-induced apoptosis, CD20XL-induced apoptosis was not affected, pointing to a distinct pathway. Second, the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk prevented processing of caspase-9, -3 and PARP as well as DNA fragmentation, but did not block apoptosis as measured by annexin V staining, cell size and membrane integrity. Lastly, Bcl-2 overexpression blocked cyt-c release and the decrease in Deltapsi(m), and completely prevented CD95- or BCR-mediated apoptosis; however, it did not affect CD20XL-induced cell death. We conclude that although CD20XL can initiate the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, CD20-induced apoptosis does not necessarily require active caspases and cannot be blocked by Bcl-2. Since most chemotherapeutic drugs require the activation of caspases to exert their cytotoxicity, these findings provide an important rationale for the use of CD20 mAbs in chemoresistant malignancies.","['van der Kolk, L E', 'Evers, L M', 'Omene, C', 'Lens, S M A', 'Lederman, S', 'van Lier, R A W', 'van Oers, M H J', 'Eldering, E']","['van der Kolk LE', 'Evers LM', 'Omene C', 'Lens SM', 'Lederman S', 'van Lier RA', 'van Oers MH', 'Eldering E']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rituximab', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402559 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1735-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402559.,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated that Bcr-Abl-positive cells can be uniquely resistant to apoptosis induced by different types of stimuli, but the mechanism by which this is achieved is not defined. In this study we have investigated how cells expressing high expression levels of Bcr-Abl may gain resistance to cytotoxic drugs. We have established cell lines expressing low and high expression levels of Bcr-Abl. Cells expressing elevated Bcr-Abl are resistant to cytotoxic drugs. In drug-sensitive 32D-parental and low Bcr-Abl expressing cells, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bax and Bad translocate from the cytosol to the mitochondrion following a cytotoxic insult. In contrast, high Bcr-Abl expression prevents the early translocation of these pro-apoptotic proteins to the mitochondrion, mitochondrial membrane potential is retained and caspases are inactive. We also demonstrate that IL-3 can contribute to drug resistance in low Bcr-Abl expressing cells, however, independent inhibition of IL-3 activated pathways (PI3K/AKT and Jak/STAT) does not sensitise cells to apoptosis. This study demonstrates that the subcellular translocation of Bax and Bad can be regulated by elevated Bcr-Abl expression and this may be a key event in the abrogation of an apoptotic response following a cytotoxic insult.","['Keeshan, K', 'Cotter, T G', 'McKenna, S L']","['Keeshan K', 'Cotter TG', 'McKenna SL']","['Department of Biochemistry, University College Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402576 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1725-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402576.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that stromal cells prevent apoptosis of AML cells by up-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins in leukemic blasts. In HL-60 and NB-4 cells, serum deprivation- and ara-C-induced apoptosis was diminished when cells were cocultured with murine MS-5 stromal cells (P < 0.02). This effect was reproduced with conditioned medium from MS-5 cells. Cocultivation with stromal cells induced Bcl-2 expression levels, both by PCR analysis and flow cytometry. In primary AML (n = 14), ara-C-induced apoptosis was significantly lower in cells cocultured with MS-5 cells than in controls (P < 0.001). This effect was partially preserved when leukemic cells were separated from stromal cells by a microporous insert (in 5/9 samples, P = 0.04). In addition, Bcl-2 levels were significantly higher in stroma-supported than in control CD34(+) AML cells (P < 0.01). Bcl-X(L) levels were higher in 5/7 samples grown on stromal layers. Of note, in AML patients resistant to induction chemotherapy (n = 6), Bcl-2 increased significantly after cultivation with stromal cells, but no such increase was noted in cells from chemotherapy-sensitive patients. In conclusion, MS-5 stromal cells prevented apoptosis in HL-60 cells and in primary AML blasts via modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins. The observed association of high Bcl-2 expression in stroma-supported AML blasts in vitro with resistance to chemotherapy in vivo suggests that the same mechanisms may be operational in vivo.","['Konopleva, M', 'Konoplev, S', 'Hu, W', 'Zaritskey, A Y', 'Afanasiev, B V', 'Andreeff, M']","['Konopleva M', 'Konoplev S', 'Hu W', 'Zaritskey AY', 'Afanasiev BV', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', '*Organic Chemicals', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402608 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1713-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402608.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (PKH 26)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,"['P01 CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the effect of short exposures (>3 days) to low etoposide concentrations (LC-etoposide, 0.01-0.04 microM) on the ability of leukaemic cells to initiate apoptosis. Results showed that although LC-etoposide had no effect on cell growth characteristics, the pre-culture of cells with LC-etoposide conferred resistance to subsequent exposure to cytotoxic concentrations of etoposide (0.3 microM etoposide in HL60 on day 3: %V: 95.2 +/- 1.6% vs 60.3 +/- 12.1% in control cells with no pre-culture, and %A: 5.1 +/- 0.2 vs 19.0 +/- 0.7%; P < 0.001). This effect was still observed 4 weeks after the initial drug exposure. Associated with these observations was a three-fold increase in genetic instability and a reduction in induced bax protein levels. The anti-cytotoxic effect was also shown to be specific to topoisomerase II (topo II) inhibitors, as the pre-culture of cells with a low doxorubicin concentration also induced resistance, while low cisplatin concentrations did not. The persistence of these alterations in cellular processes following an initial exposure to topo II inhibitors suggests a DNA-based mechanism, and highlights the existence of drug/target interactions even at very low drug concentrations.","['Liu, W M', 'Oakley, P R', 'Joel, S P']","['Liu WM', 'Oakley PR', 'Joel SP']","[""Barry Reed Oncology Laboratory, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402621 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1705-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402621.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively evaluated the effect of reinforced courses of chemotherapy on the prognostic value of FLT3-ITDs in 159 AML patients prospectively enrolled in the ALFA-9000 trial, which randomly compared three reinforced induction regimens (standard 3+7 including high-dose daunorubicin, double induction, and timed-sequential therapy). FLT3-ITD was present in 40/159 (25%) blast samples and associated with high WBC (P = 0.002) and cytogenetics (P < 0.001) with a higher incidence (35%) in patients with a normal karyotype. There was no difference in CR rate between FLT3-wt and FLT3-ITD patients (80% vs 78%). Relapse-free survival (RFS) was similar in both groups (5-year RFS, 33% vs 32%; P = 0.41), even after adjustment for age, sex, WBC, cytogenetics, and treatment arm. A trend to a worse survival was observed in the FLT3-ITD group (estimated 5-year OS, 23% vs 37%; P = 0.09), mainly in patients with a normal karyotype. This was associated with a dramatic outcome in relapsing FLT3-ITD patients (estimated 3-year post-relapse survival, 0% vs 27%; P = 0.04). These results suggest that the bad prognosis associated with FLT3-ITDs in AML might be partly overcome using reinforced chemotherapy. Early detection of FLT3 mutations might thus be useful to intensify induction as well as post-remission therapy in FLT3-ITD patients.","['Boissel, N', 'Cayuela, J M', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Thomas, X', 'Grardel, N', 'Fund, X', 'Tigaud, I', 'Raffoux, E', 'Rousselot, P', 'Sigaux, F', 'Degos, L', 'Castaigne, S', 'Fenaux, P', 'Dombret, H']","['Boissel N', 'Cayuela JM', 'Preudhomme C', 'Thomas X', 'Grardel N', 'Fund X', 'Tigaud I', 'Raffoux E', 'Rousselot P', 'Sigaux F', 'Degos L', 'Castaigne S', 'Fenaux P', 'Dombret H']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Factor/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402622 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1699-704. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402622.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of optimal mitogen combinations (OMCs) on the expression of 26 surface membrane antigens among 33 CLL patients. The seven OMCs used were selected after pre-testing 14 combinations of (1) S. aureus Cowan I (SAC), (2) interleukin-2 (IL-2), (3) tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and (4) 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA; also known as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or PMA).

Interestingly, the expression of CD27, CD45RA, CD79b, CD80, CD122 and that of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily members CD21, Ig-kappa, Ig-lambda, Ig-delta and Ig-micro were not significantly affected under similar conditions. The expression of several antigens was co-regulated, suggesting common regulatory pathways. These antigens include CD11c/CD5, CD11c/CD22, CD11c/CD126, CD11c/FMC7 as well as CD27/CD45, CD27/CD45RA and CD27/CD79b. Upregulation of surface antigen expression, induced by OMCs, should be applicable in antibody therapy in vitro and in vivo, and in negative stem cell selection for autotransplantation. Furthermore, the current strategy to enhance cell surface antigen expression may be a versatile tool to raise humoral and cell-mediated host defense against CLL cells. Upregulation of proteins mediating positive growth signals (eg CD25, CD40) and negative signals or apoptosis (eg CD95) may be used to sensitize cells to chemotherapy and programmed cell death.","['Vilpo, J', 'Hulkkonen, J', 'Hurme, M', 'Vilpo, L']","['Vilpo J', 'Hulkkonen J', 'Hurme M', 'Vilpo L']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Tampere Medical School and Laboratory Centre of Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Up-Regulation']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402583 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1691-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402583.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed our database of 379 consecutive breast cancer ASCT patients treated with alkylator-based chemotherapy, followed for a median of 1.52 years (range 0-8.97), with a median survival of 6.16 years. Three patients have developed tMDS/AML. The probability of developing this complication at 5 years is 0.032 in our series.

Forty-one patients, in whom both a molecular marker of MRD and sufficient archival material was available, were included in the study. All were in remission at BMT: eight in CR1, 32 in CR2 and five in greater than CR2. MRD was measured by PCR amplification of antigen receptor gene rearrangements and clone-specific oligoprobing, the median sensitivity of detection being one leukaemic cell in 10000 normals. Results were classified as high-level positive (if a clonal band was evident after electrophoresis), low-level positive (if MRD was detected only after oligoprobing) and negative. MRD was detected at high levels in 17 patients, at low levels in 10 patients and 14 patients were MRD negative at the time of transplant. The 5-year event-free survival for these groups was 23%, 48% and 78%, respectively (P = 0.022). Limited multivariate analysis confirmed the significance of MRD (P = 0.0095) vs CR status, donor type, sex, immunophenotype and acute GvHD. This study confirms the strong relationship between MRD level and outcome following allogeneic transplantation. In contrast to a previous study we observed that a minority of children with high-level pre-BMT MRD can enter long lasting remission. The possible role for acute GVHD coupled with a graft-versus-leukaemia effect in the clearance of high level MRD in patients with ALL is discussed.","['Bader, P', 'Hancock, J', 'Kreyenberg, H', 'Goulden, N J', 'Niethammer, D', 'Oakhill, A', 'Steward, C G', 'Handgretinger, R', 'Beck, J F', 'Klingebiel, T']","['Bader P', 'Hancock J', 'Kreyenberg H', 'Goulden NJ', 'Niethammer D', 'Oakhill A', 'Steward CG', 'Handgretinger R', 'Beck JF', 'Klingebiel T']","[""University Children's Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2002/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402552 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1668-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402552.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have investigated the effect of the R115777 on growth and survival of myeloma cells. We have found that R115777 induced (1) a significant and dose-dependent growth inhibition of the three myeloma cell lines tested; and (2) a significant and time-dependent apoptosis. R115777 also induced apoptosis in the bone marrow mononuclear cell population of four MM patients, being almost restricted to the malignant plasma cells. Finally, we have investigated the effect of the R115777 in the Ras/MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways which are implicated in survival and/or proliferation in MM. The phosphorylation of both STAT3 and ERK1/2 induced by IL-6 was totally blocked at 15 microM of R115777 and partially blocked when R115777 was used at 10 and 5 microM.

However, it was unclear whether the clonal progeny of a retrovirally transduced hematopoietic stem cell would be capable of maintaining transgene expression through serial repopulation and multilineage differentiation. Such investigations require simultaneous analyses of clonality, multilineage activity and transgene copy numbers. Using a mouse model, the present study demonstrates that a single hematopoietic stem cell expressing a marker gene from one or two insertions of a simple retroviral vector actively maintains multilineage transgene expression in the vast majority (80-99%) of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells. Gene expression persisted through serial transplantations for at least 97 weeks post gene transfer and was observed in the lymphoid (B, T and NK cells), myeloid (CD11b(+), Gr-1(+)), erythroid (Ter119(+), mature red blood cells) and megakaryocytic (as indicated by platelets) progeny. Therefore, a single immunoselection for hematopoietic stem cells expressing the transgene in vivo was sufficient to establish a completely chimeric hematopoiesis. These observations imply that the retroviral vectors used in this study contain cis-elements that mediate expression through massive clonal expansion and multilineage differentiation, provided the insertion occurred in genetic loci permissive for expression in hematopoietic stem cells.","['Li, Z', 'Fehse, B', 'Schiedlmeier, B', 'Dullmann, J', 'Frank, O', 'Zander, A R', 'Ostertag, W', 'Baum, C']","['Li Z', 'Fehse B', 'Schiedlmeier B', 'Dullmann J', 'Frank O', 'Zander AR', 'Ostertag W', 'Baum C']","['Experimental Cell Therapy, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage/*physiology', 'Chimera', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes/*physiology']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402619 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1655-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402619.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose to develop cell vaccines by genetic modification of AML cells with CD80, an essential T cell costimulator that is lacking in the majority of AML cases, and GM-CSF, to induce proliferation and activation of professional antigen-presenting cells. Here, we evaluated third generation self inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors, which have the potential advantage of improved safety. CD80 and GM-CSF expression by these vectors was higher than that reported with second generation vectors (Stripecke et al, Blood 2000; 96: 1317-1326). In some cases, endogenous GM-CSF expression by transduced AML cells induced phenotypic changes consistent with the maturation of leukemia blasts into antigen-presenting cells. Further, in all cases studied, GM-CSF expression was associated with higher proliferation and cell viability. Allogeneic and autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions performed with transduced irradiated AML cells expressing CD80 and/or GM-CSF demonstrated that expression of either transgene enhanced T cell activation.

As IL12 and CD154 share several pathways mediating immune response, we investigated in an aggressive murine model of acute leukemia the relative antileukemic efficiency of IL12, CD154 and IL12 + CD154 gene transfer. Live leukemic cells transduced by IL12, CD154, and IL12 + CD154 showed reduced leukemogenicity but CD154 protective effect was reduced when 10(6) leukemic cells were injected. Vaccines with lethally irradiated IL12-transduced cells were able to cure mice previously injected with 10(4) leukemic cells and adoptive transfer of IL12-induced antileukemic immunity protected recipient mice. NK cytotoxicity was enhanced in mice vaccinated with leukemic cells transduced by IL12, CD154, and CD154 + IL12.

Between 1982 and 1999, 3603 new consecutive cases of AML aged over 15 years were admitted to GIMEMA trials. Of them, 24 were AMeL. The incidence of AMeL among AML patients enrolled in GIMEMA trials was 0.6% (24/3603). Diagnosis was based on morphological criteria. Out of 11 cytogenetic studies performed two presented chromosome 3 abnormalities. Twelve patients (50%) reached a CR, five (21%) died in induction and seven (27%) were unresponsive. The median duration of CR was 35 weeks (range 10-441). Seven patients underwent transplantation procedures (1 BMT, 4 aBMT, 2 aPBSCT). Four patients died in CR due to chemotherapy-related complications. Comparing the CR rate between AMeL and the other cases of AML enrolled in GIMEMA trials, no differences were observed. These results were mirrored for different age groups. The median survival was 40 weeks. At present, after a follow-up of a minimum of 2 years, only two patients are alive in CR, all the others having died.

Here we used Cox modelling to compare these strategies in patients with MDS and s-AML treated by the Leukemia Group of the EORTC or at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. All patients were aged 15-60. The 184 EORTC patients received conventional dose ara-C + idarubicin + etoposide for remission induction, and after one consolidation course, were scheduled to receive an allograft, or an autograft if a sibling donor was unavailable. The 215 MDA patients received various high-dose ara-C containing induction regimens, and in CR, continued to receive these regimens at reduced dose for 6-12 months. CR rates were 54% EORTC and 63% MDA (P = 0.09). Sixty-five of the 100 EORTC patients who entered CR received a transplant in first CR. Disease-free survival in patients achieving CR was superior in the EORTC cohort, the 4-years DFS rates were 28.9% (s.e. = 4.8%) EORTC vs 17.3% (s.e. = 3.7%) MDA (P = 0.017). Survival from CR was not significantly different in the EORTC and MDA groups, as was survival from start of treatment. After accounting for prognostic factors the conclusions were unchanged.

All patients presented disease progression in the last 3 months with standard therapy, regarding splenomegaly, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia and/or hyperleukocytosis. Thalidomide was administered at daily doses increasing from 100 to 600 mg. Eleven out of 12 patients were evaluable. No progression of disease was seen during the treatment in any case. In particular, spleen size decreased in 7/11 patients, anemia improved in 3/4 (two are now transfusion independent), thrombocytopenia in 2/2 and hyperleukocytosis in 2/5 patients. Side-effects were frequent, although not severe. After treatment, VEGF and bFGF plasma levels varied widely and in selected cases decreased. In particular, VEGF and/or bFGF decreased in 4/5 responders and in 1/3 non-responders. Moreover, MVD significantly decreased in all the responders evaluated after treatment.

HSC represent a very small subset of hematopoietic cells and provide self-renewal, possess differentiation capacity and allow a constant supply of the entire hematopoietic cell spectrum. Until recently, CD34 has been used as a convenient marker for HSC, since CD34(+) cells have been shown to possess colony-forming potential in short-term assays, maintain long-term colony-forming potential in in vitro cultures and allow the expression and differentiation of blood cells from different hematopoietic lineages in in vivo models. Clinical and experimental protocols have targeted CD34(+) cells enriched by a variety of selection models and have readily used these for transplantation, purging and gene therapies and targets for future organ replacement. Recent studies in murine and human models, however, have indicated that CD34(-) HSC exist as well, which possess engraftment potential and distinct HSC characteristics. These studies challenge the dogma that HSC are uniformly found in the CD34(+) subset, and question whether primitive HSC are CD34(+) or CD34(-).

S1P is the ligand for a family of five G protein-coupled receptors. Activation of these GPCRs by S1P or dihydro-S1P regulates diverse processes, including cell migration, angiogenesis, vascular maturation, heart development, and neurite retraction. There is also abundant evidence that S1P can function as a second messenger important for regulation of calcium homeostasis, cell growth, and suppression of apoptosis. In many cases, the intracellular level of S1P and ceramide, another important sphingolipid metabolite associated with cell death and cell growth arrest, coordinately determine cell fate. Changes in S1P and ceramide have been implicated in a number of pathological conditions in which apoptosis plays an important role. Importantly, radiation-induced oocyte loss in adult female mice, the event that drives premature ovarian failure and infertility in female cancer patients, was completely prevented by in vivo therapy with S1P. Understanding the biosynthesis, metabolism and functions of S1P can uncover new targets for the pharmaceutical and therapeutic applications of S1P.","['Spiegel, S', 'Kolesnick, R']","['Spiegel S', 'Kolesnick R']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Virginia Campus, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298-0614, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Physiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Lysophospholipids', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/physiology/*therapeutic use']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402611 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1596-602. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402611.,"['0 (Lysophospholipids)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",79,,"['CA42385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM43880/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, it has been reported that CML patients could develop resistance to the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib (STI571, Gleevec), pointing to the need for development of additional Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors or other therapeutic strategies. It was also found that a significant proportion of patients who received the Bcr-Abl inhibitor did not achieve complete cytogenetic response. Mechanisms for incomplete cytogenetic response to Bcr-Abl inhibition are not entirely clear. We report here three new pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PD164199, PD173952, PD173958, that induced apoptosis of Bcr-Abl-dependent hematopoietic cells. An interleukin-3 (IL-3) autocrine loop was observed previously in primitive CD34(+)/Bcr-Abl(+) leukemic cells in CML patients. Using 32Dp210(Bcr-Abl)and Baf3p210(Bcr-Abl) cells as models, we tested whether IL-3 might protect Bcr-Abltransformed, IL-3-responsive cells from apoptosis caused by Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibition. Results of trypan blue exclusion, fluoroisothiocyanate-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl] -fluoromethylketone (FITC-VAD-FMK), and Annexin-V/7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) binding assays indicate that IL-3 could protect Bcr-Abl-transformed, IL-3 responsive hematopoietic progenitor cells from apoptosis induced by Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or stem cell transplantation (SCT) is currently considered the only curative treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Recently, the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Glivec, formerly STI-571) has been shown to induce durable hematologic and major cytogenetic responses in a high percentage of patients with chronic phase CML. In patients with advanced disease remissions are transient and most patients relapse despite continued imatinib treatment. Some of these patients go on to receive allogeneic BMT or SCT, during which administration of imatinib is usually discontinued as it is believed to interfere with bone marrow engraftment. In this study, we examined the effect of imatinib on hematopoietic engraftment in a syngeneic mouse model. We found that imatinib has no significant influence on hematopoietic recovery in lethally irradiated mice in vivo. Thus, our results suggest that continued administration of imatinib in the course of BMT or SCT may be a feasible therapeutic regimen.","['Hoepfl, J', 'Miething, C', 'Grundler, R', 'Gotze, K S', 'Peschel, C', 'Duyster, J']","['Hoepfl J', 'Miething C', 'Grundler R', 'Gotze KS', 'Peschel C', 'Duyster J']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory of Leukemogenesis, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/09/27 06:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402679 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Sep;16(9):1584-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402679.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to determine whether BCR-ABL transcript levels can predict chromosomal response. Residual disease was evaluated in 120 CML patients in chronic phase (CP) treated with the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib after resistance or intolerance to interferon alpha (IFN). Median time of therapy was 401 days (range 111-704). BCR-ABL and total ABL transcripts were measured in 486 peripheral blood (PB) specimens with a real time RT-PCR approach using fluorescent-labeled hybridization probes (LightCycler technology) and results were expressed as the ratio BCR-ABL/ABL. Cytogenetic response was determined in 3-monthly intervals: From 101 evaluable patients, 42 achieved a complete (CR, 0% Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)- positive metaphases), 18 a partial (PR, 1-34% Ph+), 13 a minor (MR, 35-94% Ph+), and 26 no response (NR, >94% Ph+). All PB samples were RT-PCR positive. The proportion of Ph+ metaphases and simultaneous BCR-ABL/ABL ratios correlated with r = 0.74, P < 0.0001. In order to investigate whether early molecular analysis may predict cytogenetic response, quantitative RT-PCR data obtained after 1 and 2 months of therapy were compared with cytogenetic response at 6 months. BCR-ABL/ABL ratios after 1 month were not predictive, but results after 2 months correlated with the consecutive cytogenetic response (P = 0.0008). The probability for a major cytogenetic response was significantly higher in patients with a BCR-ABL/ABL ratio <20% after 2 months of imatinib therapy. We conclude that: (1) quantitative determination of residual disease with real time RT-PCR is a reliable and sensitive method to monitor CML patients on imatinib therapy; (2) BCR-ABL/ABL ratios correlate well with cytogenetic response; (3) in IFN-pretreated patients all complete responders to imatinib have evidence of residual disease with the limited follow-up available; and (4) cytogenetic response at 6 months of therapy in CP patients is predictable with real time RT-PCR at 2 months.","['Merx, K', 'Muller, M C', 'Kreil, S', 'Lahaye, T', 'Paschka, P', 'Schoch, C', 'Weisser, A', 'Kuhn, C', 'Berger, U', 'Gschaidmeier, H', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Hochhaus, A']","['Merx K', 'Muller MC', 'Kreil S', 'Lahaye T', 'Paschka P', 'Schoch C', 'Weisser A', 'Kuhn C', 'Berger U', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A']","['III.

We have investigated the expression of the IL-11 receptor, IL-11Ralpha, protein in the human endometrium in vivo and the effects of IL-6, LIF and IL-11 on the production of metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokines by cultured endometrial epithelial and stromal cells. Immunostaining showed that IL-11Ralpha was expressed in both epithelial and stromal cells, with epithelial staining being more intense than stromal staining and little variation in staining in either compartment throughout the cycle. Incubation of both stromal and epithelial cells with IL-6, LIF and IL-11 had no effect on MMP-2, -7, -9, transforming growth factor (TGF)beta or IL-1beta production or cell growth. IL-6 and LIF also had no effect on tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha production, but IL-11 caused a dose-dependent decrease in TNFalpha production by epithelial cells. IL-6 receptor, LIF receptor and gp130 were all expressed by cultured stromal and epithelial cells, showing that the lack of effect is not due to lack of expression of the receptor components. The results show that although IL-6, LIF and IL-11 signal through the same molecule, they may have different effects in endometrial cells, suggesting the activation of different signalling pathways, which may ultimately be important in the control of endometrial function.","['Cork, B A', 'Tuckerman, E M', 'Li, T C', 'Laird, S M']","['Cork BA', 'Tuckerman EM', 'Li TC', 'Laird SM']","['Division of Biomedical Sciences/BMRC, Sheffield Hallam University, City Campus, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Endometrium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Interleukin-11/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2002/08/30 10:00,2003/03/05 04:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/molehr/8.9.841 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2002 Sep;8(9):841-8. doi: 10.1093/molehr/8.9.841.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL11RA protein, human)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heat stress has been shown to activate de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids, whereas in mammalian cells the sphingolipid ceramide has been implicated in the heat shock responses. In the current study, we found an increase in the ceramide mass of Molt-4 cells in response to heat shock, corroborating findings in HL-60 cells. Increased ceramide was determined to be from de novo biosynthesis by two major lines of evidence. First, the accumulation of ceramide was dependent upon the activities of both ceramide synthase and serine palmitoyltransferase. Second, pulse labeling studies demonstrated increased production of ceramide through the de novo biosynthetic pathway. Significantly, the de novo sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway was acutely induced upon heat shock, which resulted in a 2-fold increased flux in newly made ceramides within 1-2 min of exposure to 42.5 degrees C. Functionally, heat shock induced the dephosphorylation of the SR proteins, and this effect was demonstrated to be dependent upon the accumulation of de novo-produced ceramides. Thus, these studies disclose an evolutionary conserved activation of the de novo pathway in response to heat shock. Moreover, SR dephosphorylation is emerging as a specific downstream target of accumulation of newly made ceramides in mammalian cells.","['Jenkins, Gary M', 'Cowart, L Ashley', 'Signorelli, Paola', 'Pettus, Benjamin J', 'Chalfant, Charles E', 'Hannun, Yusuf A']","['Jenkins GM', 'Cowart LA', 'Signorelli P', 'Pettus BJ', 'Chalfant CE', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20020827,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/pharmacokinetics', 'Fumonisins/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Microsomes/metabolism', 'Mycotoxins/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Palmitic Acid/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'Sphingolipids/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/30 10:00,2003/02/07 04:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M207346200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71841-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Nov 8;277(45):42572-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M207346200.

A hematopoietic cell-specific adaptor protein, 3BP2, that was originally identified as an Abl SH3-binding protein was rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated by the aggregation of FcepsilonRI on rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2 did not depend on calcium influx from external sources. To examine the role of 3BP2 in mast cells, we overexpressed the SH2 domain of 3BP2 in the RBL-2H3 cells. Overexpression of 3BP2-SH2 domain resulted in a suppression of antigen-induced degranulation as assessed by beta-hexosaminidase release. Even though overall tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular protein was not altered, antigen-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) and calcium mobilization were significantly suppressed in the cells overexpressing the 3BP2-SH2 domain. Furthermore, antigen stimulation induced the association of 3BP2-SH2 domain with LAT and other signaling molecule complexes in the RBL-2H3 cells. FcepsilonRI-mediated phosphorylation of JNK and ERK was not affected by the overexpression of 3BP2-SH2 domain.

Hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmune phenomena are both often present in this disease. In contrast, humoral or cellular antitumor responses are rarely observed. It has been previously shown that antigens detected in patients with malignant diseases can provide information regarding intracellular molecules engaged in the transformation process and can identify tumor antigens that may be useful for development of immunotherapeutic strategies. Serologic identification by recombinant expression cloning (SEREX) has been demonstrated to be a useful method to detect tumor and tumor-associated antigens in a variety of malignancies. Although this approach is complicated in CLL, we used a modified SEREX approach and identified 14 antigens (KW-1 to KW-14) using this methodology. Several clones showed a restricted expression pattern in normal tissues. Moreover, distinctive expression of splice variants and aberrant gene expression in malignant tissue were detected. In this study, 6 antigens were detected exclusively in patients with CLL. Eight antigens were detected also in lymphoma patients. Healthy donors showed antibody responses against only 3 of the identified antigens. T cells with specific cytotoxicity against peptides derived from the 2 antigens tested could be generated from healthy donors. These findings demonstrate that humoral and cellular immune responses against CLL-associated antigens can be detected. Ongoing experiments investigate their potential for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies.","['Krackhardt, Angela M', 'Witzens, Mathias', 'Harig, Sabine', 'Hodi, F Stephen', 'Zauls, A Jason', 'Chessia, Morgan', 'Barrett, Patrick', 'Gribben, John G']","['Krackhardt AM', 'Witzens M', 'Harig S', 'Hodi FS', 'Zauls AJ', 'Chessia M', 'Barrett P', 'Gribben JG']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/immunology/metabolism', '*Autoantibodies', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Peptide Library', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tissue Distribution']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0513 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)51013-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 15;100(6):2123-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0513.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Peptide Library)']",,,['U01 CA 81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['GENBANK/AF432208', 'GENBANK/AF432209', 'GENBANK/AF432210', 'GENBANK/AF432211', 'GENBANK/AF432212', 'GENBANK/AF432213', 'GENBANK/AF432214', 'GENBANK/AF432215', 'GENBANK/AF432216', 'GENBANK/AF432217', 'GENBANK/AF432218', 'GENBANK/AF432219', 'GENBANK/AF432220', 'GENBANK/AF432221', 'GENBANK/AF432222']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Controlling alloreactivity to prevent GVHD while retaining GVL poses a true dilemma for the successful treatment of such malignancies. We reasoned that suicide gene therapy, which kills dividing cells expressing the thymidine kinase (TK) ""suicide"" gene using time-controlled administration of ganciclovir (GCV), might solve this dilemma. We have previously shown that after infusion of allogeneic TK T cells along with HSCT to an irradiated recipient, an early and short GCV treatment efficiently prevents GVHD by selectively eliminating alloreactive T cells while sparing nonalloreactive T cells, which can then contribute to immune reconstitution. Nevertheless, it remained to be established that this therapeutic strategy retained the desired GVL effect. Hypothesizing that a contained GVHR would be essential, we evaluated the GVL effect using different protocols of GCV administration. We were able to show that when the GCV treatment is initiated at, or close to, the time of grafting, GVHD is controlled but GVL is lost. In contrast, when the onset of GCV administration is delayed until day 6, a potent GVL effect is retained while GVHD is still controlled. These data emphasize that, by a time-optimized scheduling of the administration of GCV, this TK/GCV strategy can be tuned to efficiently treat malignant hemopathies.","['Litvinova, Elena', 'Maury, Sebastien', 'Boyer, Olivier', 'Bruel, Sylvie', 'Benard, Laurent', 'Boisserie, Gilbert', 'Klatzmann, David', 'Cohen, Jose L']","['Litvinova E', 'Maury S', 'Boyer O', 'Bruel S', 'Benard L', 'Boisserie G', 'Klatzmann D', 'Cohen JL']","[""Biologie et Therapeutique des Pathologies Immunitaires CNRS/UPMC UMR 7087, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, 83 boulevard de l'Hopital, F-75651 Paris Cedex 13, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Ganciclovir/administration & dosage', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control/therapy', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/transplantation', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0161 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50998-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 15;100(6):2020-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0161.,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In light of the long-term data, guidelines for follow-up of survivors of Hodgkin disease need to be redefined. In this study we attempt to analyze the long-term risks and temporal trends, identify patient- and treatment-related risk factors, and determine the prognosis of patients who develop a second malignancy after radiation treatment with or without chemotherapy for Hodgkin disease. Among 1319 patients with clinical stage I-IV Hodgkin disease, 181 second malignancies and 18 third malignancies were observed. With a median follow-up of 12 years, the relative risk (RR) and absolute excess risk of second malignancy were 4.6 and 89.3/10 000 person-years. The RR was significantly higher with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy (6.1) than with radiation therapy alone (4.0, P =.015). The risk increased with increasing radiation field size (P =.03) in patients who received combined modality therapy, and with time after Hodgkin disease. After 15 and 20 years, there was a 2.3% and 4.0% excess risk of second malignancy per person per year. The 5-year survival after development of a second malignancy was 38.1%, with the worst prognosis seen after acute leukemia and lung cancer. The excess risk of second malignancy after Hodgkin disease continues to be increased after 15 to 20 years, and there does not appear to be a plateau. Our analysis suggests that the risk may be reduced with smaller radiation fields, as are used in current trials of abbreviated chemotherapy and limited-field radiation therapy.","['Ng, Andrea K', 'Bernardo, M V Patricia', 'Weller, Edie', 'Backstrand, Kendall', 'Silver, Barbara', 'Marcus, Karen C', 'Tarbell, Nancy J', 'Stevenson, Mary Ann', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W', 'Mauch, Peter M']","['Ng AK', 'Bernardo MV', 'Weller E', 'Backstrand K', 'Silver B', 'Marcus KC', 'Tarbell NJ', 'Stevenson MA', 'Friedberg JW', 'Mauch PM']","[""Department of Radiation Oncology and the Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0634 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50994-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 15;100(6):1989-96. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0634.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook a retrospective cohort study of children with ALL treated on Children's Cancer Group therapeutic protocols to determine outcomes by racial and ethnic backgrounds of patients treated with contemporary risk-based therapy. In total, 8447 children (white, n = 6703; Hispanic, n = 1071; black, n = 506; and Asian, n = 167) with newly diagnosed ALL between 1983 and 1995 were observed for a median of 6.5 years. Analysis of disease outcome was measured as overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) and was adjusted for known predictors of outcome including clinical features, disease biology, socioeconomic status, and treatment era (1983-1989 vs 1989-1995). There was a statistically significant difference in survival by ethnicity (P <.001). Five-year EFS rates were: Asian, 75.1% +/- 3.5%; white, 72.8% +/- 0.6%; Hispanic, 65.9% +/- 1.5%; and black, 61.5% +/- 2.2%. Multivariate analysis revealed that when compared with white children, black and Hispanic children had worse outcomes and Asian children had better outcomes after adjusting for known risk factors. The poorer outcomes among black children were most apparent among patients with standard-risk features (relative risk [RR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.5), whereas poorer outcomes in Hispanic children (RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6) were most evident among patients with high-risk features.

However, to date only modest clinical success has been achieved manipulating the NK cell compartment in patients with malignant disease. Progress in the field of NK cell receptors has revolutionized our concept of how NK cells selectively recognize and lyse tumor and virally infected cells while sparing normal cells. Major families of cell surface receptors that inhibit and activate NK cells to lyse target cells have been characterized, including killer cell immunoglobulinlike receptors (KIRs), C-type lectins, and natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs). Further, identification of NK receptor ligands and their expression on normal and transformed cells completes the information needed to begin development of rational clinical approaches to manipulating receptor/ligand interactions for clinical benefit. Indeed, clinical data suggest that mismatch of NK receptors and ligands during allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may be used to prevent leukemia relapse. Here, we review how NK cell receptors control natural cytotoxicity and novel approaches to manipulating NK receptor-ligand interactions for the potential benefit of patients with cancer.","['Farag, Sherif S', 'Fehniger, Todd A', 'Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Velardi, Andrea', 'Caligiuri, Michael A']","['Farag SS', 'Fehniger TA', 'Ruggeri L', 'Velardi A', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Ohio State University, A433A Starling Loving Hall, 320 W Tenth Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. farag-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0350 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50987-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 15;100(6):1935-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0350.,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",134,,"['CA 65670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the effect of 5-LOX or 12-LOX inhibitors on human breast cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as the possible mechanisms were investigated. The LOX inhibitors, NDGA, Rev-5901, and baicalein all inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in MCF-7 (ER+) and MDA-MB-231 (ER-) breast cancer cell in vitro. In contrast, the LOX products, 5-HETE and 12-HETE had mitogenic effects, stimulating the proliferation of both cell lines. These inhibitors also induced cytochrome c release, caspase-9 activation, as well as downstream caspase-3, caspase-7 activation, and PARP cleavage. LOX inhibitor treatment also reduced the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and increased the levels of the pro-apoptotic protein bax. In conclusion, blockade of both 5-LOX and 12-LOX pathways induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells through the cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation, with changes in the levels of Bcl-2 family proteins.","['Tong, Wei-Gang', 'Ding, Xian-Zhong', 'Adrian, Thomas E']","['Tong WG', 'Ding XZ', 'Adrian TE']","['Department of Surgery, Gastrointestinal Oncology Laboratories, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic Acid/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Chemotactic Factors/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/pharmacology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Mitogens', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/10/12 04:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/12 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X02020144 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02014-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Aug 30;296(4):942-8. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02014-4.,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '467RNW8T91 (5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid)', '59985-28-3 (12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,['P50 CA 72712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TTP was defined as the simultaneous occurrence of red cell fragmentation, laboratory findings of haemolysis, red cell transfusion requirement and de novo or persistent thrombocytopenia caused by consumption, in the absence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Forty-five centres reported all patients (n = 406) transplanted between July and December 1996. Twenty-three patients developed TTP; the risk of developing TTP was 6.7% at 2 years (95% CI: 4.1% to 9.3%). The median time of onset was 44 d (range 13-319) post transplantation. Significant risk factors for the development of TTP were female gender (P = 0.005) and an unrelated donor (P = 0.046). To treat TTP, cyclosporin administration was discontinued in 10 cases, plasma exchanges were performed in five cases and 12 patients received plasma infusions without plasma exchange. TTP resolved in 13 of the 23 patients (57%). The only factor predictive of resolution of TTP was the absence of nephropathy. Seven patients (30%) were alive at follow-up of 38-45 months from the onset of TTP. Sixteen patients died; the causes were multiple, only three patients had TTP as a central factor. The median time to death was 41 d (range 1-762 d) from the onset of TTP.

It is the purpose of this paper to stimulate further research in this area. The sex rate ratios are presented for the commoner haematological malignancies. The male excess in the lymphoid cancers is most marked in the youngest age group in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease, while acute lymphoblastic leukaemia shows equal sex ratios in the childhood peak. Both chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphocytic lymphoma display an unusual pattern, hitherto undescribed, with a large male excess specific to the 40s and 60s age groups. The myeloid sex ratios are all characterized by slight female excess in early adulthood followed by marked male excess. The reasons for these patterns are discussed.","['Cartwright, Ray A', 'Gurney, Karen A', 'Moorman, Anthony V']","['Cartwright RA', 'Gurney KA', 'Moorman AV']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Leeds, Leeds, UK. p.a.pickles@leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Risk', '*Sex', 'Sex Distribution']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['3750 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03750.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Sep;118(4):1071-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03750.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients received a combination of mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2/d) and etoposide (100 mg/m2/d) together with cytosine arabinoside (1 g/m2 b.i.d) for 4 d. Overall, 39 patients (47%) achieved a second CP (CP2)/partial remission (PR). Responding patients < 65 years were eligible for ablative chemotherapy followed by an allogeneic (SCT) or a double autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Seventeen of 34 responders < 65 years failed to proceed to transplantation as a result of early disease progression (n = 15) or disease-related complications (n = 2). The remaining 17 patients underwent SCT (n = 9; including four unrelated donor SCT) or ASCT (n = 8). Only one of the eight ASCT patients had a second ASCT; the remaining seven failed because of progression (n = 5) or hypoplasia (n = 2). The median duration of CP2/PR was 6 months (range 1-72 months). Five patients achieved a longer CP2/PR than CP1. The 1 year survival was 70% for SCT/ASCT patients (median survival 21 months), 50% for responding patients overall, but only 7% for non-responders (P < 0.001). Three SCT/ASCT patients are long-term survivors (65+, 66+ and 73+ months). In conclusion, approximately half of the patients achieved a CP2/PR after intensive chemotherapy, with a clear survival advantage for responders vs non-responders.

The highest WT1 expression was observed in the primitive CD34+ rhodamine-123 (rho) dull cells, both in healthy donors and MDS or sAML patients. In contrast to normal CD34-negative bone marrow cells, WT1 was present in CD34-negative bone marrow cells in 12 out of 13 MDS patients and two sAML samples. Further analysis of this aberrant WT1 expression was performed in the CD34-negative subfractions of three MDS patients. In one of these, WT1 expression was found exclusively in the erythroid cells. This patient was completely transfusion dependent and showed morphological dyserythropoiesis. In another MDS patient, WT1 expression was found in a non-erythroid compartment.

During the diagnostic screening of the TAL-1 deletion in 176 T-ALL patients, we identified one case showing a new SIL rearrangement. A novel fusion transcript was identified between the SIL exon 1a and an unknown sequence (633-cDNA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening of a human cDNA library confirmed the existence of this transcript. Using long-distance PCR on patient DNA, we obtained a genomic fragment containing SIL exon 1b, a portion of intron 1b, an unknown sequence and the 633 sequence. Using DNA from healthy donors, a partial genomic map of 633-DNA was found to be identical to the restriction map of the PCR fragment amplified from patient DNA. To define the chromosomal origin of 633-DNA, a YAC human genomic library was screened. Two clones containing 633-DNA were found, mapping to chromosomal region 1p32 and both contained SIL and TAL-1 sequences. By searching GenBank, we identified PAC RP1-18D14 which contains SIL, TAL-1 and 633-DNA, confirming this novel rearrangement as a new deletion of the SIL/TAL-1 locus.","['Carlotti, Emanuela', 'Pettenella, Francesca', 'Amaru, Ricardo', 'Slater, Sarah', 'Lister, T Andrew', 'Barbui, Tiziano', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Biondi, Andrea']","['Carlotti E', 'Pettenella F', 'Amaru R', 'Slater S', 'Lister TA', 'Barbui T', 'Basso G', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Rambaldi A', 'Biondi A']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedali Riuniti Bergamo, Clinica paediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale S.

Fifty-five infants were assigned to different treatment programs (from December 1995 to December 1998) on the basis of their MLL gene status at diagnosis. Forty-two cases (76.3%) had a rearranged MLL gene (MLL+) and were treated with remission induction therapy followed by sequential intensive chemotherapy, including multiple genotoxic agents (MLL9601 protocol). Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was attempted if suitable donors were available. Thirteen infants (23.7%) were classified as MLL- and treated for 2.5 years with intensive chemotherapy for high-risk B-ALL (MLL9602 protocol). Complete remission was induced in 38 of the 42 infants (90.5%) with MLL+ ALL and in all 13 patients (100%) with MLL- disease. In the MLL+ subgroup, the estimated event-free survival (EFS) rate at 3 years post diagnosis was 34.0% +/- 7.5%, compared with 92.3% +/- 7.4% in the MLL- subgroup (overall comparison, P = 0.001 by log-rank analysis).

These findings indicate a strategic advantage in classifying infant ALL as either MLL+ or MLL- early in the clinical course and selecting therapy accordingly. Standard chemotherapy for high-risk B-lineage ALL appeared adequate for MLL- cases.

Similarly, prognostic information may be gained from the extent of angiogenesis in these tumours.

We retrospectively investigated 82 bone marrow trephine biopsies from 41 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) at diagnosis and following treatment. Nine normal bone marrow trephines from age-matched children were also analysed as controls. The microvessels were stained immunohistochemically with anti-Factor VIII-related antigen (antivWF) and antithrombomodulin (anti-THR). Angiogenesis was quantified manually by two independent observers and was highly reproducible (Pearson's r = 0.91). Staining with anti-vWF and anti-THR was highly specific for microvessels and thetwo stains closely correlated (r = 0.68). Microvessel densities (MVD) at presentation were significantly increased in the majority of patients in comparison with controls (P < 0.0001) and MVD dropped towards normal in remission (P < 0.0001). Of interest, the difference in total vessel counts between leukaemic and normal/remission marrows was contributed solely by small microvessels.

To better define the mechanisms related to low BCR expression, we have investigated transcription, protein synthesis, assembly and transport of the BCR in B-CLL cells. Our results demonstrated that: (1) there was no major defect in transcriptional expression of the B29 (CD79b) gene; (2) the BCR components were intracellularly detected, thus adequately synthesized, in almost all patients; (3) neither a genetic defect in the transmembrane region of SIg, which associated with CD79a/CD79b, nor a genetic abnormality in the chaperone protein calnexin that is involved in folding and assembly of the BCR were found; (4) a constant defect in the assembly of IgM and CD79b chains occurred leading to abnormal accumulation of both chains in different intracellular compartments; (5) in a majority of CLL patients all of the nascent IgM failed to be processed into mature chains and remained unsuitable for transport. These findings demonstrated that a post-transcriptional defect located at the BCR intracellular assembly and/or trafficking levels could be involved in its low surface expression in B-CLL.","['Payelle-Brogard, Beatrice', 'Magnac, Christian', 'Alcover, Andres', 'Roux, Pascal', 'Dighiero, Guillaume']","['Payelle-Brogard B', 'Magnac C', 'Alcover A', 'Roux P', 'Dighiero G']","[""Unite d'Immuno-Hematologie et d'Immunopathologie, CNRS URA 1960, Paris, France. bbrogard@pasteur.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'Biological Transport', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Calnexin/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['3759 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03759.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Sep;118(4):976-85. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03759.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '139873-08-8 (Calnexin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we analysed 27 B-CLL peripheral blood samples by metaphase cytogenetics after CD40 ligand (CD40L)-induced cell cycle stimulation. In comparison with the simultaneous use of B-cell mitogens such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM), CD40L stimulation of B-CLL cells induced a threefold increase in metaphases amenable to analysis by conventional cytogenetics. The analysis of these metaphases confirmed all genetic abnormalities detected by FISH. Moreover, CD40L-enhanced cytogenetics revealed complex karyotypic aberrations in 11 out of 27 patients (41%).

Humanized 1D10 (Hu1D10; Remitogen) is among the antibodies that are currently under evaluation in phase II clinical trials in lymphoma patients. The 1D10 antibody is directed against a polymorphic epitope on the beta-chain of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II. We found expression of the 1D10 epitope on B cells and monocytes from approximately 50% of healthy donors. Analyses of 1D10 expression on malignant cells revealed that approximately half of the HLA class II-positive haematological malignancies expressed the 1D10 epitope. In whole blood antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays, Hu1D10 was more effective than rituxan in killing malignant ARH-77 B cells. Interestingly, Hu1D10-mediated lymphoma cell lysis was significantly enhanced when blood from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-treated patients was compared with blood from healthy controls. Analyses of the relevant effector cell populations revealed that FcgammaRI (CD64)-positive polymorphonuclear cells were critical for enhanced Hu1D10-mediated lymphoma killing during G-CSF therapy, while the same effector cell population induced only marginal lysis with rituxan. Furthermore, Hu1D10 was highly effective in inducing apoptosis in primary lymphoma cells from B chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. These preclinical results form the basis for a phase I/II clinical trial of Hu1D10 in combination with G-CSF.","['Stockmeyer, Bernhard', 'Schiller, Martin', 'Repp, Roland', 'Lorenz, Hanns-Martin', 'Kalden, Joachim R', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Valerius, Thomas']","['Stockmeyer B', 'Schiller M', 'Repp R', 'Lorenz HM', 'Kalden JR', 'Gramatzki M', 'Valerius T']","['Department of Medicine III, University of Erlangen - Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.

Primary indications for surgery were cytopenia(s) or autoimmune phenomena and progressive or refractory disease with splenomegaly. The spleens removed were on average larger in MCL (median 2.6 kg) than in CLL (1.0 kg). Splenectomy improved the blood counts in 62% of patients with MCL and 47% with stage C CLL, both with cytopenias. The MCL patients showed a decrease in the leucocytosis (medians 60.3-29.1 x 10(9)/l before and after splenectomy), whereas there was an increase in the leucocytosis in CLL (medians 24.2-44 x 10(9)/l). With a median follow up post splenectomy of 10 months (range: < 1-128), 18 patients (four MCL and 14 CLL) have not required further therapy for up to 66 months. We conclude that splenectomy is a useful treatment in MCL and advanced CLL for the correction of cytopenias, reducing the leucocyte count and allowing prolonged periods of clinical remission without therapy. Differences seen between MCL and CLL in spleen size, and in response of the leucocytosis suggest a central role for the spleen in the evolution of MCL with leukaemia.","['Ruchlemer, Rosa', 'Wotherspoon, Andrew C', 'Thompson, Jeremy N', 'Swansbury, John G', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Catovsky, Daniel']","['Ruchlemer R', 'Wotherspoon AC', 'Thompson JN', 'Swansbury JG', 'Matutes E', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden NHS Trust, London, UK. rosa@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/mortality/surgery', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/*surgery', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*complications/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Splenectomy/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/30 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['3716 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03716.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Sep;118(4):952-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03716.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coincidental development of leukaemia in children or adults with haemophilia is extremely rare, although cases of leukaemia and other malignancies have been reported previously in HIV-positive subjects. Of a total of 440 people with haemophilia registered with our society, two were diagnosed with acute leukaemia last year. The development of leukaemia in a subject with haemophilia has previously been reported from our country in 1985, but the negative HIV status of these recent cases is very interesting. The first case involved a 14-year-old boy with moderate haemophilia A, who developed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) [French-American-British (FAB) classification L2]. The second subject was a 16-year-old boy who had moderately severe haemophilia A with no previous family history, and developed acute nonlymphocytic (myelomonocytic) leukaemia (FAB-M4). Both patients received conventional chemotherapy and this report discusses the potential problems in management of such cases, including diagnosis and administration of chemotherapy in subjects with a pre-existing haemorrhagic disorder. Extensive cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, as well as bleeds in joints previously affected by haemarthrosis and alterations of haematological values were all initially suggestive of the development of inhibitors against factor VIII, but the appearance of blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow led to the definitive diagnosis. The risk of bleeding, due to the combination of both leukaemia and the consequences of the chemotherapy, was overcome by the administration of coagulation factor concentrates (daily initially followed by prophylactic doses after successful induction of remission in both patients). The young patient with ALL is now receiving the maintenance phase of the Children's Cancer Study Group 1961 protocol and is in the 15th month of follow-up, without any complications. The other case relapsed in the seventh month, developing enterobacter sepsis, and died. An important lesson to be learnt from these cases is that the possible diagnosis of leukaemia should not be overlooked in a patient with haemophilia and severe haemorrhagic problems, if the first-line differential diagnosis of inhibitor development against factor VIII (or IX) has been excluded.","['Zulfikar, B']",['Zulfikar B'],"['Institute of Oncology, University of Istanbul, The Hemophilia Society of Turkey, Istanbul, Turkey. bzilfikar@turkhemoder.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Haemophilia,Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia,9442916,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Cost of Illness', '*Developing Countries', 'Fatal Outcome', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'Hemophilia A/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Turkey']",2002/08/30 10:00,2003/04/18 05:00,['2002/08/30 10:00'],"['2002/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [medline]', '2002/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['660 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2516.2002.00660.x [doi]']",ppublish,Haemophilia. 2002 Sep;8(5):698-702. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2516.2002.00660.x.,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These methods have proved to be informative in estimating exceedance of basic restrictions prescribed by exposure guideline organizations. To date, the analyses have been conducted with a resolution on the order of millimeters. However, these techniques have future roles to play at higher levels of resolution at those sites in target tissues suspected of transducing local electric fields into biological responses. Two specific cases in which high resolution ""microdosimetry"" would yield value involve (a) residential settings and childhood leukemia and (b) worker exposure and cardiovascular disease. Recent research suggests that residential contact currents on the order of microamperes can produce biologically significant dose (expressed as the local electric field) to the bone marrow of a child. Microdosimetry would focus on pluripotent progenitor cells resident in the marrow compartment, as well as anatomic features that distinguish a child's from an adult's marrow. Laboratory and epidemiologic research has suggested that magnetic field exposure may affect heart rate variability, a measure reflective of autonomic nervous system control of cardiac activity. Given the physical attributes of the central nervous system and the sites that could serve as substrates for field interactions, future microdosimetry addressing heart rate variability effects may be well-advised to focus on the electrically excitable dendritic arborizations of neurons.

In acute infection (up to day 30 post infection (p.i.)) the number of CD8+ T cells increased, reaching a maximum at day 11 p.i.

A similar increase in the number of these cells was observed at day 730 p. i.

Here it is proposed that human lymphocytic tumors can be categorized based on the propensity and capacity of the tumor cells to undergo apoptosis. The first category is defined by malignant cells that are resistant to apoptosis due to expression of anti-apoptotic factors such as bcl-2 and cellular inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). These tumors would include CLL and follicular lymphomas, as well as some malignancies in which the tumor cells are infected by viruses that co-opt cell survival pathways, such as human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV)-1. The second category, in which the malignant cells are apoptosis-prone, would include tumors arising in the context of impaired cytotoxic T-cell function. These neoplasms would include some human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related lymphomas such as Burkitt's lymphoma, and post-transplantation lymphomas. The third category would include neoplasms of intermediate sensitivity to apoptosis, some of which are associated with infection such as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas of the stomach. Although this classification is tentative, it should evolve in parallel with our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms in lymphoid neoplasia, and provides a novel framework with which to consider the appropriateness of specific therapeutic strategies. Distinctions among lymphocytic tumors in terms of the likelihood of response to therapies such as antisense to bcl-2 related proteins, inhibitors of NF-kappa B activity, and new approaches aimed at bolstering the host's immune response, would cross standard classifications based on the T or B-cell origin of the tumor cells.","['Schattner, Elaine J']",['Schattner EJ'],"['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Room C-640, Weill Medical College, USA. ejsch@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infections', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/*physiopathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/physiology']",2002/08/29 10:00,2002/09/12 10:01,['2002/08/29 10:00'],"['2002/08/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1081/cnv-120002951 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2002;20(5-6):737-48. doi: 10.1081/cnv-120002951.,,117,,,,,['Cancer Invest. 2003 Apr;21(2):331'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, we have the opportunity to link these accumulating data to the drug discovery processes. Our previous efforts at 'information-intensive' molecular pharmacology have focused on the relationship between patterns of gene expression and patterns of drug activity. In the present study, we take the process a step further-relating gene expression patterns, not just to the drugs as entities, but to approximately 27,000 substructures and other chemical features within the drugs. This coupling of genomic information with structure-based data mining can be used to identify classes of compounds for which detailed experimental structure-activity studies may be fruitful. Using a systematic substructure analysis coupled with statistical correlations of compound activity with differential gene expression, we have identified two subclasses of quinones whose patterns of activity in the National Cancer Institute's 60-cell line screening panel (NCI-60) correlate strongly with the expression patterns of particular genes: (i) The growth inhibitory patterns of an electron-withdrawing subclass of benzodithiophenedione-containing compounds over the NCI-60 are highly correlated with the expression patterns of Rab7 and other melanoma-specific genes; (ii) the inhibitory patterns of indolonaphthoquinone-containing compounds are highly correlated with the expression patterns of the hematopoietic lineage-specific gene HS1 and other leukemia genes. As illustrated by these proof-of-principle examples, we introduce here a set of conceptual tools and fluent computational methods for projecting directly from gene expression patterns to drug substructures and vice versa. The analysis is presented in terms of the NCI-60 cell lines and microarray-based gene expression patterns, but the concept and methods are broadly applicable to other large-scale pharmacogenomic database sets as well. The approach (SAT for Structure-Activity-Target) provides a systematic way to mine databases for the design of further structure-activity studies, particularly to aid in target and lead identification.","['Blower, P E', 'Yang, C', 'Fligner, M A', 'Verducci, J S', 'Yu, L', 'Richman, S', 'Weinstein, J N']","['Blower PE', 'Yang C', 'Fligner MA', 'Verducci JS', 'Yu L', 'Richman S', 'Weinstein JN']","['Leadscope Inc, Columbus, OH 43212, USA.

Semaphorins also play a role in other processes such as immune regulation and tumorigenesis. However, the molecular signaling mechanisms downstream of plexin receptors have not been elucidated. Semaphorin 4D is the ligand for the plexin-B1 receptor and stimulation of the plexin-B1 receptor activates the small GTPase RhoA. Using the intracellular domain of plexin-B1 as an affinity ligand, two Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors, leukemia-associated Rho GEF (LARG; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 homology (PDZ)-RhoGEF, were isolated from mouse brain as plexin-B1-specific interacting proteins. LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF contain several functional domains, including a PDZ domain. Biochemical characterizations showed that the PDZ domain of LARG is directly involved in the interaction with the carboxy-terminal sequence of plexin-B1. Mutation of either the PDZ domain in LARG or the PDZ binding site in plexin-B1 eliminates the interaction. The interaction between plexin-B1 and LARG is specific for the PDZ domain of LARG and LARG does not interact with plexin-A1. A LARG-interaction defective mutant of the plexin-B1 receptor was created and was unable to stimulate RhoA activation.

The study covered 57 patients, 26 of whom were receiving treatment. Burkitt's lymphoma was the most common type of malignant blood disease encountered (33%). The proportion of men was slightly higher, at 54%, and the average age of patients was 26. Hyperleucocytosis, anaemia and medullar blastosis were the most common blood disorders. The tumours arising from hyperleucocytosis and medullar blastosis caused increases in proteins from inflammatory reaction. The increase was moderate for alpha 1 globulins and haptoglobin and high (at least twice the reference levels) for C Reactive Protein (CRP) and orosomucoid. Full remission was only achieved in the cases of Burkitt's lymphoma, in which the haematological and biochemical parameters reached near-normal levels following treatment. In cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia the treatment lowered the hyperleucocytosis but the high rate of CRP might indicate that the disease was reaching a more acute phase. In the cases of acute leukaemia, chemotherapy did not achieve full remission: the alpha 1 globulins, including orosomucoids, were the most sensitive proteins to treatment. Even though the rate of CRP was lowered, it remained high in all cases of acute leukaemia. Neither haematological nor biochemical data proved superior to the other in monitoring the effectiveness of the treatment or the gradual return of the disease. It would be beneficial to combine them in order to obtain a clearer assessment of the effectiveness of chemotherapy.","['Sawadogo, Duni', 'Lartey, Marie-Therese', 'Kouassi, Dinard', 'Nacoulma, William', 'Monet, Daguy', 'Sangare, Amadou']","['Sawadogo D', 'Lartey MT', 'Kouassi D', 'Nacoulma W', 'Monet D', 'Sangare A']","[""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Faculte de pharmacie, Universite de Cocody-Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. education@globeaccess.net""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,Sante,"Sante (Montrouge, France)",9212437,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', ""Cote d'Ivoire"", 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/28 10:00,2002/10/31 04:00,['2002/08/28 10:00'],"['2002/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/31 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sante. 2002 Apr-Jun;12(2):229-32.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",,,,,Impact de la chimiotherapie sur les profils hematologiques et biochimiques au cours des hemopathies malignes a Abidjan (Cote d'lvoire).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), patients with Ph-positive ALL usually demonstrate expression of a truncated version of the BCR-ABL protein called p190bcr-abl. Irrespective of age and breakpoint location, Ph-positive ALL carries a poor prognosis. Although remission rates are identical to those of Ph-negative ALL, relapse is almost universal and long-term survival remains rare. Given the poor outcome with current chemotherapy consolidation programs, stem cell transplantation is usually recommended for these patients in first remission or as soon as feasible. Even with transplantation the impact on outcome is limited and new therapeutic concepts are urgently needed. One of the most promising developments in recent years has been the introduction of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as STI571.

In large multicenter studies remission rates range from 75% to 89%, and long-term leukemia-free survival (LFS) from 28% to 39%. Major progress has also been made regarding better characterization of subtypes of ALL. Complete diagnostic procedures are essential to identify these subtypes which have significant differences in clinical and laboratory features and prognosis. LFS of > 50% can be expected in favorable subtypes such as T-ALL or mature B-ALL, while LFS of < 20% is expected in Ph/BCR-ABL positive ALL. Prognostic factors can be used for risk stratification and selection of treatment strategies can be adapted to the subtype and relapse risk. This includes measurement of minimal residual disease (MRD) to evaluate individualized treatment strategies adapted to the molecular response. Several new approaches for improvement in chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation (SCT) are under investigation. They include the use of intensified anthracyclines, asparaginase, cyclophosphamide or high-dose cytarabine during induction and intensive rotational chemotherapy during consolidation. Also SCT - mainly from sibling donors - is now part of standard treatment of de novo ALL, although it remains open whether indications should be based on prognostic factors or whether SCT should be offered to all patients with sibling donor. However, substantial progress can only be achieved by new, experimental strategies. These include new approaches for SCT, such as nonmyeloablative SCT, measurement of MRD, causal treatment with molecular targeting, e.g. with kinase inhibitors, and antibody therapy.","['Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Hoelzer, Dieter']","['Gokbuget N', 'Hoelzer D']","['J.W.

Outcome is related to the number of chromosomes. For example, high hyperdiploidy (51-65 chromosomes) is associated with a good prognosis, whereas patients with near haploidy (23-29 chromosomes) have a poor outcome. The discovery of recurring chromosomal abnormalities in the leukemic blasts of patients with ALL has identified a large number of genes involved in leukemogenesis. Certain specific genetic changes are related to prognosis. The ETV6/AML1 fusion arising from the translocation (t12;21) (p13;q22) has been associated with a good outcome; the BCR/ABL fusion of (t9;22)(q34;q11), rearrangements of the MLL gene, and abnormalities of the short arm of chromosomes 9 involving the tumor suppressor genes p16INK4A have a poor prognosis. Unfortunately, the classification of patients into prognostic groups based on cytogenetics is not always as predicted. Even when other clinically based risk factors are taken into account, some patients with good-risk cytogenetic features will relapse. In the search for new measures of prognosis, it has recently emerged that the level of minimal residual disease following induction therapy can be a reliable predictor of outcome in ALL.","['Harrison, Christine J', 'Foroni, Letizia']","['Harrison CJ', 'Foroni L']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Cytogenetics Group, Cancer Sciences Division, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK. harrison@soton.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Italy,Rev Clin Exp Hematol,Reviews in clinical and experimental hematology,9815344,IM,,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/*genetics']",2002/08/28 10:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2002/08/28 10:00'],"['2002/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['69 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1468-0734.2002.00069.x [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Clin Exp Hematol. 2002 Jun;6(2):91-113; discussion 200-2. doi: 10.1046/j.1468-0734.2002.00069.x.,,156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The core binding site on DNA identified in these studies, 5'-GGCCGG-3' (upper strand), is highly related to the canonical GC box and was bound by a CTIP1 oligomeric complex(es) in vitro. Furthermore, both CTIP1 and CTIP2 repressed transcription of a reporter gene harbouring a multimerized CTIP binding site, and this repression was neither reversed by trichostatin A (an inhibitor of known class I and II histone deacetylases) nor stimulated by co-transfection of a COUP-TF family member. These results demonstrate that CTIP1 is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein and a bona fide transcriptional repressor that is capable of functioning independently of COUP-TF family members.

Haematological malignancies, because of the relative accessibility of the malignant cell in blood and bone marrow and the understanding of haemopoietic lineage-specific antigens, have provided a successful testing ground for this therapy. There have been many technical developments which have allowed the safe delivery of more potent antibody constructs. The development of human or chimeric antibodies has largely overcome the problems associated with host immune responses to rodent-derived MAbs. Protein engineering to combine MAbs with other biologically active molecules such as radioisotopes, toxins, chemotherapy and cytokines, has made available a new range of agents with clinical activity. The purpose of this review is not to give a catalogue of all therapeutic antibodies but rather to outline the principles of this approach, the current state of knowledge, and possible directions for future development. First, the general requirements and strategies for use of both unmodified and conjugated MAbs are discussed, followed by a summary of the trial data in specific lymphoid and myeloid haemopoietic malignancies. The focus is on MAbs that now have an accepted use in clinical practice, with some discussion of newer MAbs under development.

In a country with a high prevalence of tuberculosis such as Turkey, most people have inactive tuberculous lesions and tuberculin test positivity. Therefore, a prospective study was carried out to investigate the frequency of tuberculosis reactivation in patients with a malignancy. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with a malignancy and undergoing diagnostic fiberoptic bronchoscopy were enrolled in the study during a 2-year period (1993-1995). Bronchoscopic biopsies and cytologic materials were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, bronchial washings, and pre- and postbronchoscopic sputum specimens were also evaluated for acid-fast bacilli. A diagnosis of tuberculosis was based on smear and/or culture positivity for acid-fast bacilli. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 56.2 +/- 13.6 years, with a male/female ratio of 69/4. The biopsy proven malignancies were as follows: primary lung carcinoma (n = 66, 90.4%), lymphoma (n = 5, 6.8%), metastatic breast adenocarcinoma (n = 1, 1.4%), and acute myelocytic leukemia (n = 1, 1.4%). Thirty-one of all patients had findings compatible with tuberculosis on radiology. The sputa and bronchial washing specimens were smear negative in all patients. Acid-fast bacilli were grown on culture in 6 patients (8%) (primary lung cancer, n = 5; non-Hodgkin lymphoma, n = 1). Four of these 6 patients had positive radiology for tuberculosis. These subjects were treated with a three- or four-drug anti-tuberculosis regimen. Two months later, smears remained acid-fast bacilli negative, or no bacilli were grown on culture. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of coexisting tuberculosis should be kept in mind in patients with a malignancy, especially those with lung carcinoma in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. Pulmonary infections encountered in such patients should raise the suspicion of tuberculosis reactivation, and in addition to direct microscopic evaluation, sputum specimens and materials obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy should be cultivated for tuberculosis. Three-four-drug anti-tuberculosis regimens should be given, especially in countries with high drug-resistance rates for eradicating tuberculosis.","['Karnak, Demet', 'Kayacan, Oya', 'Beder, Sumru']","['Karnak D', 'Kayacan O', 'Beder S']","['Ankara University Medical Faculty, Department of Chest Diseases and Tuberculosis, 06100 Cebeci, Ankara, Turkey. karnak@dialup.ankara.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/complications', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/microbiology', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lung Neoplasms/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*isolation & purification', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Sputum/microbiology', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",2002/08/28 10:00,2002/10/12 04:00,['2002/08/28 10:00'],"['2002/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/12 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 2002 May-Jun;88(3):251-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to examine the risk of leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and multiple myeloma associated with occupational exposure to animals. METHODS: We used data from a multi-site, population-based case-control study using mailed questionnaires which had taken place in eight of ten Canadian provinces, during 1994-1998. There were 1023 leukemia cases, 1577 NHL cases, and 324 multiple myeloma cases (all histologically confirmed) and 4688 population-based controls. Animal-related occupations were identified from a lifetime occupational history. Subjects in animal-related jobs were compared with others using logistic regression for the risk of leukemia, NHL, and multiple myeloma. RESULTS: Compared to subjects without occupational exposure to animals, occupational exposure to beef cattle increased the risks of leukemia (odds ratio (OR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-3.3) and NHL (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9). No other animal exposure was consistently associated with risk of lymphohematopoietic cancer. An unexpected protective association was observed between work as a fisherman and leukemia (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) and NHL (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: This population-based case-control study found that those individuals working in occupations associated with beef cattle are at increased risk for developing leukemia and lymphoma while those working in occupations requiring the handling of fish are at decreased risk of leukemia and lymphoma.","['Fritschi, Lin', 'Johnson, Kenneth C', 'Kliewer, Erich V', 'Fry, Rick']","['Fritschi L', 'Johnson KC', 'Kliewer EV', 'Fry R']","['Department of Public Health, University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, 6009, Australia. linf@dph.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology"", 'Animals', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2002/08/28 10:00,2003/01/18 04:00,['2002/08/28 10:00'],"['2002/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/18 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1016331128897 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2002 Aug;13(6):563-71. doi: 10.1023/a:1016331128897.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Canadian Cancer Registries Epidemiology Research Group'],,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of interventional radiologic techniques in diagnosing specific hematologic malignancies in children. METHODS: During a 4-year period, 22 patients (16 male, 6 female; median age, 13 years) underwent 25 percutaneous biopsies, 6 fluid aspirations, 3 catheter drainages, and 1 needle localization for diagnosing suspected hematologic malignancy. RESULTS: For Hodgkin's disease, the procedures yielded 6 true-positive (TP) results, 2 true-negative (TN) results, and 2 false-negative (FN) results; for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 14 TP results, 1 TN result, and 3 FN results; and for leukemia, 4 TP results and 3 FN results. Percutaneous biopsies yielded 16 TP results, 3 TN results, and 6 FN results. Aspirations and drainages yielded 8 TP results and 1 FN result. The one needle localization yielded a FN result. Overall sensitivity was 75%+/-7.3%; specificity, 100%; and accuracy, 77%+/-7.1%. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous biopsy of lymphoma is usually diagnostic. Drainage or aspiration of a fluid collection associated with NHL or leukemia is often diagnostic and is less invasive than biopsy.

Furthermore, quantitative solution hybridization and Northern blot analysis show the differential regulation of c-fos mRNA levels by interleukin-6 (8.1 and 4.0 folds) and leukemia inhibitory factor (5.4 and 3.2 folds) in C6 and astrocyte cultures (respectively). However, interferon gamma increases in c-fos mRNA levels (2.9 fold in both C6 and astrocyte cultures) were not significant in a one way ANOVA.

The present study assesses the effect of hydroxytyrosol, a major antioxidant compound of virgin olive oil, on proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle of tumour cells. Hydroxytyrosol inhibited proliferation of both human promyelocytic leukaemia cells HL60 and colon adenocarcinoma cells HT29 and HT29 clone 19A. The con-centrations of hydroxytyrosol which inhibited 50% of cell proliferation were approximately 50 and approximately 750 micromol/l for HL60 and both HT29 and HT29 clone 19A cells, respectively. At concentrations ranging from 50 to 100 micromol/l, hydroxytyrosol induced an appreciable apoptosis in HL60 cells after 24 h of incubation as evidenced by flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, no effect on apoptosis was observed after similar treatment of freshly isolated human lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells. The DNA cell cycle analysis, quantified by flow cytometry, showed that the treatment of HL60 cells with hydroxytyrosol 50-100 micromol/l arrested the cells in the G0/G1 phase with a concomitant decrease in the cell percentage in the S and G2/M phases. These results support the hypothesis that hydroxytyrosol may exert a protective activity against cancer by arresting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis in tumour cells, and suggest that hydroxytyrosol, an important component of virgin olive oil, may be responsible for its anticancer activity.","['Fabiani, R', 'De Bartolomeo, A', 'Rosignoli, P', 'Servili, M', 'Montedoro, G F', 'Morozzi, G']","['Fabiani R', 'De Bartolomeo A', 'Rosignoli P', 'Servili M', 'Montedoro GF', 'Morozzi G']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biochimiche e Biotecnologie Molecolari, Sezione di Scienze Igienistiche e Ambientali, Universita di Perugia, Via del Giochetto, 06126 Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/pathology/*prevention & control', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Olive Oil', 'Phenylethyl Alcohol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Plant Oils/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/27 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/08/27 10:00'],"['2002/08/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00008469-200208000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 2002 Aug;11(4):351-8. doi: 10.1097/00008469-200208000-00006.,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Olive Oil)', '0 (Plant Oils)', '10597-60-1 (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol)', 'ML9LGA7468 (Phenylethyl Alcohol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cloning of these translocation breakpoints has provided important insights into pathogenesis of disease as well as novel therapeutic approaches. Chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML) are caused by constitutively activated tyrosine kinases, such as BCR/ABL, that confer a proliferative and survival advantage to hematopoietic progenitors but do not affect differentiation. These activated kinases are validated targets for therapy with selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors, a paradigm that may have broad applications in treatment of hematologic malignancies as well as solid tumors. Chromosomal translocations in acute myeloid leukemias (AML) most often result in loss-of-function mutations in transcription factors that are required for normal hematopoietic development. These latter mutations, however, are not sufficient to cause AML. The available evidence indicates that activating mutations in the hematopoietic tyrosine kinases FLT3 and c-KIT, and in N-RAS and K-RAS, confer proliferative advantage to hematopoietic progenitors and cooperate with loss-of-function mutations in hematopoietic transcription factors to cause an acute leukemia phenotype characterized by proliferation and impaired differentiation.

We have shown previously that MR and GR can form heterodimers that inhibit transcription from a glucocorticoid (GC)-responsive gene and that this inhibition was mediated by the N-terminal domain (NTD) of MR. In this report, we examined the effect of NTD-MR on GC-induced apoptosis in the GC-sensitive pre-B lymphoma cell line, 697. In GC-treated 697 cells, we demonstrated that stable expression of NTD-MR blocks apoptosis and inhibits proteolytic processing of pro-caspases-3, -8, and -9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Importantly, gel shift and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed a direct association between the GR and amino acids 203-603 of NTD-MR. We observed down-regulation of c-Myc and of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bfl-1 as well as high levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bid. Conversely, cells stably expressing NTD-MR exhibited increased expression of Bcl-2 and Bfl-1 and diminished levels of Bid and Bax.

METHODS: Mouse acute lymphcytic leukemia P388 cells were cultured. with 1.0 micro mol/L thasone (DXM) hours. Then Cytosine arabinoside Ara-C), cyclophosphamide Cy , and etoposide VP16 , of different concentrations were added into the cultures. Twelve hours later, the apoptosis induced by these drugs in P388 cells was analysed by TdT-mediated kappa-dUTP nick and end labeling (Tunel) and DNA electrophoresis. P388 cells in the exponential growth stage (1 x 10(6)/ml) were cultured with DXM (1.0 micro mol/L) for 2 hours. Then Ara-C, Cy, DXM, and VP16 were added into the culture. Three hours later electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was conducted to determine the DNA binding activation of NF-KappaBeta. RESULTS: The highest apoptosis rates of P388 cells induced by Ara-C, Cy, and VP-16, were 48.3% +/- 2.6%, 21.4% +/- 6.8%, and 38.1% +/- 3.8%, respectively. The apoptosis rate of P388 cells induced by Ara-C + DXM was 69.6% +/- 7.7%, 44% higher than that induced by only Ara-C (48.3% +/- 2.6%); the apoptosis rate of P388 cells induced by Cy + DXM was 35.6% +/- 6.8%, 89% higher than that induced by only Cy (21.4% +/- 6.8%); and the apoptosis rate of P388 cells induced by VP-16 + DXM was 71.9% +/- 9.9%, 66% higher than that induced by only VP-16 (38.1% +/- 3.8%) (all P < 0.01). Ara-C, Cy, and VP-16 significantly increased the activation of NF-KappaBeta in P388 cells. Pre-processing of 1.0 micro mol/L DXM suppressed the activation of NF-KappaBeta in P388 cells induced by Ara-C, Cy and VP16 by 90 , 71 and 68 respectively. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapeutic drugs (Ara-C, Cy, and VP-16) induce apoptosis and meanwhile induce the activation of NF-KappaBeta in P388 cells. Glucocorticoids, such as DXM, suppress the activation of NF-KappaBeta in leukemic cells, thus increasing the apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs.","['Shi, Jianhui', 'Xu, Xiaoping', 'Li, Lin', 'Zhang, Zongliang', 'Cheng, Wenying', 'Niu, Yuhong', 'Ge, Junbo']","['Shi J', 'Xu X', 'Li L', 'Zhang Z', 'Cheng W', 'Niu Y', 'Ge J']","['Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia P388/pathology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/27 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/27 10:00'],"['2002/08/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/27 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2002 Aug 10;82(15):1050-3.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lymphocytes from B-CLL patients were gamma-irradiated in vitro with 0.2-5 Gy and stimulated by Staphylococcus aureus cowan I (SAC I) for estimation of chromosomal damage. Induction of apoptosis after irradiation was studied in 50 patients by two methods: morphological characterization of apoptotic cells after fluorescent staining (Hoechst), and specific quantification of mono- and oligonucleosomes in cytoplasmic cell fractions (ELISA assay). Morphological chromosome damage was scored in the first cell generation after irradiation (13 patients). In parallel, the kinetics of DNA single-strand break rejoining were investigated by the alkaline comet assay (12 patients). RESULTS: Ionizing irradiation did not induce apoptosis in lymphocytes from a subset of B-CLL patients. The results suggest that B-CLL cells resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis could repair DNA strand-breaks more rapidly and showed a higher level of chromosome aberrations than radiation-sensitive B-CLL cells. CONCLUSION: Each of three biological effects observed (apoptosis, kinetics of DNA single-strand-break repair, chromosomal damage) might be explained by different modifications occurring in irradiated B-CLL cells. Their convergence strongly suggests that resistance to apoptotic death initiation by DNA damage may be impeded by a rapid engaging of the DNA repair mechanisms. The higher level of chromosome aberrations observed in these cells suggests that the type of DNA repair system involved may generate inaccurate repair.","['Blaise, R', 'Alapetite, C', 'Masdehors, P', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Roulin, C', 'Delic, J', 'Sabatier, L']","['Blaise R', 'Alapetite C', 'Masdehors P', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Roulin C', 'Delic J', 'Sabatier L']","['Laboratoire de Radiobiologie et Oncologie, CEA, DSV/DRR, 92265 Fontenay aux Roses, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/radiation effects', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Time Factors']",2002/08/27 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2002/08/27 10:00'],"['2002/08/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553000110120364 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2002 Aug;78(8):671-9. doi: 10.1080/09553000110120364.,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known that the immune response of gamma deltaT cells is not MHC-dependent, but is likely based on direct recognition of surface peptides and non-peptide ligands. This study examined whether DCs and CD4(+) T cells can participate in the activation of gamma deltaT cells. METHOD: Peripheral blood gamma deltaT cells were co-cultured with CD34-derived autologous DCs and CD4(+) T cells using contact-dependent cultures and transwell systems. Proliferation, immunophenotyping, and cytotoxicity assays determined the extent of gamma deltaT cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Human gamma deltaT cells expanded 221.3 +/- 76-fold in cultures with DCs, and 165.7 +/- 76.6-fold with CD4(+) T-cells alone. Proliferation was enhanced (1949.8 +/- 261.3-fold) when gamma deltaT cells were cultured with both DC and CD4(+) T cells. Proliferation was contact-dependent, and resulted in the expansion of V delta1+ or V delta2+ cells cytotoxic against several leukemic cell-lines, but not against allogeneic PHA-induced lymphoid blasts. Ligation of the T-cell receptor with anti-pan-delta Ab significantly up-regulated cytotoxicity against K562, KBM-5 and KG1a, and normal BM, but not against Molt-4, allogeneic EBV-transfected B cells and allogeneic PHA-blasts. Minimal cytotoxic activity was shown against allogeneic marrow colony-forming units granulocyte-macrophage and erythrocyte colony-forming units. CONCLUSION: DCs can participate in the activation of gamma deltaT cells against specific autologous targets, and cytotoxicity can be enhanced by further stimulation via the T-cell receptor.","['Ye, Z', 'Haley, S', 'Gee, A P', 'Henslee-Downey, P J', 'Lamb, L S Jr']","['Ye Z', 'Haley S', 'Gee AP', 'Henslee-Downey PJ', 'Lamb LS Jr']","['Division of Transplantation Medicine, South Carolina Cancer Center, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,IM,,"['CD11c Antigen/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism']",2002/08/27 10:00,2003/03/20 04:00,['2002/08/27 10:00'],"['2002/08/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/146532402320219817 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(02)71064-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2002;4(3):293-304. doi: 10.1080/146532402320219817.,"['0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose intensification via autologous and allogeneic transplantation provides viable treatment options in specific clinical settings. Currently, autologous transplantation is the standard of care for relapsed but chemosensitive aggressive B-cell NHL. However, tools such as the International Prognostic Index allow risk-adapted analyses, and show that the magnitude of benefit from autologous transplantation differs in lymphoma subsets. METHODS: Low-risk patients appear to do well regardless of salvage approaches, whereas high-risk patients have suboptimal outcomes with autologous transplantation. In high-risk patients, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation has been examined as part of initial therapy, with long-term data promising but still evolving. DISCUSSION: A significant concern with autologous transplantation in aggressive and high-grade NHL is the risk of graft contamination with tumor cells. Several investigators have demonstrated the presence of malignant cells in both BM and PBSC, although the clonagenic potential of such cells is unclear. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation has several potential advantages over autologous transplantation for NHL,including procurement of an uncontaminated stem-cell graft, GvL effects, and the elimination of hematopoietic stem-cell damage and consequent secondary leukemia. RESULTS: The ideal application of allogeneic transplantation in aggressive and high-grade lymphomas is still unclear; but the lower relapse rates demonstrated in several comparisons of the two approaches make this an exciting area to pursue. Finally, non-myeloablative stem-cell transplantation may broaden the use of allogeneic transplantation by lowering regimen-related mortality while capitalizing on GvL.","['Smith, S M', 'Grinblatt, D', 'van Besien, K']","['Smith SM', 'Grinblatt D', 'van Besien K']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Protocols', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/08/27 10:00,2003/03/20 04:00,['2002/08/27 10:00'],"['2002/08/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/146532402320219745 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(02)71057-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2002;4(3):223-40. doi: 10.1080/146532402320219745.,,131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients were eligible for our study if they were refractory or failed a prior response to fludarabine. The conditioning regimen consisted of high-dose CY 60 mg/kg daily for 2 days and fractionated TBI. One patient received BEAM because of prior radiation. GvHD prophylaxis consisted of CYA or tacrolimus and MTX in the majority of patients. RESULTS: Twenty eight patients were treated. nineteen had disease that was refractory to fludarabine. The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens per patient was 3. Twenty had HLA-identical donors and one had a one-Ag mismatched sibling donor. Seven patients had a matched unrelated transplant. The median follow-up time for the surviving patients was 66 months. By univariate analysis, chemosensitivity was the only factor that predicted a better outcome. For the chemosensitive patients, the overall survival was 78%, compared with 31% for those with refractory disease (P = 0.05). Progression-free survival at 5 years was 78% for the chemosensitive and 26% for those who were refractory to conventional chemotherapy at the time of transplantation (P = 0.03). Three patients (11%) died within 100 days of transplant. The actuarial risk of acute Grade II-IV GvHD was 49%. Only one patient developed acute Grade III GvHD.

METHODS: A large number of clinical trials have evaluated the role autologous SCT in both low grade and intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). These studies have attempted to evaluate the role of high dose therapy with stem cell support in comparison to more conventional chemotherapy approaches. Studies have also focused on methods to assess whether contaminating tumor cells are contained with the stem cell collection and whether this has impact on outcome. With an increased number of patients now long term survivors, additional studies are focusing on long term complications and in particular the emergence of secondary malignancies. RESULTS: Virtually all patients now receive peripheral blood stem cells rather than bone marrow as a source of stem cells. The role of purging of residual tumor cells remains controversial and no randomized trial has been published to date that could evaluate the clinical utility of cell manipulation to attempt to remove contaminating lymphoma cells. Secondary leukemia is emerging as a major source of long-term morbidity and mortality after autologous stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: Autologous SCT is associated with improved outcome in patients with relapsed intermediate grade lymphoma and most likely prolongs disease free survival in patients with low grade NHL. Morbidity and mortality of the procedure is low and major efforts are being made to attempt to decrease the major causes of failure, which remain disease relapse and occurrence of secondary malignancies.","['Gribben, J G']",['Gribben JG'],"[""Department of Adults Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Receptors, Antigen/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/08/27 10:00,2003/03/20 04:00,['2002/08/27 10:00'],"['2002/08/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/20 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/146532402320219727 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(02)71055-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2002;4(3):205-15. doi: 10.1080/146532402320219727.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen)']",71,,['R21 CA-76667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cytogenetic aberration is the most frequent alteration found in leukemias, which is produced by the translocation t(9;22). Two different fusion proteins are produced depending on the break point (210 kD and 190 kD). The detection of this gene has both diagnostic and prognostic importance, associated with poor prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). AIM: To detect BCR-ABL gene sequences in patients with leukemia from the IX Region of Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 58 patients: 5 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 35 ALL, 15 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 3 biphenotypic leukemia. The gene sequences were detected using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

MATERIAL: A total of 367 inbred Piebald variegated rats was used. METHOD: Transmission of leukemic cells was carried out intraperitoneally at 30 days of age, and without treatment (Study I), the rats reached the terminal phase within 17 +/- 1 days. Rats with induced leukemia was cured with 10 mg/kg carmustine (BCNU) given on days 6 and 13 following cell transmission (Study II), the rats remaining in remission until they were killed at 100 days of age. Final weight was recorded and 12 craniofacial dimensions and tibial length were measured with a digital sliding caliper. RESULTS: The results showed that the effect of untreated terminal rat leukemia (Study I) on craniofacial growth differed between the genders. Male rats showed clearly reduced dimensions of facial structures and also retarded general body growth, whereas females showed differences mainly in general body growth. The effect of cured leukemia (Study II) as such was minor, while BCNU had a strong and permanent reducing effect on both craniofacial and general body growth in both genders. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the results in Study I came both from a direct effect of leukemia and an indirect effect of untreated terminal leukemia through malnutrition. The alkylating agent BCNU seemed to be the main cause of permanent craniofacial and general growth retardation in Study II.","['Karsila-Tenovuo, S', 'Jahnukainen, K', 'Peltomaki, T', 'Salmi, T T', 'Ronning, O']","['Karsila-Tenovuo S', 'Jahnukainen K', 'Peltomaki T', 'Salmi TT', 'Ronning O']","['Development and Orthodontics, Institute of Dentistry, University of Turku, Lemminkaisenkatu 2, FIN-20520, Turku, Finland. susanna.karsila-tenovuo@utu.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Orthod Craniofac Res,Orthodontics & craniofacial research,101144387,IM,,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Carmustine/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalometry', 'Facial Bones/drug effects/*growth & development', 'Female', 'Foramen Magnum/drug effects/growth & development', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mandible/drug effects/growth & development', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nose/drug effects/growth & development', 'Pilot Projects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sex Factors', 'Skull/drug effects/*growth & development', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Survival Rate', 'Tibia/drug effects/growth & development']",2002/08/27 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/27 10:00'],"['2002/08/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0544.2002.02174.x [doi]'],ppublish,Orthod Craniofac Res. 2002 Aug;5(3):131-9. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0544.2002.02174.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Thirteen pregnant ewes at various gestational ages underwent amniocentesis and injection of cells producing the retrovirus vector LIRESgeo, which is derived from Maloney murine leukemia virus and encodes Escherichia coli LacZ (beta-galactosidase) as a marker gene. Pregnant ewes and fetuses were killed, and amniotic fluid, placenta, and fetal tissues were collected and assayed for transgene expression 7 to 77 days after intraamniotic injection. In addition, serum was collected and analyzed for evidence of specific immune responses against the producer cells, and amniotic fluid was collected and analyzed for deleterious effects on producer cell viability, vector production, and vector transduction. RESULTS: Only 1 of 10 fetuses exposed to the retroviral producer cells demonstrated beta-galactosidase activity that correlated with positive immunohistochemistry for LacZ in lung, trachea, pancreas, and small intestine. However, the presence of the LacZ gene could not be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Thus, we could not confirm transduction after any of the injections. The retroviral producer cells survived well in amniotic fluid and continued to produce high levels of retroviral vector after intra-amniotic injection, although amniotic fluid inhibited the transducing activity of the vector in a manner dependent on gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-amniotic retroviral gene transfer with the use of these amphotropic producer cells does not result in reproducible gene transfer in the ovine fetus although amniotic fluid sustains producer cell viability and vector production. Possible reasons for the inefficient transduction are discussed.","['Galan, Henry L', 'Bennett, Michael L', 'Tyson, R Weslie', 'Owens, Geoffrey', 'Regnault, Timothy R h', 'Accurso, Frank', 'Hobbins, John C', 'Schaack, Jerome']","['Galan HL', 'Bennett ML', 'Tyson RW', 'Owens G', 'Regnault TR', 'Accurso F', 'Hobbins JC', 'Schaack J']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Obstet Gynecol,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,0370476,IM,,"['Amniocentesis', 'Amniotic Fluid/metabolism/virology', 'Animals', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Placenta/metabolism/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sheep/*embryology/metabolism/virology', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods/standards', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis/genetics']",2002/08/24 10:00,2002/09/20 10:01,['2002/08/24 10:00'],"['2002/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0002937802001540 [pii]', '10.1067/mob.2002.123601 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2002 Aug;187(2):469-74. doi: 10.1067/mob.2002.123601.,['EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)'],,,"['1K 12HD01271-01A 1/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL58344/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of FasL in immune privilege remains controversial due to studies that indicate FasL is both pro- and anti-inflammatory. To elucidate the mechanism(s) by which FasL regulates immune privilege, we used an ocular tumor model and examined the individual roles of the membrane-bound and soluble form of FasL in regulating ocular inflammation. Following injection into the privileged eye, tumors expressing only soluble FasL failed to trigger inflammation and grew progressively. By contrast, tumors expressing only membrane FasL 1) initiated vigorous neutrophil-mediated inflammation, 2) terminated immune privilege, and 3) were completely rejected. Moreover, the rejection coincided with activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. Interestingly, a higher threshold level of membrane FasL on tumors is required to initiate inflammation within the immune privileged eye, as compared with nonprivileged sites. The higher threshold is due to the suppressive microenvironment found within aqueous humor that blocks membrane FasL activation of neutrophils. However, aqueous humor is unable to completely block the proinflammatory effects of tumor cells that express high levels of membrane FasL. In conclusion, our data indicate that the function of FasL on intraocular tumors is determined by the microenvironment in conjunction with the form and level of FasL expressed.","['Gregory, Meredith S', 'Repp, Amanda C', 'Holhbaum, Andreas M', 'Saff, Rebecca R', 'Marshak-Rothstein, Ann', 'Ksander, Bruce R']","['Gregory MS', 'Repp AC', 'Holhbaum AM', 'Saff RR', 'Marshak-Rothstein A', 'Ksander BR']","['Schepens Eye Research Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Anterior Chamber/immunology/pathology', 'Aqueous Humor/immunology', 'Chemokine CXCL2', 'Chemokines/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Eye/*immunology/pathology', 'Eye Neoplasms/immunology/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/immunology/pathology', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Interleukin-1/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred MRL lpr', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neutrophils/immunology/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Species Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2002/08/24 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/08/24 10:00'],"['2002/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.5.2727 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Sep 1;169(5):2727-35. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.5.2727.,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cxcl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,"['F32-EY13664/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-58724/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-EY08122/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA64070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-EY07145/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ab fragments expressed in the appropriate cell compartment may also help to elucidate the functions of a protein of interest. We report in this study the successful targeting of the protein tyrosine kinase Syk in the RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cell line. We isolated from a phage display library human single-chain variable fragments (scFv) directed against the portion of Syk containing the Src homology 2 domains and the linker region that separates them. Among them, two scFv named G4G11 and G4E4 exhibited the best binding to Syk in vivo in a yeast two-hybrid selection system. Stable transfectants of RBL-2H3 cells expressing cytosolic G4G11 and G4E4 were established. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that intracellular G4G11 and G4E4 bind to Syk, but do not inhibit the activation of Syk following FcepsilonRI aggregation, suggesting that the scFv do not affect the recruitment of Syk to the receptor. Nevertheless, FcepsilonRI-mediated calcium mobilization and the release of inflammatory mediators are inhibited, and are consistent with a defect in Bruton's tyrosine kinase and phospholipase C-gamma2 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. Interestingly, FcepsilonRI-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation is not altered, suggesting that intracellular G4G11 and G4E4 do not prevent the coupling of Syk to the Ras pathway, but they selectively inhibit the pathway involving phospholipase C-gamma2 activation.","['Dauvillier, Stephanie', 'Merida, Peggy', 'Visintin, Michela', 'Cattaneo, Antonino', 'Bonnerot, Christian', 'Dariavach, Piona']","['Dauvillier S', 'Merida P', 'Visintin M', 'Cattaneo A', 'Bonnerot C', 'Dariavach P']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, Unite Mixte de Recherche 5535 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics/immunology', 'Enzyme Precursors/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/*immunology/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology/metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains/*immunology', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",2002/08/24 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/08/24 10:00'],"['2002/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.169.5.2274 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Sep 1;169(5):2274-83. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.169.5.2274.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF401619', 'GENBANK/AF401620']",,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Single blinded prospective randomised controlled trial and single blinded randomised crossover trial. SETTING: Neurosurgical unit and haematology ward of university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 100 neurosurgical patients and 40 patients with leukaemia who required chemotherapy. INTERVENTIONS: Neurosurgical patients' hands and forearms were covered for 15 minutes with a carbon fibre heating mitt. Patients were assigned randomly to active warming at 52 degrees C or passive insulation (heater not activated). The same warming system was used for 10 minutes in patients with leukaemia. They were assigned randomly to active warming or passive insulation on day 1 and given alternative treatment during the subsequent visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY: success rate for insertion of 18 gauge cannula into vein on back of hand. SECONDARY: time required for successful cannulation. RESULTS: In neurosurgical patients, it took 36 seconds (95% confidence interval 31 to 40 seconds) to insert a cannula in the active warming group and 62 (50 to 74) seconds in the passive insulation group (P=0.002). Three (6%) first attempts failed in the active warming group compared with 14 (28%) in the passive insulation group (P=0.008). The crossover study in patients with leukaemia showed that insertion time was reduced by 20 seconds (8 to 32, P=0.013) with active warming and that failure rates at first attempt were 6% with warming and 30% with passive insulation (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Local warming facilitates the insertion of peripheral venous cannulas, reducing both time and number of attempts required. This may decrease the time staff spend inserting cannulas, reduce supply costs, and improve patient satisfaction.","['Lenhardt, Rainer', 'Seybold, Tanja', 'Kimberger, Oliver', 'Stoiser, Brigitte', 'Sessler, Daniel I']","['Lenhardt R', 'Seybold T', 'Kimberger O', 'Stoiser B', 'Sessler DI']","['Outcomes Research Institute and Department of Anaesthesiology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202 USA. rainerlenhardt@compuserve.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,IM,"['BMJ. 2002 Nov 2;325(7371):1038.

The cell surface molecule recognized by CSC-1 is widely expressed on a variety of human cell lines. Among the hematopoietic cell lines examined, the CSC-1 marker seems to be preferentially expressed by lymphoid cell lines (e.g., Raji, CEM-SS, Jurkat, and MOLT-3). Although CSC-1 also recognizes some uncommitted myeloid and erythroleukemia cell lines (e.g., U-937 and K562), the CSC-1 marker expression on these cell lines is subjected to PMA-induced down-regulation. In addition, the PMA-induced cell surface down-regulation of the CSC-1 marker required more than 24 h. Proteolytic analysis shows that the CSC-1 marker can be categorized into proteinase K-resistant and-sensitive phenotypes.

In a number of hematologic malignancies, chromosomal translocations lead to aberrant fusions of TEL-SAM to a variety of other proteins, including many tyrosine kinases. TEL-SAM polymerization results in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase domains to which it becomes fused, leading to cell transformation. Thus, inhibitors of TEL-SAM self-association could abrogate transformation in these cells. In previous work, we determined the structure of a mutant TEL-SAM polymer bearing a Val to Glu substitution in center of the subunit interface. It remained unclear how much the mutation affected the architecture of the polymer, however. RESULTS: Here we determine the structure of the native polymer interface. To accomplish this goal, we introduced mutations that block polymer extension, producing a heterodimer with a wild-type interface. We find that the structure of the wild-type polymer interface is quite similar to the mutant structure determined previously. With the structure of the native interface, it is possible to evaluate the potential for developing therapeutic inhibitors of the interaction. We find that the interacting surfaces of the protein are relatively flat, containing no obvious pockets for the design of small molecule inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the architecture of the TEL-SAM polymer proposed previously based on a mutant structure. The fact that the interface contains no obvious potential binding pockets suggests that it may be difficult to find small molecule inhibitors to treat malignancies in this way.","['Tran, Hoang H', 'Kim, Chongwoo A', 'Faham, Salem', 'Siddall, Marie-Claire', 'Bowie, James U']","['Tran HH', 'Kim CA', 'Faham S', 'Siddall MC', 'Bowie JU']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, UCLA Laboratory of Structural Biology and Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology Institute, 90095-1570, USA. htran@mbi.ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20020822,England,BMC Struct Biol,BMC structural biology,101088689,IM,,"['Biopolymers/chemistry', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics']",2002/08/24 10:00,2003/12/10 05:00,['2002/08/24 10:00'],"['2002/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/10 05:00 [medline]', '2002/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1472-6807-2-5 [doi]'],epublish,BMC Struct Biol. 2002 Aug 22;2:5. doi: 10.1186/1472-6807-2-5.,"['0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",,,"['R01 CA081000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA81000-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC126206,,,,['PDB/1LKY'],,,,,,,,,,,,

DBD* was derived from the DNA binding domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor by a frameshift that replaces the final 21 C-terminal amino acids of the domain. Previous studies suggested that DBD* no longer acted as the natural DNA binding domain. To confirm and extend these results, we mutated DBD* in 29 single amino acid positions, critical for the function in the native domain or of possible functional significance in the novel 21 amino acid C-terminal sequence. Steroid-resistant leukemic ICR-27-4 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with each of the 29 mutants. Cell kill was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion, a WST-1 tetrazolium-based assay for cell respiration, propidium iodide exclusion, and Hoechst 33258 staining of chromatin. Eleven of the 29 point mutants increased, whereas four decreased antileukemic activity. The remainder had no effect on activity. The nonconcordances between these effects and native DNA binding domain function strongly suggest that the lethality of DBD* is distinct from that of the glucocorticoid receptor. Transfections of fragments of DBD* showed that optimal activity localized to the sequence for its C-terminal 32 amino acids.","['Ji, Yan-shan', 'Johnson, Betty H', 'Webb, M Scott', 'Thompson, E Brad']","['Ji YS', 'Johnson BH', 'Webb MS', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-0645, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",2002/08/23 10:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2002/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2002/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.neo.7900253 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2002 Sep-Oct;4(5):417-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.neo.7900253.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",,,"['R01 CA041407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41407 - 15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC1564120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It codes for a chimeric protein consisting of MLL fused to AFX, a forkhead transcription factor that normally regulates genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle progression. We demonstrate here that forced expression of MLL-AFX enhances the self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and induces acute myeloid leukemias after long latencies in syngeneic recipient mice. MLL-AFX interacts with the transcriptional coactivator CBP, which is also a fusion partner for MLL in human leukemias. A potent minimal transactivation domain (CR3) at the C terminus of AFX mediates interactions with the KIX domain of CBP and is necessary for transformation of myeloid progenitors by MLL-AFX. However, CR3 alone is not sufficient, suggesting that simple acquisition of a transactivation domain per se does not activate the oncogenic potential of MLL. Rather, two conserved transcriptional effector domains (CR2 and CR3) of AFX are required for full oncogenicity of MLL-AFX and also endow it with the potential to competitively interfere with transcription and apoptosis mediated by wild-type forkhead proteins. Furthermore, a dominant-negative mutant of AFX containing CR2 and CR3 enhances the growth of myeloid progenitors in vitro, although considerably less effectively than does MLL-AFX. Taken together, these data suggest that recruitment of transcriptional cofactors utilized by forkhead proteins is a critical requirement for oncogenic action of MLL-AFX, which may impact both MLL- and forkhead-dependent transcriptional pathways.","['So, Chi Wai', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['So CW', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2002/08/23 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/08/23 10:00'],"['2002/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.22.18.6542-6552.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Sep;22(18):6542-52. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.18.6542-6552.2002.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXO4 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AFX protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",,,['CA55209/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC135648,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of selective protein kinase inhibitors that can block or modulate diseases caused by abnormalities in these signaling pathways is widely considered a promising approach for drug development. Because of their deregulation in human cancers, protein kinases, such as Bcr-Abl, those in the epidermal growth factor-receptor (HER) family, the cell cycle regulating kinases such as the cyclin-dependent kinases, as well as the vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor kinases involved in the neo-vascularization of tumors, are among the protein kinases considered as prime targets for the development of selective inhibitors. These drug-discovery efforts have generated inhibitors and low-molecular weight therapeutics directed against the ATP-binding site of various protein kinases that are in various stages of development (up to Phase II/III clinical trials). Three examples of inhibitors of protein kinases are reviewed, including low-molecular weight compounds targeting the cell cycle kinases; a potent and selective inhibitor of the HER1/HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase, the pyrollopyrimidine PKI166; and the 2-phenyl-aminopyrimidine STI571 (Glivec(R), Gleevec) a targeted drug therapy directed toward Bcr-Abl, the key player in chronic leukemia (CML). Some members of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases, in particular HER1 and HER2, have been found to be overexpressed in a variety of human tumors, suggesting that inhibition of HER signaling would be a viable antiproliferative strategy. The pyrrolo-pyrimidine PKI166 was developed as an HER1/HER2 inhibitor with potent in vitro antiproliferative and in vivo antitumor activity. Based upon its clear association with disease, the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase in CML represents the ideal target to validate the clinical utility of protein kinase inhibitors as therapeutic agents. In a preclinical model, STI571 (Glivec(R), Gleevec) showed potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity that was selective for Abl, c-Kit, and the platelet-derived growth factor-receptor. Phase I/II studies demonstrated that STI571 is well tolerated, and that it showed promising hematological and cytogenetic responses in CML and clinical responses in the c-Kit-driven gastrointestinal tumors.","['Fabbro, Doriano', 'Ruetz, Stephan', 'Buchdunger, Elisabeth', 'Cowan-Jacob, Sandra W', 'Fendrich, Gabriele', 'Liebetanz, Janis', 'Mestan, Jurgen', ""O'Reilly, Terence"", 'Traxler, Peter', 'Chaudhuri, Bhabatosh', 'Fretz, Heinz', 'Zimmermann, Jurg', 'Meyer, Thomas', 'Caravatti, Giorgio', 'Furet, Pascal', 'Manley, Paul W']","['Fabbro D', 'Ruetz S', 'Buchdunger E', 'Cowan-Jacob SW', 'Fendrich G', 'Liebetanz J', 'Mestan J', ""O'Reilly T"", 'Traxler P', 'Chaudhuri B', 'Fretz H', 'Zimmermann J', 'Meyer T', 'Caravatti G', 'Furet P', 'Manley PW']","['Department of Oncology, Novartis Pharma Inc., WKL-125.4.10, CH-4002, Basel, Switzerland. doriano.fabrio@pharma.novartis.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Pharmacol Ther,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', '*Protein Kinases/metabolism/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2002/08/23 10:00,2003/01/24 04:00,['2002/08/23 10:00'],"['2002/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/24 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0163725802001791 [pii]', '10.1016/s0163-7258(02)00179-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Ther. 2002 Feb-Mar;93(2-3):79-98. doi: 10.1016/s0163-7258(02)00179-1.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and others have found it difficult to extract an optimal quality and quantity of mRNA for the preparation of cDNA libraries which represent the genes transcribed in haematological samples. The difficulty is believed to be due to residual haem groups in the isolated RNA sample which inhibit the activity of reverse transcriptase used in the later production of cDNA. During our preparation of a cDNA library for SEREX studies, we optimised the isolation of mRNA from samples from patients with haematological malignancies. We compared the efficacy of different methods of mRNA extraction using a range of haematological sample sizes and describe the most efficient techniques to maximise mRNA yield and quality for cDNA library production. The phage library we prepared contained a range of cDNA insert sizes, including high molecular weight sequences which, following immunoscreening with autologous patient sera, led to the isolation of 17 novel antigens. Using the methodology described, we have shown SEREX to be effective for the isolation of leukaemia-associated antigens, which may act as targets for immunotherapy.","['Guinn, Barbara-ann', 'Collin, Joseph F', 'Li, Geng', 'Rees, Robert C', 'Mufti, Ghulam J']","['Guinn BA', 'Collin JF', 'Li G', 'Rees RC', 'Mufti GJ']","[""Leukaemia Science Laboratories, Department of Haematological Medicine, Guy's, King's & St. Thomas' School of Medicine, Denmark Hill Campus, Rayne Institute, 123 Coldharbour Lane, London, UK. barbara.guinn@kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,IM,,"['Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*isolation & purification/therapeutic use', 'Bacteriophage lambda/genetics', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cloning, Molecular/*methods', 'DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/isolation & purification', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/*isolation & purification/therapeutic use', 'Specimen Handling/methods', 'Viral Plaque Assay']",2002/08/23 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/08/23 10:00'],"['2002/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0022175902000959 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(02)00095-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2002 Jun 1;264(1-2):207-14. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(02)00095-9.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, 26 lines were positive for CD19 and CD20, and 11 were negative for both. All of the lines were strongly HLA-DR+, while CD40 expression was variable.

Human retroviruses cause disease ranging from neurological disorders and leukemias (HTLV-1) to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency virus) (HIV) and promote development of several types of malignancies (HIV). They share many common features, but their contrasts are greater, especially the far greater replication and variation of HIV associated with its greater genomic complexity. Both have evolved striking redundancy for mechanisms which promote their survival. Thus, HTLV has redundant mechanisms for promoting growth of provirus containing T cells needed for virus continuity, because it is chiefly through its cellular DNA provirus that HTLV replicates and not through production of virions. Conversely, HIV has redundancy in its mechanisms for promoting virion replication and escape from the host immune system. It is via these redundant mechanisms that they produce disease: leukemias from mechanisms promoting T-cell proliferation (HTLV-1) and AIDS from mechanisms promoting virus replication and T-cell death (HIV). The practical challenges for the future are clear. For HTLV-1, education and control of breastfeeding. For HIV, the formidable tasks now ahead in part demand new kinds of talent, talents that will foster greater insights into the development of therapy for the developing countries, new forms of less toxic therapies for all infected persons, a continued and expanded commitment to education, and a persistent 'never say die' commitment to the development of a truly preventive vaccine with all the scientific and nonscientific challenges that these objectives face.","['Gallo, Robert C']",['Gallo RC'],"['Institute of Human Virology, Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. coleman@umbi.umd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,IM,,"['AIDS Vaccines', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/*prevention & control/therapy/virology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genetic Therapy', 'HIV/genetics/immunology/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/chemistry/metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/immunology/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans']",2002/08/23 10:00,2003/04/24 05:00,['2002/08/23 10:00'],"['2002/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2002/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['imr18520 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-065x.2002.18520.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2002 Jul;185:236-65. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-065x.2002.18520.x.,"['0 (AIDS Vaccines)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)']",258,,,,,['Immunol Rev. 2002 Oct;188:183'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early observations included the feasibility of bone marrow transplantation (and related problems with graft-vs.-host reactions); the mitogenic effect of phytohemagglutinin (and resultant human lymphocyte culture techniques); and early cytogenetic findings in human leukemias, both lymphocytic and myeloid (including the Philadelphia chromosome). Subsequent studies of normal human lymphocytes have contributed to our enormously expanding knowledge of their basic biology, especially regulatory pathways, both extracellular and intracellular. Further work with human lymphoid neoplasms has helped extend the early chromosomal findings to the specific genes involved, including several regulating apoptosis; and also contributed to the concept of clonal evolution as a basic underlying mechanism of tumorigenesis in general. This career has covered a period of remarkable growth of knowledge concerning both normal and neoplastic lymphocytes, with potential for many important future clinical applications; it has been a privilege to participate.","['Nowell, Peter C']",['Nowell PC'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6082, USA. nowell@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,IM,,"['Allergy and Immunology/history', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology']",2002/08/23 10:00,2003/04/24 05:00,['2002/08/23 10:00'],"['2002/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2002/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['imr18518 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-065x.2002.18518.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2002 Jul;185:220-6. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-065x.2002.18518.x.,['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first demonstration of its crucial role in establishing the development of a normal immune system was provided in 1961, when it was shown that mice thymectomized immediately after birth had poorly developed lymphoid tissues, impaired immune responses and inordinate susceptibility to intercurrent infections. Although thymus lymphocytes were believed to be immunoincompetent, it was shown in 1967 that they could respond to antigen by proliferating and giving rise to a progeny of cells that could not produce antibody, but enabled other lymphocytes, derived from bone marrow, to differentiate to antibody-forming cells. This was the first unequivocal demonstration, in mammalian species, of the existence of two major interacting subsets of lymphocytes, T and B cells. It required a re-evaluation of many immunological phenomena, such as tolerance, memory and autoimmunity, and it was followed by an avalanche of work elucidating many of the mysteries of the immune system.","['Miller, J F A P']",['Miller JF'],"['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, P.O.

METHODS: Systematic review of all new serum IgM paraproteins detected over a 6-year period in an immunodiagnostic laboratory serving a population of 400,000 people. Clinical diagnoses were ascertained from a computerised laboratory database or clinical notes, whilst associated laboratory features were obtained from the same sources. RESULTS: The 125 IgM paraproteins detected constitute 19.7% of all new paraproteins observed over the period of study. IgM paraproteinaemia occurred more commonly in males and its frequency increased with age. Approximately 30% were associated with B cell lymphoproliferative disorders (Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, amyloid, etc.) with the remainder being labelled as monoclonal IgM gammopathies of uncertain significance (four having a peripheral neuropathy). At clinical presentation, patients with lymphoproliferative disorders tended to have higher levels of IgM, beta2-microglobulin, the presence of free urinary light chains and demonstrated molecular size heterogenicity of the paraprotein (presence of decamers, oligomers and monomers in addition to the pentamer) but there was considerable overlap. A good correlation was noted between paraprotein concentration and viscosity in most patients. CONCLUSION: IgM paraproteinaemia was most frequently encountered in the context of a gammopathy of uncertain significance. Features which suggested lymphoproliferative disorders included higher levels of paraprotein (>15 g/l) elevated levels of beta2-microglobulin and the presence of urinary free high chain. However, as much overlap was seen, regular monitoring of paraprotein levels is considered mandatory in the management of these patients.","['Roberts-Thomson, Peter J', 'Nikoloutsopoulos, Tony', 'Smith, Anthony J F']","['Roberts-Thomson PJ', 'Nikoloutsopoulos T', 'Smith AJ']","['Department of Immunology, Allergy and Arthritis, Flinders Medical Centre, Bedford Park, Adelaide, South Australia. peter.roberts-thomson@flinders.edu.au']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,IM,,"['Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Blood Viscosity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'Paraproteinemias/blood/complications/epidemiology/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution']",2002/08/23 10:00,2003/03/07 04:00,['2002/08/23 10:00'],"['2002/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/003130202760120535 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathology. 2002 Aug;34(4):356-61. doi: 10.1080/003130202760120535.,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate four polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods used to analyse T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements in the assessment of T cell clonality. METHODS: DNA was tested from 23 T cell neoplasms, seven B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL), three Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL), 14 benign LPD and peripheral blood from a healthy donor. TCRgamma rearrangements were assessed by McCarthy's et al. two primer set method, Benhattar's et al. linear pre-amplification method, and Chhanabhai's et aL heteroduplex method. TCRbeta D-J rearrangements were analysed by Slack's et al. method. RESULTS: Monoclonal TCRgamma rearrangements were found in 91% (21 of 23) of T cell neoplasms using McCarthy's et al. method; in 83% (19 of 23) using Benhattar's et al. or Chhanabhai's et al. methods and monoclonal TCRbeta rearrangements were found in 43% (10 of 23) using Slack's et al. method. Monoclonality was established in all T cell neoplasms using one or more PCR methods. One follicular B-NHL had inappropriate monoclonal TCRbeta rearrangement, while the remaining B-NHL and all HL samples had no monoclonal TCRgamma or TCRbeta rearrangements. In addition to polyclonal products, one reactive lymph node had oligoclonal TCRgamma rearrangements and two others generated monoclonal products of uncertain significance. McCarthy's et al. TCRgamma method was the most sensitive in establishing T cell monoclonality, and in combination with Slack's et al. TCRbeta method, monoclonality was demonstrated in 100% of T cell neoplasms (23 of 23). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that multiple primer set PCR methods should obviate a need for the more expensive and time-consuming Southern blot (SB) technique and are the preferred diagnostic molecular test for assessing T cell clonality.","['Cairns, Suzanne M', 'Taylor, Jeremy M E', 'Gould, Paul R', 'Spagnolo, Dominic V']","['Cairns SM', 'Taylor JM', 'Gould PR', 'Spagnolo DV']","['The Western Australian Centre for Pathology and Medical Research, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,IM,,"['Blood Cells/pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*pathology', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",2002/08/23 10:00,2003/03/07 04:00,['2002/08/23 10:00'],"['2002/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/003130202760120463 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathology. 2002 Aug;34(4):320-5. doi: 10.1080/003130202760120463.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic implications of CD56 expression in AML are not clear. In this study, we evaluated the correlation among CD56 expression, cytogenetic abnormality, and clinical outcome in AML. METHODS: CD56 expression was analyzed in leukemic cells from 94 adults with primary AML in Taiwan and was correlated with clinical and hematologic features, cytogenetics, and immunophenotypes of the leukemia. RESULTS: Thirty patients (32%) showed CD56 expression. CD56+ AML patients had a higher lactate dehydrogenase level than CD56- patients (1.136 vs 730 V/L, p = 0.048). Patients with t(8;21) had a significantly higher incidence (89%, 8/9) of CD56 positivity in leukemic cells than those with normal karyotype or other cytogenetic abnormalities (26%, 22/85, p < 0.001). In general, there was no difference in overall survival time in CD56+ and CD56- AML patients. However, three patients had central nervous system involvement at initial presentation; two of these had concomitant CD56 expression and t(8;21). In addition, five of the seven patients with t(8;21) and CD56 expression who achieved complete remission later relapsed. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CD56 expression in AML patients with t(8;21) is very high in Taiwan, and it may imply a poor prognosis in this subgroup of patients.","['Hsiao, Chi-Huang', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Yao, Ming', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Wang, Chiu-Hwa', 'Chen, Yao-Chang', 'Shen, Ming-Ching', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Hsiao CH', 'Tang JL', 'Yao M', 'Tsay W', 'Wang CH', 'Chen YC', 'Shen MC', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, Pan-Chiao, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CD56 Antigen/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Taiwan']",2002/08/23 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/23 10:00'],"['2002/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 2002 Jun;101(6):393-8.,['0 (CD56 Antigen)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these studies, this phenomenon will be further investigated and expanded to leukemia cells from acute and chronic myeloid leukemia (AML and CML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell samples of AML and CML patients, from the first affiliated hospital of Jinan University Medical College, were obtained. The primary cell culture was established to investigate whether or not the inhibition of telomerase activity with hTERT mRNA AS PS-ODN increased the effect for cisplatin to induce apoptosis of leukemic cells from patients. Cell growth was observed with trypan blue dye exclusion. hTERT protein was determined by tissue chemistry and flowcytometry. Telomerase activity was tested with the telomerase PCR ELISA assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim). RESULTS: The inhibition of telomerase activity with hTERT mRNA AS PS-ODN could significantly increase the susceptibility of AML or CML cells to CDDP. The apoptotic percentage of cells (AML: 42.68%; CML: 35.72%) treated with AS PS-ODN/CDDP was significantly different from that of cells (AML, 29.02%; CML, 23.84%) treated with S PS-ODN/CDDP or CDDP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: ATRA was administered orally at 45 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-14 and 25 mg/m(2)/day on days 15-28 of two standard cycles (idarubicin, etoposide, cytarabine, G-CSF) and of up to three high-dose courses (cytarabine, G-CSF). The results obtained in 19 patients enrolled in the ATRA trial were compared with those from 29 comparable cases treated with the same schedule without ATRA, according to patient risk class and an in vitro study. RESULTS: ATRA was administered for a median of 52 days to the patients selected for study who achieved a remission. ATRA-related toxicity was mostly non-severe apart from high incidence of headache in conjunction with high-dose cytarabine. Complete remission (CR) rate after cycle 1 (54%), kinetics of hematological recovery, postremission treatment realization, disease-free survival (DFS 37.5% at three years) and overall survival (30% at three years) were not different between ATRA-treated and untreated patients. The only significant prognostic factor was the patient risk class, as defined by cytogenetics and other clinical criteria: DFS rate was 57% at three years in standard-risk cases compared to only 19% in the high-risk group, with no influx by ATRA in either category. The in vitro study, in patients with a definite clinical response, failed to document any inhibitory or pro-apoptotic effect of ATRA on AML blast cells. CONCLUSION: As a consequence to these results, the pilot ATRA phase was closed. This study does not suggest a significant role for the present ATRA schedule as an adjunct to standard antileukemic therapy in adult AML.","['Bassan, Renato', 'Chiodini, Barbara', 'Lerede, Teresa', 'Giussani, Ursula', 'Oldani, Elena', 'Buelli, Maurizio', 'Rossi, Andrea', 'Viero, Piera', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Barbui, Tiziano']","['Bassan R', 'Chiodini B', 'Lerede T', 'Giussani U', 'Oldani E', 'Buelli M', 'Rossi A', 'Viero P', 'Rambaldi A', 'Barbui T']","['Division of Haematology, Cytogenetics Unit, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy. basbas@virgilio.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Headache/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Patient Compliance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2002/08/22 10:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2002/08/22 10:00'],"['2002/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2002/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.thj.6200180 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol J. 2002;3(4):193-200. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200180.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ICE protocol 4']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A nationwide study in Denmark.,524-8,"To investigate whether parents of children with congenital malformations more often developed cancer after birth of the child, a population-based case-control study in Denmark was undertaken. By linking the Cancer Registry with the Central Population Registry, we identified 8783 cancer patients having their first child born between 1977 and 1995 before the cancer was diagnosed. Parents of 41 206 firstborn children of a 10% random sample of newborns from the Birth Registry between 1980 and 1995 were identified as controls. We obtained malformation diagnoses of children of cases and controls by linking to the Hospital Discharge Registry. We estimated the association between malformation and cancer by using logistic regression, adjusting for maternal age at birth and sex of child. We found no increased risk of cancer in parents having children with malformations in general, but a higher cancer risk in parents of children born with cleft lip/palate, odds ratio (OR) for all cancer=1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.0-3.2), OR for lymphomas=4.2 (1.3-13.5) and OR for leukaemia=8.1 (2.0-33.7). This association was not restricted to cancer cases diagnosed shortly after birth of the child.

In September 2000, the Trisenox brand of arsenic trioxide for the treatment of relapsed and refractory APL was approved in the United States. A recent clinical report has shown a serious ventricular tachycardia at the therapeutic doses of arsenic trioxide in APL patients. The present study was undertaken to investigate the cardiotoxic effect of arsenic trioxide using a mouse model. Animals were injected intraperitoneally with arsenic trioxide 5 mg/ kg/d for 30 d, a dose regiment that has been shown to produce plasma concentrations of arsenic within the range of those present in arsenic-treated APL patients. Analysis of myocardial function revealed that arsenic caused a significant decrease in the maximum rate of rise in intraventricular pressure during ventricular contraction (MAX dP/dt), and significant increases in the end diastolic pressure and ventricle minimum diastolic pressure. In response to B-adrenergic stimulation by isoproterenol, the arsenic-treated heart did not show increase in MAX dP/dt, which was observed as a stress response in the saline-treated controls. The functional alterations were accompanied by cardiomyopathy, as revealed by histopathological and ultrastructural examination. Furthermore, arsenic caused myocardial apoptosis, as determined by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay, which was confirmed by caspase-3 activation detected by enzymatic assay. Our study thus demonstrates that arsenic trioxide, in a dose that could produce clinically comparable serum concentrations to those observed in humans, causes cardiotoxicity.","['Li, Yan', 'Sun, Xiuhua', 'Wang, Lipeng', 'Zhou, Zhanxiang', 'Kang, Y James']","['Li Y', 'Sun X', 'Wang L', 'Zhou Z', 'Kang YJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cardiovasc Toxicol,Cardiovascular toxicology,101135818,IM,,"['Adrenergic beta-Agonists/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Isoproterenol/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Myocardium/pathology', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Ventricular Function, Left/physiology']",2002/08/22 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/08/22 10:00'],"['2002/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2002/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['CT:2:1:63 [pii]', '10.1385/ct:2:1:63 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Toxicol. 2002;2(1):63-73. doi: 10.1385/ct:2:1:63.,"['0 (Adrenergic beta-Agonists)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,"['HL59225/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL63760/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether CVB3 induced pronounced cardiomyopathy during the severe immune dysfunction of murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), female C57BL/6 mice were infected with LP-BM5 retrovirus and then coinfected with CVB3. C57BL/6 mice, essentially resistant to CVB3-induced cardiomyopathy, became susceptible to this cardiomyopathy because of the immune dysfunction caused by murine AIDS. This susceptibility suggests that retrovirus infection causes conditions favoring the CVB3 induction of cardiac lesions. Mice were fed a diet supplemented with selenium (Se) at nine times the recommended daily dose for mice (0.933 mg/ kg of diet). Heart tissues were analyzed histopathologically 12 d after CVB3 challenge. Mice experiencing concurrent retrovirus and CVB3 infection had a high degree of cardiac lesions that were consistent with myopathy compared to that in uninfected mice (p < 0.05). Se supplementation during murine retrovirus infection significantly diminished the pathogenesis caused by concurrent CVB3 infection in mice that had murine AIDS. There was a significant increase in the survival of dually retrovirus and CVB3-infected mice that were fed Se, compared to that of identically treated mice that were not fed Se. Hepatic lipid peroxides were significantly diminished in the Se-supplemented mice as compared to those in immunodeficient mice without supplementation (p <F 0.1). Increased oxidation occurred in mice that had murine AIDS, which was also shown by reduced tissue vitamin E. Therefore, the reduction of retrovirally induced oxidation and inflammation by Se produced conditions that improved the survival of mice during CVB3 infection.","['Sepulveda, R Tomas', 'Zhang, Jin', 'Watson, Ronald R']","['Sepulveda RT', 'Zhang J', 'Watson RR']","['Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cardiovasc Toxicol,Cardiovascular toxicology,101135818,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Coxsackievirus Infections/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications', 'Myocarditis/drug therapy/pathology/prevention & control', 'Myocardium/pathology', 'Selenium/*therapeutic use', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Vitamin E/metabolism']",2002/08/22 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/08/22 10:00'],"['2002/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2002/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['CT:2:1:53 [pii]', '10.1385/ct:2:1:53 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Toxicol. 2002;2(1):53-61. doi: 10.1385/ct:2:1:53.,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",,,"['HL59794/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL63667/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, during the 1990s, the dynamics of the AIDS epidemic changed, as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection rates slowed and effective antiretroviral therapies were introduced. We examined the impact of these changes on the general population incidence of KS and NHL. METHODS: Age-standardized incidences for KS and NHL from 1973 through 1998 were obtained from nine population-based cancer registries that participate in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. RESULTS: During the mid-1990s, KS incidence declined sharply in all nine registries. Decreases in KS incidence were most evident in San Francisco, where KS rates among white men had risen from 0.5 per 100 000 people per year in 1973 to between 31.1 and 33.3 from 1987 through 1991 and then declined to 2.8 in 1998. With background NHL incidence in the general population being much higher than that for KS, changes in incidence related to the AIDS epidemic were most evident in subgroups at high risk of AIDS. In San Francisco, NHL rates among white men rose from 10.7 in 1973 to a peak of 31.4 in 1995 and then declined to 21.6 in 1998. NHL types that were most highly AIDS-associated declined most steeply, whereas the incidence of NHL types not associated with AIDS was either stable or increasing. CONCLUSION: Changes in KS and NHL incidence since the mid 1990s may reflect declines in the number of individuals with AIDS and improved immune function in such individuals following the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapies in the 1990s. Notably, non-AIDS-associated NHL incidence has continued to increase steadily through 1998.","['Eltom, Mohamed A', 'Jemal, Ahmedin', 'Mbulaiteye, Sam M', 'Devesa, Susan S', 'Biggar, Robert J']","['Eltom MA', 'Jemal A', 'Mbulaiteye SM', 'Devesa SS', 'Biggar RJ']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,,"['Adult', 'African Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Aged', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Linear Models', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'SEER Program', 'San Francisco/epidemiology', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",2002/08/22 10:00,2002/08/31 10:01,['2002/08/22 10:00'],"['2002/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/94.16.1204 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2002 Aug 21;94(16):1204-10. doi: 10.1093/jnci/94.16.1204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last fifteen years, with the discovery of nuclear receptors for RA, the molecular basis for the effects of this molecule has become apparent. Retinoic acid receptors (RAR) are members of a superfamily of ligand dependent transcription factors that interact with an increasingly large array of coactivators and repressors to regulate target gene expression through binding to cognate recognition sequences in the promoters of these genes. Alterations in RAR expression and function have been demonstrated in many types of cancer. The translocation of RARalpha with PML or PLZF genes in acute promyelocytic leukemia is a paradigm of the role of RARs in cancer biology. In addition, the development of receptor selective synthetic retinoids has greatly expanded our knowledge of RAR function in tumor cells and provided additional treatment options for cancer patients.

We tested the ability of the gene product (WT1) to serve as a target antigen for tumor specific immunotherapy both in human in vitro system and mouse in vivo system. In the latter, we can evaluate the efficacy and the side effects of WT1 vaccination in vivo. In the human in vitro system, two WT1 peptides that contain HLA-A2.1 binding anchor motifs were determined to bind to HLA-A2.1 molecules. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from an HLA-A2.1-psitive donor were repeatedly stimulated in vitro with TAP-deficient T2 cells pulsed with each of these two peptides, and CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that specifically lyse WT1-expressing, HLA-A2.1-positive tumor cells were induced. Other groups also have succeeded in generating CTLs which specifically lyse WT1-expressing leukemia cells, and which do not inhibit colony-formation of normal hematopoietic cells that express WT1 at physiological levels. In the mouse in vivo system, immunization of C57BL/6 mice with one WT1 peptide with relatively high binding affinity for H-2D(b) molecules, which contain H-2D(b) binding anchor motifs, induced CTLs, which specifically lysed WT1-expressing tumor cells in an H-2D(b)-restricted manner. Furthermore, mice immunized with the WT1 peptide (peptide vaccination) or WT1 cDNA (DNA vaccination) rejected challenges by WT1-expressing tumor cells and survived with no signs of auto-aggression to WT1-expressing normal organs by the induced CTLs. The WT1 protein has been identified as a novel tumor antigen and recent investigations provide a rationale for developing WT1-based adoptive T cell therapy and vaccination against various kinds of malignant neoplasms.","['Oka, Y', 'Tsuboi, A', 'Elisseeva, O A', 'Udaka, K', 'Sugiyama, H']","['Oka Y', 'Tsuboi A', 'Elisseeva OA', 'Udaka K', 'Sugiyama H']","['Deapartment of Molecular Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, 2-2, Yamada-oka, Suita City, Osaka 565-0871, Japan. yoshi@imed3.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/adverse effects/*genetics/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/*immunology/therapeutic use']",2002/08/22 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/08/22 10:00'],"['2002/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1568009023334088 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2002 Mar;2(1):45-54. doi: 10.2174/1568009023334088.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in many known instances, tumor cells develop resistance to apoptosis through various mechanisms. Thus, interventions designed to facilitate tumor cells apoptosis are likely to have a therapeutic benefit. PKCtheta, which is expressed relatively selectively in T cells, plays an important role in mature T cell activation and proliferation upon its translocation to the plasma membrane. PKCtheta is necessary for induction of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene because the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB, which are essential for IL-2 gene promoter activation, are main targets of PKCtheta. Recent studies revealed that PKCtheta provides an important survival signal that protects leukemic T cells from Fas- or UV-induced apoptosis. These findings and the constitutive localization of PKCq in the membrane of some leukemic T cells suggests that it plays a role in leukemic T cell survival and/or proliferation, and that selective PKCtheta-inhibitory strategies may facilitate elimination of malignant T cells. The high-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2Ralpha) is a major target of receptor-directed therapy in several human diseases, and it is constitutively expressed by the malignant cells in some T cell leukemias, suggesting an autocrine IL-2/IL-2R loop that participates in the expansion of leukemic IL-2R(+) cells. Therefore, given the essential role of PKCtheta in IL-2 production, IL-2 gene regulation by PKCtheta could also be of therapeutic interest.","['Villalba, Martin', 'Altman, Amnon']","['Villalba M', 'Altman A']","['Division of Cell Biology, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, 10355 Science Center Drive, San Diego, CA 92121, USA. villalba@liai.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immune System/physiology', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Isoenzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C-theta', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology']",2002/08/22 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/08/22 10:00'],"['2002/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1568009023333908 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2002 Jun;2(2):125-37. doi: 10.2174/1568009023333908.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCQ protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-theta)']",83,,"['CA 35299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 50819/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This problem is the main reason why current treatments for cancer are often ineffective. There have been remarkable advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of cancer that provides new selective tumor destruction mechanisms. The molecular characterization of the tumor-specific chromosomal abnormalities has revealed that fusion proteins are the consequence in the majority of cancers. These fusion proteins result from chimeric genes created by the translocations, which form chimeric mRNA species that contain exons from the genes involved in the translocation. Obviously, these chimeric molecules are attractive therapeutic targets since they are unique to the disease (they only exist in the tumor cells but not in the normal cells of the patient), allowing the design of specific anti-tumor drugs. Inhibition of chimeric gene expression by anti-tumor agents specifically kills leukemic cells without affecting normal cells. As therapeutic agents targeting chimeric genes, zinc-finger proteins, antisense RNAs or hammerhead-based ribozymes have been used. All of these agents have some limitations, indicating that new therapeutic tools are required as gene inactivating agents that should be able to inhibit any chimeric fusion gene product. Recently, we have used the catalytic RNA subunit of RNase P from Escherichia coli, which can be specifically directed to cut any mRNA sequence, to specifically destroy tumor-specific fusion genes created as a result of chromosomal translocations. In this chapter, we will review the advances made to selectively destroy tumor cells through specific inhibition of products resulting from chromosomal translocations.","['Rodriguez-Garcia, A', 'Sanchez-Martin, M', 'Perez-Losada, J', 'Perez-Mancera, P A', 'Sagrera-Aparisi, A', 'Gutierrez-Cianca, N', 'Cobaleda, C', 'Sanchez-Garcia, I']","['Rodriguez-Garcia A', 'Sanchez-Martin M', 'Perez-Losada J', 'Perez-Mancera PA', 'Sagrera-Aparisi A', 'Gutierrez-Cianca N', 'Cobaleda C', 'Sanchez-Garcia I']","['Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, CSIC/ Universidad de Salamanca, Campus Unamuno, Salamanca, 37.007, Spain. isg@gugu.usal.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Chimera', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Catalytic/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2002/08/22 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/08/22 10:00'],"['2002/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1568009013334214 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2001 Aug;1(2):109-19. doi: 10.2174/1568009013334214.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",80,,['1 R01 CA79955-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Reports on EBV-associated peripheral T-cell and NK-cell proliferative disease/lymphomas have been published elsewhere) In this study, the authors identified 58 patients; 14 were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B-cell origin (NHL-B), 8 were Hodgkin's disease, 6 were acute leukemia, 9 were systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and 21 were patients with other diseases. Serologic tests for the EBV infection, the study of EBV genome in circulating non-T-cells (CD3-cells) and T-cells (CD3+ cells), and the EBV-RNA study in the tumor cells were performed. EBV internal repeat-1 region (IR-1) in peripheral blood CD3+ cells was detected in 10 of 14 patients (71.5%) with NHL-B, 3 of 8 patients (37.5%) with Hodgkin's disease, 1 of 6 patients (16.7%) with acute leukemia, 4 of 9 patients (44.5%) with SLE, and was not detected in any of the 21 patients with other diseases. Anti-viral capsid antigen-IgG was significantly elevated in hematologic malignancy patients with EBV IR-1 genome in the peripheral blood CD3+ cells when compared to hematologic malignancy patients with a negative result, whereas there was no significant difference in anti-EBV nuclear antigen among these two groups. EBV-RNA expression in tumor cells by in situ hybridization was detected in 4 of 13 patients (31%) with NHL-B (all showed EBV IR-1 genome in peripheral blood CD3+ cells), and 3 of 5 patients (60%) with Hodgkin's disease (only two showed EBV IR-1 genome in peripheral blood CD3+ cells).

Studies of induction mechanisms for cell differentiation and discovery of differentiation-inducing factors are thus critical components of drug development. The Screening of differentiation-inducing factors, such as purified aldehyde reductase, a xenobiotic metabolite enzyme, that induces differentiation of human acute myeloid leukemia HL60 cells into monocyte/macrophage cells is described. Mechanisms of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation are also covered. RA is a potent inducer of HL60 cell differentiation and when used as a sole agent it can induce complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). While one mechanism of the effect of RA involves RA nuclear receptors, retinoylation (a posttranslational modification of proteins by RA) may be a new nongenomic mechanism by which RA acts on cells. An early event in RA-induced differentiation may be retinoylation of RII alpha (regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase), in which RII alpha units are retinoylated and the retinoylated RII alpha is then translocated to the nucleus. Drugs can also be combined with RA in RA-differentiation therapy. Cytodifferation therapy by RA in APL patients exhibits limitations due to the resistance of relapsed patients to further RA treatment. This may occur through the induction of expression of various genes that reduce RA blood concentrations. Treatment with combinations of RA and other agents may be one way to reduce induction of those genes. Good candidates for such agents include cAMP-elevating agents, retinoids, steroids, and fatty acids that synergistically induce differentiation of HL60 cells. Two derivatives of falconensone A, falconensone A p-bromophenylhydrazone, which has a bromophenyl residue, and falconensone A dioxime, which possesses a hydroxy residue, were synthesized to incorporate features of RA and N-[4-hydroxyphenyl] retinamide. Both derivatives have exhibited more potent biological activity than the parent falconensone A in vitro and in vivo.","['Takahashi, Noriko']",['Takahashi N'],"['Department of Health Chemistry, Hoshi University, 2-4-41 Ebara, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo 142-8501, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,IM,,"['Acylation', 'Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Ketosteroids', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Retinoids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Triglycerides']",2002/08/22 10:00,2002/10/17 04:00,['2002/08/22 10:00'],"['2002/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/17 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/yakushi.122.547 [doi]'],ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2002 Aug;122(8):547-63. doi: 10.1248/yakushi.122.547.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ketosteroids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '157414-01-2 (Mer NF8054X)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S05LZ624MF (tributyrin)']",79,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

U937 cells displayed a slight reduction in the number of cells in G(2)/M cell cycle phase after exposure to FTT, SC-10, R59022 and R59949, respectively. In contrast, HL-60 cells demonstrated a largely unaltered cell cycle distribution. Whereas TPA treatment resulted in a strong induction of p21(WAF/CIP1), c-Fos and c-Jun levels, neither one of the novel PKC activators altered expression of these proteins. Consequently, we tested the ability of the activators to cause membrane translocation of PKC. While TPA treatment resulted in translocation of the PKC isoforms alpha, delta and epsilon, SC-10 and FTT failed to induce alterations in the PKC content of the membrane and cytosolic fractions, respectively. Expression of the beta(2)-integrin CD11c that is induced during TPA-mediated differentiation remained unaltered after exposure to SC-10 and was partly reduced after treatment with FTT. To further investigate the effect of these activators upon apoptosis in leukemic cells, HL-60 and U937 cells were treated with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) or etoposide (VP-16). Whereas TPA strongly reduced apoptosis in Ara-C- or VP-16-treated U937 cells, little if any reduction was observed after pretreatment with either FTT, SC-10, R59022 or R59949, respectively, in these cells. In contrast, TPA enhanced apoptosis in Ara-C- or VP-16-treated HL-60 cells. Interestingly, FTT and SC-10 demonstrated a protective effect in Ara-C-treated HL-60 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the novel PKC activators FTT, SC-10, R59022 and R59949 exhibit modest biological effects upon leukemic blast cells, and are not capable of enhancing the apoptotic response of these cells to cytotoxic drugs.","['Meinhardt, Gerold', 'Eppinger, Elfriede', 'Schmidmaier, Ralf']","['Meinhardt G', 'Eppinger E', 'Schmidmaier R']","['Medizinische Klinik Innenstadt, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, 80336 Munich, Germany. geroldmeinhardt@yahoo.com.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD11c Antigen/biosynthesis', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Diacylglycerol Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Activators/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Farnesol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, fos/drug effects', 'Genes, jun/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/biosynthesis', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Triazoles/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/21 10:00,2003/02/06 04:00,['2002/08/21 10:00'],"['2002/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-200208000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2002 Aug;13(7):725-33. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200208000-00007.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Triazoles)', '102649-79-6 (N-(m-heptyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide)', '120166-69-0 (R 59949)', '156604-45-4 (farnesylthiotriazole)', '4602-84-0 (Farnesol)', '93076-89-2 (R 59022)', 'EC 2.7.1.107 (Diacylglycerol Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))']",,['Copyright 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After ligation with the CD33 on the cell surface, GO is internalized and hydrolyzed. Its two components are released into the cytoplasm and calicheamicin enters the nucleus where it associates with the DNA, causing double helix breaks and finally cell death. GO is in general well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effect observed is myelotoxicity, with prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Veno-occlusive disease of the liver is a less frequent but severe adverse effect. A phase II study points towards a percentage of overall hematologic response around 30% in the setting of refractory or relapsed disease.

COX is found in the 2 isoforms COX-1 (a constitutive form) and COX-2 (an inducible form). Due to the side effects associated with COX-1 inhibition there is great interest in selective COX-2 inhibition. We determined if COX-2 messenger (m)RNA and protein expression are regulated during ureteral obstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: mRNA analysis was performed using excess ureteral segments from 6 patients undergoing reconstructive procedures for chronic ureteral obstruction and 8 (normal ureter) undergoing donor nephrectomy after providing informed consent. All ureteral segments were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70C. RNA was isolated from the segments using phenol extraction and complementary DNA was synthesized by reverse transcription with murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp., Madison, Wisconsin). Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed using specific COX-2 gene primers with ribosomal S26 primers serving as the housekeeping gene. The polymerase chain reaction product was quantified by agarose gel electrophoresis and phospho-imaging. The ratio of COX-2-to-S26 mRNA was compared. Additional segments were homogenized and total protein was extracted, separated via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. These membranes were Western blotted for COX-2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (housekeeping protein) with specific primary and secondary antibodies. RESULTS: The mean ratio of COX-2-to-S26 mRNA plus or minus standard error at 20, 22 and 24 cycles of amplification was 0.22 +/- 0.04 in the 8 normal ureters compared with 1.01 +/- 0.21 in the 6 obstructed ureters (unpaired Student's t test p = 0.004). Similarly the mean ratio of COX-2-to-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein on immunoblotting was 0.15 +/- 0.02 in the 8 normal ureters compared with 0.59 +/- 0.10 in the 6 obstructed ureters (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that COX-2 mRNA and protein levels are up-regulated in chronically obstructed human ureters. Using selective COX-2 inhibitors may be useful for treating prostanoid induced effects associated with ureteral obstruction.","['Nakada, Stephen Y', 'Jerde, Travis J', 'Jacobson, Lynn M', 'Saban, Ricardo', 'Bjorling, Dale E', 'Hullett, Debra A']","['Nakada SY', 'Jerde TJ', 'Jacobson LM', 'Saban R', 'Bjorling DE', 'Hullett DA']","['Divisions of Urology and Transplantation, Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteins/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribosomal Proteins/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Ureter/*metabolism', 'Ureteral Obstruction/*metabolism']",2002/08/21 10:00,2002/09/19 10:01,['2002/08/21 10:00'],"['2002/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.ju.0000023404.44796.2f [doi]', 'S0022-5347(05)64630-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2002 Sep;168(3):1226-9. doi: 10.1097/01.ju.0000023404.44796.2f.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RPS26 protein, human)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, investigators may be interested in questions relating to subsequent relapsed disease. Linking administrative data to registry data, as in the creation of the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) and Medicare data set, can provide the ability to infer the occurrence of relapse in selected situations. METHODS: The authors created different algorithms to detect relapse of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). A retrospective cohort of patients with AML was identified, and both their billing data and medical records were obtained. The algorithms were then applied to the billing data, the results were compared with medical record review. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were identified, of whom 22 were treated for relapsed AML. The sensitivity of the best algorithm for detecting relapse was 86%, and the specificity 99%, with a positive predictive value of 95% and a negative predictive value of 96%. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of relapse from SEER-Medicare data using clinical algorithms is feasible for cancers where a majority of patients receive treatment for relapse, without a ""watch and wait"" strategy, and where that treatment is with a modality that can be detected in billing data (ie, intravenous chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, or all three). Optimal analytic situations are ones in which the investigator is mostly interested in positive predictive value, less interested in sensitivity, and wants to evaluate outcomes among those patients who receive treatment for their relapsed disease. However, the accuracy of such an approach for cancers other than AML has not yet been established.","['Earle, Craig C', 'Nattinger, Ann B', 'Potosky, Arnold L', 'Lang, Kathleen', 'Mallick, Rajiv', 'Berger, Mark', 'Warren, Joan L']","['Earle CC', 'Nattinger AB', 'Potosky AL', 'Lang K', 'Mallick R', 'Berger M', 'Warren JL']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. craig_earle@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Med Care,Medical care,0230027,IM,,"['Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Health Services Research', 'Humans', 'Insurance Claim Reporting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*SEER Program', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'United States/epidemiology']",2002/08/21 10:00,2002/09/12 10:01,['2002/08/21 10:00'],"['2002/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/00005650-200208001-00011 [doi]', '00005650-200208001-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Med Care. 2002 Aug;40(8 Suppl):IV-75-81. doi: 10.1097/00005650-200208001-00011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regulatory mechanism of endogenous cytokines in circulating platelet counts of thrombocytopenic patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is still not clear. METHODS: We measured the serum levels of both thrombopoietic and inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples collected from 52 patients with either AML or MDS along with 35 normal control samples. The levels of thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin (IL)-11, IL-6, IL-8 and stem cell factor (SCF) were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Platelet counts in the AML/MDS patients during initial diagnosis, chemotherapy and complete remission were 71.2 +/- 11.6, 47.2 +/- 6.1 and 181.4 +/- 26.3 x10(9)/l, respectively. The median value of TPO in AML/MDS patients during diagnosis was 150.6 pg/ml and increased significantly during chemotherapy (median: 828 pg/ml; p < 0.05) but then decreased following complete remission (median: 221.4 pg/ml). However, these levels were all significantly higher in patients than in normal subjects (p < 0.05, p < 0.05 and p < 0.05; respectively), and no significant change was noted in the levels of IL-11 and SCF during treatment of patients or in normal controls. The level of IL-6 was not detectable in normal serum samples but was markedly increased in the AML/MDS patients (median level during diagnosis: 6.7 pg/ml; chemotherapy: 25 pg/ml; complete remission: 7 pg/ml). The level of IL-8 in patients with AML and MDS was markedly elevated during diagnosis (median: 27.5 pg/ml; range: 0-1,587 pg/ml), but decreased to the level of the normal controls when patients were under chemotherapy or in complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: The endogenous levels of TPO, IL-6 and IL-8 are elevated in the thrombocytopenic patients with AML and MDS. Our results are consistent with previous mechanistic studies and suggest that TPO and IL-6 may be active mediators of platelet production.","['Hsu, Hui-Chi', 'Lee, Yuan-Ming', 'Tsai, Wen-Hui', 'Jiang, Mei-Lan', 'Ho, Chau-Hung', 'Ho, Chi-Kuan', 'Wang, Sheng-Yuan']","['Hsu HC', 'Lee YM', 'Tsai WH', 'Jiang ML', 'Ho CH', 'Ho CK', 'Wang SY']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei and National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Drug Therapy', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Interleukin-8/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/drug therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Stem Cell Factor/blood', 'Thrombopoietin/blood']",2002/08/21 10:00,2002/09/18 10:01,['2002/08/21 10:00'],"['2002/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['65722 [pii]', '10.1159/000065722 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2002;63(1):64-9. doi: 10.1159/000065722.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,"['Copyright 2002 S.

In our series of patients, TNF-alpha serum levels had an inverse correlation with hemoglobin levels (r = -0.813). In patients with anemia, the serum levels of TNF-alpha were significantly higher (p = 0.022) than in those without anemia (186.7 +/- 84.7 vs. 39.8 +/- 20.7 pg/ml). Serum Epo levels were also significantly (p = 0.0003) increased in CLL patients with anemia compared to those without (134.1 +/- 225.9 vs. 12.3 +/- 4.8 mU/ml). The ratio of observed/predicted (O/P) serum Epo was adequate (>0.8) for the degree of anemia in 70% of patients with anemia and inadequate in the remaining 30%. In the latter, the mean serum TNF-alpha level was significantly higher (p = 0.005) than the mean for the anemic cases with an adequate O/P ratio of serum Epo (234.1 vs. 166.4 pg/ml). These data suggest that although CLL anemia is not characterized by inadequate Epo production, in some CLL patients this factor may be correlated. In these cases, the levels of TNF-alpha were significantly higher than in other anemic cases. Compared to other CLL patients with anemia, these CLL patients might better respond to therapy with recombinant human Epo in pharmacological doses.","['Capalbo, S', 'Battista, C', 'Delia, M', 'Ciancio, A', 'De Santis, G', 'Dargenio, M', 'Diomede, D', 'Liso, V']","['Capalbo S', 'Battista C', 'Delia M', 'Ciancio A', 'De Santis G', 'Dargenio M', 'Diomede D', 'Liso V']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Bari, Italy. ematba@cimedoc.uniba.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/*blood/etiology', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Erythropoietin/*blood', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Transferrin/blood', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2002/08/21 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/08/21 10:00'],"['2002/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['aha08084 [pii]', '10.1159/000064751 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2002;108(2):84-9. doi: 10.1159/000064751.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,"['Copyright 2002 S.

ET can be difficult to distinguish from secondary (reactive) thrombocytosis, and the diagnosis of ET can only be made after the exclusion of other marrow disorders with similar features. Although ET has been assumed to be a clonal process, recent studies have suggested that a substantial number of cases classified as ET may actually not be clonal, and nonclonality may be associated with a lower risk of thrombosis. The lack of a characteristic cytogenetic marker for ET confounds analyses of clonality and offers no insight into disease pathogenesis. There is controversy over the proper classification of thrombocytosis associated with the pathological BCR-ABL gene rearrangement; such cases are not clearly distinguishable from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and should be provisionally classified as CML. New insights are emerging into the role of the megakaryocytopoiesis regulator thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor, c-Mpl, in ET and related disorders, but TPO-Mpl dynamics appear to be complex. In some familial thrombocythemic syndromes, mutations in the 5' untranslated region of TPO have recently been described, but these have not yet been observed in sporadic ET. In the future, global analysis of gene expression patterns may help overcome diagnostic dilemmas, refine disease classification, and lead to an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of ET.","['Steensma, David P', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Steensma DP', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/pathology', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Thrombopoietin/blood']",2002/08/21 10:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2002/08/21 10:00'],"['2002/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['aha08055 [pii]', '10.1159/000064754 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2002;108(2):55-65. doi: 10.1159/000064754.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",145,"['Copyright 2002 S.

To gain insight into the mechanisms of HTLV-1 latency, we have studied methylation of individual CpG sites in the U3-R region of the integrated proviral LTR by using bisulfite genomic sequencing methods. Surprisingly, our results reveal selective hypermethylation of the 5' LTR and accompanying hypomethylation of the 3' LTR in both latently infected cell lines and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells having a complete provirus. Moreover, we observed a lack of CpG methylation in the LTRs of 5'-defective proviruses recovered from ATL samples, which is consistent with the selective hypomethylation of the 3' LTR. Thus, the integrated HTLV-1 provirus in these carriers appears to be hypermethylated in the 5' LTR and hypomethylated in the 3' LTR. These results, together with the observation that proviral gene expression is reactivated by 5-azacytidine in latently infected cell lines, indicate that selective hypermethylation of the HTLV-1 5' LTR is common both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, hypermethylation of the 5' LTR appears to be an important mechanism by which HTLV-1 gene expression is repressed during viral latency.","['Koiwa, Tsukasa', 'Hamano-Usami, Akiko', 'Ishida, Takaomi', 'Okayama, Akihiko', 'Yamaguchi, Kazunari', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Watanabe, Toshiki']","['Koiwa T', 'Hamano-Usami A', 'Ishida T', 'Okayama A', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Kamihira S', 'Watanabe T']","['Division of Pathology, Department of Cancer Research, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier State/virology', 'Cell Line', 'CpG Islands/*physiology', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/*metabolism/physiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*physiology', '*Virus Latency']",2002/08/21 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/08/21 10:00'],"['2002/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.18.9389-9397.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Sep;76(18):9389-97. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.18.9389-9397.2002.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,PMC136445,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is followed by dispersal of ND10 constituents such as the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), CREB-binding protein (CBP), and Daxx. Numerous experiments have shown that this dispersal is mediated by ICP0. PML is thought to be the organizing structural component of ND10. To determine whether the virus targets PML because it is inimical to viral replication, telomerase-immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts and HEp-2 cells were transduced with wild-type baculovirus or a baculovirus expressing the M(r) 69,000 form of PML. The transduced cultures were examined for expression and localization of PML in mock-infected and HSV-1-infected cells. The results obtained from studies of cells overexpressing PML were as follows. (i) Transduced cells accumulate large amounts of unmodified and SUMO-I-modified PML. (ii) Mock-infected cells exhibited enlarged ND10 structures containing CBP and Daxx in addition to PML. (iii) In infected cells, ICP0 colocalized with PML in ND10 early in infection, but the two proteins did not overlap or were juxtaposed in orderly structures. (iv) The enlarged ND10 structures remained intact at least until 12 h after infection and retained CBP and Daxx in addition to PML. (v) Overexpression of PML had no effect on the accumulation of viral proteins representative of alpha, beta, or gamma groups and had no effect on the accumulation of infectious virus in cells infected with wild-type virus or a mutant (R7910) from which the alpha 0 genes had been deleted. These results indicate the following: (i) PML overexpressed in transduced cells cannot be differentiated from endogenous PML with respect to sumoylation and localization in ND10 structures. (ii) PML does not affect viral replication or the changes in the localization of ICP0 through infection. (iii) Disaggregation of ND10 structures is not an obligatory event essential for viral replication.","['Lopez, Pascal', 'Jacob, Robert J', 'Roizman, Bernard']","['Lopez P', 'Jacob RJ', 'Roizman B']","['The Marjorie B.

Since no significant alteration of c-myb expression was found in Abelson murine leukemia virus-induced pre-B-lymphomas harboring a provirus inserted within the Ahi-1 locus, this suggested that it harbors another gene whose dysregulation is involved in tumor formation. Here we report the identification of a novel gene (Ahi-1) targeted by these provirus insertional mutations and the cloning of its cDNA. The Ahi-1 proviral insertions were found at the 3' end of the gene, in an inverse transcriptional orientation, with most of them located around and downstream of the last exon, whereas another insertion was within intron 22. In addition, another previously identified provirus insertion site, Mis-2, was found to map within the 16th intron of the Ahi-1 gene. The Ahi-1 cDNA encodes a 1,047-amino-acid protein. The predicted Ahi-1 protein is a modular protein that contains one SH3 motif and seven WD40 repeats. The Ahi-1 gene is conserved in mammals and encodes two major RNA species of 5 and 4.2 kb and several other shorter splicing variants. The Ahi-1 gene is expressed in mouse embryos and in several organs of the mouse and rat, notably at high levels in the brain and testes. In tumor cells harboring insertional mutations in Ahi-1, truncated Ahi-1/viral fused transcripts were identified, including some splicing variants with deletion of the SH3 domain. Therefore, Ahi-1 is a novel gene targeted by provirus insertion and encoding a protein that exhibits several features of a signaling molecule. Thus, Ahi-1 may play an important role in signal transduction in normal cells and may be involved in tumor development, possibly in cooperation with other oncogenes (such as v-abl and c-myc) or with a tumor suppressor gene (Nf1), since Ahi-1 insertion sites were identified in tumors harboring v-abl defective retroviruses or a c-myc transgene or in tumors exhibiting deletion of Nf1.","['Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Hanna, Zaher', 'Kaouass, Mohammadi', 'Girard, Luc', 'Jolicoeur, Paul']","['Jiang X', 'Hanna Z', 'Kaouass M', 'Girard L', 'Jolicoeur P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Montreal, H2W 1R7 Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Exons/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', '*Proviruses', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rats', 'Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Virus Infections', '*Virus Integration', 'src Homology Domains/*genetics']",2002/08/21 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/08/21 10:00'],"['2002/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.18.9046-9059.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Sep;76(18):9046-59. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.18.9046-9059.2002.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Ahi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",,,,PMC136442,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-V3 antibodies (Abs) recognize both types of elements, but Abs which preferentially react to the conformational aspect of the epitopes may have more potent neutralizing activity against HIV-1, as recently suggested. To test this hypothesis, human anti-V3 monoclonal Abs (MAbs) were selected using a V3 fusion protein (V3-FP) which retains the conformation of the third variable region. The V3-FP consists of the V3(JR-CSF) sequence inserted into a truncated form of murine leukemia virus gp70. Six human MAbs which recognize epitopes at the crown of the V3 loop were selected with the V3-FP. They were found to react more strongly with molecules displaying conformationally intact V3 than with linear V3 peptides. In a virus capture assay, these MAbs showed cross-clade binding to native, intact virions of clades A, B, C, D, and F. No binding was found to isolates from subtype E. The neutralizing activity of MAbs against primary isolates was determined in three assays: the GHOST cell assay, a phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell assay, and a luciferase assay. While these new MAbs displayed various degrees of activity, the pattern of cross-clade neutralization of clades A, B, and F was most pronounced. The neutralization of clades C and D viruses was weak and sporadic, and neutralization of clade E by these MAbs was not detected. Analysis by linear regression showed a highly significant correlation (P < 0.0001) between the strength of binding of these anti-V3 MAbs to intact virions and the percent neutralization. These studies demonstrate that human MAbs to conformation-sensitive epitopes of V3 display cross-clade reactivity in both binding to native, intact virions and neutralization of primary isolates.","['Gorny, Miroslaw K', 'Williams, Constance', 'Volsky, Barbara', 'Revesz, Kathy', 'Cohen, Sandra', 'Polonis, Victoria R', 'Honnen, William J', 'Kayman, Samuel C', 'Krachmarov, Chavdar', 'Pinter, Abraham', 'Zolla-Pazner, Susan']","['Gorny MK', 'Williams C', 'Volsky B', 'Revesz K', 'Cohen S', 'Polonis VR', 'Honnen WJ', 'Kayman SC', 'Krachmarov C', 'Pinter A', 'Zolla-Pazner S']","['Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/chemistry/*immunology', '*Antibody Specificity', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes/chemistry/immunology', 'HIV Antibodies/biosynthesis/chemistry/*immunology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/*immunology', 'HIV-1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Peptide Fragments/*immunology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Virion/metabolism']",2002/08/21 10:00,2002/10/03 04:00,['2002/08/21 10:00'],"['2002/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/03 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.76.18.9035-9045.2002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Sep;76(18):9035-45. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.18.9035-9045.2002.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (HIV envelope protein gp120 (305-321))', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",,,"['R01 AI036085/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI36085/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL059725/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL59725/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI27742/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI027742/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC136433,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Colony-forming activity assays of normal bone marrow (BM) BFU-E and CFU-GM showed that CB significantly enhanced progenitor cell growth in comparison to PB. Apoptosis was determined by enumerating APO 2.7 mAb stained cells using flow cytometry. UT-7/EPO cell cultures subjected to PB exhibited a four-fold higher rate of apoptosis than CB exposed cultures, indicating that CB markedly suppressed apoptosis in this human leukemic cell line. Immunoprecipitation of UT-7/EPO cell lysates and immunodetection of the anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (4G10), revealed that CB induced tyrosine phosphorylation of three proteins, with approximate molecular masses of 160, 117.5 and 80 kDa.

Fifty patients with AML (4 M0, 8 M1, 16 M2, 5 M3, 7 M4, 6 M5, 4 M6) were included in this study. sL and sE selectins were evaluated at diagnosis, remission and in relapsed patients; whole membrane expression of L and E selectins by AML blast was investigated only at diagnosis. In addition, 15 normal persons were studied as a control group. sL and sE selectins were significantly higher in AML patients at diagnosis when compared to controls (P<0.01), but less at remission (P<0.01). Furthermore, elevated sL and sE selectin levels were detected in patients with AML at relapse. sE and sL selectins were significantly higher in AML patients with extramedullary infiltration as compared to patients without extramedullary disease (P<0.001). Membrane expression of L selectin was positive in 20% of AML patients. However, none of the patients showed significant E selectin expression. Patients with higher sE and sL selectins at diagnosis have high probability of relapse compared to those with normal levels (P<0.01 and <0.001, respectively). The overall relapse predictability of sE and sL selectins was 84%. Moreover, patients with higher sE and sL selectins levels had shorter event free survival than patients with lower levels (P<0.001 for both). The overall mortality prediction using sE, sL, and cellular L selectin was 96%. IN CONCLUSION: (1) AML blast cell express and release sL selectins but not sE selectin, (2) sE and sL selectins and cellular L selectin may be useful prognostic markers in evaluating AML patients at diagnosis.","['Aref, S', 'Salama, O', 'Al-Tonbary, Y', 'Fouda, M', 'Menessy, A', 'El-Sherbiny, M']","['Aref S', 'Salama O', 'Al-Tonbary Y', 'Fouda M', 'Menessy A', 'El-Sherbiny M']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'E-Selectin/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'L-Selectin/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/mortality', 'Leukemic Infiltration/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2002/08/21 10:00,2003/06/24 05:00,['2002/08/21 10:00'],"['2002/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2002/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10245330290028579 [doi]', 'DDBA4XC798994MU9 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2002 Apr;7(2):83-7. doi: 10.1080/10245330290028579.,"['0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now known that there are local RASs in many tissues. It has also recently been hypothesized that there exists a local bone marrow (BM) RAS with paracrine/autocrine pathobiological functions. The aim of this study was to detect BM and peripheral blood levels of the essential RAS components in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. Concentrations of renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were assayed in BM aspirates and in simultaneously drawn peripheral blood samples of 16 pre-chemotherapy leukemic and 10 post-treatment megaloblastic anemia patients with normal blood counts, as controls. In the leukemia group, the ACE concentration was found to be significantly higher in the BM (38+/-6.2 U/l) than in the peripheral blood (29.5+/-5.3 U/l), (p=0.029). In the leukemia group, although the BM renin concentration was higher than the peripheral blood levels (21.3+/-8.3 vs. 18.6+/-6.2 U/l), this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.196). In the control group, mean BM renin levels were insignificantly lower than in the peripheral blood (8.6+/-3 vs. 12.1+/-4.6 pg/ml) (p=0.059). In the leukemia group, serum ACE levels positively correlated with BM and peripheral blood blast percentages (p<0.05). Serum LDH level (p<0.01), BM blast (p<0.05) and peripheral blast percentages (p<0.01) were inversely correlated with serum potassium in the leukemia group.The results of this study can be considered as the preliminary evidence supporting the hypothesis of the presence of a local BM RAS. Further, molecular biologic and immunohistochemical studies are needed to shed light on this important subject. A better understanding of the interrelationships of RAS and hematopoiesis will bring new insights into the pathobiology and even novel therapies for such neoplastic diseases.","['Abali, Huseyin', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Celik, Ismail', 'Ozatli, Duzgun', 'Koray, Zehra', 'Caglar, Meltem']","['Abali H', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Goker H', 'Celik I', 'Ozatli D', 'Koray Z', 'Caglar M']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hacettepe University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey. habali@hacettepe.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/*metabolism', 'Blood/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/metabolism', 'Potassium/blood', 'Renin/metabolism', '*Renin-Angiotensin System']",2002/08/21 10:00,2003/06/24 05:00,['2002/08/21 10:00'],"['2002/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2002/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/10245330290022160 [doi]', '3YGK6R149DBMW8WP [pii]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2002 Apr;7(2):75-82. doi: 10.1080/10245330290022160.,"['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.15.1 (Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A)', 'EC 3.4.23.15 (Renin)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are reduced mainly in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and in other hematological disorders. However, there are very few reports in the literature concerning their expression in patients with acute leukemias (AL). We studied the CD55 and CD59 expression in 88 newly diagnosed patients with AL [65 with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) and 23 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)] using the sephacryl gel test, the Ham and sucrose lysis tests and we compared the results with patients' clinical data and disease course. Eight patients with PNH were also studied as controls. Red cell populations deficient in both CD55 and CD59 were detected in 23% of ANLL patients (especially of M(0), M(2) and M(6) FAB subtypes), 13% of ALL and in all PNH patients. CD55-deficient erythrocytes were found in 6 ANLL patients while the expression of CD59 was decreased in only 3 patients with ANLL. No ALL patient had an isolated deficiency of these antigens. There was no correlation between the existence of CD55 and/or CD59 deficiency and the percentage of bone marrow infiltration, karyotype or response to treatment. However no patient with M(3), M(5), M(7) subtype of ANLL and mature B- or T-cell ALL showed a reduced expression of both antigens. The deficient populations showed no alteration after chemotherapy treatment or during disease course. This study provides evidence about the lower expression of CD55 and CD59 in some AL patients and the correlation with their clinical data.

After transplantation, the patient developed chronic graft-versus-host disease, which was controlled with steroid agents. Interestingly, the recurrent ependymoma regressed steadily over the next 21 months posttransplant, until the tumor became almost undetectable on magnetic resonance images.

CONCLUSIONS: Together with facts that fetus is jeopardized with toxic metabolites of tobacco smoke which cause genotoxic effects or DNA adducts give additional arguments the necessity of introducing smoking cessation programs in perinatal care.","['Sipowicz, Marek A', 'Laudanski, Tadeusz']","['Sipowicz MA', 'Laudanski T']",['Zakladu Patofizjologii Ciazy Akademii Medycznej w Bialymstoku.'],['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Poland,Ginekol Pol,Ginekologia polska,0374641,IM,,"['Brain Neoplasms/etiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Maternal Behavior', '*Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Smoking Cessation']",2002/08/21 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/21 10:00'],"['2002/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ginekol Pol. 2002 Jun;73(6):546-52.,,50,,,,Palenie tytoniu w ciazy--efekty odlegle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STI571 (Gleevec), a novel anti-leukemia drug targeting BCR/ABL kinase can induce remissions of the Ph(1)-positive leukemias. STI571 was recently combined with the standard cytostatic drugs to achieve better therapeutic results and to overcome emerging drug resistance mechanisms. We decided to search for a more specific partner compound for STI571. Our previous studies showed that a signaling protein phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3k) is essential for the growth of CML cells, but not of normal hematopoietic cells (Blood, 86:726,1995). Therefore the anti- Ph(1)-leukemia effect of the combination of BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor STI571 and PI-3k inhibitor wortmannin (WT) or LY294002 (LY) was tested. We showed that STI571+WT exerted a synergistic effect against the Ph(1)-positive cell lines, but did not affect the growth of Ph(1)-negative cell line. Moreover, the combinations of STI571+WT or STI571+LY were effective in the inhibition of clonogenic growth of CML-chronic phase and CML-blast crisis patient cells, while sparing normal bone marrow cells. Single colony RT-PCR assay showed that colonies arising from the mixture of CML cells and normal bone marrow cells after treatment with STI571+WT were selectively depleted of BCR/ABL-positive cells. Biochemical analysis of the CML cells after the treatment revealed that combination of STI571+WT caused a more pronounced activation of caspase-3 and induced massive apoptosis, in comparison to STI571 and WT alone. In conclusion, combination of STI571+WT or STI571+LY may represent a novel approach against the Ph(1)-positive leukemias.","['Klejman, Agata', 'Rushen, Lori', 'Morrione, Andrea', 'Slupianek, Artur', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Klejman A', 'Rushen L', 'Morrione A', 'Slupianek A', 'Skorski T']","['Center for Biotechnology, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19122, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wortmannin']",2002/08/20 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/08/20 10:00'],"['2002/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2002/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2002/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1205724 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Aug 29;21(38):5868-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205724.,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,,"['CA87300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 DK02896/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OS rates were also different: 54 percent (95 percent CI: 48-57 percent) vs 70 percent (95 percent CI: 65-76 percent), respectively (p<0.01). Toxicity was mild and no therapy-related deaths were observed. At a median follow-up of 7.3 years, no second neoplasia or acute leukemia has been observed. The international prognostic index was not useful to define clinical risk in this selected group of patients. Multivariate analysis identified pleural and pericardial effusion and chemotherapy regimen as prognostic factors influencing FFS and OS. We feel that patients with PMBCL should be treated with more intensive, but not myeloablative chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to achieve an improvement in outcome in this setting of patients. Patients with pleural or pericardial effusion are considered at high risk for failure with the actual programs of treatment and probably will be considered for experimental therapeutic approaches.","['Aviles, A', 'Garcia, E L', 'Fernandez, R', 'Gonzalez, J L', 'Neri, N', 'Diaz-Maqueo, J C']","['Aviles A', 'Garcia EL', 'Fernandez R', 'Gonzalez JL', 'Neri N', 'Diaz-Maqueo JC']","['Research Unit in Oncology Diseases, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Apartado Postal 7-1220, 06700, Mexico D.F., Mexico. agaviles@avantel.net']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20020621,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2002/08/20 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/20 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-002-0473-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2002 Jul;81(7):368-73. doi: 10.1007/s00277-002-0473-4.

Patients receiving the M-80 regimen experienced higher platelet toxicity (P=0.05), vomiting (P<0.0003), and mucositis. Also, the need for red blood cell transfusions was higher in the M-80 group. Median overall survival was 60 days. Overall survival was better in patients achieving complete or partial response. In conclusion, our study illustrates that intermediate doses of melphalan plus dexamethasone are an effective chemotherapy regimen for this aggressive disease. Response to treatment is the only prognostic factor for survival in these patients.","['Vela-Ojeda, J', 'Garcia-Ruiz Esparza, M A', 'Rosas-Cabral, A', 'Padilla-Gonzalez, Y', 'Garcia-Chavez, J', 'Tripp-Villanueva, F', 'Sanchez-Cortes, E', 'Ayala-Sanchez, M', 'Garcia-Leon, L D', 'Montiel-Cervantes, L', 'Rubio-Borja, M E']","['Vela-Ojeda J', 'Garcia-Ruiz Esparza MA', 'Rosas-Cabral A', 'Padilla-Gonzalez Y', 'Garcia-Chavez J', 'Tripp-Villanueva F', 'Sanchez-Cortes E', 'Ayala-Sanchez M', 'Garcia-Leon LD', 'Montiel-Cervantes L', 'Rubio-Borja ME']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital de Especialidades Centro Medico Nacional La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Apartado Postal 14-878, Codigo postal 07001, Mexico D.F., Mexico. velaj12x@prodigy.net.mx']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20020625,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2002/08/20 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2002/08/20 10:00'],"['2002/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2002/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-002-0480-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2002 Jul;81(7):362-7. doi: 10.1007/s00277-002-0480-5.

We infected Cdkn2a(-/-) mice with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) to screen for loci that can participate in tumorigenesis in collaboration with loss of the Cdkn2a-encoded tumor suppressors p16INK4a and p19ARF. Insertional mutagenesis by the latent retrovirus was synergistic with loss of Cdkn2a expression, as indicated by a marked acceleration in the development of both myeloid and lymphoid tumors. We isolated 747 unique sequences flanking retroviral integration sites and mapped them against the mouse genome sequence databases from Celera and Ensembl. In addition to 17 insertions targeting gene loci known to be cancer-related, we identified a total of 37 new common insertion sites (CISs), of which 8 encode components of signaling pathways that are involved in cancer. The effectiveness of large-scale insertional mutagenesis in a sensitized genetic background is demonstrated by the preference for activation of MAP kinase signaling, collaborating with Cdkn2a loss in generating the lymphoid and myeloid tumors. Collectively, our results show that large-scale retroviral insertional mutagenesis in genetically predisposed mice is useful both as a system for identifying genes underlying cancer and as a genetic framework for the assignment of such genes to specific oncogenic pathways.","['Lund, Anders H', 'Turner, Geoffrey', 'Trubetskoy, Alla', 'Verhoeven, Els', 'Wientjens, Ellen', 'Hulsman, Danielle', 'Russell, Robert', 'DePinho, Ronald A', 'Lenz, Jack', 'van Lohuizen, Maarten']","['Lund AH', 'Turner G', 'Trubetskoy A', 'Verhoeven E', 'Wientjens E', 'Hulsman D', 'Russell R', 'DePinho RA', 'Lenz J', 'van Lohuizen M']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20020819,United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/deficiency/*genetics', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics']",2002/08/20 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/08/20 10:00'],"['2002/08/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ng956 [doi]', 'ng956 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2002 Sep;32(1):160-5. doi: 10.1038/ng956.

The retroviral integration sites (RISs) in these tumors thus provide powerful genetic tags for the discovery of genes involved in cancer. Here we report the first large-scale use of retroviral tagging for cancer gene discovery in the post-genome era. Using high throughput inverse PCR, we cloned and analyzed the sequences of 884 RISs from a tumor panel composed primarily of B-cell lymphomas. We then compared these sequences, and another 415 RIS sequences previously cloned from BXH2 myeloid leukemias and from a few AKXD lymphomas, against the recently assembled mouse genome sequence. These studies identified 152 loci that are targets of retroviral integration in more than one tumor (common retroviral integration sites, CISs) and therefore likely to encode a cancer gene. Thirty-six CISs encode genes that are known or predicted to be genes involved in human cancer or their homologs, whereas others encode candidate genes that have not yet been examined for a role in human cancer. Our studies demonstrate the power of retroviral tagging for cancer gene discovery in the post-genome era and indicate a largely unrecognized complexity in mouse and presumably human cancer.","['Suzuki, Takeshi', 'Shen, Haifa', 'Akagi, Keiko', 'Morse, Herbert C', 'Malley, James D', 'Naiman, Daniel Q', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Copeland, Neal G']","['Suzuki T', 'Shen H', 'Akagi K', 'Morse HC', 'Malley JD', 'Naiman DQ', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG']","['Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20020819,United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,IM,,"['Animals', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2002/08/20 10:00,2002/09/28 04:00,['2002/08/20 10:00'],"['2002/08/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ng949 [doi]', 'ng949 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2002 Sep;32(1):166-74. doi: 10.1038/ng949.

Schwartz, a cancer patient at Massachusetts General Hospital, founded the Kenneth B. Schwartz Center. The Schwartz Center is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and advancing compassionate health care delivery, which provides hope to the patient, support to caregivers, and sustenance to the healing process. The center sponsors the Schwartz Center Rounds, a monthly multidisciplinary forum where caregivers reflect on important psychosocial issues faced by patients, their families, and their caregivers and gain insight and support from fellow staff members. When a competent adult patient refuses lifesaving treatment for religious or personal reasons, caregivers have a legal obligation to respect this decision. A patient's refusal of treatment adds particular challenges to the delivery of compassionate care. The case of a 50-year-old Jehovah's Witness with acute myelocytic leukemia who declined blood product support is presented. Respecting her religious beliefs during chemotherapy required balancing risk and benefit, watching her suffer while unable to intervene with what the staff saw as simple treatment, and eventually undertaking a complicated grief process. Jehovah's Witness beliefs regarding blood products are reviewed. Caregiver roles and responsibilities are discussed in the context of psychosocial, legal, familial, and ethical issues.","['Knuti, Kristine A', 'Amrein, Philip C', 'Chabner, Bruce A', 'Lynch, Thomas J Jr', 'Penson, Richard T']","['Knuti KA', 'Amrein PC', 'Chabner BA', 'Lynch TJ Jr', 'Penson RT']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,IM,,"['*Blood Transfusion', 'Christianity', 'Decision Making', 'Ethics, Medical', '*Faith Healing', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Identity Crisis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Religion', 'Treatment Refusal']",2002/08/20 10:00,2002/10/19 04:00,['2002/08/20 10:00'],"['2002/08/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/theoncologist.7-4-371 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2002;7(4):371-80. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.7-4-371.,,,,,,,,,,"['KIE: 115076', 'NRCBL: VF 8.3.4']",['KIE'],"['Professional Patient Relationship', 'Religious Approach']",['KIE: KIE Bib: treatment refusal'],,,,,,,,

Sequence alignment with the MLV C-tail led to the identification of a conserved hydrophobic protease cleavage motif located in the centre of retroviral Env protein C-tails. Expression of Env proteins, truncated at the predicted cleavage sites, of spleen necrosis virus (SNV), gibbon ape leukaemia virus and porcine endogenous retroviruses resulted in cell-cell fusion as monitored by microscopy and reporter gene fusion assays. Western blot analysis of MLV particles pseudotyped with the SNV Env protein demonstrated proteolytic cleavage of the SNV R-peptide by the MLV protease.

Peptides derived from the aa 78-98 region in the Vif molecule specifically inhibit and bind the HIV-1 protease in vitro and arrest the production of infectious viruses in HIV-1-infected cells. This study demonstrates that (i) purified recombinant Vif protein and HIV-1 but not avian sarcoma leukaemia virus protease specifically bind each other and (ii) the interaction between these two proteins takes place at the N terminus of the protease (aa 1-9) and the central part of Vif (aa 78-98).

In aGVHD patients, there were marked increases in the proportion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells that express IL-18Ralpha. RT-PCR assays showed elevation of IL-18Ralpha and IL-18Rbeta mRNA levels in CD8+ T cells in aGVHD patients.

The purpose of this investigation was to quantify CD34+ progenitor cells and to determine their dynamics during the post-transplant period. Moreover, we tried to correlate their number with corresponding changes in the amount of nucleated erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes including pro- and megakaryoblasts and the fiber content. Monitoring the quantity of precursors after BMT revealed a very rapid recovery in comparison to a control group. However, a more detailed evaluation showed that at day 22 +/- 6 a higher number of progenitor cells was significantly associated with an earlier independence for platelet transfusion and also with a more pronounced growth of erythro- and megakaryopoiesis including their precursor cells. Furthermore, a slight increase in the density of the fibrous matrix (reticulin fibers) was present in these patients that were characterized by a more favorable engraftment. The latter feature sheds some light on the complex pathomechanisms of homing and differentiation of progenitors. In confirmation with in vitro findings, this phenomenon is dependent on proper anchoring sites to the fibrous bone marrow stroma. Finally, the size of a full BM graft exerted a distinctive influence on the number of CD34+ precursors in the early post-transplant period. In conclusion, the present study has validated a number of BM features by focusing on the CD34+ progenitor cells and associated hematopoietic reconstitution including reticulin fibers and precursor cells of the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineage, which are not readily evaluable by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.","['Thiele, Juergen', 'Kvasnicka, Hans Michael', 'Beelen, Dietrich Wilhelm', 'Cicek, Guelken', 'Leder, Lutz-Dietrich', 'Schaefer, Ulrich Wilhelm']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Beelen DW', 'Cicek G', 'Leder LD', 'Schaefer UW']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, D-50924 Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Count', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stromal Cells', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/08/20 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/08/20 10:00'],"['2002/08/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/08/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/15258160260091022 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2002 Jun;11(3):565-74. doi: 10.1089/15258160260091022.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Silencing has been shown to be particularly robust when stem cells are used for transduction, posing a significant problem for gene therapy of hematologic diseases. Stability of proviral expression with newer generation vectors is significantly improved over that obtainable with original vectors based on Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV). However, strategies to increase resistance further to retroviral silencing are needed, because newer generation vectors have been shown to remain prone to a significant degree of silencing that could limit their efficacy as gene therapy vectors. Proviral silencing has been attributed to known mechanisms of cellular gene repression, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, as well as uncharacterized mechanisms that act independently of DNA methylation. A further understanding of transcriptional silencing that occurs in stem cells and during hematopoietic development is needed for design of effective vectors for gene therapy of hematologic diseases.","['Swindle, C Scott', 'Klug, Christopher A']","['Swindle CS', 'Klug CA']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294-3300, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,IM,,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Therapy/standards', 'Genetic Vectors/adverse effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transduction, Genetic/standards']",2002/08/20 10:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2002/08/20 10:00'],"['2002/08/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2002/08/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/15258160260090915 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2002 Jun;11(3):449-56. doi: 10.1089/15258160260090915.,,74,,['T32 AI007051/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Children with ALL (n = 61) participated. At diagnosis, during therapy, and one year after cessation of therapy, BMD and body composition were measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry of lumbar spine (LS) and total body (TB). Serum markers of bone turnover were assessed. RESULTS: BMD(LS) was significantly reduced at diagnosis, and remained low during therapy. BMD(TB) was normal at diagnosis, with a fast decrease in the first 32 weeks, in which chemotherapy was relatively intensive. Apparent (""volumetric"") BMD(LS) was also reduced, but this did not reach significance at diagnosis and follow-up. Bone formation markers were reduced at diagnosis; formation as well as resorption markers increased during treatment. Fracture rate was 6 times higher in ALL patients compared with healthy controls. Lean body mass was decreased at baseline. Percentage of body fat increased significantly during therapy. After ALL treatment was completed, BMD and body composition tended to improve. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL are at risk for osteopenia because of the disease itself and the intensive chemotherapy. Fracture rate increases substantially, not only during but also shortly after treatment.","['van der Sluis, Inge M', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Hahlen, Karel', 'Krenning, Eric P', 'de Muinck Keizer-Schrama, Sabine M P F']","['van der Sluis IM', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Hahlen K', 'Krenning EP', 'de Muinck Keizer-Schrama SM']","[""Division of Endocrinology and Oncology-Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,IM,['J Pediatr. 2003 Sep;143(3):412; author reply 412.

Emerging evidence implicates Rho GTPases in these biological events. However, Plexins lack any known catalytic activity in their conserved cytoplasmic tails, and how they transduce signals from semaphorins to Rho is still unknown. Here we show that Plexin B2 associates directly with two members of a recently identified family of Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology containing guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho, PDZ-RhoGEF, and Leukemia-associated Rho GEF (LARG). This physical interaction is mediated by their PDZ domains and a PDZ-binding motif found only in Plexins of the B family. In addition, we show that ligand-induced dimerization of Plexin B is sufficient to stimulate endogenous RhoA potently and to induce the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Moreover, overexpression of the PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF but not its regulator of G protein signaling domain prevents cell rounding and neurite retraction of differentiated PC12 cells induced by activation of endogenous Plexin B1 by semaphorin 4D. The association of Plexins with LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF thus provides a direct molecular mechanism by which semaphorins acting on Plexin B can control Rho, thereby regulating the actin-cytoskeleton during axonal guidance and cell migration.","['Perrot, Valerie', 'Vazquez-Prado, Jose', 'Gutkind, J Silvio']","['Perrot V', 'Vazquez-Prado J', 'Gutkind JS']","['Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4340, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20020814,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Gene Library', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Glutamate/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",2002/08/17 10:00,2003/02/07 04:00,['2002/08/17 10:00'],"['2002/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/07 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M206005200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71912-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Nov 8;277(45):43115-20. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M206005200.

Potentiation was associated with a decrease in free thymidylate synthase from preexisting levels. To further investigate the action of rMETase on CCRF-CEM cells, in the present study we explored the effects of rMETase as a single agent on DNA methylation levels and DNA synthesis, which may be changed as a result of deprivation of methionine. Cells treated with rMETase under subcytotoxic conditions contained significantly lower levels of genomic methylated DNA than did control cells, as demonstrated by incorporation of the methyl radical of [methyl-(3)H]S-adenosylmethionine in DNA and by use of methylation-sensitive arbitrarily primed PCR. DNA hypomethylation produced by rMETase was of similar magnitude as that produced with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine. Cells exposed to rMETase synthesized significantly more DNA than did untreated cells. Incorporation of [6-3H]thymidine and [6-3H]2'-deoxyuridine in these cells was augmented over that in control by mean factors of 1.78 and 2.36, respectively. Increased 3H nucleoside incorporation resulted in greater numbers of nuclear grains as demonstrated by autoradiography. The increase in DNA synthesis induced by rMETase is likely to result from enhancement of DNA repair because it was not accompanied by differences in cell cycle phase distribution or in total DNA content as determined by flow cytometry.

On the basis of these data, the likely locations of breast cancer tumor suppressor genes are bands 16q22.1 and 16q24.3. We have mapped the CBFA2T3 (MTG16) gene, previously cloned as a fusion partner of the AML1 protein from a rare (16;21) leukemia translocation, to the 16q24.3 breast cancer LOH region. The expression of CBFA2T3 was significantly reduced in a number of breast cancer cell lines and in primary breast tumors, including early ductal carcinomas in situ, when compared with nontransformed breast epithelial cell lines and normal breast tissue. Reintroduction of CBFA2T3 into different breast tumor derived cell lines with decreased expression of this gene reduced colony growth on plastic and in soft agar. CBFA2T3 was shown to function as a transcriptional repressor when tethered to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in a reporter gene assay and, therefore, has the potential to be a transcriptional repressor in normal breast epithelial cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that CBFA2T3 is a likely candidate for the breast cancer tumor suppressor gene that is the target for the frequent 16q24 LOH in breast neoplasms.","['Kochetkova, Marina', 'McKenzie, Olivia L D', 'Bais, Anthony J', 'Martin, Julie M', 'Secker, Genevieve A', 'Seshadri, Ram', 'Powell, Jason A', 'Hinze, Susan J', 'Gardner, Alison E', 'Spendlove, Hayley E', ""O'Callaghan, Nathan J"", 'Cleton-Jansen, Anne-Marie', 'Cornelisse, Cees', 'Whitmore, Scott A', 'Crawford, Joanna', 'Kremmidiotis, Gabriel', 'Sutherland, Grant R', 'Callen, David F']","['Kochetkova M', 'McKenzie OL', 'Bais AJ', 'Martin JM', 'Secker GA', 'Seshadri R', 'Powell JA', 'Hinze SJ', 'Gardner AE', 'Spendlove HE', ""O'Callaghan NJ"", 'Cleton-Jansen AM', 'Cornelisse C', 'Whitmore SA', 'Crawford J', 'Kremmidiotis G', 'Sutherland GR', 'Callen DF']","[""Department of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Women's and Children's Hospital, North Adelaide 5006, South Australia, Australia. marinak@wch.bionomics.com.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', '*Phosphoproteins', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2002/08/17 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2002/08/17 10:00'],"['2002/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Aug 15;62(16):4599-604.,"['0 (CBFA2T3 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among NUP98 fusion partner genes, HOXA and HOXD clusters have been reported thus far; however, no HOXC or HOXB clusters have been reported. We identified a novel NUP98-HOXC11 fusion gene in a pediatric patient with de novo acute myeloid leukemia having t(11;12)(p15;q13). The breakpoint of NUP98 was located within a LINE repetitive sequence (HAL1) in intron 12, and the breakpoint of HOXC11 was located within exon 1, resulting in a NUP98-HOXC11 in-frame fusion transcript containing exon 12 of NUP98 fused to a part of exon 1 of HOXC11 with an 8-bp insertion derived from the intron sequence just 5' of the breakpoint of NUP98. The NUP98-HOXC11 fusion protein consists of the NH2-terminal phenylalanine-glycine repeat motif of NUP98 and the COOH-terminal homeodomain of HOXC11. Although the frequency of HOXC11 expression was not high in leukemia cell lines, its expression was significantly more frequent in myeloid than lymphoid leukemia cell lines.

Haematological disorders (73%) including stem-cell transplantation (36%), solid-organ transplantations (10%) and AIDS (9%) were the main underlying conditions. The crude mortality was 63%. Incidence of IA was 8% (CI(95): 6.5-9.5) in acute myelocytic leukaemia and 6.3% (CI(95): 4.3-8.3) in acute lymphocytic leukaemia.

To investigate the mechanism involved in their interaction, we examined the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the differentiation of ML-1 cells to mature macrophages. We found that the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203 suppressed the morphological change and the alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase activity induced in ML-1 cells by treatment with KH1060 plus TPA. This treatment increased the translocation of PKC alpha, PKC epsilon, and PKC theta from cytosol to membranes. ML-1 cells treated with KH1060 alone increased translocation of PKC theta, whereas cells treated with TPA alone increased translocation of PKC alpha and PKC epsilon. These data showed that in human myeloblastic leukemia cells, diverse isoforms of PKC, including PKC alpha, epsilon, and theta, participate in the regulation of cell differentiation.","['Shimizu, Takahisa', 'Taira, Nozomi', 'Senou, Mana', 'Takeda, Ken']","['Shimizu T', 'Taira N', 'Senou M', 'Takeda K']","['Department of Hygiene-Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Science University of Tokyo, 12 Ichigaya, Funagawara-Machi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-0826, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,,"['Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Protein Kinase C-epsilon', 'Protein Kinase C-theta', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/17 10:00,2002/12/13 04:00,['2002/08/17 10:00'],"['2002/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/13 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0304383502002355 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(02)00235-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2002 Dec 1;186(1):67-74. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(02)00235-5.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '131875-08-6 (KH 1060)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCQ protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-epsilon)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-theta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, intact alpha-actinin, which is a 100-kDa actin-binding protein, has no differentiating activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the enzyme responsible for the degradation of alpha-actinin to form this fragment, named mactinin. The ability of cell lysates to degrade [125I]alpha-actinin in the presence of various enzyme inhibitors, including inhibitors of metalloproteinases, cysteine proteinases, and serine proteases, was measured. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was the only inhibitor able to prevent formation of mactinin by cell lysate degradation of alpha-actinin, suggesting that a serine protease is responsible for the digestion. Of the various serine proteases tested (thrombin, plasmin, and urokinase), only urokinase was able to produce a 31-kDa band. The urokinase-generated 31-kDa band promoted maturation in HL-60 cells. Amiloride, a specific inhibitor of urokinase, inhibited production of the 31-kDa alpha-actinin fragment by HL-60 cell lysates. For in vivo tests, inflammatory fluid (from bronchoalvelolar lavage) was collected from uPA (urokinase) knockout mice and their wild-type counterparts after intratracheal challenge with Pneumocystis carinii. Although most (6 of 8) wild-type mice had mactinin in their inflammatory fluid samples, none (0 of 8) of the uPA knockout mice had mactinin present (P<0.01). These results demonstrate that urokinase is necessary and sufficient for the formation of the monocyte/macrophage maturation promoting fragment, mactinin, in vitro and in vivo. These findings support the role of urokinase in the regulation of monocyte/macrophage functions, such as that occurring in inflammatory reactions.","['Luikart, Sharon', 'Masri, Mohammed', 'Wahl, Dan', 'Hinkel, Tim', 'Beck, James M', 'Gyetko, Margaret R', 'Gupta, Pankaj', 'Oegema, Theodore']","['Luikart S', 'Masri M', 'Wahl D', 'Hinkel T', 'Beck JM', 'Gyetko MR', 'Gupta P', 'Oegema T']","['Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN, USA. sharon.luikart@med.va.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,,"['Actinin/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Amiloride/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Environment', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tosyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2002/08/17 10:00,2002/09/24 06:00,['2002/08/17 10:00'],"['2002/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2002/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0167488902002550 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4889(02)00255-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2002 Aug 19;1591(1-3):99-107. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4889(02)00255-0.,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tosyl Compounds)', '0 (mactinin, human)', '11003-00-2 (Actinin)', '455-16-3 (4-toluenesulfonyl fluoride)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",,,"['HL 57011/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 59823/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 60020/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It remains unknown whether MEK/ERK-mediated signals affect ionizing radiation (IR)-induced cell death. Here we demonstrate that MEK/ERK-mediated signals selectively inhibit IR-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and subsequent cell death. In Jurkat cells, TPA strongly activated ERK and inhibited the IR-induced caspase-8/Bid cleavage and the loss of DeltaPsi(m). The inhibitory effect of TPA was mostly abrogated by pretreatment of a specific MEK inhibitor PD98059, indicating that the effect depends upon MEK/ERK-mediated signals. Moreover, BAF-B03 transfectants expressing IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) beta(c) chain lacking the acidic region, which is responsible for MEK/ERK-mediated signals, revealed higher sensitivity to IR than the transfectants expressing wild-type IL-2R. Interestingly, the signals could neither protect the DeltaPsi(m) loss nor cell death in UV-irradiated cells. These data imply that the anti-apoptotic effect of MEK/ERK-mediated signals appears to selectively inhibit the IR-induced cell death through protection of the DeltaPsi(m) loss. Our data enlighten an anti-apoptotic function of MEK/ERK pathway against IR-induced apoptosis, thereby implying its contribution to radioresistance.","['Shonai, T', 'Adachi, M', 'Sakata, K', 'Takekawa, M', 'Endo, T', 'Imai, K', 'Hareyama, M']","['Shonai T', 'Adachi M', 'Sakata K', 'Takekawa M', 'Endo T', 'Imai K', 'Hareyama M']","['Department of Radiology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S-1, W-16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,,"['BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/*enzymology/radiation effects', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/*enzymology/radiation effects', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*enzymology/radiation effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/drug effects/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/drug effects/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Radiation Tolerance/drug effects/physiology', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2002/08/16 10:00,2003/02/08 04:00,['2002/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2002/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/08 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4401050 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2002 Sep;9(9):963-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401050.,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This seemed to be mediated by 1) persistent phosphorylation on the Tyr(15) residue of Cdk2 and 2) an increased association of Cdk2 with p21. S-phase arrest was also associated with an increase in Chk1 kinase activity. Concomitantly, the activity of Cdc25A phosphatase was decreased. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated complexes of Cdk2, Cdc25A, and Chk1. The addition of the Chk1 kinase inhibitor 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) to F-ara-A-arrested S-phase cells resulted in a rapid decrease in the fraction of cells with an S-phase DNA content and a corresponding increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells. Under these conditions, the kinase activity of Chk1 was reduced, Cdc25A phosphatase activity was increased, the level of Tyr(15) phosphorylation of Cdk2 was reduced, and the kinase activity associated with immunoprecipitates of Cdk2 and cyclin A was reactivated. UCN-01 also had no effect on the association of p21 with Cdk2. Lastly, cells incubated with UCN-01 before F-ara-A addition did not arrest in S-phase. Thus, the DNA damage induced by F-ara-A initiated a hierarchical regulatory cascade through Chk1 and Cdc25A that resulted in Cdk2 inhibition, affecting an S-phase checkpoint that was dysregulated by UCN-01.

In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effect and mechanisms of action of As(2)O(3) in human tumor cell lines. As(2)O(3) caused inhibition of cell growth (IC(50) range, 3-14 microM) in a variety of human solid tumor cell lines, including four human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines (H460, H322, H520, H661), two ovarian cancer cell lines (SK-OV-03, A2780), cervical cancer HeLa, and breast carcinoma MCF-7, as assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Flow cytometry analysis showed that As(2)O(3) treatment resulted in a time-dependent accumulation of cells in the G(2)/M phase. We observed, using Wright-Giemsa and 4',6-diamidine-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride staining, that As(2)O(3) blocked the cell cycle in mitosis. In vitro examination revealed that As(2)O(3) markedly promoted tubulin polymerization without affecting GTP binding to beta-tubulin. Immunocytochemical and EM studies of treated MCF-7 cells showed that As(2)O(3) treatment caused changes in the cellular microtubule network and formation of polymerized microtubules. Similar to most anti-tubulin agents, As(2)O(3) treatment induced up-regulation of the cyclin B1 levels and activation of p34(cdc2)/cyclinB1 kinase, as well as Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, activation of caspase-3 and -7 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and beta-catenin occurred only in As(2)O(3)-induced mitotic cells, not in interphase cells, suggesting that As(2)O(3)-induced mitotic arrest may be a requirement for the activation of apoptotic pathways. In addition, As(2)O(3) exhibited similar inhibitory effects against parental MCF-7, P-glycoprotein-overexpressing MCF-7/doxorubicin cells, and multidrug resistance protein (MRP)-expressing MCF-7/etoposide cells (resistance indices, 2.3 and 1.9, respectively). Similarly, As(2)O(3) had similar inhibitory effect against parental ovarian carcinoma A2780 cells and tubulin mutation paclitaxel-resistant cell lines PTx10 and PTx22 (resistance indices, 0.86 and 0.93, respectively), suggesting that its effect on tubulin polymerization and G(2)/M phase arrest is distinct from that of paclitaxel. Taken together, our data demonstrate that As(2)O(3) has a paclitaxel-like effect, markedly promotes tubulin polymerization, arrests cell cycle at mitosis, and induces apoptosis. In addition, As(2)O(3) is a poor substrate for transport by P-glycoprotein and MRP, and non-cross-resistant with paclitaxel resistant cell lines due to tubulin mutation, suggesting that As(2)O(3) may be useful for treatment of human solid tumors, particularly in patients with paclitaxel resistance.","['Ling, Yi-He', 'Jiang, Jian-Dong', 'Holland, James F', 'Perez-Soler, Roman']","['Ling YH', 'Jiang JD', 'Holland JF', 'Perez-Soler R']","['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA. yling@aecom.yu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymers', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/16 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/08/16 10:00'],"['2002/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.62.3.529 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2002 Sep;62(3):529-38. doi: 10.1124/mol.62.3.529.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tubulin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,['CA50270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the ability of LEF to induce differentiation of a human erythroleukemia (K562) cell line and show that LEF induces a dose- and time-dependent differentiation of these cells as characterized by growth inhibition, hemoglobin production, and erythroid membrane protein glycophorin A expression. This effect was dependent on depletion of the intracellular pyrimidine ribonucleotides (UTP and CTP), and preceded by a specific S-phase arrest of the cell cycle. Supplementation of the cultures with exogenous uridine restored intracellular UTP and CTP to normal levels and prevented the LEF-induced cell cycle block and differentiation of K562 cells. Interestingly, addition of cytidine alone blocked the LEF-induced differentiation of K562 cells but only restored the CTP pool. By contrast, neither deoxycytidine nor thymidine prevented the effects of LEF on these cells. Similarly, pyrimidine starvation of a cell line lacking the de novo pyrimidine pathway (G9c) resulted in an S-phase arrest that was reversed by the addition of cytidine. Thus these studies demonstrate an important role for CTP in regulating cell cycle progression and show that LEF is an effective inducer of tumor cell differentiation through depletion of this ribonucleotide.","['Huang, Min', 'Wang, Yanhong', 'Collins, Matthew', 'Mitchell, Beverly S', 'Graves, Lee M']","['Huang M', 'Wang Y', 'Collins M', 'Mitchell BS', 'Graves LM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Aspartate Carbamoyltransferase/deficiency/metabolism', 'Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Glutamine-Hydrolyzing)/deficiency/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Crotonates', 'Cytidine/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Dihydroorotase/deficiency/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Glycophorins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydroxybutyrates/*pharmacology', 'Isoxazoles/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leflunomide', 'Multienzyme Complexes/deficiency/metabolism', 'Nitriles', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Toluidines', 'Uridine/pharmacology', 'Uridine Triphosphate/metabolism']",2002/08/16 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/08/16 10:00'],"['2002/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.62.3.463 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2002 Sep;62(3):463-72. doi: 10.1124/mol.62.3.463.,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (CAD trifunctional enzyme)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Crotonates)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Hydroxybutyrates)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Toluidines)', '1C058IKG3B (teriflunomide)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '65-47-4 (Cytidine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.1.3.2 (Aspartate Carbamoyltransferase)', 'EC 3.5.2.3 (Dihydroorotase)', 'EC 6.3.5.5 (Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Glutamine-Hydrolyzing))', 'G162GK9U4W (Leflunomide)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",,,"['R01-CA34085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM59767/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gene is located on chromosome 5q33, and the activation is usually caused by a t(5;12)(q33;p13) translocation associated with an ETV6-PDGFRB fusion gene. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate specifically inhibits ABL, PDGFR, and KIT kinases and has impressive clinical efficacy in BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukemia. METHODS: We treated four patients who had chronic myeloproliferative diseases and chromosomal translocations involving 5q33 with imatinib mesylate (400 mg daily). Three of the four patients presented with leukocytosis and eosinophilia; their leukemia cells carried the ETV6-PDGFRB fusion gene. The fourth patient had leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and a t(5;12) translocation involving PDGFRB and an unknown partner gene; he also had extensive raised, ulcerated skin lesions that had been present for a long time. RESULTS: In all four patients, a normal blood count was achieved within four weeks after treatment began. In the patient with skin disease, the lesions began to resolve shortly after treatment began. The t(5;12) translocation was undetectable by 12 weeks in three patients and by 36 weeks in the fourth patient. In the three patients with the ETV6-PDGFRB fusion gene, the transcript level decreased, and in one patient, it became undetectable by 36 weeks. All responses were durable at 9 to 12 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib mesylate induces durable responses in patients with chronic myeloproliferative diseases associated with activation of PDGFRB.","['Apperley, Jane F', 'Gardembas, Martine', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Russell-Jones, Robin', 'Bain, Barbara J', 'Baxter, E Joanna', 'Chase, Andrew', 'Chessells, Judith M', 'Colombat, Marie', 'Dearden, Claire E', 'Dimitrijevic, Sasa', 'Mahon, Francois-X', 'Marin, David', 'Nikolova, Zariana', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Silberman, Sandra', 'Schultheis, Beate', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Goldman, John M']","['Apperley JF', 'Gardembas M', 'Melo JV', 'Russell-Jones R', 'Bain BJ', 'Baxter EJ', 'Chase A', 'Chessells JM', 'Colombat M', 'Dearden CE', 'Dimitrijevic S', 'Mahon FX', 'Marin D', 'Nikolova Z', 'Olavarria E', 'Silberman S', 'Schultheis B', 'Cross NC', 'Goldman JM']","['Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom. j.apperley@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Eosinophilia/drug therapy', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukocytosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics']",2002/08/16 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/08/16 10:00'],"['2002/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1056/NEJMoa020150 [doi]', '347/7/481 [pii]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2002 Aug 15;347(7):481-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa020150.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (ETV6-PDGFRB fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",,['Copyright 2002 Massachusetts Medical Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib mesylate, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown in preclinical models and preliminary clinical studies to have activity against such tumors. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized, multicenter trial to evaluate the activity of imatinib in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor. We assessed antitumor response and the safety and tolerability of the drug. Pharmacokinetics were assessed in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: A total of 147 patients were randomly assigned to receive 400 mg or 600 mg of imatinib daily. Overall, 79 patients (53.7 percent) had a partial response, 41 patients (27.9 percent) had stable disease, and for technical reasons, response could not be evaluated in 7 patients (4.8 percent). No patient had a complete response to the treatment. The median duration of response had not been reached after a median follow-up of 24 weeks after the onset of response. Early resistance to imatinib was noted in 20 patients (13.6 percent). Therapy was well tolerated, although mild-to-moderate edema, diarrhea, and fatigue were common. Gastrointestinal or intraabdominal hemorrhage occurred in approximately 5 percent of patients. There were no significant differences in toxic effects or response between the two doses. Imatinib was well absorbed, with pharmacokinetics similar to those reported in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib induced a sustained objective response in more than half of patients with an advanced unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Inhibition of the KIT signal-transduction pathway is a promising treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which resist conventional chemotherapy.","['Demetri, George D', 'von Mehren, Margaret', 'Blanke, Charles D', 'Van den Abbeele, Annick D', 'Eisenberg, Burton', 'Roberts, Peter J', 'Heinrich, Michael C', 'Tuveson, David A', 'Singer, Samuel', 'Janicek, Milos', 'Fletcher, Jonathan A', 'Silverman, Stuart G', 'Silberman, Sandra L', 'Capdeville, Renaud', 'Kiese, Beate', 'Peng, Bin', 'Dimitrijevic, Sasa', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Corless, Christopher', 'Fletcher, Christopher D M', 'Joensuu, Heikki']","['Demetri GD', 'von Mehren M', 'Blanke CD', 'Van den Abbeele AD', 'Eisenberg B', 'Roberts PJ', 'Heinrich MC', 'Tuveson DA', 'Singer S', 'Janicek M', 'Fletcher JA', 'Silverman SG', 'Silberman SL', 'Capdeville R', 'Kiese B', 'Peng B', 'Dimitrijevic S', 'Druker BJ', 'Corless C', 'Fletcher CD', 'Joensuu H']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Cancer Center, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['N Engl J Med. 2002 Aug 15;347(7):462-3.

Clastosomes contain a high concentration of 1) ubiquitin conjugates, 2) the proteolytically active 20S core and the 19S regulatory complexes of the 26S proteasome, and 3) protein substrates of the proteasome. Although detected in a variety of cell types, clastosomes are scarce under normal conditions; however, they become more abundant when proteasomal activity is stimulated. In contrast, clastosomes disappear when cells are treated with proteasome inhibitors. Protein substrates of the proteasome that are found concentrated in clastosomes include the short-lived transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun, adenovirus E1A proteins, and the PML protein.

HOX11 is also leukaemogenic, both through its clinical association with childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and its ability to immortalize other haematopoietic cell lineages experimentally. To examine the pathological role of HOX11 in tumorigenesis, we constitutively expressed HOX11 cDNA in J2E murine erythroleukaemic cells, which are capable of terminal differentiation. Enforced HOX11 expression was found to induce a profound alteration in J2E cellular morphology and differentiation status. Our analyses revealed that HOX11 produced clones with a preponderance of less differentiated cells that were highly adherent to plastic. Morphologically, the cells overexpressing HOX11 were larger and had decreased globin levels, as well as a reduction in haemoglobin synthesis in response to erythropoietin (EPO). Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed the immature erythroid phenotype imposed by HOX11, with clones transfected with HOX11 demonstrating expression of the c-Kit stem cell marker, while retaining EPO receptor expression. Taken together, these results show that HOX11 alters erythroid differentiation, favouring a less mature progenitor-like stage. This supports the notion that disrupted haematopoietic cell differentiation is responsible for pre-leukaemic immortalization by the HOX11 oncoprotein.","['Greene, Wayne K', 'Ford, Jette', 'Dixon, Darcelle', 'Tilbrook, Peta A', 'Watt, Paul M', 'Klinken, S Peter', 'Kees, Ursula R']","['Greene WK', 'Ford J', 'Dixon D', 'Tilbrook PA', 'Watt PM', 'Klinken SP', 'Kees UR']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, TVW Telethon Institute for Child Health Research and Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, West Perth, Australia.

Invitro, 10-15% of bone marrow stromal cells was effectively transduced by retroviral vector (murine Moloney leukaemia virus-derived) expressing IL-1alpha/LacZ, or LacZ alone as control marker, as assessed by betaGal staining. IL-1alpha gene expression was upregulated [semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)] within the transduced cells and the cell supernatant showed an increased production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and an increased clonogenic activity (colony-forming cell assay). Ex vivo autologous expanded IL-1alpha/LacZ transduced bone marrow stromal cells were reinfused in two macaques (and two control animals for LacZ alone as controls), without clinical systemic toxicity; LacZ expression by RT-PCR was detected in one animal of each group between d 4 and 9.

We have used serial real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to monitor the ratio of peripheral blood BCR-ABL to normal ABL transcripts in 43 patients receiving imatinib, and compared the results to concurrent conventional bone marrow (BM) cytogenetics. After 6 months of treatment, 13 cases were complete cytogenetic responders, defined as all BM metaphases negative for the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. In these patients, the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio was less than 0.08%. Six cases achieved a partial cytogenetic response (1-35% Ph-positive BM metaphases) and their BCR-ABL/ABL ratio was between 0.08 and 10%. In total, 24 cases were cytogenetic non-responders, and their BCR-ABL/ABL ratio exceeded 11%. The data suggested that the 6-month BCR-ABL/ABL ratio may reliably predict the contemporary marrow cytogenetic response.

In a cohort of 81 patients with B-CLL, a level of CD38 expression of > or = 30% and an ABC value of 250 proved statistically valid cut-off points to predict disease progression (% CD38: P=0.0027; ABC: P < 0.0001). There was a positive and significant correlation between the percentage of CD38 expression and ABC (r=0.7; P < 0.0001). There was a better discrimination of survival using ABC rather than percentage CD38 positivity (P < 0.0001 compared with P=0.0027).

Beside ethical, immunological, physiological and technical problems, the microbiological safety of the xenograft has to be guaranteed. It will be possible to eliminate all of the known porcine microorgansims in the nearby future by vaccinating or specified pathogen-free breeding. Thus, the main risk will come from the porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) which are present in the pig genome as proviruses of different subtypes. PERVs will therefore be transmitted, with the xenograft, to the human recipient. PERVs can infect numerous different types of human primary cells and cell lines in vitro and were shown to adapt to these cells by serial passaging on uninfected cells. Furthermore, PERVs have high homology to other retroviruses, such as feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or murine leukemia virus (MuLV), which are known to induce tumors or immunodeficiencies in the infected host. To evaluate the potential risk of a trans-species transmission of PERV in vivo, naive and immunosuppressed rats, guinea pigs and minks were inoculated with PERV and screened over a period of 3 months for an antibody reaction against PERV proteins or for the integration of proviral DNA into the genomic DNA of the host's cells. Furthermore, we inoculated three different species of non-human primates, rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), pig-tailed monkey (Macaca nemestrina) and baboon (Papio hamadryas) with high titers of a human-adapted PERV. To simulate a situation in xenotransplantation, the animals received a daily triple immunosuppression using cyclosporine A, methylprednisolone and RAD, a rapamycin derivative, presently under development by Novartis. None of the small laboratory animals or the non-human primates showed production of antibodies against PERV or evidence of integration of proviral DNA in blood cells or cells of several organs, 3 months after virus inoculation, despite the observation that cells of the animals used in the experiment were infectible in vitro. This apparent difference in the outcome of the in vitro and the in vivo data might be explained by an efficient elimination of the virus by the innate or adaptive immunity of the animals.","['Specke, V', 'Schuurman, H J', 'Plesker, R', 'Coulibaly, C', 'Ozel, M', 'Langford, G', 'Kurth, R', 'Denner, J']","['Specke V', 'Schuurman HJ', 'Plesker R', 'Coulibaly C', 'Ozel M', 'Langford G', 'Kurth R', 'Denner J']","['Robert Koch-Institute, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Transpl Immunol,Transplant immunology,9309923,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*pathogenicity', 'Female', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Mink', 'Models, Animal', 'Rats', 'Safety', 'Swine/*virology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Virus Integration']",2002/08/16 10:00,2003/03/19 04:00,['2002/08/16 10:00'],"['2002/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0966-3274(02)00039-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0966-3274(02)00039-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Transpl Immunol. 2002 May;9(2-4):281-8. doi: 10.1016/s0966-3274(02)00039-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Articular cartilage from bovine, porcine, or human joints was cultured as explants in serum-free media. Explants or monolayer cultures of primary chondrocytes were treated with cytokines in the absence or presence of inhibitors [antibodies to leukemia inhibitory factor (anti-LIF) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, dexamethasone, or inhibitors of aggrecanase or NO synthase]. NO production and matrix breakdown and synthesis were measured. RESULTS: At low concentrations, a novel interleukin 17 (IL-17) family member induced matrix breakdown without altering NO production. Treatment of articular cartilage explants with dexamethasone or anti-LIF blocked NO production by IL-17, but not by IL-1alpha. Inhibition of NO production in cytokine treated cartilage explants enhanced matrix breakdown and partially overcame suppression of matrix synthesis. In isolated chondrocytes, inhibition of NO production decreased expression of gelatinase and increased expression of stromelysin. CONCLUSION: Endogenous NO serves a dual function in cartilage: to protect the tissue from matrix breakdown and to mediate suppression of proteoglycan synthesis by cytokines. Despite the similarities in biological function between IL-I and IL-17, their downstream signaling pathways are distinct and appear to be affected by extracellular matrix degradation.","['Cai, Liping', 'Suboc, Pam', 'Hogue, Deborah A', 'Fei, David T W', 'Filvaroff, Ellen H']","['Cai L', 'Suboc P', 'Hogue DA', 'Fei DT', 'Filvaroff EH']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Genentech Inc, South San Francisco California 94080-4990, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Canada,J Rheumatol,The Journal of rheumatology,7501984,IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/metabolism', 'Cartilage, Articular/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Matrix/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gelatinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 3/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitric Oxide/*biosynthesis', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Swine']",2002/08/16 10:00,2003/03/19 04:00,['2002/08/16 10:00'],"['2002/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Rheumatol. 2002 Aug;29(8):1725-36.,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.17 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progress in the use of alemtuzumab (MabCampath) to eradicate minimal residual disease in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has positive implications for patients, particularly prior to stem cell transplantation. Another beneficial aspect of monoclonal antibody therapy under active investigation is the ability of alemtuzumab to repeatedly produce or maintain responses. Subcutaneous administration of alemtuzumab is now emerging as a key advancement in the treatment of CLL. A phase II trial of subcutaneous alemtuzumab has demonstrated an 87% response rate in 38 previously untreated patients, with a reduction in intravenous administration-related rigors, as well as the elimination of nausea, dyspnea, diarrhea, and hypotension, frequently seen following intravenous administration of alemtuzumab. This trial demonstrates the advantages for safety, cost, flexibility, and convenience offered by subcutaneous administration of alemtuzumab. Finally, encouraging results with the combination of alemtuzumab and fludarabine, which demonstrate eradication of malignant cells in patients who are resistant to either agent alone, open the way for such combinations to produce durable responses even in refractory disease.","['Rai, Kanti', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Rai K', 'Hallek M']","['Long Island Jewish Medical Center New Hyde Park, NY 11042, USA. rai@lij.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2002/08/16 10:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/08/16 10:00'],"['2002/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1385/mo:19:2s:s57 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2002;19 Suppl:S57-63. doi: 10.1385/mo:19:2s:s57.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the characteristics of advanced B-CLL is an increased susceptibility to infection, which may improve in patients whose disease responds to alemtuzumab, particularly when immune reconstitution by non-malignant stem cells is successful. However, at initiation of treatment, patients with advanced disease are likely to have poor immune function, and need careful management during and after treatment. Here, we present results showing the nature of immune reconstitution after alemtuzumab and the ways in which alemtuzumab may affect white cell counts during and after treatment.

This success is in large part due to the persistence, dedication, and commitment of a large number of academic collaborators. The first breakthrough was the identification of CAMPATH-1M, an isotype directed against CD52, and extremely efficient at lysing target cells in the presence of human complement, but limited in vivo by the rate of complement biosynthesis. The search for a monoclonal antibody that was more efficient in vivo found the rare class-switching variant CAMPATH-1G, which is able to kill target cells by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Construction of the humanized form of the antibody, CAMPATH-1H, and the development of resources to manufacture clinical-grade material, further expedited many studies across the world in leukemia and lymphoma as well as in marrow transplantation, autoimmune disorders, and kidney transplantation. Such studies have taught us a lot about the diseases themselves, as well as offering the prospect of harnessing immunological tolerance processes to facilitate a whole new approach to immunosuppression.","['Waldmann, Herman']",['Waldmann H'],"['Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford. herman.waldmann@path.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/isolation & purification/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology/isolation & purification/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/*drug effects', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Glycoproteins/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy']",2002/08/16 10:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/08/16 10:00'],"['2002/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1385/mo:19:2s:s03 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2002;19 Suppl:S3-9. doi: 10.1385/mo:19:2s:s03.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We summarize the results of our experience using alemtuzumab to treat a range of clinically aggressive, mature, post-thymic, T-cell malignancies, including T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus I (HTLV-I) associated adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL). Alemtuzumab was administered at a dose of 30 mg, three times a week until maximum response. Apart from first-dose reactions, which were common, treatment was well tolerated, the main complication being infection and viral reactivation associated with the prolonged lymphopenia. Overall response rates were 76% (60% complete response) in 39 patients with T-PLL and 100% in 3 patients with CTCL, of duration up to 4 yr. Experience in T-LGL and ATLL is limited to single cases only and further studies are required to better define the role of alemtuzumab in these subgroups. Our results indicate that alemtuzumab has activity in T-cell malignancies, particularly in T-PLL and in patients with predominantly blood and bone marrow disease. It may be possible to prolong response duration by the use of high-dose therapy and stem cell transplantation. Alemtuzumab may also have a role in purging minimal residual disease following other chemotherapy and prior to transplantation. We conclude that treatment with alemtuzumab may offer new hope to patients who otherwise have a bleak prognosis.","['Dearden, Claire E', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Catovsky, Daniel']","['Dearden CE', 'Matutes E', 'Catovsky D']","[""St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, UK. claire.dearden@stgeorges.nhs.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,,"['Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/*drug effects', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2002/08/16 10:00,2002/12/11 04:00,['2002/08/16 10:00'],"['2002/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/11 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1385/mo:19:2s:s27 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2002;19 Suppl:S27-32. doi: 10.1385/mo:19:2s:s27.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent RT-PCR studies demonstrated the presence of melanocortin 1 receptor mRNA in other tissues such as pituitary gland and testis. Previously, we have demonstrated that three HLA-A2 binding nonamer peptides derived from melanocortin 1 receptor can elicit peptide-specific CTL which can recognize target cells transfected with the melanocortin 1 receptor gene and MHC class I matched melanoma lines. The potential of targeting melanocortin 1 receptor in therapy and diagnosis will depend on a preferential expression of this receptor in the majority of primary and metastatic melanomas vs normal tissues. We tested a panel of melanomas, carcinomas and other cell lines for the presence of melanocortin 1 receptor, using two monoclonal antibodies. The receptor was detected in 83% of the tested melanoma cell lines but not in other carcinoma lines. Immunohistochemistry revealed a strong expression of melanocortin 1 receptor in all tested primary and metastatic melanomas, but also demonstrated low levels of expression in adrenal medulla, cerebellum, liver and keratinocytes. Flow cytometry studies showed that melanocortin 1 receptor was expressed in in vitro activated monocytes/macrophages and in the THP-1 monocytic leukaemia line at levels of about 1 in 3 to 1 in 5 of that found in melanomas. Peripheral blood-derived dendritic cells, also express melanocortin 1 receptor in vitro. This extensive analysis of melanocortin 1 receptor tissue distribution may be of relevance not only for melanoma immunology, but also for research on the pathogenicity of inflammatory conditions in the skin and neurologic tissues. It remains to be seen if the over-expression of melanocortin 1 receptor in melanomas is sufficiently high to allow a 'therapeutic window' to be exploited in cancer immunotherapy.","['Salazar-Onfray, F', 'Lopez, M', 'Lundqvist, A', 'Aguirre, A', 'Escobar, A', 'Serrano, A', 'Korenblit, C', 'Petersson, M', 'Chhajlani, V', 'Larsson, O', 'Kiessling, R']","['Salazar-Onfray F', 'Lopez M', 'Lundqvist A', 'Aguirre A', 'Escobar A', 'Serrano A', 'Korenblit C', 'Petersson M', 'Chhajlani V', 'Larsson O', 'Kiessling R']","['Disciplinary Program of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Av.

Genetic engineering of islets before transplantation with protective genes may enhance their posttransplantation survival. Accomplishing this goal requires the development of a safe, efficient vector for islet gene delivery. METHODS: The ability of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vectors to transfer a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene to NIT-1 cells and primary islets was measured and compared with murine leukemia virus (MLV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vectors. Islets were examined using confocal microscopy to determine the extent and pattern of infection. Toxicity of the procedure was assessed via measurement of glucose stimulation indices and by reversion of diabetic mice using either FIV-infected or control islet transplants. RESULTS: FIV effectively transduces islets with no untoward effect on the insulin secretion capacity of the beta cells. When FIV, HIV, and MLV GFP vectors were standardized to the same 293 cell titer and used to infect NIT-1 cells or whole islets, the FIV transduced equal or greater numbers of cells relative to the HIV vector and significantly more than the MLV vector. Islets transduced with FIV GFP were transplanted in a murine model for diabetes and were shown to revert diabetes and express GFP 4 weeks after transduction and 3 weeks after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: FIV transduction is a nontoxic and efficient method to genetically modify pancreatic islets and may prove promising for delivering genes to augment islet survival after transplantation.","['Curran, Michael A', 'Ochoa, M Sofia', 'Molano, R Damaris', 'Pileggi, Antonello', 'Inverardi, Luca', 'Kenyon, Norma S', 'Nolan, Garry P', 'Ricordi, Camillo', 'Fenjves, Elizabeth S']","['Curran MA', 'Ochoa MS', 'Molano RD', 'Pileggi A', 'Inverardi L', 'Kenyon NS', 'Nolan GP', 'Ricordi C', 'Fenjves ES']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University Medical Center, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Insulin Secretion', 'Insulinoma', 'Islets of Langerhans/cytology/*virology', 'Islets of Langerhans Transplantation/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Rats', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-200208150-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2002 Aug 15;74(3):299-306. doi: 10.1097/00007890-200208150-00003.,"['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,"['A1/GF41520-01/GF/NIH HHS/United States', 'AI35304/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AR44565/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-AR-6-2227/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-AI/MH43665/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-AI39646/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A consequence of this are frequent infections, sometimes with fatal outcome. The immunological system ""answers"" to infections with changes in number and quality of cells participating in the inflammatory process. The aim of the study was to investigate the subpopulations of mononuclear cells in patients with neoplastic (haematologic) diseases during infections. We studied 16 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and with lymphomas (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin). Among our patients we note 25 episodes of infections requiring hospitalization. Mean percent values of mononuclear antibodies: CD14-PE/CD45-FITC, CD3-FITC/CD19-PE, CD4-FITC/CD8-PE, CD3-FITC/CD16+CD56-PE, CD14-PerCP/CD54-PE, CD3-PerCP/CD54RA-FITC/CD45RO-PE, CD3-PerCP/HLA-DR, CD14-PerCP/HLA-DR. In the examination carried out during acute infection, we found higher mean percent values of CD3+ HLDAR+, CD14+ CD54+ and CD3+ CD45RO+ cells than in analogous values in the remaining examinations. After the infection we found higher percent of CD3 CD45RA+/CD3+CD45RO+ cells. In a patient with cytomegalovirus pneumonitis our examination showed a depression of HLA-DR antigens on monocytes during acute infections (10th day of treatment) and return to normal values after 20 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The most sensitive expression of infection in children with neoplastic disease was the variable percent of HDLA-DR molecules on T lymphocytes. (2) Presence of activation indicators on T lymphocytes and monocytes can testify that there is persistent function of the immunological system in spite of immunosuppression in patients with neoplastic disease. (3) Depression in percent value of monocytes with HLA-DR antigens in the course of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis confirms its immunosuppressive influence on the human organism.","['Luczynsk, Wlodzimierz', 'Stasiak-Barmuta, Anna', 'Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Kasprzycka, Edwina']","['Luczynsk W', 'Stasiak-Barmuta A', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Kasprzycka E']","['Klinika Onkologii Dzieciecej, Samodzielny Publiczny Dzieciecy Szpital Kliniczny, Akademia Medyczna, Waszyngtona 17, 15-274 Bialystok, Poland. vlodek@amb.ac.bialystok.pl']",['pol'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Med Wieku Rozwoj,Medycyna wieku rozwojowego,100928610,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/12/28 04:00,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Wieku Rozwoj. 2002 Jan-Mar;6(1):31-41.,['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)'],,,,,Aktywacja limfocytow t i monocytow w przebiegu infekcji u dzieci z choroba nowotworowa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized with equal probability to receive low-, intermediate-, or high-dose suramin (total doses 3.192, 5.320, and 7.661 g/m(2), respectively). Overall survival, time to progression, and response rate (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] and objective) for each treatment arm were compared. Relationships between plasma suramin concentrations and response, toxicity, and survival were also evaluated. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety patients were randomized. For the low-, intermediate-, and high-dose arms, the median survival time was 16, 14, and 13 months, respectively (P =.49). The objective response rate was 9%, 7%, and 15%, respectively (P =.10). PSA response rates were 24%, 28%, and 34%, respectively (P =.082). Landmark analyses of a 50% decline in PSA at 20 weeks showed a significant correlation with survival. There was a dose-response relationship between dose and toxicity. After adjusting for treatment arm, the measured suramin concentration was not associated with clinical response, PSA response, survival, or toxicity. CONCLUSION: Although high-dose suramin was associated with higher objective and PSA response rates, these were not statistically significant. Overall, no dose-response relationship was observed for survival or progression-free survival, but toxicity was increased with the higher dose. Patients treated with the low-dose level experienced modest toxicity, making it the preferred arm on this study. The lack of a dose-response relationship and the toxicity profile observed raise questions regarding the utility of suramin, particularly high-dose suramin, as administered on this schedule.","['Small, Eric J', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Ratain, Mark J', 'Rosner, Gary', 'Stadler, Walter', 'Palchak, David', 'Marshall, Ernest', 'Rago, Randall', 'Hars, Vera', 'Wilding, George', 'Petrylak, Daniel', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J']","['Small EJ', 'Halabi S', 'Ratain MJ', 'Rosner G', 'Stadler W', 'Palchak D', 'Marshall E', 'Rago R', 'Hars V', 'Wilding G', 'Petrylak D', 'Vogelzang NJ']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California-San Francisco, 1600 Devisadero Street, Third Floor, San Francisco, CA 94115, USA. smalle@medicine.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/blood', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Suramin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Survival Rate']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2002.10.022 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Aug 15;20(16):3369-75. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.10.022.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)']",,,['CA 31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two proteins isolated in this screen were 14-3-3zeta and a novel adaptor, Madm. Mlf1 contains a classic RSXSXP sequence for 14-3-3 binding and is associated with 14-3-3zeta via this phosphorylated motif. Madm co-immunoprecipitated with Mlf1 and co-localized in the cytoplasm. In addition, Madm recruited a serine kinase, which phosphorylated both Madm and Mlf1 including the RSXSXP motif. In contrast to wild-type Mlf1, the oncogenic fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-MLF1 did not bind 14-3-3zeta, had altered Madm binding, and localized exclusively in the nucleus. Ectopic expression of Madm in M1 myeloid cells suppressed cytokine-induced differentiation unlike Mlf1, which promotes maturation. Because the Mlf1 binding region of Madm and its own dimerization domain overlapped, the levels of Madm and Mlf1 may affect complex formation and regulate differentiation. In summary, this study has identified two partner proteins of Mlf1 that may influence its subcellular localization and biological function.","['Lim, Raelene', 'Winteringham, Louise N', 'Williams, James H', 'McCulloch, Ross K', 'Ingley, Evan', 'Tiao, Jim Y-H', 'Lalonde, Jean-Philippe', 'Tsai, Schickwann', 'Tilbrook, Peta A', 'Sun, Yi', 'Wu, Xiaohua', 'Morris, Stephan W', 'Klinken, S Peter']","['Lim R', 'Winteringham LN', 'Williams JH', 'McCulloch RK', 'Ingley E', 'Tiao JY', 'Lalonde JP', 'Tsai S', 'Tilbrook PA', 'Sun Y', 'Wu X', 'Morris SW', 'Klinken SP']","['Laboratory for Cancer Medicine, Medical Research Foundation, Royal Perth Hospital, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research, Rear 50 Murray Street, Perth, WA 6000, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20020809,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['14-3-3 Proteins', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/12/10 04:00,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/12/10 04:00 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M206041200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)72214-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Oct 25;277(43):40997-1008. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M206041200.

Seventy-three eligible patients were assigned to treatment with cytarabine and infusional daunorubicin with or without intravenous CsA.

In a clinical trial attempting to capture this approach to achieve graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effects without GVHD, we have observed surprisingly powerful antitumor effects of DLI in patients achieving mixed chimerism after nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplantation. This observation led us to hypothesize that host antigen-presenting cells in mixed chimeras might be required to optimally present recipient antigens to the donor lymphocytes, leading to maximal graft-versus-tumor effects. To test this hypothesis, we established mixed and fully allogeneic hematopoietic chimeras in B6 mice and evaluated the effect of DLI on EL4 T-cell lymphoma. DLI administration to mixed chimeras produced dramatically improved leukemia-free survival compared to administration of DLI to full donor chimeras. DLI also converted mixed chimeras to full chimeras without causing GVHD. The magnitude of the GVL effect was dependent on the level of major histocompatibility complex class I expression on recipient hematopoietic cells in mixed chimeras. Thus, the induction of mixed chimerism followed by delayed DLI provides an approach to inhibiting GVHD that optimizes GVL effects.","['Mapara, Markus Y', 'Kim, Yong-Mi', 'Wang, Sheng-Ping', 'Bronson, Roderick', 'Sachs, David H', 'Sykes, Megan']","['Mapara MY', 'Kim YM', 'Wang SP', 'Bronson R', 'Sachs DH', 'Sykes M']","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Bone Marrow Transplantation Section, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston 02129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation Chimera/immunology', '*Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-01-0023 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59279-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 1;100(5):1903-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-01-0023.,,,,['R01 CA 79989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We gave DLI at weeks 3 and 12 after BMT and related its ability to induce a GVL effect with (1) evolution of T cell chimeric status and (2) the extent to which DLI could elicit lymphohematopoietic GVH (LHGVH) reactivity. All mice remained free of GVH disease, but only week 3 DLI chimeras exhibited a significant GVL response when challenged with host-type leukemia cells. In these week 3 DLI chimeras, host-reactive T cells were found to proliferate in vivo (5- [and-6]-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl esther [CFSE]-labeled DLI inocula, TCR-Vbeta6(+) T-cell frequency) and T-cell chimerism rapidly converted from mixed into complete donor type, indicating the occurrence of LHGVH reactivity. In week 12 chimeras, DLI elicited none of the activities noted at week 3. Yet, in both instances, splenocytes, recovered following DLI, generated an equally strong antihost proliferative response in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, thereby arguing against a decisive role of regulatory cells. The lack of in vivo LHGVH reactivity after week 12 DLI was associated with a substantially increased level of pre-existing host-type T-cell chimerism. We conclude that elicitation of a GVL effect may require LHGVH reactivity and that the reason why timing of DLI was critical for obtaining LHGVH reactivity and the desired GVL effect may lie in the evolution of chimeric status. A possible direct involvement of residual host-type antigen-presenting cells in eliciting LHGVH reactivity after DLI should be studied using models that allow chimerism analysis in non-T-cell lineages.","['Billiau, An D', 'Fevery, Sabine', 'Rutgeerts, Omer', 'Landuyt, Willy', 'Waer, Mark']","['Billiau AD', 'Fevery S', 'Rutgeerts O', 'Landuyt W', 'Waer M']","['Laboratory of Experimental Transplantation and Laboratory of Experimental Radiobiology, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', '*T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0419 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59278-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 1;100(5):1894-902. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0419.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the viral protein Tax is an activator of NF-kappaB, Bay 11-7082-induced apoptosis of HTLV-I-infected cells was not associated with reduced expression of Tax. Furthermore, Bay 11-7082- induced apoptosis of primary ATL cells was more prominent than that of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and apoptosis of these cells was also associated with down-regulation of NF-kappaB activity.

These results indicate that the conformational changes of Bax and Bak occur upstream of caspase activation or are caspase independent. Following drug-induced apoptosis, Bax integrates into mitochondria, as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and Western blot, without changes in the total amount of Bax or Bak protein. Fludarabine and FCM induce p53 stabilization, but do not seem to be essential in inducing Bax and Bak conformational changes, as they are also observed in dexamethasone-treated CLL cells.

The activity of calpains (calcium-dependent, neutral proteases, active in the cells responding to signals inducing a rise of cytoplasmic Ca(++)) is involved in the regulation of apoptosis of some cell types by interaction with caspase-3. This work verifies the hypothesis of the abnormal activity of calpains and its role in reduced apoptosis of the B-CLL cells. Casein zymography, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting were used for identification and quantification of the activity and expression of calpains in B-CLL cells and purified normal B lymphocytes. The activity and expression of mu-calpain (requiring micromolar Ca(++) for activation) are significantly higher in the leukemic than in nonmalignant cells. Contrarily, the activity and expression of m-calpain (requiring millimolar Ca(++)) as well as the expression of calpastatin (an endogenous inhibitor of calpains) are unchanged or reduced in the B-CLL lymphocytes. Correspondingly, the activity of caspase-3 is many times lower in the B-CLL cells than in normal B lymphocytes. Inhibition of overexpressed mu-calpain in living B-CLL cells in vitro results in doubling of the proportion of the cells undergoing spontaneous apoptosis. This observation suggests a possible role for calpains in longer survival of the B-CLL cells and may open new therapeutic possibilities.","['Witkowski, Jacek M', 'Zmuda-Trzebiatowska, Emilia', 'Swiercz, Jakub M', 'Cichorek, Miroslawa', 'Ciepluch, Hanna', 'Lewandowski, Krzysztof', 'Bryl, Ewa', 'Hellmann, Andrzej']","['Witkowski JM', 'Zmuda-Trzebiatowska E', 'Swiercz JM', 'Cichorek M', 'Ciepluch H', 'Lewandowski K', 'Bryl E', 'Hellmann A']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland. jawit@amedec.amg.gda.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'CD3 Complex', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calpain/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Signal Transduction']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2001-11-0073 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59267-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 1;100(5):1802-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2001-11-0073.,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To model such cell-cell interactions in vitro, we cultured freshly isolated CLL B cells with a follicular dendritic cell line, HK. CLL B cells cocultured with HK cells were protected from apoptosis, either spontaneous or induced by treatment with anticancer drugs. Protection against spontaneous apoptosis could also be induced by coculturing the CLL B cells with normal dendritic cells (DCs) or with a CD40-ligand (CD154)-expressing fibroblast cell line. Examination of the expression of several apoptosis-regulatory proteins revealed that coculture with HK cells or DCs induced up-regulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 in CLL B cells, whereas CD40 ligation increased expression of Bcl-X(L). Cell-cell contact was required for HK-induced protection, and introducing neutralizing antibodies against various adhesion molecules showed that CD44 was involved in HK-mediated survival, whereas CD40, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were not. Anti-CD44 antibodies also blocked Mcl-1 induction by HK cells. Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides reduced leukemia cell expression of Mcl-1, and significantly suppressed HK-induced protection against apoptosis, whereas control oligonucleotides had no effect. Thus, HK cells protect CLL B cells against apoptosis, at least in part through a CD44-dependent mechanism involving up-regulation of Mcl-1, and this mechanism is distinct from that achieved by CD40 ligation. Consequently, the particular antiapoptotic proteins important for CLL survival may vary depending on the microenvironment.","['Pedersen, Irene M', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Leoni, Lorenzo M', 'Zapata, Juan M', 'Karras, James G', 'Tsukada, Nobuhiro', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Choi, Yong Sung', 'Bennett, Frank', 'Reed, John C']","['Pedersen IM', 'Kitada S', 'Leoni LM', 'Zapata JM', 'Karras JG', 'Tsukada N', 'Kipps TJ', 'Choi YS', 'Bennett F', 'Reed JC']","['The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Apoptosis/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/immunology/metabolism', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Survival', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/immunology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59266-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 1;100(5):1795-801.,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",,,['CA 98099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are used for their detection, but cytogenetic analysis is hampered by the low mitotic index of B-CLL cells, and FISH depends on accurate information about candidate regions. We used a set of 400 highly informative microsatellite markers covering all chromosomal arms (allelotyping) and automated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols to screen 46 patients with typical B-CLL for chromosomal aberrations. For validation, we compared data with our conventional karyotype results and fine mapping with conventional single-site PCR. All clonal cytogenetic abnormalities potentially detectable by our microsatellite PCR (eg, del13q14 and trisomy 12) were picked up. Allelotyping revealed additional complex aberrations in patients with both normal and abnormal B-CLL karyotypes. Aberrations detectable in the samples with our microsatellite panel were found on almost all chromosomal arms. We detected new aberrant loci in typical B-CLL, such as allelic losses on 1q, 9q, and 22q in up to 25% of our patients, and allelic imbalances mirroring chromosomal duplications, amplifications, or aneuploidies on 2q, 10p, and 22q in up to 27% of our patients. We conclude that allelotyping with our battery of informative microsatellites is suitable for molecular screening of B-CLL. The technique is well suited for analyses in clinical trials, it provides a comprehensive view of genetic alterations, and it may identify new loci with candidate genes relevant in the molecular biology of B-CLL.","['Novak, Urban', 'Oppliger Leibundgut, Elisabeth', 'Hager, Jorg', 'Muhlematter, Dominique', 'Jotterand, Martine', 'Besse, Celine', 'Leupin, Nicolas', 'Ratschiller, Daniel', 'Papp, Jeanette', 'Kearsey, Gina', 'Aebi, Stefan', 'Graber, Hans', 'Jaggi, Rolf', 'Luthi, Jean-Marc', 'Meyer-Monard, Sandrine', 'Lathrop, Mark', 'Tobler, Andreas', 'Fey, Martin F']","['Novak U', 'Oppliger Leibundgut E', 'Hager J', 'Muhlematter D', 'Jotterand M', 'Besse C', 'Leupin N', 'Ratschiller D', 'Papp J', 'Kearsey G', 'Aebi S', 'Graber H', 'Jaggi R', 'Luthi JM', 'Meyer-Monard S', 'Lathrop M', 'Tobler A', 'Fey MF']","['Department of Clinical Research and Medical Oncology/Hematology, Inselspital (University Hospital), Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['*Alleles', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2002/08/15 10:00,2002/09/14 10:01,['2002/08/15 10:00'],"['2002/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)59265-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2002 Sep 1;100(5):1787-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
