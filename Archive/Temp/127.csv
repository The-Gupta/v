We performed phylogenetic analysis to discern evolutionary relationships and in silico characterization to identify elements potentially important for gene regulation. We report that murine, bovine and chimpanzee sequences are the nearest neighbors of human GARS-AIRS-GART and that endo-duplication of the AIRS protein is restricted to insect orthologs. Convergent evolution of mono-functional bacterial orthologs to bi-functional, partly fused, yeast orthologs is observed from the rooted-NJ tree topology that bears bootstrap values exceeding 9000 in majority of the nodes. Sequence alignments reveal that introns 11-15 of human GARS-AIRS-GART are conserved among vertebrates. An inverse correlation is observed between intron size and intron density without bias for intron position. The generation time of organisms is independent of intron density. Human, bovine and murine sequences possess similar GC content with CpG islands in promoter regions. The long isoforms of cow and chicken transcripts and short isoforms of human, bovine and murine mRNA form energetically stable stem-like structures in the 3'-UTR and may regulate translational stability of GARS-AIRS-GART transcripts. Glycine-rich loops important for enzyme structure and ATP-, folate-binding residues are partially conserved.","['Banerjee, Disha', 'Nandagopal, Krishnadas']","['Banerjee D', 'Nandagopal K']","['Manovikas Biomedical Research and Diagnostic Centre, Manovikas Kendra Rehabilitation and Research Institute for the Handicapped, Kolkata, 700107, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090320,United States,Mol Biotechnol,Molecular biotechnology,9423533,"['0 (Untranslated Regions)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 6.3.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.3.1 (phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthase)', 'EC 6.3.4.13 (phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Composition', 'Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Untranslated Regions']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/09/25 06:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2008/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12033-009-9160-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biotechnol. 2009 Jul;42(3):306-19. doi: 10.1007/s12033-009-9160-1.

Although many predisposing factors exist (including systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy, young age, brain infiltration and genetic predispositions), cranial irradiation appears to be the strongest one. METHODS: Three cases of secondary high-grade gliomas (two multiform glioblastomas, grade IV; one anaplastic astrocytoma, grade III) developed in ALL survivors (F-M, 1:2) 3 to 6.3 years after stopping ALL therapy according to BFM-90 trial. RESULTS: All tumours were supratentorial, contrast-enhancing, space-occupying, highly advanced and aggressive. Possible risk factors and current therapeutic options for paediatric ALL and malignant gliomas are reviewed and discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis in secondary malignant gliomas in children is poor (overall survival of 5, 10 and 19 months) despite intense therapy. Thus, protocols for paediatric ALL reduce prophylactic cranial irradiation in favour of intrathecal and intravenous high-dose MTX. Nevertheless, ALL survivors must undergo systematic, long-term surveillance for early detection of intracranial neoplasms.","['Bien, Ewa', 'Stachowicz-Stencel, Teresa', 'Szalewska, Magdalena', 'Krawczyk, Malgorzata', 'Synakiewicz, Anna', 'Dubaniewicz-Wybieralska, Miroslawa', 'Zielinski, Piotr', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska, Elzbieta', 'Balcerska, Anna']","['Bien E', 'Stachowicz-Stencel T', 'Szalewska M', 'Krawczyk M', 'Synakiewicz A', 'Dubaniewicz-Wybieralska M', 'Zielinski P', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska E', 'Balcerska A']","['Department of Paediatrics, Haematology, Oncology and Endocrinology, Medical University of Gdansk, 7.

Six hundred forty HSCT were performed between 1990 and 2006 for adults with acute myeloid (n = 459) and lymphoblastic (n = 181) leukemia. Two-year leukemia-free survival (LFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and relapse incidence were 58 +/- 2%, 19 +/- 2%, and 23 +/- 2%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of NRM decreased from 22 +/- 2% for patients treated between 1990 and 2002 to 15 +/- 3% for transplantations performed between 2003 and 2006 (p = 0.02), despite increasing recipient age. In a multivariate analysis, time of HSCT affected both NRM and LFS. Among other prognostic factors, the use of TBI decreased relapse incidence and increased the LFS rate. We conclude that results of MRD-HSCT for acute leukemia in Eastern Europe improved over time as a consequence of decreased NRM. The use of TBI containing regimens appears advantagous.","['Giebel, Sebastian', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Holowiecki, Jerzy', 'Labar, Boris', 'Komarnicki, Mieczyslaw', 'Koza, Vladimir', 'Masszi, Tamas', 'Mistrik, Martin', 'Lange, Andrzej', 'Hellmann, Andrzej', 'Vitek, Antonin', 'Pretnar, Joze', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Rzepecki, Piotr', 'Indrak, Karel', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak, Wieslaw', 'Wojnar, Jerzy', 'Krawczyk-Kulis, Malgorzata', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Giebel S', 'Labopin M', 'Holowiecki J', 'Labar B', 'Komarnicki M', 'Koza V', 'Masszi T', 'Mistrik M', 'Lange A', 'Hellmann A', 'Vitek A', 'Pretnar J', 'Mayer J', 'Rzepecki P', 'Indrak K', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W', 'Wojnar J', 'Krawczyk-Kulis M', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Rocha V']","['Department of Clinical Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute Branch Gliwice, Wybrzeze Armii Krajowej 15, 44-101, Gliwice, Poland. sgiebel@poczta.onet.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20090320,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Europe, Eastern', 'HLA Antigens', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2008/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0719-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Oct;88(10):1005-13. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0719-5.

Due to the chemical affinity of arsenic and antimony, we analyzed the potency of antimony(III)-oxide (Sb(2)O(3)) to exert As(2)O(3)-like effects. Based on the same molar concentrations, lower efficacy in apoptosis induction and caspase-independent decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential was observed for Sb(2)O(3). No difference in sensitivity to As(2)O(3) or Sb(2)O(3) was detected in CEM cells when compared to their multiple drug resistant derivatives. Apoptosis was induced by combining sub-apoptotic concentrations of Sb(2)O(3) or As(2)O(3) with sub-apoptotic concentrations of DL: -buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO). Other modulators of the cellular redox system showed this effect to a lower extent and enhancement was not consistent for the different cell lines tested. Caspase inhibitors protected cell lines from Sb(2)O(3)- and As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis. When BSO was added, the inhibitors lost their protective ability. The ability of modulators of the cellular redox system in clinically applicable concentrations to enhance the apoptotic effects of the two oxides in a synergistic way may be helpful to reduce their toxicity by optimizing their dose.","['Losler, Susan', 'Schlief, Sarah', 'Kneifel, Christiane', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Schrezenmeier, Hubert', 'Rojewski, Markus T']","['Losler S', 'Schlief S', 'Kneifel C', 'Thiel E', 'Schrezenmeier H', 'Rojewski MT']","['Medizinische Klinik III (Hamatologie, Onkologie und Transfusionsmedizin), Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090321,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '9IT35J3UV3 (Antimony)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'P217481X5E (antimony trioxide)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antimony/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutathione/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxides/*pharmacology']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2008/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0736-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Nov;88(11):1047-58. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0736-4.

Human macrophages, differentiated in vitro from peripheral blood monocytes, were used in binding and phagocytosis assays using B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma target cells opsonized with rituximab. Phagocytosis was maximal at 0.1 microg/ml rituximab and was not significantly affected by CD20 expression levels or by CD16A polymorphism at position 158 (Val/Phe). The role of FcgammaRs was demonstrated by complete inhibition of phagocytosis by excess human Igs. Because macrophages can be differentiated to M1- or M2-type cells with either GM-CSF or M-CSF, respectively, and can be classically activated by proinflammatory stimuli (IFN-gamma/LPS) or undergo alternative activation with cytokines such as IL-4 or IL-10, we have analyzed the effect of these different polarization programs on the phagocytosis mediated by rituximab. Macrophages differentiated in presence of M-CSF showed a 2- to 3-fold greater phagocytic capacity compared with GM-CSF-induced cells. Furthermore, addition of IL-10 significantly increased, whereas IL-4 decreased phagocytosis by both M-CSF- and GM-CSF-differentiated macrophages. LPS/IFN-gamma had little effect. Expression of CD16, CD32, and CD64 in different macrophage populations correlated with phagocytic activity. Interestingly, several B lymphoma cell lines were observed to secrete 400-1300 pg/ml IL-10 in vitro, and coculture of human macrophages with lymphoma conditioned medium increased significantly their phagocytic capacity. Our data suggest that cytokines secreted by lymphoma cells can favor alternate activation of macrophages with a high phagocytic capacity toward rituximab-opsonized targets.","['Leidi, Marzia', 'Gotti, Elisa', 'Bologna, Luca', 'Miranda, Elena', 'Rimoldi, Monica', 'Sica, Antonio', 'Roncalli, Massimo', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe A', 'Introna, Martino', 'Golay, Josee']","['Leidi M', 'Gotti E', 'Bologna L', 'Miranda E', 'Rimoldi M', 'Sica A', 'Roncalli M', 'Palumbo GA', 'Introna M', 'Golay J']","['Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Opsonin Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/immunology/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Macrophage Activation/immunology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Macrophages/*cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Opsonin Proteins/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, IgG/immunology', 'Rituximab']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']","['182/7/4415 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0713732 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Apr 1;182(7):4415-22. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0713732.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the authors investigated the use of nicotine concentrations in house dust as measures of children's exposure to cigarette smoke in 469 households from the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (1999-2007). House dust was collected by using high-volume surface samplers and household vacuum cleaners and was analyzed for nicotine via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Using multivariable linear regression, the authors evaluated the effects of self-reported parental smoking, parental demographics, house characteristics, and other covariates on house-dust nicotine concentrations. They observed that nicotine concentrations in house dust were associated with self-reported smoking for periods of months and years before dust collection. Furthermore, the authors found that the relation between nicotine dust levels and self-reported smoking varied by parental age and socioeconomic status. These findings suggest that house-dust nicotine concentrations reflect long-term exposures to cigarette smoke in the home and that they may be less biased surrogates for children's exposures to cigarette smoke than self-reported smoking habits.","['Whitehead, Todd', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Ward, Mary H', 'Nishioka, Marcia G', 'Gunier, Robert', 'Colt, Joanne S', 'Reynolds, Peggy', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Buffler, Patricia', 'Rappaport, Stephen M']","['Whitehead T', 'Metayer C', 'Ward MH', 'Nishioka MG', 'Gunier R', 'Colt JS', 'Reynolds P', 'Selvin S', 'Buffler P', 'Rappaport SM']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA. toddpwhitehead@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090318,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,"['0 (Dust)', '0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)', '6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Air Pollution, Indoor/adverse effects/*analysis', 'California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dust/*analysis', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Linear Models', 'Middle Aged', 'Nicotine/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Parents/psychology', 'Smoking/adverse effects/*epidemiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]']","['kwp021 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwp021 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2009 May 1;169(9):1113-23. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwp021.

Whereas sporadic cancer results from interactions between complex exposures and low-penetrance alleles, t-AML results from an acute exposure to a limited number of potent genotoxins. Consequently, we hypothesized that the effect sizes of variants associated with t-AML would be greater than in sporadic cancer, and, therefore, that these variants could be detected even in a modest-sized cohort. To test this, we undertook an association study in 80 cases and 150 controls using Affymetrix Mapping 10K arrays. Even at nominal significance thresholds, we found a significant excess of associations over chance; for example, although 6 associations were expected at P less than .001, we found 15 (P(enrich) = .002). To replicate our findings, we genotyped the 10 most significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an independent t-AML cohort (n = 70) and obtained evidence of association with t-AML for 3 SNPs in the subset of patients with loss of chromosomes 5 or 7 or both, acquired abnormalities associated with prior exposure to alkylator chemotherapy. Thus, we conclude that the effect of genetic factors contributing to cancer risk is potentiated and more readily discernable in t-AML compared with sporadic cancer.","['Knight, Jeffrey A', 'Skol, Andrew D', 'Shinde, Abhijit', 'Hastings, Darcie', 'Walgren, Richard A', 'Shao, Jin', 'Tennant, Thelma R', 'Banerjee, Mekhala', 'Allan, James M', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Graubert, Timothy A', 'Cox, Nancy J', 'Onel, Kenan']","['Knight JA', 'Skol AD', 'Shinde A', 'Hastings D', 'Walgren RA', 'Shao J', 'Tennant TR', 'Banerjee M', 'Allan JM', 'Le Beau MM', 'Larson RA', 'Graubert TA', 'Cox NJ', 'Onel K']","['Committee on Cancer Biology, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20090318,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease/etiology', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37396-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-10-183244 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 May 28;113(22):5575-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-10-183244.

RA and its metabolites use a diverse set of signal transduction pathways during the differentiation program. In addition to the direct transcriptional targets of the nuclear RAR and RXR receptors, signals derived from membrane receptors and the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway are required. Raf1 phosphorylation and the prolonged activation of Raf1 persisting during the entire differentiation process are required for RA-dependent differentiation of HL-60 cells. Here we identify a nuclear redistribution of Raf1 during the RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. In addition, the nuclear accumulation of Raf1 correlates with an increase in Raf1 phosphorylated at serine 621. The serine 621 phosphorylated Raf1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus. The RA-dependent nuclear accumulation of Raf1 suggests a novel nuclear role for Raf1 during the differentiation process.","['Smith, James', 'Bunaciu, Rodica P', 'Reiterer, Gudrun', 'Coder, David', 'George, Thaddeus', 'Asaly, Michael', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Smith J', 'Bunaciu RP', 'Reiterer G', 'Coder D', 'George T', 'Asaly M', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, T4-008 VRT, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090317,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (1,5-bis((2-(methylamino)ethyl)amino)-4,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9,10-dione)', '0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/07/21 09:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(09)00107-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2009 Aug 1;315(13):2241-8. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.03.004.

In this report, we proposed the application of the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) technique to the determination of MPO activity in blasts of acute leukemia (AL). METHODS: Bone-marrow samples were obtained from 23 patients with AL (ALL, 5 cases; ANLL, 13 cases; AUL, 1 cases; mixed-lineage AL, 4 cases). Cells were incubated with a standard reaction mixture and chemiluminescence was measured. The mean peak light emission (PLE) was assessed. RESULTS: When the cut-off point of PLE was settled at 2483, which was set for the discrimination between ANLL and ALL (mean + 3 x SD of ALL samples, n=5), all cases of ALL were MPO-negative, and ten of the thirteen ANLL patients were MPO-positive, which was concordant with cytochemical staining. In addition, this technique was able to demonstrate MPO activity in 4 mixed-lineage AL cases which did not stain for MPO in cytochemistry preparations. CONCLUSIONS: Our ECL technique is simple, inexpensive, and easier to perform compared to other procedures used to measure MPO activity in AL.","['Tan, Sanqin', 'Wang, Guangping', 'Peng, Minyuan', 'Zhang, Xinhua', 'Shen, Guoli', 'Jiang, Jianhui', 'Chen, Fangping']","['Tan S', 'Wang G', 'Peng M', 'Zhang X', 'Shen G', 'Jiang J', 'Chen F']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090317,Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Luminescent Measurements/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/analysis/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*enzymology/*pathology']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/07/07 09:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2009/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [medline]']","['S0009-8981(09)00125-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2009.03.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2009 May;403(1-2):216-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2009.03.006.

Classical Rai and Binet staging of CLL is being superseded by new prognostic markers. The mutational status of the immunoglobulin variable region heavy-chain genes segregates the disease into more benign and more malignant versions, and has been confirmed as an important prognostic marker in prospective clinical trials. A search for surrogate markers for this assay has led to flow cytometric assays for CD38 and ZAP-70 expression. The human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) molecule exhibits limited tissue distribution and a low polymorphism that generate seven HLA-G isoforms. HLA-G exerts multiple immunoregulatory functions. Recent studies indicate an ectopic up-regulation in tumor cells that may favor their escape from anti-tumor immune responses. For this report we studied HLA-G in parallel with CD38 and ZAP-70 in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients. HLA-G expression was studied retrospectively in circulating B-CLL cells from 20 patients by flow cytometry using the anti-HLA-G specific monoclonal antibody MEM/G9. The proportion of leukemic cells expressing HLA-G varied from 1 to 34%. We detected a statistically significant correlation between HLA-G positive (>12%) expression and progression free survival (p=0.045), but no correlation with CD38 and ZAP-70. We also detected a statistically significant difference between Binet stage A; B and C (p=0.046) and a positive correlation between IL-10 and HLA-G (p=0.044). We conclude that positive HLA-G has an effect on progression - free survival, when compared with CD38 and ZAP-70.","['Erikci, Alev Akyol', 'Karagoz, Bulent', 'Ozyurt, Mustafa', 'Ozturk, Ahmet', 'Kilic, Selim', 'Bilgi, Oguz']","['Erikci AA', 'Karagoz B', 'Ozyurt M', 'Ozturk A', 'Kilic S', 'Bilgi O']","['Department of Hematology, Gulhane Military Hospital, Istanbul/Ankara, Turkey. aleverikci@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'HLA Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Up-Regulation', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis/genetics']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/09/03 06:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453309X385197 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2009 Apr;14(2):101-5. doi: 10.1179/102453309X385197.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such immune dysfunction may be due to reduced expression of the T-cell receptor (TCR) zeta chain, which is an important component in TCR-mediated signal transduction. In this study, the TCR zeta expression level was detected using a real-time polymerase chain reaction with SYBR Green I technique and relative quantification method. We demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) and CML in complete remission (CML-CR) expressed decreased TCR zeta mRNA levels compared to healthy controls. In addition, TCR zeta chain gene expression was down-regulated in CD4+ T cells from patients with CML-CP. However, the mRNA expression level of the same gene in CD8+ T cells between CML patients and normal individuals did not differ. To confirm that this abnormal zeta chain expression could be corrected, we then stimulated the PBMCs of there patients with interleukin-2, phytohaemagglutinin and concanavalin A. The results showed that it was possible to partially up-regulate zeta chain expression. Taken together, these results indicate that TCR zeta chain expression was decreased in PBMCs and CD4+ T cells from patients with CML and this could be up-regulated partially by using stimulators.","['Chen, Si', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Chen S', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (antigen T cell receptor, zeta chain)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/09/03 06:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453309X385241 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2009 Apr;14(2):95-100. doi: 10.1179/102453309X385241.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite of positive results in the evolution of pediatric hematopoietic neoplasias, there are some high-risk subtypes at worse prognosis. The aim of this study was to asses the expression and activation status of crucial proteins involved in cell-signaling pathways in order to identify molecular alterations responsible for the proliferation and/or escape from apoptosis of leukemic blasts. The quantitative and qualitative expression and activation of Erk-1, c-Jun, Caspase8, and Gadd45a was analyzed, by immunocytochemical (ICC) and western blotting methods, in bone marrow blasts of 72 patients affected by acute myeloid leukemia (AML), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and stage IV non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). We found an upregulation of Erk-1, Caspase8, c-Jun, and Gadd45a proteins with a constitutive activation in 95.8%, 91.7%, 86.2%, 83.4% of analyzed specimens, respectively. It is worth noting that all AML patients showed an upregulation of all proteins studied and the high expression of GADD45a was associated to the lowest DFS median (p = 0.04). On univariate analysis, only Erk-1 phosphorylation status was found to be correlated with a significantly shorter 5-years DFS in all disease subgroups (p = 0.033) and the lowest DFS median in ALL/NHL subgroup (p = 0.04). Moreover, the simultaneous activation of multiple kinases, as we found for c-Jun and Erk-1 (r = 0.26; p = 0.025), might synergistically enhance survival and proliferation potential of leukemic cells. These results demonstrate an involvement of these proteins in survival of blast cells and, consequently, on relapse percentages of the different subgroups of patients.","[""D'Angelo, Velia"", 'Crisci, Stefania', 'Casale, Fiorina', 'Addeo, Raffaele', 'Giuliano, Maria', 'Pota, Elvira', 'Finsinger, Paola', 'Baldi, Alfonso', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Abbruzzese, Alberto', 'Caraglia, Michele', 'Indolfi, Paolo']","[""D'Angelo V"", 'Crisci S', 'Casale F', 'Addeo R', 'Giuliano M', 'Pota E', 'Finsinger P', 'Baldi A', 'Rondelli R', 'Abbruzzese A', 'Caraglia M', 'Indolfi P']","['Pediatric Oncology Service, Pediatric Department, F Fede, II University of Naples, Naples, Italy. velia.dangelo@unina2.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090319,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (GADD45A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification/*metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2008/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['1756-9966-28-39 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-28-39 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Mar 19;28:39. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-28-39.,,,,,PMC2664791,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis is an intrinsic cell death program that is crucial in maintaining tissue homeostasis, for example in the haematopoietic system where there is a high turnover rate of cells. As a result, a decrease in the rate of apoptosis as well as an increase in proliferation favours tumorigenesis as well as tumour progression. Further, the anti-leukaemic action of current treatment approaches, including chemo-, radio- or immunotherapy, critically relies on intact cell death programs in cancer cells. Therefore, defects in apoptosis pathways are frequently associated with the resistance to anticancer therapies. In recent years, the identification and characterization of the molecules and pathways that are involved in the regulation and execution of cell death in leukaemia and lymphoma cells, for example tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), 'inhibitor of apoptosis' (IAP) proteins and Bcl-2, have set the ground for the development of novel diagnostic tools and molecular therapeutics targeting apoptosis pathways in haematological malignancies.","['Fulda, Simone']",['Fulda S'],"[""University Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany. simone.fulda@uniklinik-ulm.de""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/07/01 09:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7603 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07603.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 May;145(4):441-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07603.x.,,173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To compare the frequency of infections in patients with matched-related (Group A) or with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched-unrelated donors (Group B). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients treated at our transplantation unit between April 2004 and April 2005 were enrolled into this analysis. Documentation comprised demographic data, conditioning treatment, stem cell source, clinical course, as well as microbiological and clinical data and mortality. RESULTS: We analyzed 59 patients, 22 in Group A and 37 in Group B. Both groups were well balanced regarding demographic data. Diagnoses were acute myeloid leukemia (30 of 59 patients, 50.8%), multiple myeloma (15.2%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (11.9%), and chronic myeloid leukemia (10.2%). Patients in Group A developed infections in 95.5% of the cases compared with 97.3% in patients in Group B. Most frequently detected pathogens were Staphylococcus species, human herpesvirus-6, and Epstein-Barr virus. Three proven fungal infections were detected in Group A compared with 9 proven fungal infections in Group B. Lung infiltrations were observed in equivalent incidence in both groups. Two years after transplantation, 55.9% of patients were alive (Group A: 68.2%; Group B: 48.6%, not significant). CONCLUSION: Allogeneic SCT from HLA-matched-unrelated donors does not have a higher infection risk than patients transplanted from matched-related donors.","['Rieger, C T', 'Rieger, H', 'Kolb, H J', 'Peterson, L', 'Huppmann, S', 'Fiegl, M', 'Ostermann, H']","['Rieger CT', 'Rieger H', 'Kolb HJ', 'Peterson L', 'Huppmann S', 'Fiegl M', 'Ostermann H']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Munich Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany. christina.rieger@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090309,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Donor Selection', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects', 'Virus Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/10/02 06:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['TID379 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-3062.2009.00379.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2009 Jun;11(3):220-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3062.2009.00379.x.

The inhibitory concentration (IC50) of deferasirox was 17-50 microM in three human myeloid cell lines (K562, U937, and HL60), while those in fresh leukemia cells obtained from four patients it varied from 88 to 172 microM. Gene expression profiling using Affymerix GeneChips (U133 Plus 2.0) revealed up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) encoding p21CIP, genes regulating interferon (i.e. IFIT1). Pathways related to iron metabolism and hypoxia such as growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) and Regulated in development and DNA damage response (REDD1) were also prominent. Based on the results obtained from gene expression profiling, we particularly focused on the REDD1/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway in deferasirox-treated K562 cells, and found an enhanced expression of REDD1 and its down-stream protein, tuberin (TSC2). Notably, S6 ribosomal protein as well as phosphorylated S6, which is known to be a target of mTOR, was significantly repressed in deferasirox-treated K562 cells, and REDD1 small interfering RNA restored phosphorylation of S6. Although iron chelation may affect multiple signaling pathways related to cell survival, our data support the conclusion that REDD1 functions up-stream of tuberin to down-regulate the mTOR pathway in response to deferasirox. Deferasirox might not only have benefit for iron chelation but also may be an antiproliferative agent in some myeloid leukemias, especially patients who need both iron chelation and reduction of leukemia cells.","['Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Kobayashi, Chiaki', 'Hamamura, Ryoko', 'Okabe, Seiichi', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Kobayashi C', 'Hamamura R', 'Okabe S', 'Tauchi T', 'Ohyashiki K']","['Intractable Diseases Therapeutic Research Center, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan. junko@hh.iij4u.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090309,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (DDIT4 protein, human)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Ribosomal Protein S6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'V8G4MOF2V9 (Deferasirox)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deferasirox', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Iron Chelating Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/03/21 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/03/21 09:00'],"['2009/03/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['CAS1131 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01131.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 May;100(5):970-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01131.x.

Using four distinct culture conditions, supernatants from culture of bone fragments, marrow stroma cell line MS-5, embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH3T3, and a cocktail of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), we isolated four different sub-populations of murine BMSCs (mBMSCs). These cells express a well-known marker of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (Nanog) and show interesting features in immunophenotype, self-renewal ability, and differentiation potency. In particular, using NIH3T3 conditioned medium, we obtained cells that showed impairment in osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation while retaining high adipogenic potential during passages.

It has resulted in an improvement of approximately 20% in survival for nearly all B cell lymphomas. In follicular lymphoma, rituximab combined with chemotherapy is indicated as first-line treatment when treatment is necessary. It is also an interesting option, alone or in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of relapses, after verifying the persistence of CD20 expression on the surface of malignant cells. As a maintenance treatment after chemotherapy with or without rituximab, it improves relapse-free survival and overall survival. The standard treatment for high-grade diffuse lymphoma, regardless of age and regardless of predicted severity, is now the combination of CHOP chemotherapy and rituximab. The combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab is currently the reference treatment for chronic lymphoid leukemia as first-line treatment for patients with few comorbidities and for those with relapses. The role of this antibody in the treatment of more serious forms of lymphoma is under evaluation. The administration of rituximab, alone or in combination, in the treatment of low-grade non-follicular lymphoma must be decided as a function of existing protocols in multidisciplinary consultations. New-generation anti-CD20 antibodies, designed to improve still further the already remarkable efficacy/toxicity ratio, are now taking the road that rituximab opened.","['Milpied, Noel']",['Milpied N'],"['Service des maladies du sang, CHU de Bordeaux, Universite Bordeaux 2 Victor Segalen, F-33600 Pessac Cedex, France. noel.milpied@chu-bordeaux.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20090317,France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'HIV Infections/complications', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/therapy', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Rituximab']",2009/03/20 09:00,2009/05/22 09:00,['2009/03/20 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [medline]']","['S0755-4982(09)00097-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lpm.2009.02.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Presse Med. 2009 May;38(5):788-98. doi: 10.1016/j.lpm.2009.02.005.

Little is known however on how GCs induce apoptosis in CLL. Methylprednisolone (MP) induces apoptosis in ZAP-70 positive CLL more readily than in ZAP-70 negative CLL, which is in contrast to the effects of radiation and chemotherapy. The increased GC sensitivity of ZAP-70+ CLL was studied in relation to the expression status of ZAP-70 and the related signal transducing tyrosine kinase SYK. Both ZAP-70 and SYK were downregulated by GC treatment. Moreover, SYK was dephosphorylated by the phosphatase PTP1B of which the expression and translation levels were induced by GCs. Inhibition of PTP1B successfully restored ZAP-70 expression and SYK phosphorylation but did not interfere with GC-induced apoptosis. Therefore, the downregulation of ZAP-70 and P-SYK per se during treatment with GCs is not sufficient to induce apoptosis, and different mechanisms must therefore be responsible for the increased steroid sensitivity of ZAP-70+ CLL.","['Boelens, Jerina', 'Lust, Sofie', 'Van Bockstaele, Femke', 'Van Gele, Mireille', 'Janssens, Ann', 'Derycke, Lara', 'Vanhoecke, Barbara', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Bracke, Marc', 'Offner, Fritz']","['Boelens J', 'Lust S', 'Van Bockstaele F', 'Van Gele M', 'Janssens A', 'Derycke L', 'Vanhoecke B', 'Philippe J', 'Bracke M', 'Offner F']","['Department of Hematology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.

In certain common B-cell malignancies Syk is activated even in the absence of BCR engagement, suggesting a wider role for this kinase in lymphomagenesis. In this paper, we have profiled molecular differences between BCR-induced and constitutive Syk activation in terms of phosphorylation of regulatory tyrosine residues, downstream signaling properties and capacity to sustain B-cell proliferation. Analysis of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-cells and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines revealed that constitutive and BCR-induced Syk activation differ with respect to the phosphorylation status of the regulatory tyrosines at positions 352 and 525/526, with only the first site being phosphorylated in the case of constitutive and both sites in the case of BCR-induced Syk activation. Syk phosphorylated only on Y352 is capable of downstream signaling, as evidenced by experiments with a phosphomimetic mutant in which the activation loop tyrosines (YY525/526) were replaced with phenylalanines. However, phosphorylation at YY525/526 was shown to significantly increase the enzymatic activity of Syk and to be required for sustained PLCgamma2, Akt and ERK signaling as well as B-cell transformation. These data demonstrate that constitutively active Syk and Syk activated by BCR crosslinking represent separate stages of Syk activation with distinct signaling properties and transforming capacities.","['Carsetti, Laura', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Gobessi, Stefania', 'Longo, Pablo G', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['Carsetti L', 'Laurenti L', 'Gobessi S', 'Longo PG', 'Leone G', 'Efremov DG']","['ICGEB Molecular Hematology Group, Campus A.

Activating KRAS and NRAS mutations are among the most common oncogenic lesions detected in human cancer, and occur in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) and leukemias. We investigated the effects of expressing oncogenic Kras(G12D) from its endogenous locus on the proliferation and tumor-initiating properties of murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. MPD could be initiated by Kras(G12D) expression in a highly restricted population enriched for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but not in common myeloid progenitors. Kras(G12D) HSCs demonstrated a marked in vivo competitive advantage over wild-type cells.

This information has been successfully utilized for diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. Existing literature is included for comparison. Additionally, cell surface overexpression of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins and antibodies against them present in patients' sera aid the survival of the malignant lymphoblasts and suggest a multifaceted role played by these molecules.

Recent researches reveal a role of FLT3 in monocyte differentiation in hematopoiesis. We analyzed the clinical impact of FLT3 alterations in adult AML patients excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who received induction chemotherapy according to morphologic classification. Retrospective review of medical records from three centers in Korea between 1997 and 2007 was performed. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on genomic DNA derived from blood samples of patients before induction chemotherapy for FLT3-ITD detection. We assessed overall survival (OS), first disease-free survival (1-DFS), and response to induction chemotherapy. One hundred eighty-four patients (median age 49.1 years, range 16.0-76.5) with AML excluding APL received induction chemotherapy from three centers. FLT3-ITD was detected in 22 patients. One hundred forty-one patients were below age 60. One hundred seventy-nine patients received induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin (AId) regimen. One hundred nineteen patients achieved complete remission (CR) after first induction chemotherapy. FLT3-ITD was not related to achievement of CR. 1-DFS was longer in patients without FLT3-ITD (median 1-DFS 16.5 vs. 8.5 months, p = 0.025). 1-DFS was not different according to FLT3-ITD status in nonmonocyte lineage leukemia (p = 0.355), while 1-DFS was shorter in monocyte lineage leukemia for FLT3-ITD positive patients (20.9 vs. 2.4 months, p < 0.001). FLT3-ITD had no impact on OS except for monocyte lineage, where OS was significantly shorter in FLT3-ITD positive group (39.4 vs. 6.0 months, p = 0.026). Moreover FLT3-ITD was stronger prognostic factors in monocyte lineage AML than risk stratification based on cytogenetics. Status of FLT3-ITD should be analyzed differently in AML patients according to morphologic profile. FLT3-ITD is a predictive and prognostic marker only in monocyte lineage patients. This result suggests an existence of distinct subset of monocyte lineage AML with leukemogenesis involving FLT3 activating pathway.","['Koh, Youngil', 'Park, Juwon', 'Ahn, Kwang-Sung', 'Kim, Inho', 'Bang, Soo-Mee', 'Lee, Jae-Hoon', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Soon Lee, Dong', 'Yiul Lee, Young', 'Park, Seonyang', 'Kim, Byung-Kook']","['Koh Y', 'Park J', 'Ahn KS', 'Kim I', 'Bang SM', 'Lee JH', 'Yoon SS', 'Soon Lee D', 'Yiul Lee Y', 'Park S', 'Kim BK']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090319,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Korea/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Myelopoiesis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/analysis/chemistry/*genetics']",2009/03/20 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/03/20 09:00'],"['2008/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0733-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Nov;88(11):1089-97. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0733-7.

In this study, inducible expression of Bcr-Abl in TonB.210 cells is associated with increased production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is thought to play a role in survival signaling when generated at specific levels. Elevated ROS in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells were found to activate PI3k/Akt pathway members such as Akt and GSK3beta as well as downstream targets beta-catenin and Mcl-1. The activation of these proteins was inhibited by the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium, which is commonly used to inhibit NADPH oxidase (Nox). This indicated that increased ROS might be related to increased activity of one member of the Nox family. Knock-down experiments using siRNA suggest that Nox-4 is the main source of increased ROS following Bcr-Abl expression. We showed that Bcr-Abl-induced ROS could also increase survival pathway signaling through redox inhibition of PP1alpha, a serine threonine phosphatase that negatively regulates the PI3k/Akt pathway. Overall our results demonstrate that Bcr-Abl expression increases Nox-4-generated ROS, which in turn increases survival signaling through PI3k/Akt pathway by inhibition of PP1alpha, thus contributing to the high level of resistance to apoptosis seen in these Bcr-Abl-expressing cells.","['Naughton, R', 'Quiney, C', 'Turner, S D', 'Cotter, T G']","['Naughton R', 'Quiney C', 'Turner SD', 'Cotter TG']","['Tumour Biology Laboratory, Biochemistry Department, Bioscience Research Institute, University College, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090319,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '6HJ411TU98 (diphenyleneiodonium)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 4)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NOX4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*physiopathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NADPH Oxidase 4', 'NADPH Oxidases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Onium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2009/03/20 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/03/20 09:00'],"['2009/03/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200949 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.49 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1432-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.49.

Overall, our data indicate that the JAK1/JAK2 selective inhibitor CYT387 has potential for efficacious treatment of MPN harboring mutated JAK2 and MPL alleles.","['Pardanani, A', 'Lasho, T', 'Smith, G', 'Burns, C J', 'Fantino, E', 'Tefferi, A']","['Pardanani A', 'Lasho T', 'Smith G', 'Burns CJ', 'Fantino E', 'Tefferi A']","['Hematology Division, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. pardanani.animesh@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090319,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, human)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (TEL-JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Janus Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polycythemia Vera/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",2009/03/20 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/03/20 09:00'],"['2009/03/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200950 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.50 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1441-5. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.50.

We identified 22 patients with marked lymphoproliferation in blood while on dasatinib therapy. Clonality and immunophenotype were analyzed and related clinical information was collected. An abrupt lymphocytosis (peak count range 4-20 x 10(9)/l) with large granular lymphocyte (LGL) morphology was observed after a median of 3 months from the start of therapy and it persisted throughout the therapy. Fifteen patients had a cytotoxic T-cell and seven patients had an NK-cell phenotype. All T-cell expansions were clonal. Adverse effects, such as colitis and pleuritis, were common (18 of 22 patients) and were preceded by LGL lymphocytosis. Accumulation of identical cytotoxic T cells was also detected in pleural effusion and colon biopsy samples. Responses to dasatinib were good and included complete, unexpectedly long-lasting remissions in patients with advanced leukemia. In a phase II clinical study on 46 Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, patients with lymphocytosis had superior survival compared with patients without lymphocytosis. By inhibiting immunoregulatory kinases, dasatinib may induce a reversible state of aberrant immune reactivity associated with good clinical responses and a distinct adverse effect profile.","['Mustjoki, S', 'Ekblom, M', 'Arstila, T P', 'Dybedal, I', 'Epling-Burnette, P K', 'Guilhot, F', 'Hjorth-Hansen, H', 'Hoglund, M', 'Kovanen, P', 'Laurinolli, T', 'Liesveld, J', 'Paquette, R', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, J', 'Rauhala, A', 'Shah, N', 'Simonsson, B', 'Sinisalo, M', 'Steegmann, J L', 'Stenke, L', 'Porkka, K']","['Mustjoki S', 'Ekblom M', 'Arstila TP', 'Dybedal I', 'Epling-Burnette PK', 'Guilhot F', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Hoglund M', 'Kovanen P', 'Laurinolli T', 'Liesveld J', 'Paquette R', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Rauhala A', 'Shah N', 'Simonsson B', 'Sinisalo M', 'Steegmann JL', 'Stenke L', 'Porkka K']","['Hematology Research Unit, Biomedicum Helsinki, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090319,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colitis/chemically induced', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Lymphocytosis/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pleurisy/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2009/03/20 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/03/20 09:00'],"['2009/03/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200946 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.46 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1398-405. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.46.

In this regard, there has been a dramatic shift toward genetic testing and away from traditional tests, such as measurement of red cell mass. Clonal erythrocytosis is the diagnostic feature of polycythemia vera (PV) and is almost always associated with a JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F or exon 12). All other scenarios represent non-clonal erythrocytosis, often referred to as secondary erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin (Epo) level is usually normal or elevated in secondary erythrocytosis and subnormal in PV. Therefore, in a patient with acquired erythrocytosis, it is reasonable to begin the diagnostic work-up with peripheral blood JAK2 mutation analysis and serum Epo measurement to distinguish PV from secondary erythrocytosis. Conversely, the patient with life-long erythrocytosis is more likely to suffer from congenital polycythemia and should therefore be evaluated for germline mutations that result in enhanced Epo effect (for example, Epo receptor mutations), altered intracellular oxygen sensing (for example, mutations involving the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene) or decreased P50 (for example, high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobinopathy). The order of tests in this instance depends on the clinical scenario and serum Epo level.","['Patnaik, M M', 'Tefferi, A']","['Patnaik MM', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090319,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Erythropoietin/blood', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Polycythemia/congenital/*diagnosis/genetics']",2009/03/20 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/03/20 09:00'],"['2009/03/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['leu200954 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.54 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 May;23(5):834-44. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.54.

Moreover, we demonstrated that TRPV5 and TRPV6 channel proteins are present in both the total lysates and the crude membrane preparations from leukemia cells. Immunoprecipitation revealed that a physical interaction between TRPV5 and TRPV6 may take place. Single-channel patch-clamp experiments demonstrated the presence of inwardly rectifying monovalent currents that displayed kinetic characteristics of unitary TRPV5 and/or TRPV6 currents and were blocked by extracellular Ca(2+) and ruthenium red.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: We studied 39 immunocompromised children hospitalized in the IV-th Pediatric Clinic-Oncology Ward, between 1983-2005, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); most of them exhibited defects of humoral immunity such as transitory hypogammaglobulinemia, and defects of the cellular immunity that accompanied hepatomegaly, hepatic cytolysis and biliary obstruction. RESULTS: The diagnostic of ALL was sustained by: medullar biopsy, lumbar punction, cytochemical reactions, blood cell count, flow-cytometry, methotrexate level determination. Hepatic damage was measured by: GOT, GPT, bilirubin, LDH, GGT, FA, HBS antigen, anti HCV antibodies, anti HVA antibodies, anti toxoplasmosis antibodies, anti CMV antibodies, serum protein levels, TQ, inflammation markers. A slight increase in the number of diagnosed ALL cases during the past two decades was noticed and ALL incidence was higher in boys than girls. Hematologic toxicity of MTX is a real problem, causing neutropenia. MTX also caused oral lesions (in 69.36% of children), vomiting (in 69.2% of children) and liver toxicity (in 51.3% of children). MTX serum level 24 hours after administration is significantly different from the serum level at 48 hours after administration. Thus, the use of calcium folinate is proved to be very effective. We have also demonstrated that vomiting had some other causes besides MTX administration.","['Moisa, Stefana Maria', 'Rusu, Adriana', 'Dumitras, Silvia', 'Burlea, M', 'Miron, Ingrid']","['Moisa SM', 'Rusu A', 'Dumitras S', 'Burlea M', 'Miron I']","['Universitatea de Medicina si Farmacie Gr T Popa Iasi, Facultatea de Medicina, Clinica a IV-a Pediatric.']",['rum'],['Journal Article'],,Romania,Rev Med Chir Soc Med Nat Iasi,Revista medico-chirurgicala a Societatii de Medici si Naturalisti din Iasi,0413735,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '12001-76-2 (Vitamin B Complex)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*blood', '*Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Digestive System Diseases/chemically induced', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leucovorin/*therapeutic use', 'Liver Diseases/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*blood', 'Oncology Service, Hospital', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Romania', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vitamin B Complex/*therapeutic use', 'Vomiting/chemically induced/prevention & control']",2009/03/20 09:00,2009/06/26 09:00,['2009/03/20 09:00'],"['2009/03/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Chir Soc Med Nat Iasi. 2008 Apr-Jun;112(2):356-65.,,,,,,"Patologia digestiva la pacientul imunocompromis prin leucemie acuta limfoblastica in experienta clinicii a IV-a pediatrie--sectia himato-oncologie a spitalului de copii Sfanta Maria"" Iasi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A predictive tool based on Fisher discriminant analysis using a training set of 40 patients including four different subtypes (follicular lymphoma n = 15, mantle cell lymphoma n = 7, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia n = 6 and splenic marginal zone lymphoma n = 12) was designed. A short additional preliminary analysis to gauge the accuracy of this signature was then performed on an external set of nine patients. Using this model, eight of nine of those samples were classified successfully. This pilot study demonstrates that such a microarray tool may be a promising diagnostic approach for small B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","['Gillet, Jean-Pierre', 'Molina, Thierry Jo', 'Jamart, Jacques', 'Gaulard, Philippe', 'Leroy, Karen', 'Briere, Josette', 'Theate, Ivan', 'Thieblemont, Catherine', 'Bosly, Andre', 'Herin, Michel', 'Hamels, Jacques', 'Remacle, Jose']","['Gillet JP', 'Molina TJ', 'Jamart J', 'Gaulard P', 'Leroy K', 'Briere J', 'Theate I', 'Thieblemont C', 'Bosly A', 'Herin M', 'Hamels J', 'Remacle J']","['Research Unit of Cellular Biology (URBC), University of Namur (FUNDP, Namur, Belgium. gilletjp@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pilot Projects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/isolation & purification']",2009/03/19 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/03/19 09:00'],"['2009/03/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']","['909597568 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190902763459 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Mar;50(3):410-8. doi: 10.1080/10428190902763459.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the demographics, treatment, and outcomes of paediatric patients in El Salvador with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to determine the incidence, causes, and risk factors for TRM. Two trained data managers collected data prospectively; no patients were excluded. Biological, socioeconomic and nutritional predictors were examined. A total of 469 patients with ALL and 78 patients with AML were included. The 2-year cumulative incidence of TRM was significantly higher among children with AML (35.4+/-6.4%) than those with ALL (12.5+/-1.7%; P<0.0001). However, the proportion of deaths attributable to the toxicity of treatment did not differ significantly between AML (25/47, 53.2%) and ALL (55/107, 51.4%; P=0.98). Among children with ALL, low monthly income (P=0.04) and low parental education (P=0.02) significantly increased the risk of TRM. Among children with AML, biological, socioeconomic, and nutritional variables were not associated with TRM. In this low-income country, toxic death significantly contributes to mortality in both ALL and AML. A better understanding of the effect of socioeconomic status on TRM may suggest specific strategies for patients with ALL.","['Gupta, S', 'Bonilla, M', 'Fuentes, S L', 'Caniza, M', 'Howard, S C', 'Barr, R', 'Greenberg, M L', 'Ribeiro, R', 'Sung, L']","['Gupta S', 'Bonilla M', 'Fuentes SL', 'Caniza M', 'Howard SC', 'Barr R', 'Greenberg ML', 'Ribeiro R', 'Sung L']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology and Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090317,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Educational Status', 'El Salvador/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*mortality/therapy', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",2009/03/19 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2009/03/19 09:00'],"['2009/03/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]']","['6604895 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6604895 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2009 Apr 7;100(7):1026-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604895.

We show that the Moloney leukemia virus long terminal repeat (LTR) enhancer has the strongest activity in both a gamma-RV and a LV vector context, while an internal cellular promoter induces deregulation of gene expression less frequently, at a shorter range and to a lower extent in both vector types.

Under current protocols, BMD decreases during intensive chemotherapy and fracture risk increases. Although total body BMD may eventually return to normal after completion of chemotherapy, lumbar spine trabecular BMD may remain low for many years. The implications for long-term fracture risk are unknown. Risk factors for low BMD include high dose methotrexate, higher cumulative doses of glucocorticoids, male gender and low physical activity. BMD outcome in non-ALL childhood cancers has been less well studied but there is evidence that survivors of childhood brain or bone tumours, and survivors of bone marrow transplants for childhood malignancy, all have a high risk of long-term osteopenia.

Good evidence on risk factors for obesity in ALL is available, and the natural history and aetiology of obesity in ALL are now fairly well understood, while for craniopharyngioma the natural history is reasonably well understood.

The North American Brain Tumor Consortium conducted a phase II study to evaluate the therapeutic potential of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a PDGFR inhibitor, in patients with recurrent meningiomas. Patients were stratified into benign (WHO grade I) meningiomas or atypical (WHO grade II) and malignant (WHO grade III) meningiomas. The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival (6M-PFS). Patients requiring enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs were ineligible. Patients received imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/day for the first 4-week cycle and then gradually increased to 800 mg/day for subsequent cycles, if there were no unacceptable toxicities. Plasma concentrations of imatinib and its active metabolite, CGP74588, were assessed. Twenty-three heavily pretreated patients were enrolled into the study (13 benign, 5 atypical, and 5 malignant meningiomas), of whom 22 were eligible. The study was closed prematurely due to slow accrual. Tissue was available only from a minority of patients, but in these specimens there was uniform distribution of PDGFR, the drug target. Imatinib was generally well tolerated. Of 19 patients evaluable for response, 10 progressed at the first scan, and 9 were stable. There were no complete or partial responses. Overall median PFS was 2 months (range, 0.7-34 months); 6M-PFS was 29.4%. For benign meningiomas, median PFS was 3 months (range, 1.1-34 months); 6M-PFS was 45%. For atypical and malignant meningiomas, median PFS was 2 months (range, 0.7-3.7 months); 6M-PFS was 0%.

The development of EBV-LPD has been associated with the use of immunosuppressive agents used in solid organ, bone marrow, and stem cell transplantation and in certain congenital immunodeficiencies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a single-institution phase I dose-escalation trial of siplizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to CD2, in 29 patients with T-cell malignancies. RESULTS: Although initial responses were encouraging, 4 (13.7%) patients developed EBV-LPD and the trial was stopped. Reductions in CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell count numbers in response to therapy were seen in all patients, but in those patients developing EBV-LPD a significantly greater reduction in natural killer (NK) cell number and CD2 expression on T cells was seen. These findings highlight the importance of NK-cell depletion and CD2 expression in addition to T-cell depletion in the etiology of EBV-LPD. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of EBV-LPD may be associated with the ability of siplizumab to deplete both T and NK cells without affecting B cells. Agents that deplete T- and NK-cell populations without affecting B cell number should be screened for this potentially serious adverse event.","[""O'Mahony, Deirdre"", 'Morris, John C', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Matthews, Helen', 'Brown, Margaret R', 'Fleisher, Thomas', 'Pittaluga, Stefania', 'Raffeld, Mark', 'Albert, Paul S', 'Reitsma, Dirk', 'Kaucic, Karen', 'Hammershaimb, Luz', 'Waldmann, Thomas A', 'Janik, John E']","[""O'Mahony D"", 'Morris JC', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Matthews H', 'Brown MR', 'Fleisher T', 'Pittaluga S', 'Raffeld M', 'Albert PS', 'Reitsma D', 'Kaucic K', 'Hammershaimb L', 'Waldmann TA', 'Janik JE']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland and MedImmune, Inc, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090317,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', 'KUW1QG1ZM3 (siplizumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2009/03/19 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/03/19 09:00'],"['2009/03/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-1254 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1254 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Apr 1;15(7):2514-22. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1254.

We investigated the roles of the two major lymphocyte integrins LFA-1 and VLA-4 on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in these processes. We found that the majority of CLL cells expressed significantly reduced LFA-1 due to low beta2 integrin transcripts. VLA-4 expression was heterogeneous but underwent rapid activation by the BM chemokine CXCL12. CLL cells failed to transmigrate across VCAM-1-expressing, ICAM-1-expressing, and CXCL12-expressing endothelium, whereas when LFA-1 expression was regained in subsets of CLL cells, these lymphocytes rapidly transmigrated the endothelium. Furthermore, when injected into tail veins of immunodeficient mice, normal B cells rapidly homed to lymph nodes (LN) in a LFA-1-dependent manner, whereas CLL cells did not. Nevertheless, only residual CLL subsets could reenter BM, whereas both normal and CLL cells homed to the mice spleen in an LFA-1-independent and VLA-4-independent manner. Our results suggest that CLL cells have a reduced capacity to adhere and transmigrate through multiple vascular endothelial beds and poorly home to lymphoid organs other than spleen. Integrin blocking could thus be an efficient strategy to prevent circulating CLL cells from reaching prosurvival niches in LNs and BM but not in spleen.","['Hartmann, Tanja Nicole', 'Grabovsky, Valentin', 'Wang, Wei', 'Desch, Petra', 'Rubenzer, Gabriele', 'Wollner, Stefan', 'Binsky, Inbal', 'Vallon-Eberhard, Alexandra', 'Sapoznikov, Anita', 'Burger, Meike', 'Shachar, Idit', 'Haran, Michal', 'Honczarenko, Marek', 'Greil, Richard', 'Alon, Ronen']","['Hartmann TN', 'Grabovsky V', 'Wang W', 'Desch P', 'Rubenzer G', 'Wollner S', 'Binsky I', 'Vallon-Eberhard A', 'Sapoznikov A', 'Burger M', 'Shachar I', 'Haran M', 'Honczarenko M', 'Greil R', 'Alon R']","['Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Third Medical Department, Salzburg University Hospital, Salzburg, Austria. t.hartmann@salk.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090317,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Movement/*immunology', 'Chemokines/immunology', 'Endothelial Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*immunology/pathology', 'Spleen/immunology']",2009/03/19 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/03/19 09:00'],"['2009/03/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-4136 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4136 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Apr 1;69(7):3121-30. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4136.

Through the use of DC vaccines (DC after exposure to tumour antigens), cryopreserved in single-use aliquots, an attractive and novel immunotherapeutic strategy is available as an option for treatment. In this paper we describe an in vitro attempt to scale-up production of clinical-grade DC vaccines from leukemic cells. Blast cells of two relapsed AML patients were harvested for DC generation in serum-free culture medium containing clinical-grade cytokines GM-CSF, IL-4 and TNF-alpha. Cells from patient 1 were cultured in a bag and those from patient 2 were cultured in a flask. The numbers of seeding cells were 2.24 x 10(8) and 0.8 x 10(8), respectively. DC yields were 10 x 10(6) and 29.8 x 10(6) cells, giving a conversion rate of 4.7% and 37%, respectively. These DC vaccines were then cryopreserved in approximately one million cells per vial with 20% fresh frozen group AB plasma and 10% DMSO. At 12 months and 21 months post cryopreservation, these DC vaccines were thawed, and their sterility, viability, phenotype and functionality were studied. DC vaccines remained sterile up to 21 months of storage. Viability of the cryopreserved DC in the culture bag and flask was found to be 50% and 70% at 12 months post cryopreservation respectively; and 48% and 67% at 21 months post cryopreservation respectively. These DC vaccines exhibited mature DC surface phenotypic markers of CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR, and negative for haemopoietic markers. Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) study showed functional DC vaccines. These experiments demonstrated that it is possible to produce clinical-grade DC vaccines in vitro from blast cells of leukemic patients, which could be cryopreserved up to 21 months for use if repeated vaccinations are required in the course of therapy.","['Tan, Yuen-Fen', 'Sim, Geok-Choo', 'Habsah, Aziz', 'Leong, Chooi-Fun', 'Cheong, Soon-Keng']","['Tan YF', 'Sim GC', 'Habsah A', 'Leong CF', 'Cheong SK']","['Cell Banking Unit, MAKNA-HUKM Cancer Institute, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']",2009/03/19 09:00,2009/05/01 09:00,['2009/03/19 09:00'],"['2009/03/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2008 Dec;30(2):73-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown that, like human blood neutrophils, both neutrophil-like cells expressed high levels of CD11b, but unlike human blood neutrophils these cells almost lack LCL-detectable intracellular oxidase activity. By studying the pattern of activation to OZ and PMA and priming with GM-CSF, we concluded that there is no difference between the percentage of differentiation and function of DMSO-induced HL 60 and PLB 985. However, the LCL capacity (area under the curve) of DMSO induced PLB 985 cells was higher than that of HL 60 cells in response to both PMA and OZ, which implies a higher capacity to generate reactive oxygen species in PLB 985 cells.","['Ashkenazi, Avraham', 'Marks, Robert S']","['Ashkenazi A', 'Marks RS']","['Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, PO Box 653, Beer-Sheva 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Luminescence,Luminescence : the journal of biological and chemical luminescence,100889025,"['5EXP385Q4F (Luminol)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Luminescence', 'Luminescent Measurements/*methods', 'Luminol/*chemistry', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects', 'Phagocytes/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Reference Values', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zymosan/pharmacology']",2009/03/18 09:00,2009/09/23 06:00,['2009/03/18 09:00'],"['2009/03/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bio.1091 [doi]'],ppublish,Luminescence. 2009 May-Jun;24(3):171-7. doi: 10.1002/bio.1091.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this immunophenotype is not specific for APL. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether further biological characterization of the HLA-DR(neg) acute myeloid leukemia patients would allow more clearly define criteria to separate APL from non-APL patients. METHODS: Immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, molecular analyses, and cytomorphology were prospectively performed within routine leukemia diagnostics of 800 patients included in different prospective acute myeloid leukemia multicenter trials. RESULTS: Beside 60 APL, an additional 62 HLA-DR(neg) non-APL patients were identified. The main differential characteristics of HLA-DR(neg) non-APL included high CXCR-4 expression in most patients and almost all leukemia cells, a significantly higher proportion of patients presenting with NPM1 mutations as well as the significant association with cup-like nuclear morphology. The biological distinctness of both leukemia subtypes was further emphasized by the complete absence of aberrant CD2 expression and increased leukocyte and platelet counts in HLA-DR(neg) non-APL patients. Even in the CD34(pos) subgroup of HLA-DR(neg) non-APL all those features contributed in at least the same way to the separation from APL. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show that an immunophenotypic, molecular, and cytomorphologic separation of both HLA-DR(neg) leukemia subgroups is possible indicating that both groups are biologically distinct.","['Oelschlaegel, Uta', 'Mohr, Brigitte', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Schakel, Ulrike', 'Kroschinsky, Frank', 'Illmer, Thomas', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Thiede, Christian']","['Oelschlaegel U', 'Mohr B', 'Schaich M', 'Schakel U', 'Kroschinsky F', 'Illmer T', 'Ehninger G', 'Thiede C']","['University Hospital, University of Technics, Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, Dresden, Germany. uta.oelschlaegel@uniklinikum-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Since the function of promyelocytic leukemia protein (pml) is provoked by ras to promote apoptosis and senescence in untransformed cells, the function is probably masked in CML. Imatinib specifically inhibits bcr-abl and induces apoptosis of CML cells. As reported previously, p53(wild) CML was more resistant to imatinib than that lacking p53. Here, we searched for an imatinib-induced p53 independent proapoptotic mechanism. We found imatinib up-regulated phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), checkpoint kinase 2 (chk2) and transactivation-competent (TA) p73; expression of pml and bax; formation of PML-nuclear body (NB); and co-localization of TAp73/PML-NB in p53-nonfunctioning K562 and p53(mutant) Meg-01 CML cells, but not in BCR-ABL(-) HL60 cells. In K562 cells, with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), knockdown of pml led to dephosphorylation of TAp73. Knockdown of either pml or TAp73 abolished the imatinib-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of p38 MAPK with SB203580 led to dephosphorylation of TAp73, abolishment of TAp73/PML-NB co-localization, and the subsequent apoptosis. Conversely, interferon alpha-2a (IFNalpha), which increased phosphrylated TAp73 and TAp73/PML-NB co-localization, increased additively apoptosis with imatinib. The imatinib-induced TAp73/PML-NB co-localization was accompanied by co-immpunoprecipitation of TAp73 with pml. The imatinib-induced co-localization was also found in primary CML cells from 3 of 6 patients, including 2 with p53(mutant) and one with p53(wild). A novel p53-independent proapoptotic mechanism using p38 MAPK /pml/TAp73 axis with a step processing at PML-NB and probably with chk2 and bax being involved is hereby evident in some imatinib-treated CML cells.","['Liu, Jin-Hwang', 'Liu, Chin-Cheng', 'Yen, Chueh-Chuan', 'Gau, Jyh-Pyng', 'Wang, Wei-Shu', 'Tzeng, Cheng-Hwai']","['Liu JH', 'Liu CC', 'Yen CC', 'Gau JP', 'Wang WS', 'Tzeng CH']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China. jhwang.liu@msa.hinet.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2009/03/18 09:00,2009/05/29 09:00,['2009/03/18 09:00'],"['2009/03/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24329 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Jul 1;125(1):71-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24329.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we examine eight cases of cutaneous lymphoblastic lymphoma in children, which is the largest series to date of tumours confined to the skin with or without local lymph nodes (stage I or II) but without systemic disease at diagnosis. METHODS: The clinical history and histology from the eight cases were reviewed together with a panel of immunohistochemical stains to confirm lineage and diagnosis. RESULTS: Seven of the eight cases were confirmed as B-lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LBL) of the skin, with the eighth case representing a CD4+/CD56+ plasmacytoid dendritic cell tumour. The cases were all stage I or II, and all patients received systemic chemotherapy after full staging investigations to exclude systemic disease at diagnosis. All patients remained in complete remission at the time of last follow-up of between 3 and 9 years from diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphoblastic lymphoma may present primarily in the skin without systemic manifestation, with the majority of such cases representing B-LBL. A rare case of childhood CD4+/CD56+ plasmacytoid dendritic cell tumour with similar blastic morphology is also described. Full staging investigations are mandatory at diagnosis to exclude systemic disease.

Recent studies have provided indisputable evidence for a role of miRNAs in normal haematopoiesis adding a further layer of complexity to the regulatory process. Leukaemia and lymphoma are characterised by dysregulation of survival and differentiation in haematopoietic progenitor cells. There are several lines of evidence supporting the notion that miRNA dysfunction is contributory, whether by extrapolation from miRNA-mediated oncogenesis in other disorders, by miRNA profiling, or by in vivo and in vitro functional studies of miRNAs in haematological malignancies. Further work is underway to delineate the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of malignant blood disorders, with the eventual hope that this will aid in the diagnosis and the development of potential novel cures for such diseases, many of which still have an unacceptable prognosis.","['Bryant, Adam', 'Lutherborrow, Mark', 'Ma, David']","['Bryant A', 'Lutherborrow M', 'Ma D']","[""Blood, Stem Cells and Cancer Research, St Vincent's Hospital and University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary/*genetics', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs']",2009/03/18 09:00,2009/08/19 09:00,['2009/03/18 09:00'],"['2009/03/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [medline]']","['S0031-3025(16)32014-1 [pii]', '10.1080/00313020902756287 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathology. 2009;41(3):204-13. doi: 10.1080/00313020902756287.,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A HPLC-MS/MS system was used to quantify intracellular NTP and dNTP pools. RESULTS: The assay was linear between 50 nM, the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), and 10 muM in cell lysate. The within-day coefficients of variation (CVs, n = 5) were found to be 12.0-18.0% at the LLOQ and 3.0-9.0% between 500 and 5,000 nM for dNTPs and 8.0-15.0% and 2.0-6.0% for NTPs.

Provided by the JCBBN, between February 1997 and September 2006, 22 patients had CBT as a second HSCT. In the initial HSCT, eight received autologous, seven received CBT, and the remaining had allogenic BMT. At the time of CBT as a second HSCT, seven were in the second complete remission (CR2), two in the third CR (CR3), the remaining were not in remission. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) conducted for 10 cases and myeloablative conditioning (MAC) for 12 cases. The overall survival rate was 31.3%, 5 years after CBT. Second complete remission at second transplantation was favorable prognosis (58.3 +/- 18.6%, compared with 17.1 +/- 10.8% for the non-CR group. Mortality after CBT as a second HSCT accounted for 15 cases, 8 from treatment-related mortality. In conclusion, CBT combined with RIC as second HSCT may be useful against a recurrence of AML in children after the initial HSCT.","['Oda, M', 'Isoyama, K', 'Ito, E', 'Inoue, M', 'Tsuchida, M', 'Kigasawa, H', 'Kato, K', 'Kato, S']","['Oda M', 'Isoyama K', 'Ito E', 'Inoue M', 'Tsuchida M', 'Kigasawa H', 'Kato K', 'Kato S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, 1-30 Fujigaoka, Aoba-ku, Yokohama, 227-8501, Japan. isoyama@showa-university-fujigaoka.gr.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Osaka, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Ibaraki, Japan."", ""Division of Hemato-oncology/Regulation Medicine, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Kanagawa, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan."", 'Department of Cell Transplantation, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090318,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Autologous/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/03/18 09:00,2009/06/27 09:00,['2009/03/18 09:00'],"['2008/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/12/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0266-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0266-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Apr;89(3):374-382. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0266-9.

Currently, bone marrow biopsy is used for diagnosis. Noninvasive biomarkers for the early diagnosis of pediatric ALL are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to discover potential protein biomarkers for pediatric ALL. METHODS: Ninety-four pediatric ALL patients and 84 controls were randomly divided into a ""training"" set (45 ALL patients, 34 healthy controls) and a test set (49 ALL patients, 30 healthy controls and 30 pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients). Serum proteomic profiles were measured using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (SELDI-TOF-MS). A classification model was established by Biomarker Pattern Software (BPS). Candidate protein biomarkers were purified by HPLC, identified by LC-MS/MS and validated using ProteinChip immunoassays. RESULTS: A total of 7 protein peaks (9290 m/z, 7769 m/z, 15110 m/z, 7564 m/z, 4469 m/z, 8937 m/z, 8137 m/z) were found with differential expression levels in the sera of pediatric ALL patients and controls using SELDI-TOF-MS and then analyzed by BPS to construct a classification model in the ""training"" set. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were found to be 91.8%, and 90.0%, respectively, in the test set. Two candidate protein peaks (7769 and 9290 m/z) were found to be down-regulated in ALL patients, where these were identified as platelet factor 4 (PF4) and pro-platelet basic protein precursor (PBP). Two other candidate protein peaks (8137 and 8937 m/z) were found up-regulated in the sera of ALL patients, and these were identified as fragments of the complement component 3a (C3a). CONCLUSION: Platelet factor (PF4), connective tissue activating peptide III (CTAP-III) and two fragments of C3a may be potential protein biomarkers of pediatric ALL and used to distinguish pediatric ALL patients from healthy controls and pediatric AML patients. Further studies with additional populations or using pre-diagnostic sera are needed to confirm the importance of these findings as diagnostic markers of pediatric ALL.","['Shi, Linan', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Wu, Peng', 'Feng, Kai', 'Li, Jing', 'Xie, Zhensheng', 'Xue, Peng', 'Cai, Tanxi', 'Cui, Ziyou', 'Chen, Xiulan', 'Hou, Junjie', 'Zhang, Jianzhong', 'Yang, Fuquan']","['Shi L', 'Zhang J', 'Wu P', 'Feng K', 'Li J', 'Xie Z', 'Xue P', 'Cai T', 'Cui Z', 'Chen X', 'Hou J', 'Zhang J', 'Yang F']","['Proteomic Platform, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Center for Experimental Medicine, 306 Hospital of PLA, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Proteomic Platform, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Center for Experimental Medicine, 306 Hospital of PLA, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Proteomic Platform, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Proteomic Platform, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Proteomic Platform, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Proteomic Platform, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Proteomic Platform, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Proteomic Platform, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Proteomic Platform, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Center for Experimental Medicine, 306 Hospital of PLA, Beijing 100101, PR China.', 'Proteomic Platform, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090316,England,Proteome Sci,Proteome science,101170539,,,,2009/03/18 09:00,2009/03/18 09:01,['2009/03/18 09:00'],"['2008/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/18 09:01 [medline]']","['1477-5956-7-7 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-5956-7-7 [doi]']",epublish,Proteome Sci. 2009 Mar 16;7:7. doi: 10.1186/1477-5956-7-7.,,,,,PMC2662805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased expression of BAFF and APRIL is noted in hematological malignancies. BAFF and APRIL are essential for the survival of normal and malignant B lymphocytes, and altered expression of BAFF or APRIL or of their receptors (BCMA, TACI, or BAFF-R) have been reported in various B-cell malignancies including B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. METHODS: We compared the expression of BAFF, APRIL, TACI and BAFF-R gene expression in 40 human tumor types - brain, epithelial, lymphoid, germ cells - to that of their normal tissue counterparts using publicly available gene expression data, including the Oncomine Cancer Microarray database. RESULTS: We found significant overexpression of TACI in multiple myeloma and thyroid carcinoma and an association between TACI expression and prognosis in lymphoma. Furthermore, BAFF and APRIL are overexpressed in many cancers and we show that APRIL expression is associated with tumor progression. We also found overexpression of at least one proteoglycan with heparan sulfate chains (HS), which are coreceptors for APRIL and TACI, in tumors where APRIL is either overexpressed or is a prognostic factor. APRIL could induce survival or proliferation directly through HS proteoglycans. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data suggest that APRIL is a potential prognostic factor for a large array of malignancies.","['Moreaux, Jerome', 'Veyrune, Jean-Luc', 'De Vos, John', 'Klein, Bernard']","['Moreaux J', 'Veyrune JL', 'De Vos J', 'Klein B']","['CHU Montpellier, Institute of Research in Biotherapy, Montpellier, France. jerome.moreaux@inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090316,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (TNFRSF13B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)', '0 (heparin proteoglycan)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '99123-36-1 (bis(3-bis(4-chlorophenyl)methyl-4-dimethylaminophenyl)amine)', '9N3CBB0BIQ (Diphenylamine)']",IM,"['B-Cell Activating Factor/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Carcinoma/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Diphenylamine/analogs & derivatives/immunology/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Heparin/analogs & derivatives/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteoglycans/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/genetics/immunology/*metabolism']",2009/03/18 09:00,2009/07/07 09:00,['2009/03/18 09:00'],"['2008/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-9-83 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-9-83 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2009 Mar 16;9:83. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-9-83.,,,,,PMC2662875,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 1273 patients were recruited. The response rate was 62% (complete remission 54%, complete remission without platelet/neutrophil recovery 8%); 5-year survival was 12%. No benefits were observed in either dose escalation randomization, or from a fourth course of treatment. There was a trend for inferior response in the PSC-833 arm due to deaths in induction. Multivariable analysis identified cytogenetics, presenting white blood count, age and secondary disease as the main predictors of outcome. Although patients with high Pgp expression and function had worse response and survival, this was not an independent prognostic factor, and was not modified by PSC-833. In conclusion, these four interventions have not improved outcomes in older patients.

For certain cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the application of quantitative procedures to assess and subsequently direct therapy has given rise to the slowly maturing field of MRD (minimal residual disease) management. Although excellent protocols exist for performing these analyses, akin to all PCR procedures the limit of detection can vary markedly between laboratories. The present paper is an overview that describes how the analytical field relating to miniaturization is likely to identify the missing link that integrates sample processing with downstream PCR, analysis and eventual therapy. Miniaturized devices are suited to the multi-parallelized handling of defined numbers of cells, and PCR-based microfluidic procedures have become reasonably established. The integration of sample processing and PCR in microfluidic devices is beginning to offer reproducible quantitative data that relate the number of biomarker nucleic acids to the defined analysed cell or cells for meaningful clinical assessment. The application of MRD may, through integrated miniaturized PCR, become more reliable and routine with additional applications in defining disease threshold levels for other cancer types. These enabling integrated platforms may facilitate biomarker measurements to predict the response and outcome, which are also of current interest for personalized medical care.","['Day, Philip J R']",['Day PJ'],"['Quantitative Analytical Genomics, The Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. philip.j.day@manchester.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Humans', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Nucleic Acids/analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2009/03/18 09:00,2009/05/12 09:00,['2009/03/18 09:00'],"['2009/03/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/12 09:00 [medline]']","['BST0370424 [pii]', '10.1042/BST0370424 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2009 Apr;37(Pt 2):424-6. doi: 10.1042/BST0370424.,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, Lyn deficiency was shown to be responsible for a phenotype resembling myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) in mice. We aimed to shed more light on Lyn's role in haematological neoplasm and systematically investigated Lyn expression in MPN, acute and chronic leukaemia subtypes (n = 236). On top, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and chronic myeloid leukaemia significantly overexpressed Lyn when compared to de novo acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and Philadelphia-chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (p < 0.001). Most of acute leukaemia subtypes showed a notable down-regulation of Lyn mRNA but anyhow individual cases were labelled for the active form of Lyn protein. Intriguingly, secondary AML evolved in myelodysplastic syndromes revealed almost undetectable Lyn. Overexpression of Lyn in B-CLL was associated with a significant down-regulation of microRNA-337-5p suggesting that aberrant expression of this particular microRNA could be involved in post-transcriptional control of Lyn mRNA fate. We conclude that tyrosine kinase Lyn contributes to the malignant phenotype in certain leukaemia subtypes and therefore attracts targeted therapy.","['Hussein, Kais', 'von Neuhoff, Nils', 'Busche, Guntram', 'Buhr, Thomas', 'Kreipe, Hans', 'Bock, Oliver']","['Hussein K', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Busche G', 'Buhr T', 'Kreipe H', 'Bock O']","['Institute of Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090317,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn337 microRNA, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia/classification/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/enzymology/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'Young Adult', 'src-Family Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2009/03/18 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2009/03/18 09:00'],"['2008/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0727-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Nov;88(11):1059-67. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0727-5.

We assessed the impact of SES on survival in two large population-based cohorts of AML and MM patients diagnosed in Sweden 1973 to 2005. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The relative risk of death (all cause and cause specific) in relation to SES was estimated using Cox's proportional hazards regression. We also conducted analyses stratified by calendar periods (1973 to 1979, 1980 to 1989, 1990 to 1999, and 2000 to 2005). RESULTS: We identified a total of 9,165 and 14,744 patients with AML and MM, respectively. Overall, higher white-collar workers had a lower mortality than other SES groups for both AML (P = .005) and MM (P < .005). In AML patients, a consistently higher overall mortality was observed in blue-collar workers compared with higher white-collar workers in the last three periods (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.51; HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.45; HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.57, respectively). In MM, no difference was observed in the first two calendar periods. However, in 1990 to 1999, self-employed (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.37), blue-collar workers (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.32), and retired (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.80) had a higher mortality compared to higher white-collar workers. In 2000 to 2005, blue-collar workers had a higher mortality (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.60) compared with higher white-collar workers. CONCLUSION: SES was significantly associated with survival in both AML and MM. Most conspicuously, a lower mortality was observed among the highest SES group during more recent calendar periods. Differences in management, comorbidity, and lifestyle, are likely factors to explain these findings.","['Kristinsson, Sigurdur Yngvi', 'Derolf, Asa Rangert', 'Edgren, Gustaf', 'Dickman, Paul W', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus']","['Kristinsson SY', 'Derolf AR', 'Edgren G', 'Dickman PW', 'Bjorkholm M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden. sigurdur.kristinsson@karolinska.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090316,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/economics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/economics/*mortality', 'Registries', '*Social Class', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2009/03/18 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/03/18 09:00'],"['2009/03/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.18.2006 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.18.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 20;27(12):2073-80. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.18.2006.

Naturally occurring mutations in the C-terminal domain of nucleophosmin (Cter-NPM1) are found in approximately 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations cause changes at the C terminus of NPM1 that lead to denaturation of the protein, a critical factor in determining aberrant translocation of NPM1 to the cytosol. Hence, this protein system represents an ideal candidate to investigate the relations between folding and unfolding and disease. Here we report the characterization of the folding and unfolding kinetics of Cter-NPM1. Data reveal that this small helical domain folds via a compact denatured state, displaying a malleable residual structure. Moreover, analysis of folding rate constants measured under different experimental conditions suggests that the existence of a preorganized structure in the denatured state accelerates folding, implying a native-like residual structure. Because a major feature of Cter-NPM1 mutants responsible for AML is a reduction in stability of the protein and thus prevalence of a denatured state even under physiological conditions, our findings may pave the way to further studies with the aim of designing chemicals capable of interacting with the ""pathological"" mutants to stabilize the native conformation.","['Scaloni, Flavio', 'Gianni, Stefano', 'Federici, Luca', 'Falini, Brunangelo', 'Brunori, Maurizio']","['Scaloni F', 'Gianni S', 'Federici L', 'Falini B', 'Brunori M']","['Istituto Pasteur Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti and Dipartimento di Scienze Biochimiche A.

We analyzed 215 cases of CD103+ B-lymphoproliferative disorders to further delineate their immunophenotypic features. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that 78.6% of all cases expressed CD25 and CD103, characteristic of classical HCL. Cases analyzed immunohistochemically were also invariably positive for annexin-A1; a subset coexpressed CD10 (33/169 [19.5%]) or BCL1 (26/65 [36.9%]). In contrast, 21.4% of cases lacked CD25, a subset of which was analyzed and was invariably negative for annexin-A1, CD10, and BCL1. The CD25- cases had variable morphologic features ranging from HCLv and SMZL to prolymphocytic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Clinically, patients with CD25- disease tended to be older (P= .001), typically had leukocytosis (P= .014), and did not respond well to cladribine or pentostatin. We suggest categorizing CD103+ B-lymphoproliferative disorders into 2 groups. While HCL coexpresses CD25 and annexin-A1, diseases lacking CD25 and annexin-A1 behave clinically differently and can be separated from HCL on diagnosis.","['Dong, Henry Y', 'Weisberger, James', 'Liu, Zach', 'Tugulea, Sorina']","['Dong HY', 'Weisberger J', 'Liu Z', 'Tugulea S']","['Genzyme Genetics, 521 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Integrin alpha Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (alpha E integrins)', '0 (annexin-A1 receptor, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Integrin alpha Chains/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*classification/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Peptide/*biosynthesis']",2009/03/18 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/03/18 09:00'],"['2009/03/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']","['131/4/586 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPL13YDUHFKPJU [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2009 Apr;131(4):586-95. doi: 10.1309/AJCPL13YDUHFKPJU.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since they share the same core DNA binding site, we investigated whether they may contribute to erythroleukemia by common mechanisms. Using inducible knockdown, we demonstrated that Fli-1 contributes to proliferation, survival, and differentiation arrest of erythroleukemic cells harboring an activated fli-1 locus. Similarly, we used inducible Fli-1 knockdown and either hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA)- or small interfering RNA-mediated Spi-1 knockdown to investigate their respective contributions in erythroleukemic cells harboring an activated spi-1 locus. In these cells, simple or double knockdown of both Spi-1 and Fli-1 additively contributed to induce proliferation arrest and differentiation. Transcriptome profiling revealed that virtually all transcripts affected by both Fli-1 knockdown and HMBA are affected in an additive manner. Among these additively downregulated transcripts, more than 20% encode proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, and conserved ETS binding sites are present in their gene promoters. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated the association of Spi-1 and Fli-1 on these promoters in Friend erythroleukemic cells.

Recently the L611S point mutation in JAK2 has been identified in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we analyzed the mechanism by which JAK2 exhibits its oncogenicity. In BaF3 murine hematopoietic cells, L611S mutant increased the expression of antiapoptotic proteins including X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, inhibitor of apoptosis protein, and Bcl-XL. We also showed that JAK2 L611S mutant protects BaF3 cells from cytokine withdrawal-induced apoptotic cell death and leads to cytokine-independent cell growth. Furthermore BaF3 cells expressing JAK2 L611S mutant gained the ability to induce tumorigenesis in nude mice. The L611S mutant also exhibited malignancy, including prompt invasion and spreading into various organs, leading to rapid lethality of the mice. Finally we showed that a specific JAK2 inhibitor, AG490, potently inhibited cytokine-independent cell growth induced by JAK2 L611S mutant via the induction of apoptotic cell death. In addition, treatment with AG490 significantly inhibited the JAK2 L611S mutant-induced tumorigenesis in nude mice. Thus, our results both in vitro and in vivo strongly suggest that L611S mutant of JAK2 harbors potent oncogenic activity, and this probably requires the antiapoptotic signaling pathway.","['Funakoshi-Tago, Megumi', 'Tago, Kenji', 'Sumi, Kazuya', 'Abe, Miyuki', 'Aizu-Yokota, Eriko', 'Oshio, Tomoyuki', 'Sonoda, Yoshiko', 'Kasahara, Tadashi']","['Funakoshi-Tago M', 'Tago K', 'Sumi K', 'Abe M', 'Aizu-Yokota E', 'Oshio T', 'Sonoda Y', 'Kasahara T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan. tago-mg@pha.keio.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090316,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/*etiology/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Splenic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*etiology/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",2009/03/18 09:00,2009/07/22 09:00,['2009/03/18 09:00'],"['2009/03/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)58266-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M808879200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 May 8;284(19):12680-90. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M808879200.

METHOD: This retrospective review included all newly diagnosed children with acute lymphoblastic Leukaemia less than 15 years of age registered from April 1999 to December 2004 at oncology unit of National Institute of Child Health and Children Cancer Hospital, Karachi. The objective was to look for epidemiological data, the clinical features and laboratory findings at presentation and compare it with reported literature. RESULTS: Acute lymphoblastic Leukaemia constituted 32% (611 /1890) of all cancers in this study. Majority of patients hailed from Karachi (59%) and interior Sindh (27%) while rest from other parts of country. Patient's referral increased over the years, from 42 in 1999 to 127 in 2004. The age ranged between 3 months to 15 years with a median age of 6.5 years. Male to female ratio was 1.7:1 Family history of cancer was present in 5% of patients. Fever and pallor were the commonest presenting features. Anaemia (86%), lymphadenopathy (75%) hepatomegaly (67%) and splenomegly (58%) were common findings on physical examination. Initial high white cell count (> 50,000) was observed in 34% patients. Haemoglobin < 7gm/dl was seen in 54% and Platelet counts less than 20,000 was observed in 33% cases. CNS disease was present in 5% and HBsAg was positive in 14% patients at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia accounts for one third of total registered cases. Age distribution in this series shows less prominemt early peak and more significant late peak and a median age of 6 years. Consangunity was found in 47% cases. The fraction with a WBC count above 50,000 mm3 (30%), a higher proportion with lymphadenopathy (75%) and haemoglobin less than 7 gm/dl (54%) suggest that Pakistani children have significantly higher burdens of Leukaemia cells at presentation. These may have prognostic implication resulting in poor outcome of Leukaemia in this part of the world.","['Yasmeen, Nuzhat', 'Ashraf, Shamvil']","['Yasmeen N', 'Ashraf S']","['Oncology Unit, National Institute of Child Health, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Pakistan,J Pak Med Assoc,JPMA.

We analyzed the in vitro activity of sorafenib in pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal and chemo-radio-resistant tumors, using four human pancreatic cancer cell lines (t3m4, Capan 1, Capan 2, and MiaPaca 2), characterized by different K-ras gene status and RAF/MEK/ERK profile. Sorafenib exerted a strong anti-proliferative effect independently of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and induced various degrees of apoptosis in the cell lines. The mechanisms involved were explored in detail in t3m4 and Capan 1, in which sorafenib induced the highest and lowest levels of apoptosis, respectively. In t3m4, the RAF/AKT/STAT-3 rather than the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway was involved, whereas in Capan 1 cells there was a strong decrease in pMEK and pERK which was not accompanied by an important reduction in RAF, AKT, and STAT-3 proteins or in their phosphorylation. Moreover, U0126-induced MEK inhibition did not induce apoptosis in any cell line, reinforcing the hypothesis of a MEK/ERK-independent mechanism of sorafenib activity. Mcl-1 appears to play a crucial role in sorafenib-induced apoptosis. In fact, both protein and mRNA were downregulated in t3m4 and upregulated in Capan 1, in which siRNA-induced silencing resulted in the same level of apoptosis as observed in t3m4. Our results show that sorafenib exerts anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity in pancreatic cancer cells. Used singly or in combination with other drugs, it could therefore represent valid treatment for pancreatic cancer.","['Ulivi, Paola', 'Arienti, Chiara', 'Amadori, Dino', 'Fabbri, Francesco', 'Carloni, Silvia', 'Tesei, Anna', 'Vannini, Ivan', 'Silvestrini, Rosella', 'Zoli, Wainer']","['Ulivi P', 'Arienti C', 'Amadori D', 'Fabbri F', 'Carloni S', 'Tesei A', 'Vannini I', 'Silvestrini R', 'Zoli W']","['Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Meldola, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Sorafenib', 'Time Factors', 'raf Kinases/*metabolism']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.21753 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2009 Jul;220(1):214-21. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21753.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because it contains several flavonoid glycosides and other bioactive substances, the activities of EGb 761 against cancer in vivo and in vitro remain poorly understood. This situation prompted interest in the compounds for experimental study. We have investigated the anticancer effects of three analogues of EGb 761 samples on sarcoma 108 (S180)-bearing mice and leukemic 1210 (L1210) cell lines. We have also evaluated the changes of endogeneous antioxidant scavenging enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GST), lipid peroxidation (LPx), and catalase (CAT), in the blood of the S180-bearing mice. The EGb 761, EGb 761-H (containing mainly flavonoid aglycones and terpene trilactones), and EGb 761-DT-H (containing mainly flavonoid aglycones) samples exhibited cytotoxicity and inhibitory activity with IC (50) values of 46.36 +/- 2.43 microM, 10.27 +/- 0.88 microM, and 14.93 +/- 0.73 microM in L1210 cell-based assays, respectively. This resulted in 41.74 %, 60.72 %, and 63.76 % reductions in tumor weight after 10 days of treatment, respectively. In summary, the anticancer activity of EGb 761 can be improved by increasing the concentration of the aglycone form of the flavonoid. Terpene trilactones cannot exert the anticancer effects of flavonoids in vivo. Raising the levels of the free radical scavenger enzymes GST, SOD and CAT may be one of the involved anticancer mechanisms.","['Feng, Xiaolong', 'Zhang, Lantong', 'Zhu, Huiming']","['Feng X', 'Zhang L', 'Zhu H']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, School of Pharmacy, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, P.

We have investigated the cytotoxic activity of the strong glutathione S-transferase (GST) inhibitor 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol (NBDHEX) on AML (HL60) cell lines. METHODS: Functional drug efflux studies and cell proliferation assays were performed on both sensitive and MDR AML (HL60) cells after incubation with NBDHEX. Moreover, the mode of cell death (apoptosis vs. necrosis) as well as the correlation between NBDHEX susceptibility and GST activity or Bcl-2 expression was investigated. RESULTS: NBDHEX is not a substrate of either MDR1-Pgp or MRP1 efflux pumps; in fact, it is not only cytotoxic toward the parental HL60 cell line, but also overcomes the MDR phenotype of its HL60/DNR and HL60/ADR variants. CONCLUSIONS: The data herein reported show that NBDHEX mediates efficient killing of both MDR1-Pgp and MRP1 over-expressing AML cells.

CD123(+) MDCs expressed higher level of cytoplasmic TNF-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) than CD123(-) MDCs, whereas both expressed very little surface and soluble TRAIL.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the in vitro antiproliferation and apoptosis inducing effects of Tanshinone IIA on leukemia THP-1 cell lines and its mechanisms of action. MTT assay was used to detect the cell growth inhibitory rate; cell apoptotic rate and the mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) were investigated by flow cytometry (FCM), apoptotic morphology was observed by Hoechst 33258 staining and DNA fragmentation analysis. The expression of caspase-3 and different apoptosis modulators were analyzed by Western blotting. The results revealed that Tanshinone IIA inhibited the growth of THP-1 cells and caused significant apoptosis, the suppression was both in time- and dose-dependent manner. After treatment by Tanshinone IIA for 48 h, the percentage of disruption of Deltapsim gradually increased in a dose-dependent manner along with marked changes of cell apoptosis. Western blotting showed cleavage of the caspase-3 zymogen protein (32-kDa) with the appearance of its 20-kDa subunit and a dose-dependent cleavage of PARP, with the appearance of 89-kDa fragment; The expression of Bcl-2 and survivin was down-regulated remarkably while Bax expression was up-regulated concurrently after the cells were treated with Tanshinone IIA for 48 h. We therefore conclude that Tanshinone IIA has significant growth inhibition effects on THP-1 cells by induction of apoptosis, and that Tanshinone IIA-induced apoptosis on THP-1 cells is mainly related to the disruption of Deltapsim and activation of caspase-3 as well as down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, survivin and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax. The results indicate that Tanshinone IIA may serve as a potential anti-leukemia reagent.","['Liu, Jia-Jun', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Lin, Dong-Jun', 'Xiao, Ruo-Zhi']","['Liu JJ', 'Zhang Y', 'Lin DJ', 'Xiao RZ']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510630, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Survivin)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Abietanes', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/analysis', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Survivin']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/06/19 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or_00000326 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2009 Apr;21(4):1075-81. doi: 10.3892/or_00000326.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We then conducted DNA microarray analysis to compare the AML-2/IDAC cells with parental AML-2/WT cells. The results of the microarray analysis revealed a severe defect in the expression of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), which plays a key role in the transformation of Ara-C to the active form in AML-2/IDAC cells. A similar event was observed in AML-2/ARC cells, but not in Ara-C sensitive AML-2/IDA cells that were resistant to idarubicin. The decreased expression of dCK also resulted in lower activity in both Ara-C resistant variants. However, no significant difference in the intracellular concentration of Ara-C was observed among the cells tested, which indicates that the Ara-C resistant phenotype in our models occurred due to the lower expression and activity of dCK rather than a change in the ability to take up Ara-C. Additionally, in vitro assays using BM cells from AML patients revealed that the expression of dCK and the sensitivity to Ara-C were correlated. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that dCK can regulate the in vitro cellular response to Ara-C in AML cells.","['Song, Ju Han', 'Kim, Seung Hyun', 'Kweon, Sin Ho', 'Lee, Tae Hyang', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Kim, Tae Sung']","['Song JH', 'Kim SH', 'Kweon SH', 'Lee TH', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim TS']","['Division of Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*biosynthesis', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/07/21 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo_00000245 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2009 Apr;34(4):1165-71. doi: 10.3892/ijo_00000245.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms by which these activities are exerted. In this study, we investigated the anthocyanins isolated from Vitis coignetiae Pulliat for their potential anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on human leukemia U937 cells. It was found that these anthocyanins inhibit cell viability and induce apoptotic cell death of U937 cells in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by hemocytometer counts, by alteration in the mitochondrial membrane potential, by increases in sub-G1 populations and by DNA ladder formation. Apoptosis of U937 cells by anthocyanins was associated with modulation of expression of Bcl-2 and IAP family members. Consequently, anthocyanin treatment induced proteolytic activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9, and a concomitant degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. However, anthocyanin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis were significantly attenuated in Bcl-2 overexpressing U937 cells. Furthermore, z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 specific inhibitor, blocked apoptosis and increased the survival of anthocyanin-treated U937 cells.

In all cases, the plasma cells were analyzed by a novel 6-color flow method. Both immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry were useful in identifying the lymphoid and plasmacytic disease components. In 19 cases, immunohistochemistry revealed an earlier unrecognized pattern of plasma cell infiltration in which they were physically separate from the lymphoid infiltrates. B-cell flow cytometry revealed monotypic cells in 96% of the cases. Approximately half of these were CD5 and/or CD23 positive, although none had features of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and none of the B cells had flow cytometric features suggesting plasmacytic differentiation. In contrast, highly sensitive 6-color plasma cell flow cytometry revealed monotypic cells in 32 of the 35 cases; in 20 cases, the pattern of CD38 and CD138 coexpression detected was identical to that seen in plasma cell malignancies such as multiple myeloma. In 18 of these 20 lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma cases, these plasma cells were CD19 positive, distinguishing them from those of true plasma cell neoplasms, which are CD19 negative.

Our results establish that concomitant activation of RBPJ (Notch signaling) and MPL (cytokine signaling) transforms cells of the megakaryocytic lineage and suggest that specific targeting of these pathways could be of therapeutic value for human AMKL.","['Mercher, Thomas', 'Raffel, Glen D', 'Moore, Sandra A', 'Cornejo, Melanie G', 'Baudry-Bluteau, Dominique', 'Cagnard, Nicolas', 'Jesneck, Jonathan L', 'Pikman, Yana', 'Cullen, Dana', 'Williams, Ifor R', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Shigematsu, Hirokazu', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Giovannini, Marco', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Lee, Benjamin H', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Mercher T', 'Raffel GD', 'Moore SA', 'Cornejo MG', 'Baudry-Bluteau D', 'Cagnard N', 'Jesneck JL', 'Pikman Y', 'Cullen D', 'Williams IR', 'Akashi K', 'Shigematsu H', 'Bourquin JP', 'Giovannini M', 'Vainchenker W', 'Levine RL', 'Lee BH', 'Bernard OA', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090316,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (Mpl protein, mouse)', '0 (OTT-MAL fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Rbpj protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/etiology/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', '*Oncogene Fusion', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]']","['35901 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI35901 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2009 Apr;119(4):852-64. doi: 10.1172/JCI35901.

Our starting hypothesis was that the TEL-AML1 protein generates and maintains preleukemic clones and that conversion to overt disease requires secondary genetic changes, possibly in the context of abnormal immune responses. Here, we show that a murine B cell progenitor cell line expressing inducible TEL-AML1 proliferates at a slower rate than parent cells but is more resistant to further inhibition of proliferation by TGF-beta. This facilitates the competitive expansion of TEL-AML1-expressing cells in the presence of TGF-beta. Further analysis indicated that TEL-AML1 binds to a principal TGF-beta signaling target, Smad3, and compromises its ability to activate target promoters. In mice expressing a TEL-AML1 transgene, early, pre-pro-B cells were increased in number and also showed reduced sensitivity to TGF-beta-mediated inhibition of proliferation. Moreover, expression of TEL-AML1 in human cord blood progenitor cells led to the expansion of a candidate preleukemic stem cell population that had an early B lineage phenotype (CD34+CD38-CD19+) and a marked growth advantage in the presence of TGF-beta. Collectively, these data suggest a plausible mechanism by which dysregulated immune responses to infection might promote the malignant evolution of TEL-AML1-expressing preleukemic clones.","['Ford, Anthony M', 'Palmi, Chiara', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Hong, Dengli', 'Cardus, Penny', 'Knight, Deborah', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Enver, Tariq', 'Greaves, Mel']","['Ford AM', 'Palmi C', 'Bueno C', 'Hong D', 'Cardus P', 'Knight D', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Enver T', 'Greaves M']","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090316,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Oncogene Fusion', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]']","['36428 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI36428 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2009 Apr;119(4):826-36. doi: 10.1172/JCI36428.

In the most comprehensive study to date, we evaluated risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoproliferative disorders among first-degree relatives of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases compared to first-degree relatives of controls. DESIGN AND METHODS: Population-based registry data from Sweden were used to evaluate outcomes in 26,947 first-degree relatives of 9,717 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (diagnosed 1958-2004) compared with 107,223 first-degree relatives of 38,159 matched controls. Using a marginal survival model, we calculated relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals as measures of familial aggregation. RESULTS: Compared to relatives of controls, relatives of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients had an increased risk for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (RR=8.5, 6.1-11.7) and other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) (RR=1.9, 1.5-2.3). Evaluating NHL subtypes, we found a striking excess of indolent B-cell NHL, specifically lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and hairy cell leukemia. No excesses of aggressive B-cell or T-cell lymphomas were found. There was no statistical excess of Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or the precursor condition, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, among chronic lymphocytic leukemia relatives. CONCLUSIONS: These familial aggregations are striking and provide novel clues to research designed to uncover early pathogenetic mechanisms in chronic lymphocytic leukemia including studies to identify germ line susceptibility genes. However, clinicians should counsel their chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients emphasizing that because the baseline population risks are low, the absolute risk for a first-degree relative to develop chronic lymphocytic leukemia or another indolent lymphoma is low. At this time, an increased medical surveillance of first-degree relatives of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients has no role outside research studies.","['Goldin, Lynn R', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Kristinsson, Sigurdur Y', 'Turesson, Ingemar', 'Landgren, Ola']","['Goldin LR', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Kristinsson SY', 'Turesson I', 'Landgren O']","['Genetic Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 6120 Executive Blvd., Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. goldinl@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090313,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Aged', '*Family', '*Family Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2008.003632 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.003632 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 May;94(5):647-53. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.003632.

Unfortunately, 16 months from HSCT the patient experienced BM relapse with all blasts characterized by pro-B-ALL immunophenotype.

Water buffalo blood samples gathered from different places in the Philippines revealed a 9.4%, 27.6%, 10.3% and 4.4% prevalence of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine leukemia virus (BLV), Anaplasma marginale and Babesia bigemina infection, respectively. This was the first surveillance study of BVDV and BLV in the country. Furthermore, cytokine expression of these naturally infected animals was also quantified. BVDV-infected animals had up-regulated expressions of TNFalpha, IL-2 and IL-4; and down-regulated expressions of IFNgamma and IL-12p40 while BLV positive animals had an up-regulated IL-4 and IL-6, and highly expressed IL-10 and IL-12p40 with unchanged IFNgamma expression. Meanwhile, animals infected with A. marginale had all interleukins and IFNgamma up-regulated with significant expression of IL-10 and IL-12p40 similar to the BLV positive animals. Since it was also observed that swamp-type buffaloes were more disease tolerant than riverine-type buffaloes based on the gathered infection rate of each examined pathogen, further assessment was done focusing on the two vital cytokines, IFNgamma and TNFalpha. We quantified IFNgamma and TNFalpha expressions in ConA-stimulated PBMC from both swamp and riverine buffaloes by real-time PCR. Cytokine expression from ConA-stimulated PBMC revealed that both IFNgamma and TNFalpha were more highly expressed in swamp than in riverine buffalo. To further examine the probable cause of expression differences, the proximal promoter region of these two cytokines were sequenced for the presence of nucleotide polymorphism followed by luciferase assay to analyze the effect of these polymorphisms in gene transcription. A single nucleotide polymorphism was found in the IFNgamma (-299) while eight polymorphisms in the TNFalpha promoter (-541, -553, -562, -596, -609, -655, -659, -688). Luciferase assay showed that both IFNgamma promoter and TNFalpha promoter in swamp-type water buffalo had higher transcription activity compared to riverine-type water buffalo. These findings confirm that IFNgamma and TNFalpha transcriptions in these animals were highly affected by the disparity in the cytokine promoter region. This suggests that disease tolerance or susceptibility of these buffaloes could be due to the differences in their relative cytokine transcription and may relate to pathogen-host specific pathogenesis.","['Mingala, Claro N', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Cruz, Libertado C', 'Onuma, Misao', 'Ohashi, Kazuhiko']","['Mingala CN', 'Konnai S', 'Cruz LC', 'Onuma M', 'Ohashi K']","['Department of Disease Control, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku-Kita 18 Nishi 9 chome, Sapporo 060-0818, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090313,England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Anaplasma marginale/immunology', 'Anaplasmosis/blood/immunology', 'Animals', 'Babesia/immunology', 'Babesiosis/blood/immunology', 'Base Sequence', '*Buffaloes/blood/immunology', 'Cattle', '*Cytokines/blood/immunology', 'Diarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viral/immunology', '*Environment', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/immunology', '*Fresh Water', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukins/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pestivirus Infections/blood/immunology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/immunology']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2008/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]']","['S1043-4666(09)00060-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cyto.2009.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2009 May;46(2):273-82. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2009.02.006.

More recently, we reported that cobalt chloride (CoCl(2))/iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO)-mimicked hypoxia or moderate hypoxia (2% and 3% O(2)) can directly trigger differentiation of many subtypes of AML cells. Also, intermittent hypoxia significantly prolongs the survival of the transplanted leukemic mice with differentiation induction of leukemic cells. Additionally, these hypoxia-simulating agents selectively stimulate differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemic cells induced by arsenic trioxide, an effective second-line drug for this unique type of leukemia. Based on this interesting evidence in vitro and in vivo, the ongoing investigations showed the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein through its non-transcriptional activity in myeloid cell differentiation, as evidenced by chemical interference, the conditional HIF-1alpha induction, the specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta, an essential partner for transcription activity of HIF-1. Furthermore, HIF-1alpha and two hematopoietic transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and Runx1/AML1 interact directly with each other. Such interactions increase the transcriptional activities of C/EBPalpha and Runx1/AML1, while C/EBPalpha competes with HIF-1beta for direct binding to HIF-1alpha protein, and significantly inhibits the DNA-binding ability of HIF-1. As a protein is rapidly responsive to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a classical clinical differentiation-inducing drug for AML, HIF-1alpha also plays a role in ATRA-induced differentiation of leukemic cells.","['Zhang, Jing', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Zhang J', 'Chen GQ']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, and Institute of Health Science, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences-Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090313,Switzerland,Pathophysiology,Pathophysiology : the official journal of the International Society for Pathophysiology,9433813,,,,2009/03/17 09:00,2009/03/17 09:01,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/17 09:01 [medline]']","['S0928-4680(09)00026-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.02.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathophysiology. 2009 Oct;16(4):297-303. doi: 10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.02.005.

We have recently demonstrated that a low frequency electromagnetic field is unable to induce the heat shock response (HSR). In the present study, we expanded our investigations to the induction of HSPs, particularly Hsp72, by ultrasound (US). Human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells were exposed in suspension to US at 1, 3 and 10 MHz, as well as combinations of two of these frequencies. The ability of US to induce Hsp72 was tested for different frequencies, intensities and exposure times. In addition, the water bath temperature was varied from 30 to 36 degrees C. The Hsp72 protein expression was determined 4 and 24 h after treatment. We found that the amount of Hsp72 increased with increasing US frequency, reaching its highest level of about 1800%, induced by 10 MHz. After increasing the temperature of the water bath, the amount of Hsp72 in the treated cells was also increased, whereas no induction was observed at 30 degrees C. For all treatment conditions, ultrasound of 1 MHz was unable to significantly induce Hsp72. At 10 MHz, the exposure time was varied from 0 to 20 min. We found that the induction of Hsp72 took place after 5 min of exposure. For a fixed level of absorbed US energy, the continuous regime, as well as a pulsation of 1:2 (5 ms on and 5 ms off) induced the same Hsp72 level. Pulsation of 1:5 (2 ms on and 8 ms off) and 1:10 (1 ms on and 9 ms off) did not show any effect. A single sonication of 20 min, as well as a fractionated sonication of two 10 min exposures induced the same level of Hsp72, whereas four exposures of 5 min reduced the Hsp72 level. At the optimum exposure conditions (10 MHz, 10 min), the concentration of other HSPs was also determined. Hsp27 showed no effect but Hsp32, Hsp40 and Hsp72 were induced. Taken together, these results suggest a synergistic interaction between heat and US.","['Sontag, Werner', 'Kruglikov, Ilja L']","['Sontag W', 'Kruglikov IL']","['Institut fur Biologische Grenzflachen, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany. werner.sontag@ibg.fzk.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090313,England,Ultrasound Med Biol,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,0410553,"['0 (HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)']",IM,"['HL-60 Cells', 'HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Response/physiology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', '*Sonication', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/07/29 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0301-5629(08)00602-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2008.12.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Ultrasound Med Biol. 2009 Jun;35(6):1032-41. doi: 10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2008.12.011.

Ikaros functions in hematopoiesis have mostly been studied in mice, and are notably crucial for lymphopoiesis. Deregulation of Ikaros expression was evidenced in several leukemia subtypes, including pre-B-ALL. Here, we studied the role of Ikaros in human B lymphoid differentiation through xeno-transplantation of genetically modified cord blood (CB) human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) in NOD/SCID mice. We used lentiviral vectors to force expression of Ikaros 6 (Ik6), a known dominant negative (DN) protein that interferes with normal Ikaros and structurally related proteins in HPC and their progeny. Two types of vectors were used: a vector containing the EF1alpha promoter which produces strong gene expression in all hematopoietic lineages, and a recently validated B-specific vector containing an enhanced CD19 derived promoter that strongly favors expression in the B-cell lineage. Ik6 transduction of CB CD34(+) cells with these vectors produced distinct consequences in the B-cell differentiation profiles of xenografted human cells. While the ubiquitous vector favored a specific block at the early pro-B/pre-B stage of differentiation, with an increase in Lambda Like transcript expression in the bone marrow (BM), B-specific Ik6 expression provoked a global decrease in the CD19(+) cell population in both BM and spleen, associated with a decrease in IgM+ immature B-cells in the spleen. We conclude that Ikaros proteins are active throughout human B-cell differentiation, before and after CD19 appearance.","['Tonnelle, Cecile', 'Dijon, Marilyne', 'Moreau, Thomas', 'Garulli, Celine', 'Bardin, Florence', 'Chabannon, Christian']","['Tonnelle C', 'Dijon M', 'Moreau T', 'Garulli C', 'Bardin F', 'Chabannon C']","['Inserm, U891, CRCM, Equipe Recherche Clinique, Marseille F-13009, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20090313,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Genes, Dominant/physiology', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Pregnancy', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(09)00068-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2009.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2009 May;46(8-9):1736-43. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2009.02.004.

We analyzed the safety and efficacy of haploidentical transplantation in a Phase I/II nonimmunosuppressive, nonmyeloablative setting.

Possible mechanisms contributing to its effectiveness include initial GVT kill, breaking of host tolerance to tumor through cross-reactive alloreactive responses, persistent nondetectable microchimerism, or some combination of these.","['Colvin, Gerald A', 'Berz, David', 'Ramanathan, Muthalagu', 'Winer, Eric S', 'Fast, Loren', 'Elfenbein, Gerald J', 'Quesenberry, Peter J']","['Colvin GA', 'Berz D', 'Ramanathan M', 'Winer ES', 'Fast L', 'Elfenbein GJ', 'Quesenberry PJ']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island 02903, USA. gcolvin@lifespan.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (CD3 Complex)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD3 Complex', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection/mortality/*therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', '*Immunotherapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Chimera', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(08)01135-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.12.503 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Apr;15(4):421-31. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.12.503.,,,,"['DK0618585/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08DK6498-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR 018757-02/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spleen cells or IL-2 activated splenocytes (lymphokine activated killer [LAK]) derived from donor mice treated with CpG emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), (CpG + IFA) did not cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but were not efficient enough to induce a significant graft-versus-tumor (GVT) response against 4T1 cells. In contrast, an efficient graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect was evident in BCL1-bearing mice inoculated with spleen cells from donors pretreated with CFA or CpG + IFA. Pretransplant donor treatment with CFA prolonged survival to a median of 62 days with 3 of 27 mice remaining GVHD- and leukemia-free for >200 days, compared to GVHD-related death of all mice inoculated with naive cells (median 17 days), or leukemia-related death of all mice inoculated with leukemia cells (median of 27 days). Pretransplant donor treatment with CpG + IFA exerted a more efficient GVL effect with reduced GVHD resulting in 12 of 26 GVHD- and leukemia-free survivors for >200 days. Our results suggest that it may be possible to prevent GVHD while sparing an efficient GVL effect by using pretransplant donor treatment with immunomodulators prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation and/or donor lymphocyte infusions in hematologic malignancies.","['Morecki, Shoshana', 'Yacovlev, Elena', 'Gelfand, Yael', 'Shabat, Yehudit', 'Slavin, Shimon']","['Morecki S', 'Yacovlev E', 'Gelfand Y', 'Shabat Y', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cancer Immunotherapy, Cell Therapy & Transplantation Research Laboratory, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. morecki@hadassah.org.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090212,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', ""9007-81-2 (Freund's Adjuvant)""]",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Female', ""Freund's Adjuvant/*pharmacology"", 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Spleen/immunology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2008/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(08)01136-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.12.504 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2009 Apr;15(4):406-15. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.12.504.

Inhibition of glucosylceramide (GC) synthesis has been shown in cell lines to correlate with the expression and function of P-gp and sensitise cancer cells to cytotoxic agents. We investigated the hypothesis that reducing intracellular GC levels will reduce P-gp expression in malignant cells from CLL patients. We studied the ability of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitors N-butyl-deoxygalactonojirimycin (OGB-1) and N-nonyl-deoxygalactonojirimycin (OGB-2) to sensitise CLL cells to conventional cytotoxic drug 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA) and the cytostatic drugs chlorambucil and fludarabine. The effect on P-gp activity was analysed using the calcein-AM accumulation assay where a multidrug activity factor (MAF) of >10 in the presence of a P-gp inhibitor denotes P-gp functional activity. The P-gp over-expressing cell line CEM-VLB showed a MAF value of 96.4 with the P-gp inhibitor Z.3HCL, which fell to 15.7 after co-incubation with OGB-1 and 45.9 with OGB-2. The IC(50) for vincristine fell from >10 microg/ml to 55.5 ng/ml in the presence of OGB-2. In P-gp(+ve) peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three normal volunteers, the mean MAF values for Z.3HCL, OGB-1 and OGB-2 were 23.86, 1.83 and 16.2 respectively. In 9/13 CLL samples the mean P-gp functional activity was 22.15 and P-gp was over-expressed in 12/13 samples. However, the MAF value with OGB-1 and OGB-2 was <10. Nevertheless, sensitisation in CLL cells was observed by a reduction in the IC(50) in the presence of OGB-1 and OGB-2 with the conventional drugs. We conclude that although GCS inhibitors sensitize CLL cells to cytotoxic and cytostatic drugs, they do not appear to have any effect on P-gp functional activity.","['Gerrard, Gareth', 'Butters, Terry D', 'Ganeshaguru, Kanagasabai', 'Mehta, Atul B']","['Gerrard G', 'Butters TD', 'Ganeshaguru K', 'Mehta AB']","['Department of Haematology, University College London Medical School, Royal Free Campus, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090312,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '148504-34-1 (calcein AM)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '19130-96-2 (1-Deoxynojirimycin)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', 'C4XNY919FW (migalastat)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['1-Deoxynojirimycin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Formazans/metabolism', 'Glucosyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Chemical', 'Molecular Structure', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/07/14 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2008/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2009/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(09)00235-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.03.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2009 May 1;609(1-3):34-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.03.018.

Historically, this uncommon subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia has been associated with a high mortality rate during induction therapy, most frequently attributable to haemorrhage. Since the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) into the therapy of all patients with APL, disease-free survival and overall survival have improved dramatically, such that the disease is now highly curable. However, induction mortality remains a major problem and haemorrhage still accounts for the majority of such early deaths. Pathogenesis of the coagulopathy is complex and includes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), fibrinolysis and proteolysis. As a result, while the predominant clinical manifestation of the coagulopathy is haemorrhage, thromboembolic events may occur both at presentation and during therapy. A major recent finding is the high expression of annexin II in the leukaemic cells from patients with APL. Annexin II is a protein with high affinity for plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and also acts as a cofactor for plasminogen activation by tPA. As a result, both plasminogen and tPA are increased on the cell surface of the leukaemic cell, increasing plasmin activity. Annexin II is expressed in high amounts in cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, perhaps accounting for the relatively high incidence of intracranial haemorrhage in APL compared with other sites. Microparticles are cell-derived membrane fragments originating from normal cells or released from malignant cells involved in activating coagulation. Recent studies have found that microparticles containing tissue factor, tPA, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and annexin II have been found in the plasma of APL patients, suggesting a role in pathogenesis of the coagulopathy. Treatment of the coagulopathy remains primarily supportive. Aggressive transfusions of platelets and cryoprecipitate appear to be important. There is no clear role for the routine use of heparin or antifibrinolytic therapy. The most important factor may be the early introduction of ATRA at the first suspicion of a diagnosis of APL, before it is confirmed genetically.","['Stein, Eytan', 'McMahon, Brandon', 'Kwaan, Hau', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Frankfurt, Olga', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Stein E', 'McMahon B', 'Kwaan H', 'Altman JK', 'Frankfurt O', 'Tallman MS']","['Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Robert H.

The prevalence of symptomatic VTE ranges from 0% to 36%, and the variation can be explained, at least in part, by differences in chemotherapeutic protocols. The mechanism for increased risk of VTE is associated with alterations in the haemostatic system by use of L-asparaginase (ASP) alone or in combination with vincristine or prednisone, presence of central venous lines (CVLs) and/or inherited thrombophilia. The children at greatest risk are generally those receiving Escherichia coli ASP concomitant with prednisone. The majority of symptomatic VTEs occur in the central nervous system or in the upper venous system. In the majority of cases, asymptomatic VTEs are associated with CVLs. External CVLs are affected more often than internal CVLs. Evidence-based guidelines on prevention and treatment guidelines for ALL-related VTE are lacking, and carefully designed clinical trials are needed urgently.","['Nowak-Gottl, Ulrike', 'Kenet, Gili', 'Mitchell, Lesley G']","['Nowak-Gottl U', 'Kenet G', 'Mitchell LG']","['Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Str. 33, D-48149 Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

It has been shown that heparanase overexpression in human leukaemia, glioma and breast carcinoma cells results in a marked increase in tissue factor (TF) levels. In addition, TF was induced by exogenous addition of recombinant heparanase to tumour cells and primary endothelial cells; induction that was mediated by p38 phosphorylation and correlated with enhanced procoagulant activity. TF induction was further confirmed in transgenic mice overexpressing heparanase, and correlated with heparanase expression levels in leukaemia patients. Heparanase was also found to be involved in the regulation of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). It has been shown that heparanase overexpression or exogenous addition induces a two- to three-fold increase in TFPI expression. Similarly, heparanase stimulated accumulation of TFPI in the cell culture medium. However, extracellular accumulation exceeded the observed increase in TFPI at the protein level, and appeared to be independent of HS and heparanase enzymatic activity. Instead, a physical interaction between heparanase and TFPI was demonstrated, suggesting a mechanism by which secreted heparanase interacts with TFPI on the cell surface, leading to dissociation of TFPI from the cell membrane and increased coagulation activity, thus further supporting the local prothrombotic function of heparanase. As heparins are strong inhibitors of heparanase, in view of the effect of heparanase on the TF/TFPI pathway, the role of anticoagulant activity of heparin may potentially be expanded. Taking into account the prometastatic and pro-angiogenic functions of heparanase, its overexpression in human malignancies and abundance in platelets, its involvement in the coagulation machinery is an intriguing novel arena for further research.","['Nadir, Yona', 'Brenner, Benjamin']","['Nadir Y', 'Brenner B']","['Department of Haematology, Thrombosis and Haemostasis Unit, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Similarly, precursor T-ALL/T-LBL is characteristically negative for synaptophysin. We report the first case of a patient with precursor T-ALL/T-LBL who presented with cholestatic jaundice and aberrant tumor expression of synaptophysin. CASE REPORT: 42 year old male presented with anorexia, nausea, jaundice, pale stools, dark urine and about 35 pound weight loss over the previous 3 weeks. The initial laboratory work was suggestive of cholestatic jaundice. Markedly elevated LDH (2025 U/L) and CA 19-9 (1778 u/ML) were also noticed. The CT scan of abdomen showed massive hepatomegaly with coarse echotexture with contracted gall bladder and normal sized common bile duct. Chest x-ray revealed a mediastinal mass with mediastinal widening. CT scan of the chest showed anterior mediastinal mass (16 cm x 10 cm). CT guided biopsy of the mass showed malignant lymphoma with diffuse proliferation of medium sized lymphoid cells. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD1a, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8 and CD43 with aberrant expression of synaptophysin. PET CT scan again showed a large anterior mediastinal mass with diffuse liver involvement and abnormal activity in axial bones. CT guided liver biopsy and bone marrow biopsy revealed the same morphology and immunohistochemistry. Bone marrow aspirate showed 85% lymphoblasts. Thus, the diagnosis of precursor T-ALL/T-LBL was made and jaundice with elevated CA 19-9 were attributed to intrahepatic cholestasis. CONCLUSION: Our case illustrates an unusual presentation of hematological malignancies as cholestatic jaundice. It also indicates the non-specific nature of CA 19-9 for pancreaticobiliary malignancies. It is the first case report of neoplastic precursor T cell lymphoblasts with unusual expression of synaptophysin. Tissue biopsy with thorough immunohistochemistry is required to differentiate precursor T-ALL/T-LBL from thymoma and small cell carcinoma.","['Patel, Kevin J', 'Latif, Sahibzada U', 'de Calaca, Wanderley M']","['Patel KJ', 'Latif SU', 'de Calaca WM']","['Department of Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA. kpatel@msu.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090312,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,['0 (Synaptophysin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Jaundice, Obstructive/*diagnosis/etiology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Obesity/complications', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Synaptophysin/metabolism']",2009/03/17 09:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2009/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-12 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-12 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Mar 12;2:12. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-12.,,,,,PMC2663564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obtaining allo-restricted CTL of high-avidity and low cross-reactivity has, however, proven difficult. Here, we show that dendritic cells transfected with mRNA encoding HLA-A*0201, efficiently present externally loaded peptides from the antigen, Melan-A/MART-1 to T cells from HLA-A*0201-negative donors. CD8(+) T cells binding HLA-A*0201/MART-1 pentamers were detected already after 12 days of co-culture in 11/11 donors.

This study aimed at investigating the prevalence and predictors of symptoms and problems in a representative sample of haematological patients in Denmark. METHODS: A random sample of patients with leukaemia, multiple myeloma and advanced lymphoma (n = 732) received the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). Mean scores were calculated. In addition, scores were dichotomised using two thresholds: patients reporting at least 'a little' of each EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom/problem were classified as having a 'symptom/problem', and patients reporting at least 'quite a bit' were classified as having a 'severe symptom/problem'. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify predictors. RESULTS: In total, 470 (64%) patients participated. The most frequent symptoms/problems were fatigue (55%; severe 20%), reduced role function (49%; severe 23%), insomnia (46%; severe 15%), and pain (37%; severe 15%). Older patients and patients in active antineoplastic treatment had more symptoms and problems. There was only little evidence of social inequalities. CONCLUSION: This is probably the first nationally representative study of symptoms and problems in haematological patients. These patients have symptoms/problems that deserve attention. Health related quality of life is an important issue in haematological malignancies.","['Johnsen, Anna T', 'Tholstrup, Dorte', 'Petersen, Morten Aa', 'Pedersen, Lise', 'Groenvold, Mogens']","['Johnsen AT', 'Tholstrup D', 'Petersen MA', 'Pedersen L', 'Groenvold M']","['Department of Palliative Medicine, Bispebjerg Hospital, Copenhagen NV, Denmark. atj02@bbh.regionh.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090305,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Aged', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/psychology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/*complications/psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/psychology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Quality of Life', 'Risk Assessment', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/07/31 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [medline]']","['EJH1250 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01250.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Aug;83(2):139-48. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01250.x.

To test the hypothesis that depletion of LAA, alternating with supplementation to prevent scurvy, would provide therapeutic benefit, a single-arm pilot trial was conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00329498). Experimental results: During depletion phase, patients with refractory AML or MDS were placed on a diet deficient in LAA; during supplementation phase, patients received daily intravenous administration of LAA. An in vitro assay was performed pretherapy for LAA sensitivity of leukemic cells from individual patients. RESULTS: Of 18 patients enrolled, eight of 16 evaluable patients demonstrated a clinical response. Responses were obtained during depletion (four patients) as well as during supplementation (five patients) but at a pharmacologic plasma level achievable only with intravenous administration. Of nine patients for whom the in vitro assay indicated their leukemic cells were sensitive to LAA, seven exhibited a clinical response; compared with none of six patients who were insensitive to LAA. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical benefit, along with a conspicuous absence of significant adverse events, suggests that further testing of LAA depletion alternating with pharmacologic dose intravenous supplementation in patients with these and other malignancies is warranted.","['Park, Chan H', 'Kimler, Bruce F', 'Yi, Seong Yoon', 'Park, Se Hoon', 'Kim, Kihyun', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Kim, Sun Hee', 'Lee, Eun Ryung', 'Rha, Miyong', 'Kim, Seonwoo', 'Park, Mary H', 'Lee, Sook J', 'Park, Hye K', 'Lee, Mark H', 'Yoon, Sung Soo', 'Min, Yoo Hong', 'Kim, Bong Seog', 'Kim, Jeong-A', 'Kim, Won Seog']","['Park CH', 'Kimler BF', 'Yi SY', 'Park SH', 'Kim K', 'Jung CW', 'Kim SH', 'Lee ER', 'Rha M', 'Kim S', 'Park MH', 'Lee SJ', 'Park HK', 'Lee MH', 'Yoon SS', 'Min YH', 'Kim BS', 'Kim JA', 'Kim WS']","['Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. bkimler@kumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090305,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ascorbic Acid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*diet therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*diet therapy/genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment']",2009/03/17 09:00,2009/07/31 09:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [medline]']","['EJH1252 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01252.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Aug;83(2):108-18. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01252.x.

In myeloid leukemia, hematopoietic differentiation resulting from highly coordinated, stage-wise expression of myeloid transcription and soluble signaling factors is disrupted leading to a block in terminal differentiation and uncontrolled proliferation. This virtually always involves functional inactivation or genetic disruption of one or several tumor suppressor genes in order to circumvent their checkpoint control and apoptosis-inducing functions. Hence, reactivation of tumor suppressor gene function has therapeutic potential and can possibly enhance conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Although the major effect of CH-296 is colocalization of the MLV-derived retrovirus and target cells at specific adhesion domains of CH-296 mediated by integrins expressed on CD34(+) cells, the precise roles of the integrins are unclear. We examined the kinetics of integrin expression on CD34(+) cells during the course of MLV-derived retrovirus-mediated gene transduction with CH-296. Flow cytometry revealed that the levels of both very late activation protein (VLA)-4 and VLA-5 on CD34(+) cells freshly isolated from cord blood were insufficient for effective MLV-derived retroviral transduction. However, increases were achieved during culture for preinduction and MLV-derived retrovirus-mediated gene transduction in the presence of a cocktail of cytokines. In addition, we confirmed by using specific antibodies that inhibition of the cell adhesion mediated by the integrins significantly reduced transduction efficiency, indicating that integrin expression is indeed important for CH-296-based MLV-derived retroviral transduction. Only a few cytokines are capable of inducing integrin expression, and stem cell factor plus thrombopoietin was found to be the minimal combination that was sufficient for effective transduction of an MLV-derived retrovirus based on CH-296. Our findings should be useful for improving the culture conditions for CH-296-based MLV-derived retroviral transduction in stem cell gene therapy.","['Horiuchi, Yasuomi', 'Onodera, Masafumi', 'Miyagawa, Yoshitaka', 'Sato, Ban', 'Onda, Keiko', 'Katagiri, Yohko U', 'Okita, Hajime', 'Okada, Mayumi', 'Otsu, Makoto', 'Kume, Akihiro', 'Okuyama, Torayuki', 'Fujimoto, Junichiro', 'Kuratsuji, Tadatoshi', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka']","['Horiuchi Y', 'Onodera M', 'Miyagawa Y', 'Sato B', 'Onda K', 'Katagiri YU', 'Okita H', 'Okada M', 'Otsu M', 'Kume A', 'Okuyama T', 'Fujimoto J', 'Kuratsuji T', 'Kiyokawa N']","['Department of Developmental Biology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo 157-8535, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2009/03/17 09:00,2010/02/17 06:00,['2009/03/17 09:00'],"['2009/03/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2008.159 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2009 Jul;20(7):777-83. doi: 10.1089/hum.2008.159.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a randomized study investigating whether an exercise program could prevent these side effects. PROCEDURE: At diagnosis we randomized 51 ALL patients (median age: 5.4 years) into a group receiving a 2-year exercise program or a control group receiving standard care. BMD of total body (BMD(TB)), lumbar spine (BMD(LS)) and body composition were measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, motor performance with Bayley Scales of Infant Development or Movement-ABC, and passive ankle dorsiflexion with a goniometer. The investigator was blinded to the randomization. RESULTS: Body fat increased equally during treatment in both groups. One year after cessation of therapy more rapid decline of excessive body fat was observed in the intervention group than in the controls (P = 0.01). Lean body mass, BMD(TB) and BMD(LS) of both groups decreased equally during treatment and increased equally thereafter. Both groups showed a similar decrease in passive ankle dorsiflexion and motor performance during treatment. Adherence to the intervention program varied considerably. Adherence to intervention: 11% of children exercised daily, 37% > once a week, 16% once weekly, 36% < once a week. CONCLUSIONS: The exercise program was not more beneficial than standard care in preventing reduction in BMD, motor performance and passive ankle dorsiflexion than standard care, most likely due to unsatisfactory compliance. Increased BMI and body fat in the intervention group normalized faster after cessation of chemotherapy.","['Hartman, A', 'te Winkel, M L', 'van Beek, R D', 'de Muinck Keizer-Schrama, S M P F', 'Kemper, H C G', 'Hop, W C J', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M', 'Pieters, R']","['Hartman A', 'te Winkel ML', 'van Beek RD', 'de Muinck Keizer-Schrama SM', 'Kemper HC', 'Hop WC', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Pieters R']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. j.hartman@erasmusmc.nl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Ankle/physiopathology', 'Anthropometry', 'Body Composition', '*Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Exercise Therapy/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Motor Skills/classification', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Range of Motion, Articular']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21942 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jul;53(1):64-71. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21942.,,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Its structure was determined by analyzing (1)H, (13)C NMR and FAB-MS. The results show that MDTFC could efficiently and selectively inhibit the proliferation of several human cancer cell lines. Among all the cell lines, THP-1 was found to be most sensitive (IC(50) 29.59 microM), whereas the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were least effected (IC(50) 464.16 microM). The molecular mechanism of MDTFC mediated apoptosis was investigated for the first time. Induction of apoptosis in THP-1 cells was characterized by cell membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and decrease in level of pro-caspases 3, 9 and increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Our results were further strengthened through cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (Psim) and cytosolic release of cytochrome c, which are key events during apoptosis. Moreover, phosphatidyl serine exposure and appearance of sub-G1 peak also demonstrated cell death, when analyzed by flow cytometry. DNA fragmentation was prevented moderately when pretreated with caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-FMK) and largely with caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-FMK). In summary, MDTFC mediated apoptosis involves mitochondria-dependent pathway and the present compound of marine origin might have a therapeutic value against human cancer cell lines and especially on leukemia cells.","['Arepalli, S K', 'Sridhar, V', 'Venkateswara Rao, J', 'Kavin Kennady, P', 'Venkateswarlu, Y']","['Arepalli SK', 'Sridhar V', 'Venkateswara Rao J', 'Kavin Kennady P', 'Venkateswarlu Y']","['Toxicology Unit, Biology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad, 500 607, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthozoa/*chemistry', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Colorimetry', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Propidium/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-009-0332-z [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2009 May;14(5):729-40. doi: 10.1007/s10495-009-0332-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regulatory CD4(+) T cells (Tregs) suppress effector T and natural killer (NK) cells and therefore pose a potential challenge to the efficacy of immunotherapy. AML cells transduced with a lentivirus expressing CD80 (B7.1) and IL2 (LV-CD80/IL2) are capable of stimulating T and NK cell cytotoxicity in vitro. This study examines the effect of CD80/IL2 modified AML cells on Treg number and function. We report a significant increase in the number of CD8(+) T cells (P = 0.046) CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells (P = 0.028) and CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) Tregs (P = 0.043) following stimulation for 7 days with allogeneic LV-CD80/IL2 AMLs. In contrast, autologous LV-CD80/IL2 AML cell cultures provide a weaker stimulation with a lower number of CD8(+) T cells (P = 0.011) and no change in NK cell or Treg numbers. However, an increase in cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells and NK cells are detected following both allogeneic and autologous LV-CD80/IL2 stimulation as demonstrated by an increase in IFN-gamma and CD107a expression. Despite the presence of increased numbers of Tregs with suppressive activity in a subset of cultures, increased lysis of unmodified AMLs was still achieved following allogeneic (day 0, 2.2%; day 7, 20.4%) and more importantly, autologous LV-CD80/IL2 culture in which AML patients had recently received intensive chemotherapy (day 0, 0%; day 7, 16%). Vaccination with LV-CD80/IL2 therefore provides a potential strategy to enhance anti-leukaemia immune responses without a concomitant stimulation of Treg-mediated inhibition of cytotoxic immunological responses.","['Ingram, Wendy', 'Kordasti, Shahram', 'Chan, Lucas', 'Barber, Linda D', 'Tye, Gee J', 'Hardwick, Nicola', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Farzaneh, Farzin']","['Ingram W', 'Kordasti S', 'Chan L', 'Barber LD', 'Tye GJ', 'Hardwick N', 'Mufti GJ', 'Farzaneh F']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College London, Rayne Institute, 123 Coldharbour Lane, London, SE5 9NU, UK. wendy.2.ingram@kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090313,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/*genetics', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/08/14 09:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2008/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-009-0679-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2009 Oct;58(10):1679-90. doi: 10.1007/s00262-009-0679-6.

METHODS: Gallbladders were removed from a total of 15 patients who were categorized into two study groups: a CBD group (eight patients) and in a control group (neuroblastoma, acute myelogenous leukemia, wandering gallbladder, Wilms' tumor, glycogen storage disease, familial amyloid polyneuropathy; seven patients). Whole-mount preparations of the gallbladders were made to immunostain the intramural nerves. RESULTS: The intramural vascularity in the gallbladders of the CBD group (5.5 +/- 1.9/cm(2)) was significantly lower than that in the control group (27.6 +/- 14.4/cm(2)). The rate of perivascular plexuses on the surface of intramural vessels was also significantly lower in the CBD group than in the controls (37.7 +/- 18.1 vs. 80.2 +/- 17.4%, respectively). The numbers of ganglion cells per visual field were 38.5 +/- 24.0 and 42.3 +/- 20.6, respectively, in the CBD and control groups; this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: There may be a mechanism in CBD causing contractile failure and dilatation of the biliary tract as a result of decreased intramural blood flow that accompanies the diminished vascularity.","['Katsuno, Shinsuke', 'Ando, Hisami', 'Watanabe, Yoshio', 'Harada, Toru', 'Seo, Takahiko', 'Kaneko, Kenichiro']","['Katsuno S', 'Ando H', 'Watanabe Y', 'Harada T', 'Seo T', 'Kaneko K']","['Department of Pediatric Surgery, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsuruma-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8560, Japan. skatsuno@aichi-med-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20090313,Japan,J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg,Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery,9431940,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dilatation, Pathologic/congenital/pathology', 'Female', 'Gallbladder/*blood supply/*innervation', 'Gallbladder Diseases/*congenital/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nerve Net/*pathology', 'Neurons, Afferent', 'Probability', 'Reference Values', 'Regional Blood Flow/physiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/08/07 09:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2008/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/07 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00534-009-0066-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg. 2009;16(3):339-45. doi: 10.1007/s00534-009-0066-x.

Certain bacteria, such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum, also require cholesterol; it is unknown, however, how this cholesterol-dependent obligatory intracellular bacterium of granulocytes interacts with the host cell cholesterol regulatory pathway to acquire cholesterol. Here, we report that total host cell cholesterol increased >2-fold during A. phagocytophilum infection in a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Cellular free cholesterol was enriched in A. phagocytophilum inclusions as detected by filipin staining. We determined that A. phagocytophilum requires cholesterol derived from low-density lipoprotein (LDL), because its replication was significantly inhibited by depleting the growth medium of cholesterol-containing lipoproteins, by blocking LDL uptake with a monoclonal antibody against LDL receptor (LDLR), or by treating the host cells with inhibitors that block LDL-derived cholesterol egress from late endosomes or lysosomes. However, de novo cholesterol biosynthesis is not required, since inhibition of the biosynthesis pathway did not inhibit A. phagocytophilum infection. The uptake of fluorescence-labeled LDL was enhanced in infected cells, and LDLR expression was up-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. A. phagocytophilum infection stabilized LDLR mRNA through the 3' UTR region, but not through activation of the sterol regulatory element binding proteins. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was up-regulated by A. phagocytophilum infection, and inhibition of its upstream kinase, MEK, by a specific inhibitor or siRNA knockdown, reduced A. phagocytophilum infection. Up-regulation of LDLR mRNA by A. phagocytophilum was also inhibited by the MEK inhibitor; however, it was unclear whether ERK activation is required for LDLR mRNA up-regulation by A. phagocytophilum. These data reveal that A. phagocytophilum exploits the host LDL uptake pathway and LDLR mRNA regulatory system to accumulate cholesterol in inclusions to facilitate its replication.","['Xiong, Qingming', 'Lin, Mingqun', 'Rikihisa, Yasuko']","['Xiong Q', 'Lin M', 'Rikihisa Y']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090313,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Anaplasma phagocytophilum/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Ehrlichiosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, LDL/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/05/13 09:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2008/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/13 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1000329 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000329. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000329.

In this study, it is shown that Bcl-3 is inducible by the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 and is overexpressed in lesional skin of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. Bcl-3 was shown to be important to cutaneous innate immune responses as silencing of Bcl-3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the downregulatory effect of IL-4 on the HBD3 expression. Bcl-3 silencing enhanced vitamin D3 (1,25D3)-induced gene expression of cathelicidin AMP in keratinocytes, suggesting a negative regulatory function on cathelicidin transcription. Furthermore, 1,25D3 suppressed Bcl-3 expression in vitro and in vivo.

Analysis of the age-adjusted CD4:CD8 ratio in 76 MDS patients compared with 54 healthy controls showed that inadequate CD4+, rather than expansion of CD8+ T cells, was associated with a lower ratio in a group that included both lower and higher risk MDS patients defined by the International Prognostic Scoring System. In younger MDS patients, naive and memory phenotypes defined by CD45RA and CD62L display showed depletion of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, suggesting a possible relationship to IST responsiveness. To determine the correlation between T-cell subset distribution, T-cell turnover and autoimmunity, a cohort of 20 patients were studied before and after IST. The CD4:CD8 ratio correlated inversely with the proliferative T-cell index before treatment in IST-responsive patients, suggesting that proliferation may be linked to accelerated CD4+ T-cell turnover and hematopoietic failure. Our data show seminal findings that both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets are dysregulated in MDS.

Fli-1, a proto-oncogene and member of the Ets family, is activated through viral integration in F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemia, and is the most critical event in the induction of this disease. Fli-1 aberrant regulation is also observed in human malignancies, including Ewing's sarcoma, which is often linked to expression of the EWS/Fli-1 fusion oncoprotein. Here we examined the effects of Fli-1 inhibition to further elucidate its role in these pathological occurrences. The constitutive suppression of Fli-1, through RNA interference (RNAi), inhibits growth and induces death in F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemia cells. Expression of a dominant negative protein Engrailed (En)/Fli-1 reduces proliferation of EWS/Fli-1-transformed NIH-3T3 cells, and both F-MuLV-induced and human erythroleukemia cells. F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemia cells also display increased apoptosis, associated with reduced expression of bcl-2, a known fli-1 target gene. Introduction of En/Fli-1 into an F-MuLV-infected erythroblastic cell line induces differentiation, as shown by increased alpha-globin expression. These results suggest, for the first time, an essential role for continuous Fli-1 overexpression in the maintenance and survival of the malignant phenotype in murine and human erythroleukemias.","['Cui, J-W', 'Vecchiarelli-Federico, L M', 'Li, Y-J', 'Wang, G-J', 'Ben-David, Y']","['Cui JW', 'Vecchiarelli-Federico LM', 'Li YJ', 'Wang GJ', 'Ben-David Y']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090312,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Survival', 'DNA Primers', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']","['leu200920 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.20 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jul;23(7):1311-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.20.

Co-exposure of cells to bortezomib and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) synergistically induces T-leukemia/lymphoma cells to undergo apoptosis, consistent with a significant increase in mitochondrial injury and caspase activation. These events are accompanied by inhibition of cyto-protective signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, Raf-1/mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and AKT pathways, and activation of stress-related cascades, including the stress-activated kinases c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK). Moreover, bortezomib in conjunction with SAHA efficiently induces apoptosis of primary T-leukemia/lymphoma cells and inhibits tumor growth in a murine xenograft model established with subcutaneous injection of Jurkat cells. Taken together, these findings confirm the synergistic anti-tumor effect of the proteasome and histone deacetylase inhibitors, and provide an insight into the future clinical applications of bortezomib-SAHA combining regimen in treating T-cell malignancies.","['Zhang, Q-L', 'Wang, L', 'Zhang, Y-W', 'Jiang, X-X', 'Yang, F', 'Wu, W-L', 'Janin, A', 'Chen, Z', 'Shen, Z-X', 'Chen, S-J', 'Zhao, W-L']","['Zhang QL', 'Wang L', 'Zhang YW', 'Jiang XX', 'Yang F', 'Wu WL', 'Janin A', 'Chen Z', 'Shen ZX', 'Chen SJ', 'Zhao WL']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090312,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/pathology', 'Drug Synergism', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/enzymology/transplantation', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Vorinostat', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200941 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.41 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1507-14. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.41.

RUNX1 mutations have rarely been reported in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). We examined RUNX1 mutations in 81 patients with CMML at initial diagnosis. Mutational analysis was performed on bone marrow samples by direct sequencing of all reverse transcription PCR products amplified with three primer pairs that cover the entire coding sequences of RUNX1b. Thirty-two RUNX1 mutations were detected in 30 patients (37%); 23 mutants were located in the N-terminal part and 9 in the C-terminal region. The mutations consisted of 9 missense, 1 silent, 7 nonsense and 15 frameshift mutations. Two patients had biallelic heterozygous mutations. There was no difference in overall survival between patients with and without RUNX1 mutations, but a trend of higher risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression was observed in mutation-positive patients (16/30 vs 17/51, P=0.102), especially in patients with C-terminal mutations (P=0.023). The median time to AML progression was 6.8 months in patients with C-terminal mutations compared with 28.3 months in those without mutations (P=0.022).

The gastrointestinal toxicity of vincristine such as decreased peristalsis can potentially be increased if the CYP 3A4 enzyme is inhibited. This interaction may become more prevalent with increasing use of CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as the azole antifungals. Since azoles are increasingly being used for prophylaxis and treatment of fungal infections in this patient population, an assessment of vincristine dosing and toxicity is the first step to constructing guidelines for the coadministration of these agents. METHODS: ALL patients !18 years of age receiving vincristine-based therapy from August 2003 through December 2007 with or without azole therapy were included. Data was collected using electronic patient medical records and the pharmacy system (RxTFC). Information was entered into a database for this retrospective study. Patients were separated into two arms; vincristine with azoles and vincristine only. Patient demographic information, chemotherapy regimen, vincristine-induced symptoms, and concurrent strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors and inducers were collected. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients received vincristine of which 29 (58%) had concurrent azole therapy. No patients received concurrent major CYP 3A4 inhibitors and the baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Vincristine dosing modifications were more common in the azole group (58.6 vs. 23.8%; p = 0.02). The mean dose reduction of vincristine when combined with an azole was 46.5%. Symptoms of decreased peristalsis were more common in patients receiving azoles (65.5 vs. 28.6%; p = 0.019) and on average occurred after the second vincristine dose. Symptoms occurred in 50, 75, and 66.6% of patients receiving fluconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole, respectively. Patients were more likely to have an incomplete course of vincristine when receiving azole therapy (48.3 vs. 9.5%; p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Caution should be used with the coadministration of vincristine and azoles. It is recommended that institutional guidelines be developed to standardize care for patients receiving vincristine with azole therapy. Potential measures to avoid this interaction include revisiting azole prophylaxis in this patient group and being judicious in azole selection.","['Harnicar, Stephen', 'Adel, Nelly', 'Jurcic, Joseph']","['Harnicar S', 'Adel N', 'Jurcic J']","['Department of Pharmacy, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA. harnicas@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20090312,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peristalsis/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/10/29 06:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1078155208101959 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155208101959 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2009 Sep;15(3):175-82. doi: 10.1177/1078155208101959.

Dasatinib is extensively metabolized in humans by CYP3A4. In this study, we report that the bioactivation of dasatinib by CYP3A4 proceeds through a reactive intermediate that leads to CYP3A4 inactivation with K(I) = 6.3 microM and k(inact) = 0.034 min(-1). The major mechanism of inactivation proceeds through hydroxylation at the para-position of the 2-chloro-6-methylphenyl ring followed by further oxidation, forming a reactive quinone-imine, similar to the reactive intermediates formed by acetaminophen and diclofenac. Formation of a reactive imine-methide was also detected but appears to be a minor pathway. When glutathione was added to human liver microsomal incubations, dasatinib-glutathione adducts were detected. Numerous dasatinib analogs were synthesized in an effort to understand what modifications would block the formation of reactive intermediates during dasatinib metabolism. It is interesting to note that blocking the site of hydroxylation with a methyl group was not effective because a reactive imine-methide was formed, nor was blocking the site with fluorine because the fluorine was removed through an oxidative defluorination mechanism and the reactive quinone-imine was still formed. Numerous analogs are presented that did effectively block the formation of glutathione adducts and prevent the inactivation of CYP3A4.","['Li, Xiaohai', 'He, Yuanjun', 'Ruiz, Claudia H', 'Koenig, Marcel', 'Cameron, Michael D', 'Vojkovsky, Tomas']","['Li X', 'He Y', 'Ruiz CH', 'Koenig M', 'Cameron MD', 'Vojkovsky T']","['Translational Research Institute, Scripps Florida, the Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090312,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '144O8QL0L1 (Diclofenac)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/genetics/metabolism', '*Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Dasatinib', 'Diclofenac/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Microsomes, Liver/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Thiazoles/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/09/26 06:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['dmd.108.025932 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.108.025932 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2009 Jun;37(6):1242-50. doi: 10.1124/dmd.108.025932.

Older AML patients, generally defined by age > or = 60 years, have worse treatment outcomes than younger patients. While selected older patients can benefit from standard therapies, as a group they experience greater treatment-related toxicity, lower remission rates, shorter disease-free survival times, and shorter overall survival times. Outcome disparity is in part explained by age-related biologic features. Older patients are more likely to present with unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities, multidrug resistance phenotypes, and secondary AML. However, even older adults with favorable tumor biology have a worse prognosis than younger patients. Patient-specific factors, including impaired physical function and comorbidity, independently predict greater treatment toxicity and shorter survival. Improving patient assessment strategies is critical to identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from induction and postremission therapies. In addition, continued efforts to identify more effective and tolerable induction and postremission strategies are needed for this population. Investigations of hypomethylating agents and signal transduction inhibitors hold promise for the treatment of AML patients. Steady advances in the field of hematopoietic transplantation, including use of reduced intensity transplants, may result in additional curative options available to selected older adults.

Superior immune plasticity of CB grafts, that allows for less stringent HLA matching, is especially valuable in the face of a persistently growing need for unrelated donor (UD) transplants. Limited cell dose remains the main setback of CBT, particularly in adult population. New strategies, such as transplantation with two cord blood units or using non-myeloablative conditioning, have remarkably expanded the availability of CB transplants in adults with hematological malignancies. Clinical trials with in vitro expanded CB-derived stem cells are under way. Currently cord blood is considered a second best choice after matched bone marrow. However, results of recent international studies indicate that in particular clinical settings, such as in children with leukemia, CB may become a frontline hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source for transplantation. Recent advances in understanding the unique biology of cord blood will further expand indications for its use in different settings, including those beyond hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT).","['Stanevsky, Anfisa', 'Goldstein, Gal', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Stanevsky A', 'Goldstein G', 'Nagler A']","['Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center and Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090317,England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,"['Blood Banks', 'Contraindications', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/trends', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/*mortality/*surgery', 'Hemoglobinopathies/immunology/surgery', 'Humans']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/10/22 06:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0268-960X(09)00017-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2009.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2009 Sep;23(5):199-204. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2009.02.001.

Cells of the hematopoietic lineages, however, remain difficult to transduce, although precoating of culture vessels with the fibronectin fragment CH-296 may improve transduction efficiency. Alternatively, low-speed centrifugation of vector-containing supernatant onto culture vessels may improve transduction efficiency in the absence of CH-296 preloading. Using the NIH/3T3-derived Moloney murine leukemia virus-based packaging cell lines PG13, PA317, and PT67, we here show that preloading by low-speed centrifugation improves transduction efficiency in a packaging cell subclone-dependent manner. Preloading by centrifugation, however, cannot generally replace CH-296 and we obtained the overall highest transduction levels when combining centrifugation and CH-296 precoating. We found, moreover, that the factor responsible for high susceptibility to preloading in our PG13-derived vector supernatant was transferable to a PA317-derived vector supernatant with low susceptibility to preloading. Furthermore, our PA317, PG13, and PT67 subclones shed into their supernatants variable amounts of fibronectin. This soluble fibronectin formed aggregates of various sizes and generated complexes with vector particles. The fibronectin-vector complexes readily sedimented onto culture vessels and copurified after fibronectin-specific affinity purification of vector-containing supernatants. Finally, vector supernatant from 293T cells, which barely produce fibronectin, was not susceptible to preloading. The susceptibility to preloading by centrifugation thus appears to be dependent both on the specific packaging cell line and on the association of vector particles and packaging cell-produced fibronectin. Rigorous screening of individual vector-containing supernatants is therefore required to identify optimal transduction conditions for retroviral gene transfer.","['Sondergaard, Claus S', 'Haldrup, Christa', 'Beer, Christiane', 'Andersen, Bente', 'Kohn, Donald B', 'Pedersen, Lene']","['Sondergaard CS', 'Haldrup C', 'Beer C', 'Andersen B', 'Kohn DB', 'Pedersen L']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Aarhus University, 8000 Arhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,['0 (Fibronectins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Clone Cells', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Culture Techniques', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Virion/isolation & purification', '*Virus Assembly']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/07/30 09:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2008.140 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2009 Apr;20(4):337-49. doi: 10.1089/hum.2008.140.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to determine if the risk of SPMs is increased in individuals with thyroid cancer treated with radioactive iodine (RAI), compared to those not treated with RAI. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers screened citations and reviewed full-text papers. If not reported by the primary authors, the relative risk (RR) of SPMs was calculated by dividing the standardized incidence ratio of SPM in individuals with thyroid cancer treated with RAI compared to those not treated with RAI (with associated 95% confidence intervals [CI]). The natural logarithms of RRs of respective SPMs, weighted by the inverse of the variance, were pooled using fixed effects models and the exponential of the results was reported. RESULTS: Two multi-center studies (one from Europe and the other from North America) were included in this review. The RR of SPMs in thyroid cancer survivors treated with RAI was significantly increased at 1.19 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04, 1.36, p = 0.010), relative to thyroid cancer survivors not treated with RAI (data from 16,502 individuals), using a minimum latency period of 2 to 3 years after thyroid cancer diagnosis. The RR of leukemia was also significantly increased in thyroid cancer survivors treated with RAI, with an RR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.13, 5.53, p = 0.024). We did not observe a significantly increased risk of the following cancers related to prior RAI treatment: bladder, breast, central nervous system, colon and rectum, digestive tract, stomach, pancreas, kidney (and renal pelvis), lung, or melanoma of skin. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of SPMs in thyroid cancer survivors treated with RAI is slightly increased compared to thyroid cancer survivors not treated with RAI.","['Sawka, Anna M', 'Thabane, Lehana', 'Parlea, Luciana', 'Ibrahim-Zada, Irada', 'Tsang, Richard W', 'Brierley, James D', 'Straus, Sharon', 'Ezzat, Shereen', 'Goldstein, David P']","['Sawka AM', 'Thabane L', 'Parlea L', 'Ibrahim-Zada I', 'Tsang RW', 'Brierley JD', 'Straus S', 'Ezzat S', 'Goldstein DP']","['Division of Endocrinology and Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. sawkaam@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Thyroid,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,9104317,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/thy.2008.0392 [doi]'],ppublish,Thyroid. 2009 May;19(5):451-7. doi: 10.1089/thy.2008.0392.,['Thyroid. 2009 May;19(5):435-6.

The reversing effect of CA was evaluated by determining the inhibition rates of cell viability with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assays. The intracellular adriamycin fluorescence intensity and the expression of P-gp were measured by flow cytometry (FCM). Meanwhile, the subcellular distribution of adriamycin was detected via Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM). The mRNA expression of mdrlwas then detected via semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The findings showed that CA decreased apparently the Inhibition Concentration 50% (IC50) of adriamycin by increasing its intracellular concentration and thus enhancing the sensitivity of K562/AO2 cells. Adriamycin was distributed evenly in the cytoplasm when the cells were treated with CA. The expression of mdrl was decreased. Overall, the results indicated that CA can serve as a novel, non-toxic modulator of MDR, and it can reverse the MDR of K562/AO2 cells in vitro by increasing intracellular adriamycin concentration, down-regulating the expression of mdrl, and inhibiting the function of P-gp.","['Yu, Xiao-Ning', 'Chen, Xue-Liang', 'Li, Hao', 'Li, Xiang-Xin', 'Li, Hui-Qing', 'Jin, Wen-Rui']","['Yu XN', 'Chen XL', 'Li H', 'Li XX', 'Li HQ', 'Jin WR']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,India,Chin J Physiol,The Chinese journal of physiology,7804502,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Abietanes/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology']",2009/03/14 09:00,2009/05/30 09:00,['2009/03/14 09:00'],"['2009/03/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin J Physiol. 2008 Dec 31;51(6):348-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, sympathetic neurons in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) begin to express vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), galanin, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), and cholecystokinin after axotomy. Before these changes, nonneuronal cells in the SCG begin to express leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). When the effects of axotomy were compared in LIF-/- and wild-type mice, the increases in VIP and galanin expression were less in the former, though significant increases still occurred. LIF belongs to a family of cytokines with overlapping physiological effects and multimeric receptors containing the subunit gp130. Real-time PCR revealed large increases in the SCG after axotomy in mRNA for three members of this cytokine family, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, and LIF, with modest increases in oncostatin M, no changes in ciliary neurotrophic factor, and decreases in cardiotrophin-1. To explore the role of these cytokines, animals with selective elimination of the gp130 receptor in noradrenergic neurons were studied. No significant changes in mRNA levels for VIP, galanin, and PACAP were seen in axotomized ganglia from these mutant mice, while the increase in cholecystokinin was as large as that seen in wild-type mice. The data indicate that the inductions of VIP, galanin, and PACAP after axotomy are completely dependent on gp130 cytokines and that a second cytokine, in addition to LIF, is involved. The increase in cholecystokinin after axotomy, however, does not require the action of these cytokines.","['Habecker, Beth A', 'Sachs, Hilary Hyatt', 'Rohrer, Hermann', 'Zigmond, Richard E']","['Habecker BA', 'Sachs HH', 'Rohrer H', 'Zigmond RE']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon 97239-3098, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Dev Neurobiol,Developmental neurobiology,101300215,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 3)', '0 (Atf3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '9011-97-6 (Cholecystokinin)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Axotomy/methods', 'Cholecystokinin/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Neuropeptides/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/*cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/genetics/metabolism']",2009/03/13 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/03/13 09:00'],"['2009/03/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dneu.20706 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Neurobiol. 2009 May;69(6):392-400. doi: 10.1002/dneu.20706.,,,,"['NS 17512/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL68231/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL068231-07/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL068231/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS017512/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS017512-23A2/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2721278,,['NIHMS128092'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, bleeding has been observed in some patients receiving dasatinib. In the current study, the authors investigated the risk factors and management of bleeding associated with dasatinib therapy for CML after imatinib failure. METHODS: The bleeding episodes associated with dasatinib therapy in 138 patients with CML who were consecutively treated at the study institution in clinical trials were evaluated. RESULTS: Bleeding occurred in 32 (23%) patients (grade >or=3 in 9 [7%] patients [according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria]), including in 12% of patients treated in chronic phase, 31% of patients treated in accelerated phase (AP), and 35% of patients treated in blast phase (BP) (P = .02). The majority of episodes (81%) affected the gastrointestinal tract. Basic coagulation studies were normal in 97% of patients who developed bleeding complications. Although 37% of episodes occurred with platelet counts >100 x 10(9)/L, multivariate analysis identified thrombocytopenia and advanced phase CML as risk factors for bleeding. A trend toward an increased risk with a twice-daily schedule was observed (P = .17). Management included dasatinib interruption for a median of 17 days (range, 3-51 days) in 47%, of patients and transfusions in 72% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Bleeding occurs during dasatinib therapy, particularly in patients with AP or BP disease and low platelet counts. Appropriate clinical monitoring and the timely interruption of dasatinib therapy are warranted in this subset of patients.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi, Farhad', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Vidal-Senmache, Gabriela', 'Wierda, William', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi F', ""O'Brien S"", 'Thomas D', 'Vidal-Senmache G', 'Wierda W', 'Kornblau S', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

This entity, which is more frequent after solid organ transplantation, rarely occurs after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We report the case of a 43-year-old male presenting with a short history of rectal bleeding, diarrhoea and weight loss. He had received a bone marrow transplant two years previously for an acute lymphocytic leukaemia of B-cell origin. On sigmoidoscopy, deep ulcerations of the rectal and sigmoideal mucosa were found. Further investigations revealed a diffuse infiltration of the liver, spleen, both kidneys and lungs. Histologically, a monomorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder was diagnosed, the subtype was a high grade diffuse-large cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B-cell origin. The biopsies showed that a major proportion of cells expressed Epstein-Barr virus encoded proteins typical for latent as well as lytic EBV infection. This is a common feature of PTLD and possibly plays a critical role in its pathogenesis. The current therapeutic approach to the subtype of PTLD we saw in this patient is CHOP chemotherapy, comprising the anti-CD 20 antibody rituximab if CD 20-positivity is present. This patient had a fatal course of the disease and died a few days after the first chemotherapy cycle due to severe multiple organ failure.","['Godt, C', 'Regnery, A', 'Schwarze, B', 'Junker, K', 'Porschen, R']","['Godt C', 'Regnery A', 'Schwarze B', 'Junker K', 'Porschen R']","['Department of Medicine, Hospital Bremen-Ost, Bremen. cgodt@gmx.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090311,Germany,Z Gastroenterol,Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie,0033370,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/*etiology/pathology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Diarrhea/*etiology/pathology', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/*etiology/pathology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Sigmoidoscopy']",2009/03/13 09:00,2009/05/29 09:00,['2009/03/13 09:00'],"['2009/03/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1027554 [doi]'],ppublish,Z Gastroenterol. 2009 Mar;47(3):283-7. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1027554.

During induction therapy, he developed severe pneumonia. Although meropenem and micafungin were started, he died of circulatory failure owing to massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Autopsy specimens obtained from the stomach revealed fungal hyphae, which had invaded diffusely into submucosal vessels and caused the massive gastric bleeding. The same hyphae were also observed in both lungs. A diagnosis of disseminated zygomycosis was confirmed by its characteristic histopathological findings. Because zygomycetes are spontaneously resistant to the newer antifungal agents, such as voriconazole or micafungin, it seems likely that the prevalence of zygomycosis as a breakthrough infection may increase in the future. Zygomycosis is a rare, but life-threatening, deep fungal infection that appears in immunologically or metabolically compromised hosts. Its manifestations are clinically similar to those of invasive aspergillosis. In addition to the well-established epidemiology of zygomycosis, this case suggests the following new characteristics. (1) Although the gastrointestinal manifestation of zygomycosis is relatively rare, it is observed more frequently than invasive aspergillosis. (2) Gastrointestinal zygomycosis occasionally leads to the development of necrotic ulcers and may induce hemorrhagic shock.(3) We should be cautious of an occurrence of breakthrough zygomycosis when we use echinocandins for patients with known risk factors, especially steroid use and neutropenia. (4) For patients who are receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and echinocandins, who are negative for culture studies and aspergillus antigen, and who present with unresolved fever, it is important to make a prompt clinical diagnosis of zygomycosis.","['Suzuki, Kei', 'Sugawara, Yumiko', 'Sekine, Takao', 'Nakase, Kazunori', 'Katayama, Naoyuki']","['Suzuki K', 'Sugawara Y', 'Sekine T', 'Nakase K', 'Katayama N']","['Internal Medicine, Matsusaka Chuo General Hospital, Matsusaka, Mie, Japan. keis@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090312,Netherlands,J Infect Chemother,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,9608375,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Echinocandins/*therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology/pathology', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lipopeptides/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Micafungin', 'Stomach/pathology', 'Zygomycosis/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology/pathology']",2009/03/13 09:00,2009/04/21 09:00,['2009/03/13 09:00'],"['2008/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10156-008-0657-5 [doi]', 'S1341-321X(09)70719-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Infect Chemother. 2009 Feb;15(1):42-5. doi: 10.1007/s10156-008-0657-5.

This current ""hands on"" model of cancer has kept oncogenes firmly in focus as therapeutic targets and is in agreement with the fact that in human cancers all cancerous cells, with independence of the cellular heterogeneity existing within the tumor, carry the same oncogenic genetic lesions. This rule has now been broken in a study of the effect of the BCR-ABL oncogene in cancer development in a mouse model in which oncogene expression is restricted to the stem cell compartment. BCR-ABL is linked to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) disease in humans, and this study shows that by limiting the oncogene expression to Sca1(+) cells CML arises, indicating that maintenance of oncogene expression is not critical for the generation of differentiated tumor cells and showing a ""hands off"" role for BCR-ABL in regulating cancer formation.

Here, we determined that the pan-HDAC inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589) treatment depletes DNMT1 and EZH2 protein levels, disrupts the interaction of DNMT1 with EZH2, as well as de-represses JunB in human acute leukemia cells. Similar to treatment with the hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG, treatment with panobinostat also inhibited the chaperone association of heat shock protein 90 with DNMT1 and EZH2, which promoted the proteasomal degradation of DNMT1 and EZH2. Unlike treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine, which demethylates JunB promoter DNA, panobinostat treatment mediated chromatin alterations in the JunB promoter. Combined treatment with panobinostat and decitabine caused greater attenuation of DNMT1 and EZH2 levels than either agent alone, which was accompanied by more JunB de-repression and loss of clonogenic survival of K562 cells. Co-treatment with panobinostat and decitabine also caused more loss of viability of primary AML but not normal CD34(+) bone marrow progenitor cells.

Preexisting antiviral proteins such as PML, Daxx, and Sp100 are stored in specific nuclear domains (ND10). In herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), the immediate-early protein ICP0 serves as a counterdefense through degradation of the detrimental protein PML. We asked whether interferon (IFN)-upregulated Sp100 is similarly antagonized by ICP0 in normal human fibroblasts by using a selective-knockdown approach. We find that of the four Sp100 isoforms, the three containing a SAND domain block the transcription of HSV-1 proteins ICP0 and ICP4 at the promoter level and that IFN changes the differential splicing of the Sp100 transcript in favor of the inhibitor Sp100C. At the protein level, ICP0 activity does not lead to the hydrolysis of any of the Sp100 isoforms. The SAND domain-containing isoforms are not general inhibitors of viral promoters, as the activity of the major immediate-early cytomegalovirus promoter is not diminished, whereas the long terminal repeat of a retrovirus, like the ICP0 promoter, is strongly inhibited. Since we could not find a specific promoter region in the ICP0 gene that responds to the SAND domain-containing isoforms, we questioned whether Sp100 could act through other antiviral proteins such as PML. We find that all four Sp100 isoforms stabilize ND10 and protect PML from ICP0-based hydrolysis. Loss of either all PML isoforms or all Sp100 isoforms reduces the opposite constituent ND10 protein, suggesting that various interdependent mechanisms of ND10-based proteins inhibit virus infection at the immediate-early level.","['Negorev, Dmitri G', 'Vladimirova, Olga V', 'Maul, Gerd G']","['Negorev DG', 'Vladimirova OV', 'Maul GG']","['The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090311,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Autoantigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'Interferons/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Protein Splicing', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/03/13 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/03/13 09:00'],"['2009/03/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02083-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02083-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 May;83(10):5168-80. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02083-08.

To clarify the mechanism by which PVC-211 MuLV expression in BCEC induces neurological disease, we examined virus-infected rats at various times during neurological disease progression for vascular and inflammatory changes. As early as 2 weeks after virus infection and before any marked appearance of spongiform neurodegeneration, we detected vessel leakage and an increase in size and number of vessels in the areas of the brain that eventually become diseased. Consistent with these findings, the amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increased in the brain as early as 1 to 2 weeks postinfection. Also detected at this early disease stage was an increased level of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), a cytokine involved in recruitment of microglia to the brain. This was followed at 3 weeks postinfection by a marked accumulation of activated microglia in the spongiform areas of the brain accompanied by an increase in tissue plasminogen activator, a product of microglia implicated in neurodegeneration. Pathological observations at the end stage of the disease included loss of neurons, decreased myelination, and mild muscle atrophy. Treatment of PVC-211 MuLV-infected rats with clodronate-containing liposomes, which specifically kill microglia, significantly blocked neurodegeneration. Together, these results suggest that PVC-211 MuLV infection of BCEC results in the production of VEGF and MIP-1 alpha, leading to the vascular changes and microglial activation necessary to cause neurodegeneration.","['Li, Xiujie', 'Hanson, Charlotte', 'Cmarik, Joan L', 'Ruscetti, Sandra']","['Li X', 'Hanson C', 'Cmarik JL', 'Ruscetti S']","['Laboratory of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090311,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor A, rat)', '0813BZ6866 (Clodronic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Capillaries/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebellum/blood supply/pathology/virology', 'Chemokine CCL3/*metabolism', 'Clodronic Acid/pharmacology', 'Demyelinating Diseases/virology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/pathology/virology', 'Inflammation/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/virology', 'Microglia/metabolism/*virology', 'Muscular Atrophy/virology', 'Nerve Degeneration/pathology/prevention & control/*virology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism']",2009/03/13 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/03/13 09:00'],"['2009/03/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02343-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02343-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 May;83(10):4912-22. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02343-08.

The phosphorylation of two serine residues (S151 and S153) at the C terminus is important for the function of HTLV-2 Rex (Rex-2). The Rex-2 phosphomimetic double mutant (S151D, S153D) is locked in a functionally active conformation. Since rex and tax genes overlap, Rex S151D and S153D mutants were found to alter the Tax oncoprotein coding sequence and transactivation activities. Therefore, additional Rex-2 mutants including P152D, A157D, S151Term, and S158Term were generated and characterized (""Term"" indicates termination codon). All Rex-2 mutants and wild-type (wt) Rex-2 localized predominantly to the nucleus/nucleolus, but in contrast to the detection of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of wt Rex-2 (p26 and p24), mutant proteins were detected as a single phosphoprotein species. We found that Rex P152D, A157D, and S158Term mutants are more functionally active than wt Rex-2 and that the Rex-2 C terminus and its specific phosphorylation state are required for stability and optimal expression. In the context of the provirus, the more active Rex mutants (A157D or S158Term) promoted increased viral protein production, increased viral infectious spread, and enhanced HTLV-2-mediated cellular proliferation. Moreover, these Rex mutant viruses replicated and persisted in inoculated rabbits despite higher antiviral antibody responses. Thus, we identified in Rex-2 a novel C-terminal inhibitory domain that regulates functional activity and is positively regulated through phosphorylation. The ability of this domain to modulate viral replication likely plays a key role in the infectious spread of the virus and in virus-induced cellular proliferation.","['Xie, Li', 'Kesic, Matthew', 'Yamamoto, Brenda', 'Li, Min', 'Younis, Ihab', 'Lairmore, Michael D', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Xie L', 'Kesic M', 'Yamamoto B', 'Li M', 'Younis I', 'Lairmore MD', 'Green PL']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, 1925 Coffey Rd., Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090311,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (rex protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'HTLV-II Infections/virology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Stability', 'Rabbits', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', '*Virus Replication']",2009/03/13 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/03/13 09:00'],"['2009/03/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02271-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02271-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 May;83(10):5232-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02271-08.

In this study, we examined the roles of GATA-1 and GATA-2 in activating transcription of the secretory ribonuclease, the eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN/RNase 2). Augmented expression of both GATA-1 and GATA-2 was detected in eosinophil promyelocyte HL-60 clone 15 cells in response to biochemical differentiation with butyric acid. Deletion or mutation of one or both of the two consensus GATA-binding sites in the extended 1000-bp 5' promoter of the EDN gene resulted in profound reduction in reporter gene activity. Antibody-augmented electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicate that GATA-1 and GATA-2 proteins bind to both functional GATA consensus sequences in the EDN promoter. Interestingly, RNA silencing of GATA-1 alone had no impact on EDN expression; silencing of GATA-2 resulted in diminished expression of EDN, and also diminished expression of GATA-1 in both butyric acid-induced HL-60 clone 15 cells and in differentiating human eosinophils derived from CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors. Likewise, overexpression of GATA-2 in uninduced HL-60 clone 15 cells resulted in augmented transcription of both EDN and GATA-1. Taken together, our data suggest that GATA-2 functions directly via interactions with the EDN promoter and also indirectly, via its ability to regulate the expression of GATA-1 in differentiating eosinophils and eosinophil cell lines.","['Qiu, Zhijun', 'Dyer, Kimberly D', 'Xie, Zhihui', 'Radinger, Madeleine', 'Rosenberg, Helene F']","['Qiu Z', 'Dyer KD', 'Xie Z', 'Radinger M', 'Rosenberg HF']","['Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090310,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 3.1.- (Eosinophil-Derived Neurotoxin)', 'EC 3.1.27.5 (RNASE2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Eosinophil-Derived Neurotoxin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Eosinophils/metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Umbilical Cord']",2009/03/13 09:00,2009/07/22 09:00,['2009/03/13 09:00'],"['2009/03/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)58311-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M807307200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 May 8;284(19):13099-109. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M807307200.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been successfully used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and has activity in multiple myeloma (MM). While signaling events associated with carcinogenesis have been well studied, it still remains to be determined which of these events are involved in anti-cancer signaling. To better define this response, gene expression profiling following ATO treatment of four MM cell lines was performed. The pattern was consistent with a strong antioxidative response, particularly of genes activated by Nrf2. While Nrf2 is expressed constitutively at the mRNA level, the protein is not detected in untreated cells. Consistent with inactivation of Keap1, Nrf2 protein is stabilized and present in the nucleus within 6 h of ATO treatment. Despite the activation of this antioxidative response, ROS may not be important in ATO-induced death. Inhibition of ATO-induced ROS with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) does not affect Nrf2 activation or cell death. Moreover, silencing Nrf2 had no effect on ATO-induced apoptosis. Together these data suggest that ROS is not important in the induction of the antioxidative response or cellular death by ATO.","['Morales, Alejo A', 'Gutman, Delia', 'Cejas, Pedro J', 'Lee, Kelvin P', 'Boise, Lawrence H']","['Morales AA', 'Gutman D', 'Cejas PJ', 'Lee KP', 'Boise LH']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090311,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '25013-16-5 (Butylated Hydroxyanisole)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Butylated Hydroxyanisole/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Subcellular Fractions']",2009/03/13 09:00,2009/07/22 09:00,['2009/03/13 09:00'],"['2009/03/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)58288-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M806546200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 May 8;284(19):12886-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M806546200.

DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to investigate outcome and risk factors in patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Between 1981 and 2006, 461 patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid, a median age of 40 years and a history of solid tumor (n=163), malignant lymphoma (n=133), or other hematologic diseases (n=57) underwent stem cell transplantation and their data were reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality and relapse at 3 years was 37% and 31%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis significant factors for relapse were not being in complete remission at the time of transplantation (p=0.002), abnormal cytogenetics (p=0.005), higher patients' age (p=0.03) and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (p=0.04), while higher non-relapse mortality was influenced by higher patients' age. Furthermore, there was a marked reduction in non-relapse mortality per calendar year during the study period (p<0.001). The 3-year relapse-free and overall survival rates were 33% and 35%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis significant higher overall survival rates were seen per calendar year (p<0.001), for younger age (<40 years) and normal cytogenetics (p=0.05). Using age (<40 years), abnormal cytogenetics and not being in complete remission at the time of transplantation as risk factors, three different risk groups with overall survival rates of 62%, 33% and 24% could be easily distinguished. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation can cure patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia and has markedly improved over time. Non-complete remission, abnormal cytogenetics and higher patients' age are the most significant factors predicting survival.","['Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Brand, Ronald', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Zander, Axel', 'Dierlamm, Judith', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Devergie, Agnes', 'Ruutu, Tapani', 'Cornish, Jackie', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Cordonnier, Catherine', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Symeonidis, Argiris', 'de Witte, Theo']","['Kroger N', 'Brand R', 'van Biezen A', 'Zander A', 'Dierlamm J', 'Niederwieser D', 'Devergie A', 'Ruutu T', 'Cornish J', 'Ljungman P', 'Gratwohl A', 'Cordonnier C', 'Beelen D', 'Deconinck E', 'Symeonidis A', 'de Witte T']","['Dept. for Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany. nkroeger@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090310,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/mortality/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/13 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/03/13 09:00'],"['2009/03/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2008.000927 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2008.000927 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Apr;94(4):542-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2008.000927.

However, it is now accepted that caspase-independent forms of programmed cell death also regulate cell death. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CD47 ligation induces one of these alternative forms of cell death: type III programmed cell death. This poorly understood process is characterized by cytoplasmic hallmarks, such as mitochondrial damage. To gain insights into the molecular pathways regulating type III programmed cell death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, we performed extensive biochemical and cell biology assessments. DESIGN AND METHODS: After CD47 triggering, purified B-cells from 20 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were studied by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and three-dimensional imaging, immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and fibrillar/globular actin measurements. Finally, we subjected CD47-treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to a phagocytosis assay. RESULTS: We first confirmed that induction of type III programmed cell death is an efficient means of triggering cell death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Further, we demonstrated that the signaling events induced by CD47 ligation provoked a reduction in cell size. This alteration is related to F-actin disruption, as the two other cytoskeleton networks, microtubules and intermediate filaments, remain undisturbed in type III programmed cell death. Strikingly, we revealed that the pharmacological modulation of F-actin dynamics regulated this type of death. Finally, our data delineated a new programmed cell death pathway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia initiated by CD47 triggering, and followed by serine protease activation, F-actin rearrangement, mitochondrial damage, phosphatidylserine exposure, and cell clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Our work reveals a key molecular tool in the modulation of cell death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: F-actin. By assessing the regulation of F-actin and type III programmed cell death, this analysis provides new options for destroying chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, such as a combination of therapies based on apoptosis regulators (e.g., caspases, Bcl-2, Bax) along with alternative therapies based on type III death effectors (e.g., F-actin).","['Barbier, Sandrine', 'Chatre, Laurent', 'Bras, Marlene', 'Sancho, Patricia', 'Roue, Gael', 'Virely, Clemence', 'Yuste, Victor J', 'Baudet, Sylvie', 'Rubio, Manuel', 'Esquerda, Josep E', 'Sarfati, Marika', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Susin, Santos A']","['Barbier S', 'Chatre L', 'Bras M', 'Sancho P', 'Roue G', 'Virely C', 'Yuste VJ', 'Baudet S', 'Rubio M', 'Esquerda JE', 'Sarfati M', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Susin SA']","[""Rue de l'Ecole de Medecine, 75006 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090310,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Actins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Caspases', 'Cytoskeleton/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/03/13 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/03/13 09:00'],"['2009/03/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']","['haematol.13690 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13690 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Apr;94(4):507-17. doi: 10.3324/haematol.13690.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed malignant cells from 18 patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia using high density 250K single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and molecular allelokaryotyping to refine understanding of known alterations and identify new target genes. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed that characteristic disruptions of chromosome 14 are frequently unbalanced. In the commonly deleted region on chromosome 11, we found recurrent microdeletions targeting the microRNA 34b/c and the transcription factors ETS1 and FLI1. On chromosome 8, we identified genes such as PLEKHA2, NBS1, NOV and MYST3 to be involved in breakpoints. New recurrent alterations were identified on chromosomes 5p, 12p, 13q, 17 and 22 with a common region of acquired uniparental disomy in four samples on chromosome 17q. Single nucleotide polymorphism array results were confirmed by direct sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by cytolytic lymphoid cells is essential for the clinical activity of anticancer monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), but whether PAgs affect ADCC by gammadelta T cells is unknown. Here we report that, in association with the CD20(+)-specific mAb rituximab (RTX), the synthetic PAg bromohydrin pyrophosphate (BrHPP) increased TCRVgamma9(+) cell binding to CD20(+) lymphoma cells in vitro. This combination activated phospho-ZAP70 and phospho-ERK1/2 signaling in TCRVgamma9(+) cells and strongly enhanced their ADCC activity. We obtained similar results with BrHPP in the context of the mAbs alemtuzumab and trastuzumab. Furthermore, BrHPP enhanced RTX-mediated depletion of CD20(+) cells in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy subjects and enhanced ADCC by gammadelta T cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In cynomolgus macaques, a regimen combining RTX, BrHPP, and IL2 activated TCRVgamma9(+) lymphocytes and enhanced B-cell depletion from blood and lymph nodes.

Although there is tremendous diversity within this community, commonalities of language, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors unite Latinos, making them more similar than different. Differences by national origin, although important, are attenuated when immigrants come to the United States, dominated by an English-language, Anglo-centric culture. For non-Latino and non-Spanish-speaking clinicians, communication barriers and cultural misunderstandings can impede the care of dying Latino patients and their families. We present the case of a young, pregnant, Spanish-speaking woman from Central America diagnosed with a fatal leukemia. As illustrated by this case, Latino immigrants face a number of external challenges to optimal end-of-life care: (1) geographic distance as well as political and economic realities often separate patients from their valued families; (2) undocumented immigrants are frequently uninsured and fear of deportation may create a barrier to accessing health services; (3) language and literacy barriers; and (4) concerns about discrimination. Other Latino issues that may be more pronounced in end-of-life settings include cultural themes and religious and spiritual influences. We recommend that professional interpreters must be used for discussions about goals of care with Spanish-speaking patients and families or when negotiating conflict between the patient, family, and the health care team.

There is evidence that the accumulation of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow is due to a cell resistance to apoptosis rather than to highly proliferative cells. Genetic mechanisms that lead to the development and progression of disease are mainly unknown, although a number of prognostically and diagnostically important genetic markers have been identified. The aim of this study is to investigate the gene expression profile, by a specific chip for microarray analysis, in B-CLL lymphocytes with regard to factors involved in apoptosis cascade, signal transduction, purine metabolism enzymes, interleukin expression, enzymes involved in the responses to oxidative stress. We found relevant results in a set of 19 of the 57 genes considered. IMP dehydrogenase, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, adenylosuccinate lyase, adenylate kinase, ADORA1, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 6, Bcl-2-like 1 isoform 2, caspase 6, and 8 were found underexpressed; while ADORA3, Gars-Airs-Gart, adenylate kinase 3, adenylate deaminase, NMN adenylyltransferase, CD26, CD38, interleukins 18 and 4 were found overexpressed. The microarray technique is a powerful method for identification of potential important diagnostic and prognostic markers, besides giving prominence to genes candidate for further studies.","['Carlucci, F', 'Marinello, E', 'Tommassini, V', 'Pisano, B', 'Rosi, F', 'Tabucchi, A']","['Carlucci F', 'Marinello E', 'Tommassini V', 'Pisano B', 'Rosi F', 'Tabucchi A']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Interna, Scienze Endocrino-Metaboliche e Biochimica, Sezione di Biochimica, Universita degli Studi di Siena, Siena, Italy. carlucci@unisi.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090225,France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/genetics"", 'Apoptosis', 'Cytokines/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Purine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2009/03/13 09:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/03/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0753-3322(09)00036-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2009.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2009 Nov;63(9):663-71. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2009.02.001.

MR1 expression on thymus epithelial cells is not necessary for MAIT cell development but their accumulation in the gut requires MR1 expressing B cells and commensal flora. MAIT cell development is poorly known, as these cells have not been found in the thymus so far. Herein, complementary human and mouse experiments using an anti-humanValpha7.2 antibody and MAIT cell-specific iTCRalpha and TCRbeta transgenic mice in different genetic backgrounds show that MAIT cell development is a stepwise process, with an intra-thymic selection followed by peripheral expansion. Mouse MAIT cells are selected in an MR1-dependent manner both in fetal thymic organ culture and in double iTCRalpha and TCRbeta transgenic RAG knockout mice. In the latter mice, MAIT cells do not expand in the periphery unless B cells are added back by adoptive transfer, showing that B cells are not required for the initial thymic selection step but for the peripheral accumulation. In humans, contrary to natural killer T (NKT) cells, MAIT cells display a naive phenotype in the thymus as well as in cord blood where they are in low numbers. After birth, MAIT cells acquire a memory phenotype and expand dramatically, up to 1%-4% of blood T cells. Finally, in contrast with NKT cells, human MAIT cell development is independent of the molecular adaptor SAP. Interestingly, mouse MAIT cells display a naive phenotype and do not express the ZBTB16 transcription factor, which, in contrast, is expressed by NKT cells and the memory human MAIT cells found in the periphery after birth. In conclusion, MAIT cells are selected by MR1 in the thymus on a non-B non-T hematopoietic cell, and acquire a memory phenotype and expand in the periphery in a process dependent both upon B cells and the bacterial flora. Thus, their development follows a unique pattern at the crossroad of NKT and gammadelta T cells.","['Martin, Emmanuel', 'Treiner, Emmanuel', 'Duban, Livine', 'Guerri, Lucia', 'Laude, Helene', 'Toly, Cecile', 'Premel, Virginie', 'Devys, Anne', 'Moura, Ivan C', 'Tilloy, Florence', 'Cherif, Stephane', 'Vera, Gabriella', 'Latour, Sylvain', 'Soudais, Claire', 'Lantz, Olivier']","['Martin E', 'Treiner E', 'Duban L', 'Guerri L', 'Laude H', 'Toly C', 'Premel V', 'Devys A', 'Moura IC', 'Tilloy F', 'Cherif S', 'Vera G', 'Latour S', 'Soudais C', 'Lantz O']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Institut Curie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MR1 protein, human)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Child', 'Fetal Blood/immunology', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/cytology/immunology/microbiology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Mucosal/*immunology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*immunology']",2009/03/13 09:00,2009/05/16 09:00,['2009/03/13 09:00'],"['2008/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [medline]']","['08-PLBI-RA-3994 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pbio.1000054 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Biol. 2009 Mar 10;7(3):e54. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000054.,,,,,PMC2653554,,,"['Competing interests.

This study investigated the effectiveness of HSV-tk activation as gene therapy for gastroesophageal junction and gastric adenocarcinomas using either the stress-inducible Grp78 promoter or the murine leukemia virus long-terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. METHODS: The HSV-tk gene, controlled by either the Grp78 promoter or the LTR promoter, was transduced into the gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma cell line SK-GT-5 and the gastric adenocarcinoma cell line MKN-74. Cell viability after exposure to varying concentrations of GCV was compared. The same cell lines were used to develop a nude mouse model for studies of the HSV-tk/GCV effect in vivo. The effect of intraperitoneal GCV injection on growth of the subcutaneous tumors was measured. HSV-TK expression was measured by Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Cell viability in vitro was significantly lower in the HSV-tk expressing (HSV-tk+) cells compared to control (no HSV-tk) cells after exposure to GCV. MKN-74tk+ cells were more sensitive to GCV killing than SK-GT-5tk+ cells. After culture with 1 microg/ml GCV for 10 days, MKN-74/tk cells were totally killed, whereas most SK-GT-5/tk cells survived. Cell viability was significantly lower under glucose starvation conditions when HSV-tk expression was regulated by the Grp78 promoter compared with the LTR promoter. MKN-74 tumors formed with HSV-tk+ cells in nude mice were eliminated after administration of GCV for 3 weeks, but GCV had no effect on tumors formed from HSV-tk- cells. Eradication of tumor formed with Grp78-tk cells was faster than that with LTR-tk cells. HSV-TK protein and mRNA were expressed in the transduced, but not the non-transduced tumors. CONCLUSION: HSV-tk xwith ganciclovir suicide gene therapy results in significant cell killing in gastroesophageal junction and gastric adenocarcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo, but complete tumor elimination only occurred with the gastric adenocarcinoma cell tumors. The most effective approach in this study used the Grp78 promoter in glucose-starvation stress conditions.","['Azatian, Armen', 'Yu, Hong', 'Dai, Wande', 'Schneiders, Fiona I', 'Botelho, Natalia K', 'Lord, Reginald V N']","['Azatian A', 'Yu H', 'Dai W', 'Schneiders FI', 'Botelho NK', 'Lord RV']","['Department of Surgery, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090310,United States,J Gastrointest Surg,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,9706084,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Ganciclovir/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Transgenic, Suicide/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology/genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11605-009-0839-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gastrointest Surg. 2009 Jun;13(6):1044-51. doi: 10.1007/s11605-009-0839-1.

This chapter will cover both the RTTA and LTTA for studying candidate oncogenes involved in human leukaemia.","['Zeisig, Bernd B', 'So, Chi Wai Eric']","['Zeisig BB', 'So CW']","['Haemato-Oncology Section, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/05/20 09:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-418-6_10 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;538:207-29. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-418-6_10.,,,,"['G0800892/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have described an ex vivo bone marrow stromal coculture system in which CD34(+) cells, but not CD34(-) cells, from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of AML patients can give rise to long-term cultures (LTC) that can be maintained for over 20 weeks. Long-term expansion is associated with the formation of leukemic cobblestone area (L-CA) formation underneath the stroma. Self-renewal within these L-CAs can be determined by sequential passaging of these L-CAs onto new MS5 stromal layers, which results in the generation of second, third, and fourth L-CAs that are able to sustain long-term expansion and generate high numbers of immature undifferentiated suspension cells. Furthermore, we have optimized lentiviral transduction procedures in order to stably express genes of interest or stably downmodulate genes using RNAi in AML CD34(+) cells, and this method has also been described here. Together, these tools should allow a further molecular elucidation of derailed signal transduction in AML stem cells.","['Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'Schepers, Hein']","['Schuringa JJ', 'Schepers H']","['Department of Hematology, University of Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, 9700RB, Groningen, The Netherlands. j.schuringa@int.umcg.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biological Assay/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/05/20 09:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-418-6_14 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;538:287-300. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-418-6_14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the chromosomal translocations associated with acute leukemias involve HOX genes directly or some of their regulatory factors, e.g., mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL), leading to inappropriate expression of certain subsets of the genes. Evolutionarily, the HOX genes are thought to have arisen by duplication and divergence from a primordial gene. Consequently, they exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity, particularly in the homeobox domain. HOX gene expression, the HOXOME, can be quantified by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) using carefully selected reagents. In practice, an RQ-PCR platform based on Taqman probe chemistry has proved valuable for the precise measurement of individual human and murine HOX genes with a high degree of specificity, over a wide dynamic range. Defining the roles for HOX in hematopoiesis should help to elucidate the mechanisms of deregulation in leukemia and eventually identify targets for therapeutic intervention.","['Dickson, Glenda J', 'Lappin, Terence R', 'Thompson, Alexander']","['Dickson GJ', 'Lappin TR', 'Thompson A']","[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9 7BL, Ireland. g.mcgonigle@qub.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', '*Gene Expression', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/05/20 09:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-418-6_19 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;538:369-93. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-418-6_19.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The range of procedures necessary for the successful application of FISH in the accurate detection of significant chromosomal abnormalities in childhood acute leukaemia is described here.","['Konn, Zoe J', 'Wright, Sarah L', 'Barber, Kerry E', 'Harrison, Christine J']","['Konn ZJ', 'Wright SL', 'Barber KE', 'Harrison CJ']","['Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Probes/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/05/20 09:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-418-6_3 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;538:29-55. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-418-6_3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the exception of gene internal partial-tandem duplications involving several exons located in the 5'-end of MLL, all recombination events occur in a small genomic region flanked by MLL exons 8-14, designated as the MLL breakpoint cluster region. Efforts from different laboratories, including our own, have led to the identification of more than 50 MLL fusion partners that were characterized at the molecular level. The common theme of recombination events involving the human MLL gene is the creation of ""functional"" fusion genes that are translated into oncoproteins. Many different labs have already demonstrated that these MLL fusion proteins have the capability to instruct hematopoietic stem/precursor cells to convert into a preleukemic state, which finally leads to the onset of leukemia in experimental model systems.Here we have focused on the identification of MLL fusion partners by using the genomic DNA of acute leukemia patients. After initial screening using for example split signal FISH experiments (as an example for technologies to identify MLL rearrangements), genomic DNA from leukemia patients is analyzed by long-distance-inverse (LDI)-PCR. LDI-PCR is based on the hydrolysis of patient DNA using distinct combinations of restriction enzymes, self-ligation of the resulting DNA fragments and a subsequent PCR reaction using a specific set of oligonucleotides. This strategy allows in principle any investigator to identify known and unknown MLL fusion partner genes. Furthermore, the genomic fusion site in MLL rearrangements represent a unique and reliable molecular marker that allows the tracing of minimal residual disease (MRD) in these patients before, during, and after therapy.","['Meyer, Claus', 'Marschalek, Rolf']","['Meyer C', 'Marschalek R']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, JGW-University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/05/20 09:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-418-6_5 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;538:71-83. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-418-6_5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on the disease and the regimen, MLL-rearranged leukemias may be associated with inferior prognosis, and MLL rearrangements with some of the more than 60 known MLL-partner genes confer especially adverse effects as response to treatment (Blood 108:441-451, 2006). MLL rearrangements are usually evident as overt balanced chromosomal translocations by conventional cytogenetic analysis but up to one-third are cryptic rearrangements and occur in leukemias with del(11)(q23), a normal karyotype, or trisomy 11, the latter two of which sometimes are associated with partial tandem duplications of MLL itself (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97:2814-2819, 2000; Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:3899-3902, 1997). In addition, subsets of MLL rearrangements are complex at a cytogenetic level and/or molecular level, and fuse MLL with two different partner genes. Rapid and accurate methods to identify and characterize genomic breakpoint junctions and fusion transcripts resulting from the many types of MLL rearrangements are essential for risk group stratification, treatment protocol assignments, new partner gene discovery, understanding leukemia etiology and pathogenesis, and elucidating the impact of less common MLL-partner genes on biology and prognosis. Due to the vast heterogeneity in partner genes, typical gene-specific PCR based methods are not practical, especially when cytogenetics are normal or do not suggest involvement of a known partner gene of MLL. We have advanced seven different panhandle PCR based methods for cloning 5'-MLL-partner gene-3' and 5'-partner gene-MLL-3' genomic breakpoint junctions and identifying 5'-MLL-partner gene-3' fusion transcripts, all of which employ a stem-loop template shaped schematically like a pan with a handle and amplify the template without knowledge of the unknown partner sequence using primers all derived from MLL alone.","['Robinson, Blaine W', 'Felix, Carolyn A']","['Robinson BW', 'Felix CA']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/genetics', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular/*methods', 'Exons/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/05/20 09:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-418-6_6 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;538:85-114. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-418-6_6.,,,,"['CA77683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In essence, DNA from a cancer specimen (test DNA) labeled with the fluorescence reporter molecule (or fluorochrome) is hybridized to a target genome in the presence of a differentially labeled control DNA (reference DNA). The two DNA populations compete for hybridization sites on normal metaphase chromosomes, so that the resulting fluorescence ratio is a reflection of the copy number change in the test sample. The copy number changes are mapped to their position on the chromosome template. Over recent years, the chromosomal template has been largely superseded by microarray formats (aCGH), in which changes in copy number can be mapped to the genome sequence at a high resolution. This advance allows the genome to be studied at an unbridled resolution and at a high-throughput, whilst posing several technical, statistical and interpretive challenges. It is the aim of this chapter to introduce the fundamental concepts of aCGH and to provide an overview of the steps involved in a successful aCGH processing.

Autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) and the approval of two new classes of drugs, immunomodulators and proteosome inhibitors, have resulted in improved response rates and increased overall survivals. Thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide have been combined with corticosteroids, alkylators and anthracyclines in front-line MM treatment. Phase 2 and preliminary phase 3 studies have reported very high response rates and complete response rates formerly seen only with SCT. When patients with MM who have received these new drugs then proceed to transplant, major response rates are further increased. Owing to limited follow-up, it is unclear whether these higher response rates translate into increased survival. Despite these improvements, the disease remains incurable for all but a small fraction of patients. Allogeneic SCT is potentially curative, due in part to a graft-versus-myeloma effect but is limited by mortality. Mortality can be reduced through the use of lower intensity conditioning regimens but this comes at a cost of higher rates of disease progression and relapse. Strategies to improve outcomes of allogeneic transplants include more intensive, yet non-myeloablative conditioning regimens, tandem transplants, peripheral blood cells, graft engineering, post-transplant maintenance and targeted conditioning therapies.","['Bensinger, W I']",['Bensinger WI'],"['Division of Oncology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. wbensing@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090129,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Myeloablative Agonists/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Protease Inhibitors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Reoperation', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/04/09 09:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008396 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.396 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Mar;23(3):442-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.396.

We describe EphA1 expression in 6 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, 18 controls and 125 CRC specimens. In addition, a well-characterised cohort of 53 paired normal colon and CRCs was also assessed. Expression of EphA1 mRNA was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and correlated with protein expression by flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Significant upregulation (2- to 10-fold) of EphA1 was seen in over 50% of cases (P=0.005) whereas many of the remainder showed downregulation of EphA1. Intriguingly, EphA1 over-expression was more prevalent in stage II compared to stage III CRCs (P=0.02). Low EphA1 expression significantly correlated with poor survival (P=0.02). Epigenetic silencing appeared to explain the loss of EphA1 expression as methylation of the EphA1 CpG island strongly correlated with low EphA1 expression (P<0.01). Furthermore, EphA1 re-expression could be induced by treatment with demethylating agents. Our findings identify EphA1 as a potential prognostic marker in CRC. Although therapies targeting high EphA1 expression seem plausible in CRC, the loss of expression in advanced disease suggests a potential risk that targeted therapy, by selecting for loss of expression, might contribute to disease progression.","['Herath, N I', 'Doecke, J', 'Spanevello, M D', 'Leggett, B A', 'Boyd, A W']","['Herath NI', 'Doecke J', 'Spanevello MD', 'Leggett BA', 'Boyd AW']","['Leukaemia Foundation Research Laboratory, The Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.

RECENT FINDINGS: Improvements in nonculture-based fungal diagnostics, early implementation of pulmonary high resolution, or spiral computed tomography scanning and a recent expansion of the antifungal armamentarium have greatly improved the outcome of immunocompromised patients with invasive aspergillosis. However, the field is changing: new pathogens (such as Zygomycetes) are emerging, and novel risk groups (ICU patients in particular) are being identified. SUMMARY: Galactomannan antigen detection is a valuable tool for evaluating patients at risk for invasive aspergillosis (as a screening assay on serum samples from neutropenic patients or as a confirmatory assay on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples, in general), but should be used in conjunction with modern imaging techniques. beta-D-Glucan and PCR assays are still investigational. Voriconazole is the drug of choice for invasive aspergillosis, whereas liposomal amphotericin B at 3 mg/kg per day is the preferred alternative in case of contraindication, drug-related side-effects, or intolerance. Whenever possible, optimal antifungal therapy should be complemented by surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. The added value of combination therapy is still unproven. Therapeutic drug monitoring of mold-active azoles should be implemented in order to minimize toxicity and maximize efficacy. Lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B, and to a lesser extent voriconazole, are the drugs of choice for non-Aspergillus related fungal pneumonia. Although active in prophylaxis, the efficacy of posaconazole in confirmed infections remains controversial.","['Maertens, Johan', 'Meersseman, Wouter', 'Van Bleyenbergh, Pascal']","['Maertens J', 'Meersseman W', 'Van Bleyenbergh P']","['Department of Hematology, Acute Leukemia and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, University Hospitals Leuven, Campus Gasthuisberg, Herestraat 49, Leuven, Belgium. johan.maertens@uz.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Current opinion in infectious diseases,8809878,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Fungi/isolation & purification', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Mannans/blood', 'Mycoses/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Pneumonia/diagnosis/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Pulmonary Aspergillosis/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Radiography, Thoracic/methods', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/04/21 09:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/QCO.0b013e328328cfff [doi]', '00001432-200904000-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2009 Apr;22(2):183-90. doi: 10.1097/QCO.0b013e328328cfff.,,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although imatinib binds tightly to the Abl kinase domain, its affinity for the closely related kinase domain of c-Src is at least 2,000-fold lower. Imatinib recognition requires a specific inactive conformation of the kinase domain, in which a conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif is flipped with respect to the active conformation. The inability of c-Src to readily adopt this flipped DFG conformation was thought to underlie the selectivity of imatinib for Abl over c-Src. Here, we present a series of inhibitors (DSA compounds) that are based on the core scaffold of imatinib but which bind with equally high potency to c-Src and Abl. The DSA compounds bind to c-Src in the DFG-flipped conformation, as confirmed by crystal structures and kinetic analysis. The origin of the high affinity of these compounds for c-Src is suggested by the fact that they also inhibit clinically relevant Abl variants bearing mutations in a structural element, the P-loop, that normally interacts with the phosphate groups of ATP but is folded over a substructure of imatinib in Abl. Importantly, several of the DSA compounds block the growth of Ba/F3 cells harboring imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants, including the Thr315Ile ""gatekeeper"" mutation, but do not suppress the growth of parental Ba/F3 cells.","['Seeliger, Markus A', 'Ranjitkar, Pratistha', 'Kasap, Corynn', 'Shan, Yibing', 'Shaw, David E', 'Shah, Neil P', 'Kuriyan, John', 'Maly, Dustin J']","['Seeliger MA', 'Ranjitkar P', 'Kasap C', 'Shan Y', 'Shaw DE', 'Shah NP', 'Kuriyan J', 'Maly DJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkely, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090310,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.23 (CSK protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Piperazines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'src-Family Kinases']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/05/14 09:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-3953 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3953 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Mar 15;69(6):2384-92. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3953.

In a prospective study, we validated this relationship in patients enrolled on a trial of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer. METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocol 89803 randomized 1,264 stage III colon cancer patients to receive weekly bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or weekly bolus irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin (IFL). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); disease-free survival was a secondary endpoint. Expression of p27 and DNA mismatch repair proteins were determined by immunohistochemistry in primary tumor and normal tissue from paraffin blocks. Data were analyzed using log-rank test. RESULTS: Of 601 tumors analyzed, 207 (34.4%) showed p27 loss, 377 (62.8%) retained p27, and 17 (2.8%) were indeterminate. Patients with p27-negative tumors showed reduced OS [5-year OS 66%: 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.59-0.72 versus 75%: 95% CI, 0.70-0.79; log-rank P = 0.021]. This relationship was not influenced by treatment arm. Combination of p27 status with mismatch repair status, however, identified a small subset of patients that may benefit from IFL (n = 36; 5-year disease-free survival 81%: 95% CI, 0.64-0.98 versus 47%: 95% CI, 0.21-0.72; log-rank P = 0.042; 5-year OS 81%: 95% CI, 0.64-0.98 versus 60%: 95% CI, 0.35-0.85; log-rank P = 0.128). CONCLUSIONS: Loss of p27 is associated with reduced survival in stage III colon cancer but by itself does not indicate a significant difference in outcome between patients treated IFL or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin.","['Bertagnolli, Monica M', 'Warren, Robert S', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Mueller, Elke', 'Compton, Carolyn C', 'Redston, Mark', 'Hall, Margaret', 'Hahn, Hejin P', 'Jewell, Scott D', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Goldberg, Richard M', 'Saltz, Leonard B', 'Loda, Massimo']","['Bertagnolli MM', 'Warren RS', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Mueller E', 'Compton CC', 'Redston M', 'Hall M', 'Hahn HP', 'Jewell SD', 'Mayer RJ', 'Goldberg RM', 'Saltz LB', 'Loda M']","[""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cDNA of 300 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and 82 human leukemic cell lines was screened for aberrations in the linker and RING finger domain of CBL. The oncogenic potential of identified mutants was evaluated in hematopoietic cells. RESULTS: We identified 3 of 279 AML/MDS patients expressing CBL exon 8/9 deletion mutants. Three of four cases at diagnosis expressed deleted transcripts missing exon 8 or exon 8/9. In remission samples a weak or no expression of mutant CBL was detected. No aberrations were found in normal hematopoietic tissues. One of 116 sequenced AML/MDS cases carried a R420G missense mutation. All AML/MDS patients with identified CBL mutants belonged to the core binding factor and 11q deletion AML subtypes. Functionally, CBL negatively regulated FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) activity and interacted with human FLT3 via the autophosphorylation sites Y589 and Y599 and colocalized in vivo. Expression of CBLDeltaexon8 and CBLDeltaexon8+9 in FLT3-WT-Ba/F3 cells induced growth factor-independent proliferation associated with autophosphorylation of FLT3 and activated the downstream targets signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and protein kinase B (AKT). FLT3 ligand-dependent hyperproliferation of CBL mutant cells could be abrogated by treatment with the FLT3 PTK inhibitor PKC412 (midostaurin). CONCLUSION: CBL exon8/9 mutants occur in genetically defined AML/MDS subtypes and transform hematopoietic cells by constitutively activating the FLT3 pathway. This phenotype resembles the one of mutated RTKs and suggests that CBL mutant AML patients might benefit from treatment with FLT3 PTK inhibitors.","['Reindl, Carola', 'Quentmeier, Hilmar', 'Petropoulos, Konstantin', 'Greif, Philipp A', 'Benthaus, Tobias', 'Argiropoulos, Bob', 'Mellert, Gudrun', 'Vempati, Sridhar', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Buske, Christian', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Humphries, Keith R', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Reindl C', 'Quentmeier H', 'Petropoulos K', 'Greif PA', 'Benthaus T', 'Argiropoulos B', 'Mellert G', 'Vempati S', 'Duyster J', 'Buske C', 'Bohlander SK', 'Humphries KR', 'Hiddemann W', 'Spiekermann K']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Helmholtz Center Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090310,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Core Binding Factors/genetics', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-1325 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1325 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Apr 1;15(7):2238-47. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1325.

With increasing use, resistance to rituximab is a continuing concern, but CD20 mutation as a cause of resistance has not previously been reported. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Freshly collected lymphoma cells from 50 patients with previously untreated or relapsed/resistant non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas (diffuse large B cell, n = 22; follicular, n = 7; mucosa associated lymphoid tissue, n = 16; chronic lymphocytic leukemia, n = 2; small lymphocytic lymphoma, n = 1; lymphoplasmacytic, n = 1; mantle cell lymphoma, n = 1) were assessed for CD20 expression by flow cytometry, and CD20 gene sequencing was done on extracted DNA. RESULTS: CD20 mutations were found in 11 (22.0%) of 50 patients and could be grouped as C-terminal deletion (8.0%), early termination (10.0%), and extracellular domain (2.0%) or transmembrane domain (2.0%) mutations. The mean fluorescence intensity of CD20 on fresh lymphoma cells was significantly lower for the C-terminal deletion mutation [3.26; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.09-6.89] compared with wild type (30.8; 95% CI, 22.4-39.2; P < 0.05). In contrast, early termination mutations did not show significant differences in CD20 expression compared with wild type (19.5; 95% CI, 10.7-28.4; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that C-terminal deletion mutations of CD20 may be related to relapse/resistance after rituximab therapy. These mutations should be examined in patients showing progression of disease after partial remission.","['Terui, Yasuhito', 'Mishima, Yuji', 'Sugimura, Natsuhiko', 'Kojima, Kiyotsugu', 'Sakurai, Takuma', 'Mishima, Yuko', 'Kuniyoshi, Ryoko', 'Taniyama, Akiko', 'Yokoyama, Masahiro', 'Sakajiri, Sakura', 'Takeuchi, Kengo', 'Watanabe, Chie', 'Takahashi, Shunji', 'Ito, Yoshinori', 'Hatake, Kiyohiko']","['Terui Y', 'Mishima Y', 'Sugimura N', 'Kojima K', 'Sakurai T', 'Mishima Y', 'Kuniyoshi R', 'Taniyama A', 'Yokoyama M', 'Sakajiri S', 'Takeuchi K', 'Watanabe C', 'Takahashi S', 'Ito Y', 'Hatake K']","['Departments of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Division of Clinical Chemotherapy, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090310,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rituximab', '*Sequence Deletion']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-1403 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1403 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Apr 1;15(7):2523-30. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1403.

For dasatinib, an inhibitor of SCR/BCR-ABL kinases, in vivo interactions with P-gp and ABCG2 are not fully established yet. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used Abcb1a/1b(-/-), Abcg2(-/-), and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2(-/-) mice to establish the roles of P-gp and ABCG2 in the pharmacokinetics and brain accumulation of dasatinib. RESULTS: We found that oral uptake of dasatinib is limited by P-gp. Furthermore, relative brain accumulation, 6 hours after administration, was not affected by Abcg2 deficiency, but absence of P-gp resulted in a 3.6-fold increase after oral and 4.8-fold higher accumulation after i.p. administration. Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2(-/-) mice had the most pronounced increase in relative brain accumulation, which was 13.2-fold higher after oral and 22.7-fold increased after i.p. administration. Moreover, coadministration to wild-type mice of dasatinib with the dual P-gp and ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar resulted in a similar dasatinib brain accumulation as observed for Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: Brain accumulation of dasatinib is primarily restricted by P-gp, but Abcg2 can partly take over this protective function at the blood-brain barrier. Consequently, when both transporters are absent or inhibited, brain uptake of dasatinib is highly increased. These findings might be clinically relevant for patients with central nervous system Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia, as coadministration of an inhibitor of P-gp and ABCG2 with dasatinib might result in better therapeutic responses in these patients.","['Lagas, Jurjen S', 'van Waterschoot, Robert A B', 'van Tilburg, Vicky A C J', 'Hillebrand, Michel J', 'Lankheet, Nienke', 'Rosing, Hilde', 'Beijnen, Jos H', 'Schinkel, Alfred H']","['Lagas JS', 'van Waterschoot RA', 'van Tilburg VA', 'Hillebrand MJ', 'Lankheet N', 'Rosing H', 'Beijnen JH', 'Schinkel AH']","['Division of Molecular Biology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090310,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Abcg2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 7.6.2.2 (Abcb1b protein, mouse)', 'N488540F94 (Elacridar)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Acridines/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Dasatinib', 'Dogs', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/10/23 06:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-2253 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2253 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Apr 1;15(7):2344-51. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2253.

Concerns have been identified and still need to be resolved including the optimal dose, frequency, and monitoring parameters. OBJECTIVE: We completed a study to determine if empiric use of gentamicin 7 mg/kg once daily in pediatric patients admitted with febrile neutropenia provided extrapolated peaks and drug-free intervals consistent with suggested preferred levels. DESIGN: A review of the patient's chart was completed following their discharge from the hospital between September 2006 and October 2007. SETTING: A community hospital. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 17 encounters for pediatric patients admitted for febrile neutropenia that received once daily gentamicin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Extrapolated peak levels and drug-free intervals. RESULTS: There were seven patients with a total of 17 encounters. The mean extrapolated peak level was 16.9 mg/L. The mean drug-free interval was 15.7 h. Both target peak and drug-free interval were obtained for two encounters (12%), which was one patient. CONCLUSION: Gentamicin 7 mg/kg/dose once daily does not provide preferred levels for all pediatric febrile neutropenic patients. Further investigation is required to ensure that once daily gentamicin regimens for pediatric oncology patients provide adequate clinical success.","['Newby, Brandi', 'Prevost, Derek', 'Lotocka-Reysner, Hanna']","['Newby B', 'Prevost D', 'Lotocka-Reysner H']","['Pharmacy Department, Surrey Memorial Hospital, 13750 96th Avenue, Surrey, BC V3V 1Z2, Canada. brandi.newby@fraserhealth.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Gentamicins)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Infective Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Candidiasis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Gentamicins/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Klebsiella Infections/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Pilot Projects']",2009/03/12 09:00,2010/02/20 06:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1078155209102339 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155209102339 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2009 Dec;15(4):211-6. doi: 10.1177/1078155209102339.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To provide a comprehensive review of prosimian neoplasia, a retrospective evaluation of neoplasia in a large captive prosimian colony and an extensive literature review were performed. Primates that belong to the Order Primata, Suborder Prosimii with histologic evidence of neoplasia were included. One hundred twenty-three cases of spontaneous neoplasia were identified in 101 prosimians from the Duke Lemur Center, and 124 cases were reported in 116 prosimians in the literature. Overall, this review compiled a total of 247 neoplasms in 217 prosimians. Of the 217 affected animals, 88 of 217 were males (41%), 100 of 217 were females (46%), and sex was not reported in 29 of 217 (13%). Ages ranged from 2 days to 36 years.

While bortezomib induces several caspases, NPI-0052 activates predominantly caspase-8-dependent pathway. We studied the effect of bortezomib (10 nM) on DNA synthesis and apoptosis in human acute myeloid cell lines KASUMI-1, ML-1, ML-2 and CTV-1 cells. Bortezomib was potent inhibitor of DNA synthesis in all four types of leukemia cells and induced apoptosis in KASUMI-1, ML-2 and CTV-1 cells but not in ML-1 cells. Other research groups showed that histone deacetylase inhibitors (valproic acid or benzamide derivative MS-275) in combination with NPI-0052 or PR-171 induced greater levels of acute leukemia cell death than in combination with bortezomib. Proteasome inhibition as monotherapy and its combination with many conventional therapies as novel treatment strategies in leukemia are promising. Malignant cells are more sensitive to this treatment than normal hematopoietic cells.","['Fuchs, Ota', 'Provaznikova, Dana', 'Marinov, Iuri', 'Kuzelova, Katerina', 'Spicka, Ivan']","['Fuchs O', 'Provaznikova D', 'Marinov I', 'Kuzelova K', 'Spicka I']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Department of Cell Physiology, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic.

Epigenetics involves heritable changes in the physical and biochemical state of chromatin, which have no effect on DNA sequences; therefore, changes in the nuclear radial arrangement of chromosomes can also be considered epigenetic events. Nuclear radial distributions of select genomic regions have been studied in many tumour cells and are not influenced by aberrations in chromosome number. On the other hand, genes involved in translocations take up new positions midway between the original coding sequences. The differentiation of leukaemia cells with clinically used agents is often accompanied by nuclear repositioning of tumour-related genes. However, the nuclear rearrangement is cell-type specific and not always associated with changes in the transcriptional activity. Similarly, cell type-specific chromatin structure is observed in tumour cells treated with select cytostatics and inhibitors of epigenetic processes, which have significant influences on the histone code. Chromatin structure and histone modifications were also affected by gamma radiation in leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and solid tumour cells. Interestingly, gamma radiation induced loci proximity, which has been suggested to increase the probability of exchange aberrations typically associated with tumour progression.","['Bartova, Eva', 'Krejci, Jana', 'Hajek, Roman', 'Harnicarova, Andrea', 'Kozubek, Stanislav']","['Bartova E', 'Krejci J', 'Hajek R', 'Harnicarova A', 'Kozubek S']","['Institute of Biophysics Academy of Science of the Czech Republic, Kralovopolska 135, 61265 Brno, Czech Republic. bartova@ibp.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets,Cardiovascular & hematological disorders drug targets,101269160,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/drug effects/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/therapy', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/03/12 09:00,2009/05/16 09:00,['2009/03/12 09:00'],"['2009/03/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2174/187152909787581336 [doi]'],ppublish,Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets. 2009 Mar;9(1):51-61. doi: 10.2174/187152909787581336.,,140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common cause of resistance is the selection of leukemic clones mutated in ABL kinase domain due to amino acid substitutions with prevention of appropriate binding of the drug. Amplification and over-expression of BCR-ABL, acquired cytogenetic aberrations and modulation of drug efflux or influx transporters have been reported.

The mutations were detected by the newly developed real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) with TaqMan MGB probes and followed by the sequencing analysis. DNA samples were from 343 Chinese adults with JAK2V617F mutation-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (cMPDs). Reference curves were obtained using cloned fragments of MPL containing either the wild-type or MPL W515L or MPL W515K mutated sequence; the predicted sensitivity level was at least 0.5%(0.1-0.5%) for MPL W515L and 0.5%(0.2-0.5%) for MPL W515K mutant allele in a wild-type background. The detection rates of MPL W515 mutations were 3.5% in 199 ET patients (7/199), 12.5% in 24 PMF patients (3/24) and 5.6% in 36 cMPD-unclassed patients (2/36), respectively. No MPL W515 mutations were detected in 32 polycythemia vera (PV) patients, 40 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients, 12 hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) patients and 29 normal volunteers. The mean calculated burden of MPL mutant alleles using RQ-PCR for MPL W515L/K was 24.88 +/- 14.80% (range, 1.10-56.32%). MPL W515L/K patients presented lower haemoglobin levels, compared with the patients with JAK2V617F mutation-positive cMPDs (p < 0.01). The results demonstrated that RQ-PCR was a reliable and sensitive method for large-scale screening of the MPL W515L/K mutation in patients suspected to have a cMPD. It can also provide a quantitative estimate of mutant allele burden that might be useful for both patient prognosis and monitoring response to therapy.","['Ruan, Guo-Rui', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Li, Ling-Di', 'Niu, Ji-Hong', 'Li, Jin-Lan', 'Xie, Min', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Liu, Yan-Rong', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Chen, Shan-Shan']","['Ruan GR', 'Jiang B', 'Li LD', 'Niu JH', 'Li JL', 'Xie M', 'Qin YZ', 'Liu YR', 'Huang XJ', 'Chen SS']","[""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, 11 Xi-Zhi-Men South Street, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Asians/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Rate']",2009/03/11 09:00,2010/04/16 06:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.899 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2010 Mar;28(1):33-9. doi: 10.1002/hon.899.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ultrastructural characteristics of blasts of the monocytic series were analyzed in 72 M5 patients by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in terms of their content of typical monoblasts, atypical monoblasts, atypical promonocytes, and typical promonocytes in bone-marrow aspirates. Four kinds of monocytic blasts were identified by cell size and shape, nuclear profile, nucleocytoplasmic ratio, heterochromatin content, nucleolus, granules, vesicles, and Golgi apparatus. Their characteristics of remission rate, cytochemistry, immunophenotype, and cytogenetics were also investigated. The data obtained permitted M5 patients to be divided into monoblast and promonocyte types.

These compounds were evaluated for general toxicity toward the brine shrimp species Artemia franciscana, cytotoxicity toward human tumour cells, larvicidal activity toward the dengue fever mosquito vector Aedes aegypti, haemolytic activity in mouse erythrocytes and antimalarial activity against the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited the greatest cytotoxicity against all the tumor cells tested (IC50 = 5-27 microg/L) and against multidrug-resistant P. falciparum K1 strain (IC50 = 1.0-4.0 g/L) and 3 was only cytotoxic toward the leukaemia HL-60 strain (IC50 = 11.8 microg/L). Quassinoids 1 and 2 (LC50 = 3.2-4.4 mg/L) displayed greater lethality than derivative 4 (LC50 = 75.0 mg/L) toward A. aegypti larvae, while derivative 3 was inactive. These results suggest a novel application for these natural quassinoids as larvicides. The toxicity toward A. franciscana could be correlated with the activity in several biological models, a finding that is in agreement with the literature. Importantly, none of the studied compounds exhibited in vitro haemolytic activity, suggesting specificity of the observed cytotoxic effects. This study reveals the biological potential of quassinoids 1 and 2 and to a lesser extent their semi-synthetic derivatives for their in vitro antimalarial and cytotoxic activities.","['Silva, Ellen C C', 'Cavalcanti, Bruno C', 'Amorim, Rodrigo C N', 'Lucena, Jorcilene F', 'Quadros, Dulcimar S', 'Tadei, Wanderli P', 'Montenegro, Raquel C', 'Costa-Lotufo, Leticia V', 'Pessoa, Claudia', 'Moraes, Manoel O', 'Nunomura, Rita C S', 'Nunomura, Sergio M', 'Melo, Marcia R S', 'Andrade-Neto, Valter F de', 'Silva, Luiz Francisco R', 'Vieira, Pedro Paulo R', 'Pohlit, Adrian M']","['Silva EC', 'Cavalcanti BC', 'Amorim RC', 'Lucena JF', 'Quadros DS', 'Tadei WP', 'Montenegro RC', 'Costa-Lotufo LV', 'Pessoa C', 'Moraes MO', 'Nunomura RC', 'Nunomura SM', 'Melo MR', 'Andrade-Neto VF', 'Silva LF', 'Vieira PP', 'Pohlit AM']","['Laboratorio de Principios Ativos da Amazonia, Coordenacao de Pesquisas em Produtos Naturais, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Avenida Andre Araujo 2936, 69060-001Manaus, AM, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Brazil,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,7502619,"['0 (Quassins)', '0 (neosergeolide)', '53663-03-9 (isobrucein B)']",IM,"['Aedes/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Artemia/drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Hemolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Mice', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Plasmodium falciparum/drug effects', 'Quassins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Simaroubaceae/*chemistry']",2009/03/11 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['S0074-02762009000100008 [pii]', '10.1590/s0074-02762009000100008 [doi]']",ppublish,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz. 2009 Feb;104(1):48-56. doi: 10.1590/s0074-02762009000100008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we have reported alterations in ABH antigens on the red blood cells of 55% of patients with myeloid malignancies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms of this loss, we assessed ABO allelic expression in 21 patients with ABH antigen loss previously identified by flow cytometric analysis as well as an additional 7 patients detected with ABH antigen changes by serology. When assessing ABO mRNA allelic expression, 6/12 (50%) patients with ABH antigen loss detected by flow cytometry and 5/7 (71%) of the patients with ABH antigen loss detected by serology had a corresponding ABO mRNA allelic loss of expression. We examined the ABO locus for copy number and DNA methylation alterations in 21 patients, 11 with loss of expression of one or both ABO alleles, and 10 patients with no detectable allelic loss of ABO mRNA expression. No loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the ABO locus was observed in these patients. However in 8/11 (73%) patients with loss of ABO allelic expression, the ABO promoter was methylated compared with 2/10 (20%) of patients with no ABO allelic expression loss (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have found that loss of ABH antigens in patients with hematological malignancies is associated with a corresponding loss of ABO allelic expression in a significant proportion of patients. Loss of ABO allelic expression was strongly associated with DNA methylation of the ABO promoter.","['Bianco-Miotto, Tina', 'Hussey, Damian J', 'Day, Tanya K', ""O'Keefe, Denise S"", 'Dobrovic, Alexander']","['Bianco-Miotto T', 'Hussey DJ', 'Day TK', ""O'Keefe DS"", 'Dobrovic A']","['Department of Haematology-Oncology and University of Adelaide, Discipline of Medicine, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woodville, South Australia, Australia. tina.bianco-miotto@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090310,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*genetics/immunology', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens', 'Leukemia/blood/*genetics', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2009/03/11 09:00,2009/06/16 09:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2008/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0004788 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(3):e4788. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004788.

This prospective study investigated adjuvant chemotherapy containing FU and irinotecan in patients with MMR deficient (MMR-D) colon cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B 89803 randomly assigned 1,264 patients with stage III colon cancer to postoperative weekly bolus FU/leucovorin (LV) or weekly bolus irinotecan, FU, and LV (IFL). The primary end point was overall survival; disease-free survival (DFS) was a secondary end point. Tumor expression of the MMR proteins, MLH1 and MSH2, was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). DNA microsatellite instability was also assessed using a panel of mono- and dinucleotide markers. Tumors with MMR defects were those demonstrating loss of MMR protein expression (MMR-D) and/or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) genotype. RESULTS: Of 723 tumor cases examined by genotyping and IHC, 96 (13.3%) were MMR-D/MSI-H. Genotyping results were consistent with IHC in 702 cases (97.1%). IFL-treated patients with MMR-D/MSI-H tumors showed improved 5-year DFS as compared with those with mismatch repair intact tumors (0.76; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.88 v 0.59; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.64; P = .03). This relationship was not observed among patients treated with FU/LV. A trend toward longer DFS was observed in IFL-treated patients with MMR-D/MSI-H tumors as compared with those receiving FU/LV (0.57; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.71 v 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.88; P = .07; hazard ratio interaction between tumor status and treatment, 0.51; likelihood ratio P = .117). CONCLUSION: Loss of tumor MMR function may predict improved outcome in patients treated with the IFL regimen as compared with those receiving FU/LV.","['Bertagnolli, Monica M', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Compton, Carolyn C', 'Hahn, Hejin P', 'Hall, Margaret', 'Damas, Beatrice', 'Jewell, Scott D', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Goldberg, Richard M', 'Saltz, Leonard B', 'Warren, Robert S', 'Redston, Mark']","['Bertagnolli MM', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Compton CC', 'Hahn HP', 'Hall M', 'Damas B', 'Jewell SD', 'Mayer RJ', 'Goldberg RM', 'Saltz LB', 'Warren RS', 'Redston M']","[""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. mbertagnolli@partners.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090309,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Camptothecin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Instability', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/11 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.18.2071 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.18.2071 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 10;27(11):1814-21. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.18.2071.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a 25-month period, 203 pediatric patients who had newly placed Broviac-Hickman CVCs were randomly assigned to standard flushing with heparin solution or to experimental flushing with normal saline via a positive-pressure cap. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-one complications were recorded among 75,249 CVC-days (2.94 per 1,000 CVC-days). A higher incidence of CVC occlusion (83 v 41 episodes; P = .0002) and bacteremia (24 v 9; P = .01) were found in the experimental arm. The cumulative probability of developing at least one CVC complication was higher in the experimental arm than in the standard arm (65.1% [95% CI, 55% to 75%] v 43.8% [95% CI, 34% to 54%], respectively; P = .01). No difference was found in either the cause or the frequency of premature removal of CVCs between the two study arms. After a median follow-up of 360 days (range, 4 to 1,073), CVC survival was similar: 77% (95% CI, 66% to 84%) for the experimental arm and 69% (95% CI, 53% to 80%) for the standard arm (P = .7). The factors associated with the occurrence of CVC complication were a diagnosis of leukemia/lymphoma, double-lumen CVC, and experimental flushing. The only factor significantly associated with premature removal of a CVC was a diagnosis of leukemia/lymphoma (hazard rate, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.7). CONCLUSION: An increased complication rate was found with normal saline flushing, but additional investigation is warranted to clarify whether it is related to saline use or to once-a-week flushing.","['Cesaro, Simone', 'Tridello, Gloria', 'Cavaliere, Mara', 'Magagna, Laura', 'Gavin, Patrizia', 'Cusinato, Riccardo', 'Zadra, Nicola', 'Franco Zanon, Giovanni', 'Zanesco, Luigi', 'Carli, Modesto']","['Cesaro S', 'Tridello G', 'Cavaliere M', 'Magagna L', 'Gavin P', 'Cusinato R', 'Zadra N', 'Franco Zanon G', 'Zanesco L', 'Carli M']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Via Giustiniani 3, Padova, Italy 35128; simone.cesaro@unipd.it.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090309,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anticoagulants/*administration & dosage', 'Catheter-Related Infections/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Catheters, Indwelling/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Heparin/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sodium Chloride/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Venous Thrombosis/etiology/*prevention & control']",2009/03/11 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.19.4860 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.19.4860 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 20;27(12):2059-65. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.19.4860.

Because the repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa) was originally identified as an axon repellent in the visual system, diverse functions in the developing and adult central nervous system have been ascribed to it. RGMa binding to its receptor neogenin induces RhoA activation, leading to inhibitory/repulsive behavior and collapse of the neuronal growth cone. However, the precise mechanisms that regulate RhoA activation are poorly understood. In this study, we show that Unc5B, a member of the netrin receptor family, interacts with neogenin as a coreceptor for RGMa. Moreover, leukemia-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG) associates with Unc5B to transduce the RhoA signal. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is involved in RGMa-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of LARG as well as RhoA activation. These findings uncover the molecular basis for diverse functions mediated by RGMa.","['Hata, Katsuhiko', 'Kaibuchi, Kozo', 'Inagaki, Shinobu', 'Yamashita, Toshihide']","['Hata K', 'Kaibuchi K', 'Inagaki S', 'Yamashita T']","['Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan. hata0731@molneu.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (ARHGEF12 protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Netrin Receptors)', '0 (RGMA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (UNC5B protein, human)', '0 (neogenin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Growth Cones/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nervous System/*embryology/growth & development/metabolism', 'Netrin Receptors', 'Neurogenesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2009/03/11 09:00,2009/04/21 09:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [medline]']","['jcb.200807029 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200807029 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2009 Mar 9;184(5):737-50. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200807029.,,,,,PMC2686409,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Targeted analysis using data from a prospective longitudinal study. SETTING: A cancer care facility in southeastern Ontario, Canada. SAMPLE: 440 patients, aged 65 years and older, seeking consultation for cancer treatment at a regional cancer clinic for lymphoma or leukemia or lung, breast, genitourinary, head or neck, gastrointestinal, or skin cancers. METHODS: Self-report questionnaires were mailed to consenting participants and completed at baseline and three and six months after consultation for cancer treatment. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Participants rated fatigue and physical activity and reported comorbidities and personal demographic characteristics. Clinical measures of disease and treatment factors were obtained through chart abstraction. FINDINGS: Fatigue was the most prevalent symptom reported. Higher fatigue was associated with lower physical activity levels. Physical activity level significantly predicted fatigue level, regardless of age. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity level is a modifiable factor significantly predicting cancer-related fatigue at three and six months following consultation for cancer treatment. The results suggest that physical activity may reduce fatigue in older patients with cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Physical activity interventions should be developed and tested in older patients with cancer.","['Luctkar-Flude, Marian', 'Groll, Dianne', 'Woodend, Kirsten', 'Tranmer, Joan']","['Luctkar-Flude M', 'Groll D', 'Woodend K', 'Tranmer J']","[""School of Nursing, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada. luctkarm@kgh.kari.net""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Attitude to Health', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Comorbidity', '*Exercise/physiology/psychology', 'Fatigue/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control/psychology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Nursing Methodology Research', 'Ontario', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2009/03/11 09:00,2009/06/26 09:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [medline]']","['23H486083G868832 [pii]', '10.1188/09.ONF.194-202 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2009 Mar;36(2):194-202. doi: 10.1188/09.ONF.194-202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The consequence of a defect in the Ca2+ signaling pathway for lymphocyte activation is characterized by an impaired NFAT activation and transcription of cytokines, chemokines and many other NFAT target genes whose transcription is essential for productive immune defense.

This review summarizes the current knowledge of the effects of the HTLV-1 proteins Tax, p13 and p12 on cell death and survival pathways. Tax, the major oncogenic determinant of HTLV-1, enhances cell survival through its effects on the NF-kappaB, CREB and AKT pathways and on the tumor suppressors p53 and Rb. p13 is targeted to the inner mitochondrial membrane and sensitizes cells to the Fas/ceramide apoptotic pathway and reactive oxygen species-mediated cell death. p12 enhances release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and therefore may influence calcium-dependent apoptotic signals, including opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. The long-term fate of HTLV-1-infected cells (apoptosis, survival, transformation) may therefore depend on the balance of the effects of Tax, p13 and p12 on cell death pathways.","['Saggioro, Daniela', 'Silic-Benussi, Micol', 'Biasiotto, Roberta', ""D'Agostino, Donna M"", 'Ciminale, Vincenzo']","['Saggioro D', 'Silic-Benussi M', 'Biasiotto R', ""D'Agostino DM"", 'Ciminale V']","['Molecular Immunology and Oncology Unit, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRRCS, via Gattamelata 64, I-35128 Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090101,Singapore,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed),Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),101612996,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Death/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Homeostasis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Viral Proteins/*physiology']",2009/03/11 09:00,2009/04/08 09:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [medline]']","['3456 [pii]', '10.2741/3456 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed). 2009 Jan 1;14:3338-51. doi: 10.2741/3456.,,137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for p53 can be transformed with either c-myc or with rasV12 alone. Interestingly, transformation by c-myc is efficiently suppressed by co-expression of Stat3alphaC, but Stat3alphaC does not interfere with transformation by the rasV12-oncogene. In contrast, transplantation of bone marrow cells expressing Stat3alphaC induces the formation of a highly aggressive T cell leukemia in mice. The leukemic cells invaded multiple organs including lung, heart, salivary glands, liver and kidney. Interestingly, transplanted mice developed a similar leukemia when the bone marrow cells were transduced with Stat3beta, which is also constitutively active when expressed at significant levels.

We suggest that these proteins could act on chromatin in the vicinity of the bodies. The physical dependence of PML NB structure on the integrity of the surrounding DNA implies a functional connection between the bodies and chromatin. Indeed, some genetic loci are non-randomly associated with PML NBs, indicating that nuclear bodies organize at specific loci, or are able to recruit specific genetic loci to their periphery. Since many of the factors that accumulate in PML NBs and PML-containing structures in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells are known histone methyltransferases, histone deacetylases or DNA methyltransferases, we suggest that PML NBs may have a role as epigenetic regulators. Down-regulation of normal PML protein, observed in a variety of cancers, may impair epigenetic regulation in early tumorigenesis, which ultimately leads to genetic instability and cellular transformation.","['Torok, Dora', 'Ching, Reagan W', 'Bazett-Jones, David P']","['Torok D', 'Ching RW', 'Bazett-Jones DP']","['Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090101,Singapore,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed),Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),101612996,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromatin/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Conformation', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/03/11 09:00,2009/04/08 09:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [medline]']","['3311 [pii]', '10.2741/3311 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed). 2009 Jan 1;14:1325-36. doi: 10.2741/3311.,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the molecular level, the PML protein, and its associated nuclear bodies, play roles in diverse events ranging from mRNA export to DNA repair. PML expression impacts on Akt survival signaling, p53/Mdm2 activity, and cell cycle progression, to name a few. However, there is no discrete set of molecular activities associated with the PML protein that underlie its biochemical and physiological effects.

PML itself is critical for the formation of nuclear bodies (PML bodies) that accumulate in senescent cells rendering them suitable markers for the senescence phenotype. The mechanism of PML-induction during senescence is complex and includes increased PML gene transcription by p53 or transcription factors of the interferon/Jak/Stat pathway. In turn, PML engages both p53 and Rb, although the precise molecular processes are unknown. PML interacts with the DNA-binding domain of p53 facilitating p53 modifications. PML can also interact with Rb and may play a role in Rb-dependent gene silencing during senescence. Recent studies suggest an additional connection between PML and the senescence program. Senescence involves a constitutive activation of the DNA damage response. Intriguingly, proteins that signal DNA damage or help repairing it localize to PML bodies, suggesting that PML may play a role in the DNA damage response during senescence. We think that the discovery of factors acting upstream or downstream PML may help to understand how cells bypass senescence on their way to tumorigenesis. More importantly the PML pathway may eventually lead to novel anti-cancer therapies.","['Bourdeau, Veronique', 'Baudry, David', 'Ferbeyre, Gerardo']","['Bourdeau V', 'Baudry D', 'Ferbeyre G']","['Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, C.P. 6128, Succ.

In this regard, mutual information has been shown to be successful for selecting a set of relevant and nonredundant genes from microarray data. However, information theory offers many more measures such as the f-information measures that may be suitable for selection of genes from microarray gene expression data. This paper presents different f-information measures as the evaluation criteria for gene selection problem. To compute the gene-gene redundancy (respectively, gene-class relevance), these information measures calculate the divergence of the joint distribution of two genes' expression values (respectively, the expression values of a gene and the class labels of samples) from the joint distribution when two genes (respectively, the gene and class label) are considered to be completely independent. The performance of different f-information measures is compared with that of the mutual information based on the predictive accuracy of naive Bayes classifier, K -nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machine. An important finding is that some f-information measures are shown to be effective for selecting relevant and nonredundant genes from microarray data. The effectiveness of different f-information measures, along with a comparison with mutual information, is demonstrated on breast cancer, leukemia, and colon cancer datasets. While some f -information measures provide 100% prediction accuracy for all three microarray datasets, mutual information attains this accuracy only for breast cancer dataset, and 98.6% and 93.6% for leukemia and colon cancer datasets, respectively.","['Maji, Pradipta']",['Maji P'],"['Machine Intelligence Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata 700 108, India. pmaji@isical.ac.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080916,United States,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,0012737,,IM,"['Gene Expression Profiling', '*Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods']",2009/03/11 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1109/TBME.2008.2004502 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 2009 Apr;56(4):1063-9. doi: 10.1109/TBME.2008.2004502.

To determine the general utility of aptamers for assessing the cell surface proteome, we developed a standardized flow cytometry assay and carried out a comprehensive study with 7 different aptamers and 14 different cell lines. By examining how aptamers performed with a variety of cell lines, we identified difficulties in using aptamers for cell typing. While there are some aptamers that show excellent correlation between cell surface binding and the expression of a biomarker on the cell surface, other aptamers showed nonspecific binding by flow cytometry. For example, it has recently been claimed that an anti-PTK7 (protein tyrosine kinase 7) aptamer identified a new biomarker for leukemia cells, but data with the additional cell lines shows that it is possible that the aptamer instead identifies a propensity for adherence. Better understanding and controlling for the role of background and nonspecific binding to cells should open the way to using arrays of aptamers for describing and quantifying the cell surface proteome.","['Li, Na', 'Ebright, Jessica N', 'Stovall, Gwendolyn M', 'Chen, Xi', 'Nguyen, Hong Hanh', 'Singh, Amrita', 'Syrett, Angel', 'Ellington, Andrew D']","['Li N', 'Ebright JN', 'Stovall GM', 'Chen X', 'Nguyen HH', 'Singh A', 'Syrett A', 'Ellington AD']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (PTK7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aptamers, Nucleotide/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2009/03/11 09:00,2009/06/24 09:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr801048z [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2009 May;8(5):2438-48. doi: 10.1021/pr801048z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resveratrol-directed compounds were synthesized, and their antioxidant effects against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced DNA damage, their prooxidant effects on DNA damage in the presence cupric ions, and their cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects on human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells were investigated in vitro. It was found that the compounds bearing o-diphenoxyl groups exhibited remarkably higher activities in inhibiting ROS-induced DNA damage, accelerating DNA damage in the presence cupric ions, and inducing apoptosis of HL-60 cells compared with the ones bearing no such groups. The detail mechanism of the structure-activity relationship was also studied by the oxidative product analysis of resveratrol and its analogues with galvinoxyl radical or cupric ions and UV-visible spectra change in the presence cupric ions. This study reveals a good and interesting correlation between antioxidant and prooxidant activity, as well as cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing activity against HL-60 cells, and provides an idea for designing antioxidant-based cancer chemoprevention agents.","['Qian, Yi-Ping', 'Cai, Yu-Jun', 'Fan, Gui-Juan', 'Wei, Qing-Yi', 'Yang, Jie', 'Zheng, Li-Fang', 'Li, Xiu-Zhuang', 'Fang, Jian-Guo', 'Zhou, Bo']","['Qian YP', 'Cai YJ', 'Fan GJ', 'Wei QY', 'Yang J', 'Zheng LF', 'Li XZ', 'Fang JG', 'Zhou B']","['State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cations, Divalent', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Copper/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oxidants/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects']",2009/03/11 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jm8015415 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2009 Apr 9;52(7):1963-74. doi: 10.1021/jm8015415.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Med Chem. 2009 Oct 22;52(20):6504.

To date, the existence of cancer stem cells has been proven in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, in breast cancer, in brain tumors, in lung cancer and gastrointestinal tumors. This review is focusing on the recent discovery of stem cells in leukemia, human brain tumors and breast cancer. A small population of cells in the tumor (less than 1%) shows the potential to give rise to the tumor and its growth. These cells have a substantial characteristic of stem cells--ability for self-renewal without loss of proliferation capacity with each cell division. Furthermore they are immortal, rather resistant to treatment and express typical markers of stem cells. The origin of these resident cancer stem cells is not clear. Whether the cancer stem cells originate from normal stem cells in consequence of genetic and epigenetic changes and/or redifferentiation from somatic tumor cells to the stem-like cells remains to be investigated. We propose the idea of the relation between normal tissue stem cells and cancer stem cells and their populations--progenitor cells. Based on this we highlight one of the major characteristic of stem cell--plasticity, which is equally important in the physiological regeneration process as well as carcinogenesis. Furthermore, we consider the microenvironment as a limiting factor for tumor genesis in AML, breast cancer and brain tumors. Thus the biological properties of cancer stem cells are just beginning to be revealed, the continuation of these studies should lead to the development of cancer stem cells target therapies for cancer treatment.","['Macingova, Zuzana', 'Filip, Stanislav']","['Macingova Z', 'Filip S']","['Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy, Czech Republic. macinzuz@fnhk.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Czech Republic,Acta Medica (Hradec Kralove),Acta medica (Hradec Kralove),9705947,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/pathology/physiopathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/physiopathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology']",2008/01/01 00:00,2009/04/01 09:00,['2009/03/11 09:00'],"['2009/03/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Medica (Hradec Kralove). 2008;51(3):139-44.,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess whether there is an association between maternal age and risk of childhood leukemia and whether such an association is modified by maternal year of birth. METHODS: By linking nationwide Swedish registers, we analyzed leukemia incidence among all children between 1 and 5 years of age born between 1960 and 1999. We estimated incidence time trends by child year of birth (overall and stratified by maternal age) and incidence rate ratios (RRs) for maternal age groups stratified by maternal birth cohort. We tested the interaction between maternal age and child year of birth through the likelihood ratio test between nested Poisson regression models. RESULTS: We observed 1,562 leukemia cases. The overall annual percent change (APC) was 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51 to 1.49]. Stratifying by maternal age classes, APCs decreased from 1.66 (0.68 to 2.65) for mothers <or= 24 years to 0.23 (-0.93 to 1.40) for mothers >or= 35 years at delivery. RRs for children born to the oldest with respect to the youngest mothers were 2.42 (1.31 to 4.67), 1.68 (1.00 to 2.72), 1.34 (0.87 to 2.01), and 0.87 (0.46-1.54) for mothers born in 1930-1934, 1940-1944, 1950-1954, and 1960-1964, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood leukemia risk increased with maternal age for mothers born in the past, whereas maternal age had no effect on this risk for mothers born more recently. This finding may explain the inconsistency of previous studies and suggests that leukemia risk may be related to an environmental factor to which women's exposure has changed over time.","['Maule, Milena Maria', 'Vizzini, Loredana', 'Czene, Kamila', 'Akre, Olof', 'Richiardi, Lorenzo']","['Maule MM', 'Vizzini L', 'Czene K', 'Akre O', 'Richiardi L']","['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies and Center for Oncologic Prevention in Piedmont, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. milena.maule@cpo.it']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081107,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/history', '*Maternal Age', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/10 09:00,2009/04/01 09:00,['2009/03/10 09:00'],"['2008/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.11938 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2009 Feb;117(2):299-302. doi: 10.1289/ehp.11938.

In order to save this species, the Spanish authorities implemented a captive breeding program recruiting lynxes from the wild. In this context, a retrospective survey on prevalence of selected feline pathogens in free-ranging lynxes was initiated. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We systematically analyzed the prevalence and importance of seven viral, one protozoan (Cytauxzoon felis), and several bacterial (e.g., hemotropic mycoplasma) infections in 77 of approximately 200 remaining free-ranging Iberian lynxes of the Donana and Sierra Morena areas, in Southern Spain, between 2003 and 2007. With the exception of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), evidence of infection by all tested feline pathogens was found in Iberian lynxes. Fourteen lynxes were feline leukemia virus (FeLV) provirus-positive; eleven of these were antigenemic (FeLV p27 positive). All 14 animals tested negative for other viral infections. During a six-month period in 2007, six of the provirus-positive antigenemic lynxes died. Infection with FeLV but not with other infectious agents was associated with mortality (p<0.001). Sequencing of the FeLV surface glycoprotein gene revealed a common origin for ten of the eleven samples. The ten sequences were closely related to FeLV-A/61E, originally isolated from cats in the USA. Endogenous FeLV sequences were not detected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: It was concluded that the FeLV infection most likely originated from domestic cats invading the lynx's habitats. Data available regarding the time frame, co-infections, and outcome of FeLV-infections suggest that, in contrast to the domestic cat, the FeLV strain affecting the lynxes in 2007 is highly virulent to this species.

A total of 33 patients at variable risk of AML undergoing allogeneic SCT from an HLA-identical sibling participated. The patients suffered from a variety of treatment-related sequelae before SCT and many cases also featured the presence of major organ dysfunction. The median follow-up duration of patients who were among the overall survivors was 58 months (range, 11-125 months). The median number of CD34(+) cells infused was 3.5 x 10(6) per kg (range, 0.8-15.6 x 10(6) per kg). The median number of days for recovery of ANC and platelet count without transfusion was 13 (range, 6-22) and 18 (range, 11-29) days, respectively. Four patients (12%) died due to nonrelapse causes and only one patient developed the same course of infectious complication as before SCT. No particular finding in the context of CMV infection or other post transplant complication was observed. The estimated 10-year overall survival rate was 68%.

METHODS: Cell viability was measured by MTT assay, and apoptotic morphology changes were detected by fluorescence microscopy. The apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometric assay. mdr-1 mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. Bcl-2 family proteins, cytochrome c(cyt C), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and P-glycoprotein were detected by Western blot. BALB/c nu/nu mice were injected with K562-r cells subcutaneously. Tumor-bearing mice were treated intravenously with berbamine. RESULTS: MTT tests revealed that berbamine significantly inhibited K562-r cell proliferation and increased the chemo-sensitivity of K562-r cells to imatinib. The apoptosis rate was significantly increased following treatment with 21.2 micromol/L berbamine; formation of typical apoptotic blebs was apparent, as observed by fluorescence microscopy. Expression levels of mdr-1 mRNA and P-gp protein were high in untreated K562-r cells and significantly down-regulated by berbamine treatment. Berbamine-treated K562-r cells also exhibited down-regulated expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L), up-regulated expression of the apoptotic proteins Bax and cytoplasmic cyt C, and stimulated proteolytic cleavage of PARP. In addition, berbamine also suppressed the growth of K562-r xenotransplanted tumors in vivo. CONCLUSION: Berbamine inhibited proliferation of K562-r cells both in vitro and in vivo. Berbamine-induced apoptosis in K562-r cells appeared to occur through a mechanism involving Bcl-2 family proteins, as well as mdr-1 mRNA and P-gp protein. Berbamine in combination with imatinib restored the chemo-sensitivity of K562-r cells to imatinib. Our findings suggest that berbamine may be useful in treating imatinib-resistant CML patients.","['Wei, Yan-lin', 'Xu, Lei', 'Liang, Yun', 'Xu, Xiao-hua', 'Zhao, Xiao-ying']","['Wei YL', 'Xu L', 'Liang Y', 'Xu XH', 'Zhao XY']","['Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090309,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'V5KM4XJ0WM (berbamine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/analysis']",2009/03/10 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2009/03/10 09:00'],"['2009/03/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]']","['aps200919 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2009.19 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2009 Apr;30(4):451-7. doi: 10.1038/aps.2009.19.

Infection of ESCs by the murine leukaemia viruses (MLVs) results in the normal establishment of integrated proviral DNA, but this DNA is then transcriptionally silenced, preventing further viral spread. The repression is largely mediated by trans-acting factors that recognize a conserved sequence element termed the primer binding site, an 18-base pair sequence complementary to the 3' end of a cellular transfer RNA. A specific tRNA is annealed to the primer binding site sequence of the viral genomic RNA, and is used to prime DNA synthesis. This same sequence in the context of the integrated proviral DNA is targeted for silencing in ESCs. We have recently shown that a large protein complex binding to the primer binding site in ESCs contains TRIM28 (refs 8, 9), a well-characterized transcriptional co-repressor. An important question remains as to the identity of the factor that directly recognizes integrated retroviral DNAs and recruits TRIM28 to mediate their specific silencing. Here we identify the zinc finger protein ZFP809 as the recognition molecule that bridges the integrated proviral DNA and TRIM28. We show that expression of ZFP809 is sufficient to render even differentiated cells highly resistant to MLV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ZFP809 is able to potently block transcription from DNA constructs of human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), which use the same primer tRNA. These results identify ZFP809 as a DNA-binding factor that specifically recognizes a large subset of mammalian retroviruses and retroelements, targeting them for transcriptional silencing. We propose that ZFP809 evolved as a stem-cell-specific retroviral restriction factor, and therefore constitutes a new component of the intrinsic immune system of stem cells.","['Wolf, Daniel', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Wolf D', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, HHSC 1310, 701 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090308,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (ZFP809 protein, mouse)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Trim28 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*virology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Gene Silencing', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/growth & development', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/growth & development', 'Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28', 'Virus Replication']",2009/03/10 09:00,2009/06/19 09:00,['2009/03/10 09:00'],"['2008/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [medline]']","['nature07844 [pii]', '10.1038/nature07844 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2009 Apr 30;458(7242):1201-4. doi: 10.1038/nature07844.

We produced a preliminary estimate of the costs of treating patients for IRCs. METHODS: The medical records of patients who had received multiple transfusions were reviewed. Newly developed cardiomyopathy, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer were defined as IRCs. The costs of laboratory studies, medication, oxygenation, intervention, and education were calculated using working criteria we defined. Costs that had a definite causal relationship with IRCs were included to produce as accurate an estimate as possible. RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2006, 650 patients with hematologic diseases, including 358 with acute leukemia, 102 with lymphoma, 58 with myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative disease, 46 with multiple myeloma, and 31 with chronic leukemia, received more than 10 units of red blood cells. Nine patients developed IRCs. The primary diagnoses of eight patients were aplastic anemia and that of one patient was chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Two patients who had diabetes were excluded because one was treated at another hospital and the other was diagnosed as oxymetholone-induced diabetes. Of the seven patients included, liver cirrhosis developed in two, heart failure in four, and diabetes mellitus in three. Some of them had two diagnoses. The total cost attributed to IRCs for the seven patients was 47,388,241 KRW (approximately 50,000 USD).

RESULTS: There were 51 patients with ICH, median age of 51 (range 17-86), including 12 patients diagnosed as acute promyelocytic leukemia. Forty-three patients were refractory/relapsed status. ICH was localized in the supratentorium (44 cases), basal ganglion (9), cerebellum (5), and brainstem (4). Twenty-one patients had multiple sites. Thirty-eight patients had intraparenchymal hemorrhage, 16 subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 10 subdural hemorrhage, and one epidural hemorrhage (EDH).

We tried to identify the target molecules by western blotting and mass spectrometric analysis, revealing that the target antigen was HLA class II DR. The cell death was induced only in dimmer form of scFv (diabody) and at 15-fold lower concentration than that of a fusion protein of scFv and human IgG Fc [(scFv)(2)-Fc] or anti HLA-DR mouse whole antibody L243. Thus, S1T-A3 diabody is a small antibody fragment with agonistic activity to induce cell death through HLA-DR. This is the first report elucidating that diabody specific to HLA-DR is effective to induce the cell death in T-cell malignancy especially adult T-cell leukaemic cell line.","['Muraoka, Satoshi', 'Ito, Yuji', 'Kamimura, Masaki', 'Baba, Masanori', 'Arima, Naomichi', 'Suda, Yasuo', 'Hashiguchi, Shuhei', 'Torikai, Masaharu', 'Nakashima, Toshihiro', 'Sugimura, Kazuhisa']","['Muraoka S', 'Ito Y', 'Kamimura M', 'Baba M', 'Arima N', 'Suda Y', 'Hashiguchi S', 'Torikai M', 'Nakashima T', 'Sugimura K']","['Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kagoshima University, Korimoto 1-21-40, Kagoshima, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090306,England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Peptide Library)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/*immunology/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', '*Peptide Library']",2009/03/10 09:00,2009/08/13 09:00,['2009/03/10 09:00'],"['2009/03/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/13 09:00 [medline]']","['mvp039 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvp039 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2009 Jun;145(6):799-810. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvp039.

Translocations or point mutations that result in RUNX1 loss or disrupted function predispose to leukemia but data derived from model systems suggests that Runx genes can also be pro-oncogenic. Here we investigate the effects of enforced Runx1 expression in lymphoid lineages both in vivo and in vitro and show that transgene expression enhanced cell survival in the thymus and bone marrow but strongly inhibited the expansion of hematopoietic and B cell progenitors in vitro. Despite this, modestly enhanced levels of Runx1 accelerated Myc-induced lymphomagenesis in both the B cell and T cell lineages. Together these data provide formal proof that wild type Runx1 can promote oncogenesis in lymphoid tissues and that, in addition to loss of function, gain of function may have an aetiological role in leukemia.","['Blyth, Karen', 'Slater, Nicholas', 'Hanlon, Linda', 'Bell, Margaret', 'Mackay, Nancy', 'Stewart, Monica', 'Neil, James C', 'Cameron, Ewan R']","['Blyth K', 'Slater N', 'Hanlon L', 'Bell M', 'Mackay N', 'Stewart M', 'Neil JC', 'Cameron ER']","['Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Institute of Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090309,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, myc', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*pathology']",2009/03/10 09:00,2009/09/08 06:00,['2009/03/10 09:00'],"['2009/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(09)00046-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2009.01.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2009 Jul-Aug;43(1):12-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2009.01.013.

This fact may indicate the role of oxidative stress in the development of depression in cancer patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether the acute myeloid leukemia of Brown Norway rats, which is accompanied by oxidative stress, evoked behavioral and receptor changes resembling alterations characteristic of rat models of depression. The rats were divided into two groups: leukemic rats and healthy control. Leukemia was induced through intraperitoneal injection of 10(7) promyelocytic leukemia cells to the Brown Norway rats. Depression-like behavior was evaluated in the forced swim test at 30 or 34 days after leukemic cells injection. The rats were killed after the evaluation and the spleen, brain cortex and hippocampus were excised. The red-ox state was assessed in homogenates of tissues by measuring total glutathione (GSH) content, the ferric ion reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) level, expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), biliverdin reductase (BvR) and ferritin mRNA, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. Radioligand binding assay was used to assess of the effect of leukemia on cortical receptors. Leukemic cells were identified using RM-124 antibody by FACS Calibur flow cytometry. Leukemia influenced locomotory activity as well as forced swim test behavior in a 34-day series of experiments. Signs of oxidative stress in leukemic rats were observed in each examined stage of leukemia development. The FRAP values and glutathione contents, were significantly lowered whereas HO-1 mRNA expression, and malonodialdehyde concentrations were significantly increased in the spleen and brain structures of leukemic rats in comparison with the healthy controls. A significant increase in the potency of glycine to displace [(3)H]L-689,560 from the strychnine-insensitive glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartic (NMDA) receptors receptor complex in cortical homogenates of the leukemic rats in 30- and 34-day experimental series was observed in comparison with the control. Upregulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors was observed in rat cortex after 30 days of leukemia development but not in 34-days series compared with the control. It is concluded that disturbances in antioxidant system in brain cortex were accompanied by an activation of glycine sites of the NMDA receptor complex, regardless of stage of leukemia development, which are characteristic of model of depression. Findings of our study demonstrate the link between glutamatergic activity, oxidative stress and leukemia.","['Papiez, Monika A', 'Dybala, Malgorzata', 'Sowa-Kucma, Magdalena', 'Krzysciak, Wirginia', 'Taha, Hevidar', 'Jozkowicz, Alicja', 'Nowak, Gabriel']","['Papiez MA', 'Dybala M', 'Sowa-Kucma M', 'Krzysciak W', 'Taha H', 'Jozkowicz A', 'Nowak G']","['Department of Cytobiology & Histochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland. mfpapiez@cyf-kr.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090303,England,Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,8211617,"['0 (Receptors, Biogenic Amine)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'O9MIA842K9 (Biliverdine)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Biliverdine/genetics/metabolism', 'Body Weight', 'Cerebral Cortex/metabolism', 'Depression/*etiology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Ferritins/genetics/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/genetics/metabolism', 'Hippocampus/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/physiology', 'Male', 'Motor Activity/physiology', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Radioligand Assay/methods', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Receptors, Biogenic Amine/metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Swimming']",2009/03/10 09:00,2009/08/11 09:00,['2009/03/10 09:00'],"['2008/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/11 09:00 [medline]']","['S0278-5846(09)00054-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pnpbp.2009.02.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry. 2009 Jun 15;33(4):596-604. doi: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2009.02.015.

Although many cancer cells are sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) develops resistance to TRAIL. In this study, we investigated whether apicidin, a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, could overcome the TRAIL resistance in CML-derived K562 cells. Compared to treatment with apicidin or TRAIL alone, cotreatment with apicidin and TRAIL-induced apoptosis synergistically in K562 cells. This combination led to activation of caspase-8 and Bcl-2 interacting domain (Bid), resulting in the cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c from mitochondria as well as an activation of caspase-3. Treatment with apicidin resulted in down-regulation of Bcr-Abl and inhibition of its downstream target, PI3K/AKT-NF-kappaB pathway. In addition, apicidin decreased the level of NF-kappaB-dependent Bcl-x(L), leading to caspase activation and Bid cleavage. These results suggest that apicidin may sensitize K562 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway by regulating expression of Bcr-Abl and its related anti-apoptotic proteins. Therefore, the present study suggests that combination of apicidin and TRAIL may be an effective strategy for treating TRAIL-resistant Bcr-Abl expressing CML cells.","['Park, Soo-Jung', 'Kim, Mi-Ju', 'Kim, Hak-Bong', 'Sohn, Hee-Young', 'Bae, Jae-Ho', 'Kang, Chi-Dug', 'Kim, Sun-Hee']","['Park SJ', 'Kim MJ', 'Kim HB', 'Sohn HY', 'Bae JH', 'Kang CD', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan 622-770, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090304,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (apicidin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Genes, abl', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*administration & dosage', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*administration & dosage']",2009/03/10 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2009/03/10 09:00'],"['2008/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(09)00087-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.02.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2009 Jul 1;315(11):1809-18. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.02.024.

Bcl-6 expression is tightly controlled, but neither the nature of all the regulatory signals nor their interactions are known. Bcl-6 expression is induced in Bcr-Abl expressing lymphoid cell lines by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. We show that p38 MAPK mediates induction of Bcl-6 following inhibition of Bcr-Abl by imatinib. Next we analyze p38 function in a germinal centre B-cell line, Ramos. p38 is phosphorylated under basal conditions, and studies with p38 inhibitors show that it induces Bcl-6 expression. Membrane bound CD40 ligand activates p38 but also other MAPK pathways that strongly repress Bcl-6 and the overall effect is reduction in Bcl-6 expression. Surprisingly soluble CD40 ligand induces Bcl-6 by activating p38 without activating the repressive pathways. Hence different types of CD40 signalling are associated with varying effects on Bcl-6 expression. Transcription reporter assays demonstrate p38 responsive sequences at about 4.5 kb from the transcription start site. Immunocytochemistry of tonsil sections show phosphorylated p38 in a minor population of germinal centre B-cells. We demonstrate for the first time that p38 induces Bcl-6 transcription, but increased protein expression occurs only when the strong pathways repressing Bcl-6 are not activated.","['Batlle, Ana', 'Papadopoulou, Vasiliki', 'Gomes, Ana R', 'Willimott, Shaun', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Naresh, Kikkeri', 'Lam, Eric W-F', 'Wagner, Simon D']","['Batlle A', 'Papadopoulou V', 'Gomes AR', 'Willimott S', 'Melo JV', 'Naresh K', 'Lam EW', 'Wagner SD']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090306,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (anti-IgM)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Palatine Tonsil/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2009/03/10 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/03/10 09:00'],"['2009/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(09)00070-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2009.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2009 May;46(8-9):1727-35. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2009.02.003.

However, mechanisms responsible for neuron-glial interactions and the releasable factors that underlie these processes are not well understood. The pro-inflammatory cytokine, leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), is transiently expressed postnatally by glial cells in the hippocampus and rapidly up-regulated by enhanced neural activity following seizures. To test the hypothesis that spontaneous neural activity regulates glial development in hippocampus via LIF signaling, we blocked spontaneous activity with the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) in mixed hippocampal cell cultures in combination with blockers of LIF and purinergic signaling. TTX decreased the number of GFAP-expressing astrocytes in hippocampal cell culture. Furthermore, blocking purinergic signaling by P2Y receptors contributed to reduced numbers of astrocytes. Blocking activity or purinergic signaling in the presence of function-blocking antibodies to LIF did not further decrease the number of astrocytes. Moreover, hippocampal cell cultures prepared from LIF -/- mice had reduced numbers of astrocytes and activity-dependent neuron-glial signaling promoting differentiation of astrocytes was absent. The results show that endogenous LIF is required for normal development of hippocampal astrocytes, and this process is regulated by spontaneous neural impulse activity through the release of ATP.","['Cohen, Jonathan E', 'Fields, R Douglas']","['Cohen JE', 'Fields RD']","['Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,England,Neuron Glia Biol,Neuron glia biology,101217278,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (P2ry1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2Y1)', '0 (Sodium Channel Blockers)', '4368-28-9 (Tetrodotoxin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Hippocampus/cytology/*growth & development/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neuronal Plasticity/drug effects/physiology', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y1', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Sodium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Synaptic Transmission/drug effects/physiology', 'Tetrodotoxin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",2009/03/10 09:00,2009/04/18 09:00,['2009/03/10 09:00'],"['2009/03/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [medline]']","['S1740925X09000076 [pii]', '10.1017/S1740925X09000076 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuron Glia Biol. 2008 Feb;4(1):43-55. doi: 10.1017/S1740925X09000076.,,,,['Z01 HD000713-13/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2756042,,['NIHMS111403'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we compared the outcome of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in such patients with those without malignancy. METHODS: The patients were selected from those who had undergone coronary artery bypass surgery in the last decade. The study group (group I) included the patients with malignancy in remission. The control group comprised those patients who were selected randomly from those without any malignancy. The patients were retospectively examined with regard to preoperative, operative, and postoperative data from personal files, computerized recording system, and operation reports. RESULTS: Group I included 48 patients (age 48 to 69; 29 male) while group II included 50 patients (age = 38 to 73; 35 male). In group I, comorbidity rates were: renal dysfunction in 12 (25%), obstructive lung disease 10 (21%), congestive failure in four (8%) patients. The malignancy rates were: lung in 15 (31%), breast in 10 (21%), stomach in five (10%), colon in four (8%), renal in one (2%), Hodgkin's lyphoma in three (6%), leukemia in two (4%), ovarian in three (6%), and prostate in five (10%) patients. In group II, the comorbidity rates were: diabetes mellitus 18 (36%), renal dysfunction in five (10%) and obstructive lung disease in 13 (26%) patients. In group I, chemotherapy and radiotherapy were performed in 38 and 34 patients, respectively. In groups I and II, the CABG was elective in 47 (98%) and in 45 patients (90%); the off-pump surgery was performed in 27 (56%) and 12 (24%) patients, respectively. The total duration of bypass was 37 +/- 6 minutes and 44 +/- 5 minutes; the duration of aortic clamp was 26 +/- 4 and 29 +/- 7 minutes, respectively, in groups I and II. Posoperative complication rates were: infection in 12 (25%), bleeding in eight (17%), acute renal insufficiency in eight (17%), prolonged air escape in five (10%), and prolonged entubation in 17 (35%) patients in group I and atrial fibrillation in 11 (22%) patients in group II. Mortality rates in both groups were two (4%). CONCLUSION: CABG in patients with comorbid malignancy is as safe as the other patients. In patients with full remission of malignancy, the surgeons should be encouraged about the safety of CABG.","['Kucukarslan, Nezihi', 'Tatar, Tolga', 'Uzun, Mehmet', 'Yavuz, Izzet', 'Ozal, Ertugrul', 'Tatar, Harun']","['Kucukarslan N', 'Tatar T', 'Uzun M', 'Yavuz I', 'Ozal E', 'Tatar H']","['Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, GATA Military School, Etlik, Ankara, Turkey. nkucukarslan@gata.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Card Surg,Journal of cardiac surgery,8908809,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Artery Bypass/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Turkey']",2009/03/10 09:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2009/03/10 09:00'],"['2009/03/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JCS815 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1540-8191.2009.00815.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Card Surg. 2009 Mar-Apr;24(2):151-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2009.00815.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further testing confirmed mild elevation of foetal haemoglobin (HbF) and increased F-cells. Elevated-HbF levels have been widely reported in patients with haematological malignancy.

However, its safety and efficacy in Indian patients has not been studied. We retrospectively analysed our experience with fludarabine in low grade lymphomas and CLL. METHODS: The records of all patients with low grade lymphoma or CLL who received fludarabine between April 1999 and November 2006 were analysed. Response evaluation was done as per the National Cancer Institute-Working Group guidelines for CLL and International Workshop criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphomas, respectively, in those patients who received at least 3 cycles of fludarabine. Toxicity was graded as per the common terminology criteria for adverse events, version 3.0. Median event-free survival was obtained using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were included in the study and 189 cycles were administered (median: 4 cycles per patient). Sixteen patients had a treatment delay, 14 due to myelosuppression. Twenty-five patients had low grade lymphoma and 22 had CLL. The response was evaluable in 22 patients with low grade lymphoma and 20 with CLL. The overall response rate for CLL was 100% in those treated upfront (n=9) and 55% in those with relapsed disease (n=11). The overall response rate for low grade lymphoma was 88% (63% complete remission) in untreated patients and 79% (43% complete remission) in those with relapsed disease. Common adverse events were myelosuppression and infection. Two patients died of sepsis and 4 due to disease progression on treatment. Median event-free survival for patients treated upfront with fludarabine was 31.4 months. CONCLUSION: In our patient population, response to fludarabine is similar to that in the published literature. Our patients had a higher frequency of haematological toxicity.","['Prabhash, K', 'Vikram, G S', 'Nair, R', 'Sengar, M', 'Gujral, S', 'Bakshi, A', 'Gupta, S', 'Parikh, P M']","['Prabhash K', 'Vikram GS', 'Nair R', 'Sengar M', 'Gujral S', 'Bakshi A', 'Gupta S', 'Parikh PM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Dr Ernest Borges Marg, Parel, Mumbai 400012, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Natl Med J India,The National medical journal of India,8809315,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2009/03/10 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/03/10 09:00'],"['2009/03/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Natl Med J India. 2008 Jul-Aug;21(4):171-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, we investigated the possible role of different OSCs in the treatment of leukemia. Thereby, we found that the compounds tested in this study induced apoptosis in U937 cells, with an efficiency depending on the number of sulfides, and selected the most promising candidate, diallyltetrasulfide (Al2S4), for detailed mechanistic studies. Here we show that Al2S4 induced an accumulation of cells in early mitosis (G2/M phase), followed by the activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis. The compound counteracted different anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-xL, phospho-Bad and Bcl-2), promoted activation of Bax and Bak and induced the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Treatment by Al2S4 let to the identification of early apoptotic events including Bcl-xL degradation, Bak activation and release of cytochrome c followed by late events including Bcl-2 proteolysis, Bax activation, Bad dephosphorylation, caspase activation, nuclear fragmentation and phosphatidylserine exposure.","['Cerella, Claudia', 'Scherer, Christiane', 'Cristofanon, Silvia', 'Henry, Estelle', 'Anwar, Awais', 'Busch, Corinna', 'Montenarh, Mathias', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Jacob, Claus', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Cerella C', 'Scherer C', 'Cristofanon S', 'Henry E', 'Anwar A', 'Busch C', 'Montenarh M', 'Dicato M', 'Jacob C', 'Diederich M']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire de Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, Rue Edward Steichen 9, 2540, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Sulfides)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blood Donors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Sulfides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2009/03/07 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/03/07 09:00'],"['2009/03/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-009-0328-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2009 May;14(5):641-54. doi: 10.1007/s10495-009-0328-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyze its efficacy in a practical setting, we registered most of CML patients in Nagasaki Prefecture of Japan. Of these, 73 patients received imatinib as an initial therapy. The overall survival rate of these patients was 88.7% at 6 years, and the cumulative complete cytogenetic response rate was 82.5% at 18 months. These results are comparable with the data of other reports including the IRIS study; however, the administered imatinib dose was smaller in our study than that in other reports. To address these discrepancies, we measured the trough concentration of imatinib among 35 patients. Although 39% of the patients were administered less than 400 mg/day, the trough level was comparable to those of previous reports. The trough level of imatinib showed a significant relationship with its efficacy, and was clearly related to dose of imatinib administrated and dose of imatinib divided by body surface area (BSA). Considering the smaller BSA of Japanese patients as compared to those of foreign origin, the results suggest that a lower dose of imatinib could maintain enough trough level and provided excellent results for the treatment of CML in our registry.","['Sakai, Mari', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Matsuo, Emi', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Imanishi,

Oral supplementation can aid to fulfill the energy and protein requirements of these patients. Nevertheless, the use of commercial nutritional supplements normally available, is limited by its poor intake. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the degree of fulfillment of the prescribed supplements and fulfillment of energy requirements, as well as the development of nutritional status in hematological patients hospitalized for treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. METHODS: Prospective, randomized and open study of inpatients at the hematological ward. Patients were randomized sequentially and they were assigned into 3 different nutritional interventions providing: Group 1 (G1), a flavored supplement; Group 2 (G2): a non flavored (neutral) supplement and Group 3 (G3): ""kitchen"" foods as supplements. Need and amount of nutritional supplements were provided according to the oral intake previously analyzed. Nutritional assessment (at admission and discharge) was based in the Subjective Global Assessment test (SGA), Risk Nutritional Index (RNI) and percentage of lost weight. Both fulfillment of supplement intake and achievement of energetic requirements were analyzed. RESULTS: 125 patients of 51.3 +/- 16.8 years; 45% men and 55% women. DIAGNOSIS: 54% lymphoma, 33% leukemia, 8% myeloma and others 4%. Length of stay (LOS): 7.0 +/- 3.6 d. The nutritional assessment done by SGA showed significant negative changes in G2 and G3 (G1: 30% developed malnutrition and 28% improved their nutritional status, p = NS; G2: 50% developed malnutrition against 7% whom improved their nutritional status, p = 0.002; y G3: 37% developed malnutrition against 21% whom improved their nutritional status, p = 0.02). According to RNI, patients evolved negatively from their nutritional state but no significant differences were found within groups (G1, from 81% of malnutrition to 90%; G2, from 77% to 91%, and G3 from 71% to 85%). Globally, during hospitalization patients lost weight significantly (2.3 +/- 2.2 kg, p < 0.001), but within groups weight loss differences were not significant (G1, 1.16 kg; G2, 1.75 kg, y G3, 1.17 kg). All three groups required intake of supplements (G1, 47%; G2, 30%, and G3, 47%). The percentage of fulfillment of oral intake was similar in both commercial supplemented groups (G1, 47% and G2, 58%) although it was significantly greater in those receiving kitchen supplements (G3, 100%, p < 0.001). The fulfillment of energy requirements at admission and discharge did not showed significant changes (G1, from 53% to 46%; G2, from 67% to 52% and G3 from 49% to 55%). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that hematological patients admitted to hospital for treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy loose weight during their hospitalization and present intakes below their energy requirements so they need supplementation. Kitchen supplements are better accepted than commercial ones although that does not result in an increased total energy intake. The group which received commercial flavored supplements was the only one which did not showed negative significant changes in the nutritional status evaluated by SGA.","['Penalva, A', 'San Martin, A', 'Rossello, J', 'Perez-Portabella, C', 'Palacios, A', 'Julia, A', 'Planas, M']","['Penalva A', 'San Martin A', 'Rossello J', 'Perez-Portabella C', 'Palacios A', 'Julia A', 'Planas M']","[""Unidad de Soporte Nutricional, Hospital Universitario Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Espana.""]",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,Spain,Nutr Hosp,Nutricion hospitalaria,9100365,,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Anorexia/*etiology/*therapy', '*Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nutritional Status', 'Prospective Studies']",2009/03/07 09:00,2009/05/22 09:00,['2009/03/07 09:00'],"['2008/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [medline]']",['S0212-16112009000100002 [pii]'],ppublish,Nutr Hosp. 2009 Jan-Feb;24(1):10-6.,,,,,,Suplementacion oral nutricional en pacientes hematologicos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroelements have diverse strategies for suppressing autointegration, but how HIV-1 protects itself from autointegration is not well-understood. Here we show that knocking down any of the components of the SET complex, an endoplasmic reticulum-associated complex that contains 3 DNases (the base excision repair endonuclease APE1, 5'-3' exonuclease TREX1, and endonuclease NM23-H1), inhibits HIV-1 and HIV-2/SIV, but not MLV or ASV, infection. Inhibition occurs at a step in the viral life cycle after reverse transcription but before chromosomal integration. Antibodies to SET complex proteins capture HIV-1 DNA in the cytoplasm, suggesting a direct interaction between the SET complex and the HIV preintegration complex. Cloning of HIV integration sites in cells with knocked down SET complex components revealed an increase in autointegration, which was verified using a novel semi-quantitative nested PCR assay to detect autointegrants. When SET complex proteins are knocked down, autointegration increases 2-3-fold and chromosomal integration correspondingly decreases approximately 3-fold. Therefore, the SET complex facilitates HIV-1 infection by preventing suicidal autointegration.","['Yan, Nan', 'Cherepanov, Peter', 'Daigle, Janet E', 'Engelman, Alan', 'Lieberman, Judy']","['Yan N', 'Cherepanov P', 'Daigle JE', 'Engelman A', 'Lieberman J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Immune Disease Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090306,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.16.- (three prime repair exonuclease 1)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (APEX1 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses', 'Birds', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase/*metabolism', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HIV Infections/metabolism/virology', 'HIV-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus', '*Virus Integration']",2009/03/07 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/03/07 09:00'],"['2008/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1000327 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2009 Mar;5(3):e1000327. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000327.

METHODS: The gene expression was examined by whole genome 44 k oligo microarrays and 12 k cDNA microarrays in peripheral blood leukocytes collected from seven leukemia patients before treatment, 2-4 h and 18-24 h after start of chemotherapy and validated by real-time quantitative PCR. Statistically significantly upregulated genes were classified using gene ontology (GO) terms. Parallel samples were examined by flow cytometry for apoptosis by annexin V-binding and the expression of selected proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Significant differential modulation of 151 genes were found at 4 h after start of induction therapy with cytarabine and anthracycline, including significant overexpression of 31 genes associated with p53 regulation. Within 4 h of chemotherapy the BCL2/BAX and BCL2/PUMA ratio were attenuated in proapoptotic direction. FLT3 mutations indicated that non-responders (5/7 patients, 8 versus 49 months survival) are characterized by a unique gene response profile before and at 4 h. At 18-24 h after chemotherapy, the gene expression of p53 target genes was attenuated, while genes involved in chemoresistance, cytarabine detoxification, chemokine networks and T cell receptor were prominent. No signs of apoptosis were observed in the collected cells, suggesting the treated patients as a physiological source of pre-apoptotic cells. CONCLUSION: Pre-apoptotic gene expression can be monitored within hours after start of chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and may be useful in future determination of therapy responders. The low number of patients and the heterogeneity of acute myeloid leukemia limited the identification of gene expression predictive of therapy response. Therapy-induced gene expression reflects the complex biological processes involved in clinical cancer cell eradication and should be explored for future enhancement of therapy.","['Oyan, Anne Margrete', 'Anensen, Nina', 'Bo, Trond Hellem', 'Stordrange, Laila', 'Jonassen, Inge', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Kalland, Karl-Henning', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Oyan AM', 'Anensen N', 'Bo TH', 'Stordrange L', 'Jonassen I', 'Bruserud O', 'Kalland KH', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Institute of Medicine, Hematology Section, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. anne.oyan@gades.uib.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090305,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Communication/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Inactivation, Metabolic/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",2009/03/07 09:00,2009/06/25 09:00,['2009/03/07 09:00'],"['2008/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-9-77 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-9-77 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2009 Mar 5;9:77. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-9-77.,,,,,PMC2673224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common mutation of c-Kit in these disorders is a substitution of the aspartic acid residue in position 816 to a valine (D816V), leading to constitutive activation of the receptor. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of Src family kinases in c-Kit/D816V signaling. Src family kinases are necessary for the phosphorylation of wild-type c-Kit as well as of activation of downstream signaling pathways including receptor ubiquitination and the Ras/Mek/Erk pathway. Our data demonstrate that, unlike wild-type c-Kit, the phosphorylation of c-Kit/D816V is not dependent on Src family kinases. In addition, we found that neither receptor ubiquitination nor Erk activation by c-Kit/D816V required activation of Src family kinases. In vitro kinase assay using synthetic peptides revealed that c-Kit/D816V had an altered substrate specificity resembling Src and Abl tyrosine kinases. We further present evidence that, in contrast to wild-type c-Kit, Src family kinases are dispensable for c-Kit/D816V cell survival, proliferation, and colony formation. Taken together, we demonstrate that the signal transduction pathways mediated by c-Kit/D816V are markedly different from those activated by wild-type c-Kit and that altered substrate specificity of c-Kit circumvents a need for Src family kinases in signaling of growth and survival, thereby contributing to the transforming potential of c-Kit/D816V.","['Sun, Jianmin', 'Pedersen, Malin', 'Ronnstrand, Lars']","['Sun J', 'Pedersen M', 'Ronnstrand L']","['Experimental Clinical Chemistry, the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Malmo University Hospital, SE-205 02 Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090305,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",2009/03/07 09:00,2009/06/09 09:00,['2009/03/07 09:00'],"['2009/03/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)76899-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M808058200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Apr 24;284(17):11039-47. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M808058200.

In contrast with the wealth of data existing on TLR-dependent gene expression and resultant cytokine production, very little is known on the mechanisms governing TLR-mediated arachidonic acid (AA) mobilization and subsequent eicosanoid production. We have previously reported the involvement of both cytosolic group IVA phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) and secreted group V phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)-V) in regulating the AA mobilization response of macrophages exposed to bacterial LPS, a TLR4 agonist. In the present study, we have used multiple TLR agonists to define the role of various PLA(2)s in macrophage AA release via TLRs. Activation of P388D(1) and RAW2647.1 macrophage-like cells via TLR1/2, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6/2, and TLR7, but not TLR5 or TLR9, resulted in AA mobilization that appears to involve the activation of both cPLA(2) and sPLA(2) but not of calcium-independent phospholipase A(2). Furthermore, inhibition of sPLA(2)-V by RNA interference or by two cell-permeable compounds, namely scalaradial and manoalide, resulted in a marked reduction of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and cPLA(2) via TLR1/2, TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4, leading to attenuated AA mobilization. Collectively, the results suggest a model whereby sPLA(2)-V contributes to the macrophage AA mobilization response via various TLRs by amplifying cPLA(2) activation through the ERK1/2 phosphorylation cascade.","['Ruiperez, Violeta', 'Astudillo, Alma M', 'Balboa, Maria A', 'Balsinde, Jesus']","['Ruiperez V', 'Astudillo AM', 'Balboa MA', 'Balsinde J']","['Instituto de Biologia y Genetica Molecular, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Diabetes y Enfermedades Metabolicas Asociadas, Valladolid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pla2g4a protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Group IV Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Group V Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Group VI Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Pla2g5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Pla2g6 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Group IV Phospholipases A2/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Group V Phospholipases A2/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Group VI Phospholipases A2/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Macrophages/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*physiology']",2009/03/07 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/03/07 09:00'],"['2009/03/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['182/6/3877 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0804003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Mar 15;182(6):3877-83. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0804003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By analysis of mammalian diaphanous-related formin 1 (mDia1)-deficient mice, we have identified an essential role for this actin nucleator in neutrophil chemotaxis. Lack of mDia1 was associated with defects in chemoattractant-induced neutrophil actin polymerization, polarization, and directional migration, and also with impaired activation of RhoA, its downstream target p160-Rho-associated coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK), and the leukemia-associated RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG). Our data also revealed mDia1 to be associated with another cytoskeletal regulator, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp), at the leading edge of chemotaxing neutrophils and revealed polarized morphology and chemotaxis to be more mildly impaired in WAS(-/-) than in mDia1(-/-) neutrophils, but essentially abrogated by combined mDia1/WASp deficiency. Thus, mDia1 roles in neutrophil chemotaxis appear to be subserved in concert with WASp and are realized at least in part by activation of the LARG/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.","['Shi, Yongquan', 'Zhang, Jinyi', 'Mullin, Michael', 'Dong, Baoxia', 'Alberts, Arthur S', 'Siminovitch, Katherine A']","['Shi Y', 'Zhang J', 'Mullin M', 'Dong B', 'Alberts AS', 'Siminovitch KA']","['Department of Medicine, Samuel Lunenfeld and Toronto Hospital Research Institutes, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Arhgef12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Diap1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (Formins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Was protein, mouse)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Rock1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (RhoA protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Cell Polarity/*immunology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*immunology', 'Feedback, Physiological/immunology', 'Fetal Proteins/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Formins', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microfilament Proteins/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein/physiology', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'rho-Associated Kinases/*physiology', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein']",2009/03/07 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/03/07 09:00'],"['2009/03/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['182/6/3837 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0803838 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Mar 15;182(6):3837-45. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0803838.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the role of type I IFNs in this process in an infectious disease model, mice deficient in the type I IFN receptor (CD118(-/-)) were ocularly infected with HSV-1 and surveyed at times post infection in the nervous system and lymph node for virus and the host immune response. Virus titers were elevated in the trigeminal ganglia and brain stem with virus disseminating rapidly to the draining lymph node of CD118(-/-) mice. T cell and plasmacytoid dendritic cell infiltration into the brain stem was reduced in CD118(-/-) mice following infection, which correlated with a reduction in CXCL10 but not CXCL9 expression. In contrast, CXCL1 and CCL2 levels were up-regulated in the brainstem of CD118(-/-) mice associated with an increase in F4/80(+) macrophages. By day 5 post infection, there was a significant loss in T, NK, and plasmacytoid dendritic cell numbers in the draining lymph nodes associated with an increase in apoptotic/necrotic T cells and an appreciable lack of HSV-specific CD8(+) T cells. The adoptive transfer of HSV-specific TCR transgenic CD8(+) T cells into CD118(-/-) mice at the time of infection modestly reduced viral titers in the nervous system suggesting in addition to the generation of HSV-specific CD8(+) T cells, other type I IFN-activated pathways are instrumental in controlling acute infection.","['Conrady, Christopher D', 'Thapa, Manoj', 'Wuest, Todd', 'Carr, Daniel J J']","['Conrady CD', 'Thapa M', 'Wuest T', 'Carr DJ']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Stem/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Herpes Simplex/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*immunology', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*deficiency/genetics', 'Lymph Nodes/*immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Mandible/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Trigeminal Ganglion/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Virus Replication/genetics/immunology']",2009/03/07 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/03/07 09:00'],"['2009/03/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['182/6/3678 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0803878 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Mar 15;182(6):3678-87. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0803878.,,,,"['P20 RR017703-07/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR017703/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI053108/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY012190-10/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI053108-06/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY012190/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY12190/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2652688,,['NIHMS88847'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shERK5 cells show down-regulation of MHC class I expression at the plasma membrane. Accordingly, ectopic activation of the ERK5 pathway induces MHC class I gene expression. Coinjection of shERK5-expressing cells into the peritoneum diminishes survival of engrafted wild-type tumor cells. Moreover, s.c. injection of shERK5-expressing cells strongly diminishes tumor development by wild-type cells.

In skeletal muscle, differentiated myofibers have exited the cell cycle permanently, whereas satellite stem cells withdraw transiently, returning to active proliferation to repair damaged myofibers. We have examined the epigenetic mechanisms operating in conditional quiescence by analyzing the function of a predicted chromatin regulator mixed lineage leukemia 5 (MLL5) in a culture model of reversible arrest. MLL5 is induced in quiescent myoblasts and regulates both the cell cycle and differentiation via a hierarchy of chromatin and transcriptional regulators. Knocking down MLL5 delays entry of quiescent myoblasts into S phase, but hastens S-phase completion. Cyclin A2 (CycA) mRNA is no longer restricted to S phase, but is induced throughout G(0)/G(1), with activation of the cell cycle regulated element (CCRE) in the CycA promoter. Overexpressed MLL5 physically associates with the CCRE and impairs its activity. MLL5 also regulates CycA indirectly: Cux, an activator of CycA promoter and S phase is induced in RNAi cells, and Brm/Brg1, CCRE-binding repressors that promote differentiation are repressed. In knockdown cells, H3K4 methylation at the CCRE is reduced, reflecting quantitative global changes in methylation. MLL5 appears to lack intrinsic histone methyl transferase activity, but regulates expression of histone-modifying enzymes LSD1 and SET7/9, suggesting an indirect mechanism. Finally, expression of muscle regulators Pax7, Myf5, and myogenin is impaired in MLL5 knockdown cells, which are profoundly differentiation defective. Collectively, our results suggest that MLL5 plays an integral role in novel chromatin regulatory mechanisms that suppress inappropriate expression of S-phase-promoting genes and maintain expression of determination genes in quiescent cells.","['Sebastian, Soji', 'Sreenivas, Prethish', 'Sambasivan, Ramkumar', 'Cheedipudi, Sirisha', 'Kandalla, Prashanth', 'Pavlath, Grace K', 'Dhawan, Jyotsna']","['Sebastian S', 'Sreenivas P', 'Sambasivan R', 'Cheedipudi S', 'Kandalla P', 'Pavlath GK', 'Dhawan J']","['Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, 500 007 India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090305,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CCNA2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin A2)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SWI-SNF-B chromatin-remodeling complex)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (trx protein, Drosophila)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL5 protein, mouse)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cyclin A/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin A2', 'Drosophila Proteins/*chemistry', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Myoblasts/*cytology/enzymology', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'S Phase', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/03/07 09:00,2009/04/09 09:00,['2009/03/07 09:00'],"['2009/03/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [medline]']","['0807136106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0807136106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Mar 24;106(12):4719-24. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0807136106.

Recent studies have demonstrated the critical requirement for the complete MOZ protein in hematopoietic stem cell development and maintenance. However, the specific function of the HAT activity of MOZ remains unknown, as it has been shown that MOZ HAT activity is not required either for its role as Runx1 coactivator or for the leukemic transformation induced by MOZ transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2). To assess the specific requirement for this HAT activity during hematopoietic development, we have generated embryonic stem cells and mouse lines carrying a point mutation that renders the protein catalytically inactive. We report in this study that mice exclusively lacking the HAT activity of MOZ exhibit significant defects in the number of hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic committed precursors as well as a defect in B-cell development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the failure to maintain a normal number of hematopoietic precursors is caused by the inability of HAT(-/-) cells to expand.

Despite such severe outcomes of HTLV-1 infection, the level of HTLV-1 expression in vivo is very low and rapidly increases after transfer of cells to culture conditions. The mechanisms of this phenomenon have remained obscure. In the present study, we found that human and mouse stromal cells, such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts, suppressed HTLV-1 expression in ATL and non-ATL HTLV-1-infected cells. HTLV-1 mRNA and proteins in HTLV-1-infected cells markedly decreased upon coculture with human epithelial-like cells (HEK293T) or mouse embryo fibroblasts (NIH 3T3). When infected cells were reisolated from the cocultures, viral expression was restored to the original level over the following 48 h. Spontaneous induction of HTLV-1 expression in primary ATL cells in the first 24 h of culture was also inhibited by coculture with HEK293T cells. Coculture of HTLV-1-infected cells and HEK293T cells induced type I interferon responses, as detected by beta interferon (IFN-beta) promoter activation and IFN-stimulated gene upregulation. HEK293T-mediated suppression of HTLV-1 expression was partly inhibited by antibodies to human IFN-alpha/beta receptor. NIH 3T3-mediated suppression was markedly abrogated by neutralizing antibodies to mouse IFN-beta. Furthermore, viral expression in HTLV-1-infected cells was significantly suppressed when the infected cells were intraperitoneally injected into wild-type mice but not IFN regulatory factor 7 knockout mice that are deficient of type I IFN responses. These findings indicate that the innate immune system suppresses HTLV-1 expression in vivo, at least through type I IFN.","['Kinpara, Shuichi', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Nishitsuji, Hironori', 'Furukawa, Hiroyuki', 'Masuda, Takao', 'Kannagi, Mari']","['Kinpara S', 'Hasegawa A', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Nishitsuji H', 'Furukawa H', 'Masuda T', 'Kannagi M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Graduate School, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090304,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['156986-95-7 (Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon-beta/*immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta/immunology', 'Stromal Cells/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology']",2009/03/07 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/03/07 09:00'],"['2009/03/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02564-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02564-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 May;83(10):5101-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02564-08.

To determine whether estrogens might be implicated, we examined the effect of estradiol (E2) or 4-OH-E2 in an in vitro model of translocation susceptibility. Genomic DNA from the TK6 human lymphoblastoid cell line was screened by ligation mediated PCR and inverse PCR at a rearrangement hot spot within the MLL breakpoint cluster region to detect DNA aberrations. An increase in DNA double strand breaks was observed within this region after exposure to either E2 or 4-OH-E2. An increase in the frequency of MLL translocations was only found after exposure to E2. Induction of cleavage due to increased activation of apoptotic nucleases was excluded by pre-treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD.fmk.

Conventional cytogenetic and FISH studies with the standard panel (13q14, 11q13, 17p13, 12 centromere), and with IGH break-apart probes were done for each case. Abnormal karyotypes were detected with conventional cytogenetics in 29% of cases, and FISH detected abnormalities in 70%. Deletion of 13q14 was the most frequent anomaly, followed by trisomy 12, deletion of 11q, and deletion of 17p. Among the IGH abnormalities detected, translocations with unknown partners (split signals) occurred in only a small group of patients (15%). Instead, deletion of 5'IGH, corresponding to the variable IGH segment (IGH(V)) was the most recurrent aberration, observed in 82% (the second most common finding among our patients). This deletion was associated with good prognostic markers: 13q14 deletion, normal karyotype, and CD38 and ZAP-70 negative expression. Although not exclusive to CLL, the deletion occurred in a high frequency, in contrast to its rarity in other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.

The prognosis and clinical picture in MDS vary depending on patient-related factors (age, gender, comorbidity), the disease variant, cell types affected and genes involved in the malignant process. In fact, more and more data suggest that cytogenetic and molecular defects and gene variants are associated with the clinical course and prognosis in MDS. Although certain molecular defects are indicative of distinct cytogenetic abnormalities, others represent point mutations in critical target genes (RUNX1, N-RAS, JAK2, KIT, others) and sometimes are associated with a particular type of MDS, an overlap disease, a co-existing hematopoietic neoplasm or disease progression. Although most are somatic mutations, germ line mutations and gene polymorphisms have also been described in MDS. Some of these mutations may influence the natural course of disease, iron accumulation or disease progression.

METHODS: Two thousand four hundred and five patients with malignancy who had been hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University were pooled as case group. Two thousand and sixteen non-cancer people who finished health examinations in the Affiliated Yangcheng Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College were enrolled as control group. We compared glucose metabolism among patients with different kinds of malignancy. Based on logistic regression models, we analyzed factors that affect the development of carcinoma. RESULTS: (1) Among 2,408 malignancy patients, the total prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) reached 28.0%. Pancreatic cancer, lymphoma, liver cancer, leukemia, and colorectal cancer showed most striking hyperglycemia. (2) Leukemia and esophageal cancer accounting for 12.5% and 12.1%, respectively, were the most likely to suffer from hypoglycemia. (3) Older cancer patients seem to be more vulnerable to hyperglycemia, while the younger tend to be more likely to develop hypoglycemia. (4) High level of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was associated with lung cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, thyroid cancer, bladder cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Patients with DM increased risks for developing colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, thyroid cancer, cervical cancer, and pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: GMDs are frequent events in malignancy patients.

In the adjusted overall analysis, the odds ratio (OR) for SMN following any radiotherapy or chemotherapy is 2.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8-3.3] and 1.8 (95% CI: 0.98-3.1), respectively. The strongest effect is seen for alkylating agents (OR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-3.3). The risk of SMN after leukemia is pronounced for antimetabolites (OR=17.2, 95% CI: 1.7-177) and asparaginase (OR=4.3, 95% CI: 1.7-11.0). Following solid tumors, the greatest effect is seen for platinum derivatives (OR=4.1, 95% CI: 1.7-10.1). For anthracyclines, a decreased risk is observed (OR=0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.6). Secondary solid tumors are mainly associated with radiotherapy (OR=4.5, 95% CI: 2.5-8.0), especially secondary carcinomas. Secondary acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome are mainly associated with alkylating agents (OR=8.5, 95% CI: 0.97-74.8), asparaginase (OR=6.8, 95% CI: 2.3-20.6), and platinum derivatives (OR=4.5, 95% CI: 1.5-13.6). The observed risks are in many instances lower than the ones published in previous studies relating to earlier treatment eras of the primary diseases. These differences may be attributed to less toxic but still effective treatment regimes but also to differences in the length of follow-up.","['Kaatsch, Peter', 'Reinisch, Irene', 'Spix, Claudia', 'Berthold, Frank', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta', 'Mergenthaler, Andreas', 'Michaelis, Jorg', 'Blettner, Maria']","['Kaatsch P', 'Reinisch I', 'Spix C', 'Berthold F', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Mergenthaler A', 'Michaelis J', 'Blettner M']","['German Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 69, 55101 Mainz, Germany. kaatsch@imbei.uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090305,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Data Collection', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",2009/03/06 09:00,2009/08/20 09:00,['2009/03/06 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-009-9315-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2009 Aug;20(6):965-80. doi: 10.1007/s10552-009-9315-1.

In Egypt, we previously reported an association of increased NHL risk with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Our present aim is to assess the association between HCV infection and histological subtypes of NHL. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study at the National Cancer Institute of Cairo University. Cases with NHL (n = 486) were matched to controls (n = 786) who were orthopedic patients from the same referral regions. Participants provided a blood sample for HCV markers (anti-HCV, HCV RNA) and answered a questionnaire on possible risk factors. Case-control differences were assessed by odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals from logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Cases with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n = 146), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 58), marginal zone lymphoma (n = 24), follicular lymphoma (n = 23), and mantle cell lymphoma (n = 16) were recruited. HCV RNA prevalence was 27% in controls and 26%-48% in the NHL subgroups: it was associated (p < 0.001) with diffuse large B cell, marginal zone, and follicular lymphomas with odds ratios of 3.2, 4.4, and 3.3, respectively. CONCLUSION: HCV is a risk factor for diffuse large B cell, marginal zone, and follicular lymphomas in Egypt.","['Goldman, Lenka', 'Ezzat, Sameera', 'Mokhtar, Nadia', 'Abdel-Hamid, Amany', 'Fowler, Nathan', 'Gouda, Iman', 'Eissa, Soheir Abdel Latif', 'Abdel-Hamid, Mohamed', 'Loffredo, Christopher A']","['Goldman L', 'Ezzat S', 'Mokhtar N', 'Abdel-Hamid A', 'Fowler N', 'Gouda I', 'Eissa SA', 'Abdel-Hamid M', 'Loffredo CA']","['Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University, 3800 Reservoir Rd, PO Box 571465, Washington, DC 20057-1465, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090305,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/*complications', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/epidemiology/*virology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/epidemiology/*virology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology/*virology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prevalence', 'RNA, Viral/*blood', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2009/03/06 09:00,2009/08/20 09:00,['2009/03/06 09:00'],"['2008/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-009-9316-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2009 Aug;20(6):981-7. doi: 10.1007/s10552-009-9316-0.

In phase 1, 18 patients with chronic phase (CP) CML were treated with dasatinib 50, 70, or 90 mg twice daily to evaluate safety. Dasatinib <or= 90 mg twice daily was well tolerated. In phase 2, dasatinib 70 mg was given twice daily to CP-CML patients for 24 weeks and to CML patients in accelerated phase (AP)/blast crisis (BC) or Ph(+) ALL for 12 weeks. In the CP-CML group (n = 30) complete hematologic response was 90% and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) 53%.

Thirty-two mutations (19 frameshift, 10 nonsense, 3 missense; mostly involving exons 4 and 12) were identified for an overall mutational frequency of approximately 13%. Specific diagnoses included polycythemia vera (PV; n=89), essential thrombocythemia (ET; n=57), primary myelofibrosis (PMF; n=60), post-PV MF (n=14), post-ET MF (n=7) and blast phase PV/ET/MF (n=12); the corresponding mutational frequencies were approximately 16, 5, 17, 14, 14 and 17% (P=0.50). Mutant TET2 was detected in approximately 17 and approximately 7% of JAK2V617F-positive and -negative cases, respectively (P=0.04). However, this apparent clustering of the two mutations was accounted for by an independent association between mutant TET2 and advanced age; mutational frequency was approximately 23% in patients > or =60 years old versus approximately 4% in younger patients (P<0.0001). The presence of mutant TET2 did not affect survival, leukemic transformation or thrombosis in either PV or PMF; a correlation with hemoglobin <10 g per 100 ml in PMF was noted (P=0.05).

GO has improved the treatment outcome for a subgroup of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, but its use is associated with severe myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity. Here, we report on a novel anti-leukemia agent, designated scFvCD33:sTRAIL, in which an anti-CD33 single chain fragment of variable regions (scFv) antibody fragment is genetically linked to soluble tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL). Normal CD33-positive monocytes were fully resistant to prolonged treatment with scFvCD33:sTRAIL, whereas treatment with GO resulted in substantial cytotoxicity. The activity of scFvCD33:sTRAIL towards AML cells was up to 30-fold higher than GO. The CD33-restricted anti-leukemia activity of scFvCD33:sTRAIL remained stable during prolonged storage at 37 degrees C, whereas GO showed a rapid increase in CD33-independent cytotoxicity. Moreover, scFvCD33:sTRAIL showed potent anti-leukemia activity towards CD33+ CML cells when treatment was combined with the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Gleevec. Importantly, ex vivo treatment of patient-derived CD33+ AML tumor cells with scFvCD33:sTRAIL resulted in potent apoptosis induction that was enhanced by valproic acid, mitoxantrone and 17-(Allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). Taken together, scFvCD33:sTRAIL is superior to GO in terms of tumor selectivity, activity and stability, warranting its further development for the treatment of CD33-positive leukemias.","['ten Cate, B', 'Bremer, E', 'de Bruyn, M', 'Bijma, T', 'Samplonius, D', 'Schwemmlein, M', 'Huls, G', 'Fey, G', 'Helfrich, W']","['ten Cate B', 'Bremer E', 'de Bruyn M', 'Bijma T', 'Samplonius D', 'Schwemmlein M', 'Huls G', 'Fey G', 'Helfrich W']","['Laboratory for Tumor Immunology, Department of Pathology & Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090305,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)', '0 (scFvCD33-sTRAIL protein)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aminoglycosides/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bystander Effect', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Stability', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Single-Chain Antibodies', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2009/03/06 09:00,2009/09/22 06:00,['2009/03/06 09:00'],"['2009/03/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu200934 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.34 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Aug;23(8):1389-97. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.34.

AIM: This study was designed to assess the prevalence and impact of parvovirus B19 in pediatric oncology patients receiving chemotherapy, and to define the optimal diagnostic tests in such patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine children under chemotherapy (39 with acute lymphocytic leukemia and 20 with solid tumors) with mean age of 4.96+/-1.94 years, in addition to 30 healthy children of matched age and sex, were enrolled in this study. Clinical and laboratory data were collected by examination and from patients' records. Specific parvovirus B19 immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibodies were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and parvovirus DNA was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for all patients and controls. RESULTS: Parvovirus DNA was detected in 16 (27.1%), IgM in 3 (5.1%), and IgG in 36 (61%) patients. IgM had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18.75%, 100%, and 77.9%, respectively, whereas those of IgG were 81.25%, 53.4%, and 61%, respectively. PCR-positive patients had significantly higher frequency of unexplained anemia, red blood cell transfusions, and longer hospital stay than PCR-negative patients (P<0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that unexplained anemia and multiple red blood cell transfusions were the most important variables that can predict PCR positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Parvovirus B19 is not an uncommon problem in pediatric oncology patients who exhibited weak antibody response and nonspecific clinical features. Screening of these patients with PCR rather than serology is recommended when infection is suspected.","['Soliman, Othman El-Sayed', 'Abd El-Aal Hegazi Hasan, Moustafa', 'El-Ashry, Rasha', 'Zaghloul, Mohammad Hosam Eldeen', 'Kora, Bothina']","['Soliman Oel-S', 'Abd El-Aal Hegazi Hasan M', 'El-Ashry R', 'Zaghloul MH', 'Kora B']","[""Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University Children's Hospital, Mansoura, Egypt. oesoliman65@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Parvoviridae Infections/*blood/*diagnosis/*immunology', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/genetics', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2009/03/06 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/03/06 09:00'],"['2009/03/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181983b2d [doi]', '00043426-200903000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Mar;31(3):173-6. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181983b2d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 36-year-old woman with ALL received antifungal therapy for pulmonary fungal infections. On day 17 of itraconazole treatment, she developed hypotension and hypoxemia shock after intravenous administration of itraconazole 200 mg, which was eventually reversed by steroid treatment. On days 18 and 19, the patient developed the same type of shock 2 more times in the course of itraconazole administration. These 2 episodes of shock occurred more quickly after intravenous itraconazole administration (100 mg on day 18, 40 mg on day 19), and were reversed by stopping itraconazole and applying steroid treatment. In the modified antifungal therapy, intravenous administration of itraconazole was replaced by oral administration of voriconazole 200 mg twice daily. Shock did not recur after discontinuation of itraconazole treatment. The Naranjo probability scale showed a probable relationship between itraconazole treatment and shock occurrence. DISCUSSION: Itraconazole is a widely used antifungal drugs and is well tolerated. However, long-term itraconazole treatment might lead to serious and even life-threatening adverse effects such as anaphylactic shock, as seen in our patient. T cell reduction caused by immunosuppression and itraconazole accumulation in patients with ALL are considered to be important causal factors for this delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Anaphylactic shock represents a previously undocumented severe adverse effect associated with long-term itraconazole treatment; patients receiving this therapy and should be monitored closely.","['Chen, Jie', 'Song, Xianmin', 'Yang, Peng', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Chen J', 'Song X', 'Yang P', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090303,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anaphylaxis/chemically induced', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Drug Hypersensitivity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypotension/chemically induced', 'Hypoxia/*chemically induced', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Itraconazole/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/drug therapy']",2009/03/06 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2009/03/06 09:00'],"['2009/03/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']","['aph.1L343 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1L343 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2009 Mar;43(3):537-41. doi: 10.1345/aph.1L343.

Although the impact of PML expression in driving cell fate decisions for injured cells is well established, the function of PML in the context of tissue development is less well understood. Here, the in vivo role of PML in developmental processes in the murine mammary gland has been investigated. Data are presented showing that expression of PML is tightly regulated by three members of the Stat family of transcription factors that orchestrate the functional development of the mammary secretory epithelium during pregnancy. Developmental phenotypes were also discovered in the virgin and pregnant Pml null mouse, typified by aberrant differentiation of mammary epithelia with reduced ductal and alveolar development. PML depletion was also found to disturb the balance of two distinct luminal progenitor populations. Overall, it is shown that PML is required for cell lineage determination in bi-potent luminal progenitor cells and that the precise regulation of PML expression is required for functional differentiation of alveolar cells.","['Li, Wenjing', 'Ferguson, Brian J', 'Khaled, Walid T', 'Tevendale, Maxine', 'Stingl, John', 'Poli, Valeria', 'Rich, Tina', 'Salomoni, Paolo', 'Watson, Christine J']","['Li W', 'Ferguson BJ', 'Khaled WT', 'Tevendale M', 'Stingl J', 'Poli V', 'Rich T', 'Salomoni P', 'Watson CJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QP, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090304,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/*cytology/*growth & development', 'Mice', 'Morphogenesis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism']",2009/03/06 09:00,2009/04/09 09:00,['2009/03/06 09:00'],"['2009/03/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [medline]']","['0807640106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0807640106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Mar 24;106(12):4725-30. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0807640106.

We examined whether the transcription factor Friend leukemia integration-1 (Fli-1) might be involved in this process. Fli-1-knockdown mice demonstrated greater cardiac collagen-1 expression and fibrosis compared with wild-type mice; both developed increased cardiac collagen expression and fibrosis after 5/6 nephrectomy. There was a strong inverse relationship between the expressions of Fli-1 and procollagen in primary culture of rat cardiac and human dermal fibroblasts as well as a cell line derived from renal fibroblasts and MBG-induced decreases in nuclear Fli-1 as well as increases in procollagen-1 expression in these cells. Transfection of a Fli-1 expression vector prevented increased procollagen-1 expression from MBG. MBG exposure induced a rapid translocation of the delta-isoform of protein kinase C (PKCdelta) to the nucleus. This translocation was prevented by pharmacological inhibition of phospholipase C, and MBG-induced increases in procollagen-1 expression were prevented with a PKCdelta- but not a PKCalpha-specific inhibitor. Finally, immunoprecipitation studies strongly suggest that MBG induced phosphorylation of Fli-1. We feel these data support a causal relationship with MBG-induced translocation of PKCdelta, which results in phosphorylation of as well as decreases in nuclear Fli-1 expression, which, in turn, leads to increases in collagen production. Should these findings be confirmed, we speculate that this pathway may represent a therapeutic target for uremic cardiomyopathy as well as other conditions associated with excessive fibrosis.","['Elkareh, Jihad', 'Periyasamy, Sankaridrug M', 'Shidyak, Amjad', 'Vetteth, Sandeep', 'Schroeder, Jeremy', 'Raju, Vanamala', 'Hariri, Imad M', 'El-Okdi, Nasser', 'Gupta, Shalini', 'Fedorova, Larisa', 'Liu, Jiang', 'Fedorova, Olga V', 'Kahaleh, M Bashar', 'Xie, Zijian', 'Malhotra, Deepak', 'Watson, Dennis K', 'Bagrov, Alexei Y', 'Shapiro, Joseph I']","['Elkareh J', 'Periyasamy SM', 'Shidyak A', 'Vetteth S', 'Schroeder J', 'Raju V', 'Hariri IM', 'El-Okdi N', 'Gupta S', 'Fedorova L', 'Liu J', 'Fedorova OV', 'Kahaleh MB', 'Xie Z', 'Malhotra D', 'Watson DK', 'Bagrov AY', 'Shapiro JI']","['Department of Medicine, University of Toledo College of Medicine, Toledo, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090304,United States,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation (9;22) that generates the Bcr-Abl fusion gene. The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated by Bcr-Abl chimera protein and mediates the leukemogenesis in CML. However, the mechanism by which Bcr-Abl activates the PI3K/Akt pathway is not completely understood. In the present study, we found that pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatases 1 and 2 (PHLPP1 and PHLPP2) were depleted in CML cells. We investigated the interaction between PHLPPs and Bcr-Abl in CML cell lines and Bcr-Abl+ progenitor cells from CML patients. The Abl kinase inhibitors and depletion of Bcr-Abl induced the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, which dephosphorylated Ser-473 on Akt1, -2, and -3, resulting in inhibited proliferation of CML cells. The reduction of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 expression by short interfering RNA in CML cells weakened the Abl kinase inhibitor-mediated inhibition of proliferation. In colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte; colony-forming unit-granulocyte, macrophage; and burst-forming unit-erythroid, treatment with the Abl kinase inhibitors and depletion of Bcr-Abl induced PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 expression and inhibited colony formation of Bcr-Abl+ progenitor cells, whereas depletion of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 weakened the inhibition of colony formation activity by the Abl kinase inhibitors in Bcr-Abl+ progenitor cells. Thus, Bcr-Abl represses the expression of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 and continuously activates Akt1, -2, and -3 via phosphorylation on Ser-473, resulting in the proliferation of CML cells.","['Hirano, Isao', 'Nakamura, Satoki', 'Yokota, Daisuke', 'Ono, Takaaki', 'Shigeno, Kazuyuki', 'Fujisawa, Shinya', 'Shinjo, Kaori', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori']","['Hirano I', 'Nakamura S', 'Yokota D', 'Ono T', 'Shigeno K', 'Fujisawa S', 'Shinjo K', 'Ohnishi K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan; Cancer Center, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan; Cancer Center, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan; Cancer Center, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Hamamatsu Medical Center, 328 Tomitsuka, Naka-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 432-8580, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan; Cancer Center, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka 431-3192, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090304,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PHLPP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PHLPP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2009/03/06 09:00,2009/09/15 06:00,['2009/03/06 09:00'],"['2009/03/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(18)49422-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M808182200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Aug 14;284(33):22155-22165. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M808182200.

This study aimed to detect parvovirus B19 DNA together with its antibodies in the sera of children with recent acute leukemia and those with acute leukemia receiving chemotherapy to clarify the contribution of this infection to changes observed in hematological and clinical presentations in these populations. Two groups were included: Group I comprised 45 children with acute leukemia receiving chemotherapy and Group II comprised 40 children with recently diagnosed acute leukemia. Serum parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and the virus DNA was sought by polymerase chain reaction assay. Viral DNA was found in 22.2% of Group I patients and in 45% of Group II patients. Hemoglobin levels were significantly reduced in patients with recent infection, accompanied by statistically significant lymphocytosis in Group I patients. Group II patients with recent infection had marked neutropenia with lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia. There was statistically significant lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly in patients with recent infection in both groups. Parvovirus B19 infection is an important cause of cytopenia in children with acute leukemia both when recently diagnosed and receiving chemotherapy. This can affect the schedule of chemotherapy.

Despite the success of this target-directed therapy, imatinib resistance is an emerging problem, especially in advanced stages of CML. In this study, we explored the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model eukaryotic system to better understand the mode of action of imatinib, as well as potential mechanisms of resistance to this drug. Using a systematic approach, we screened a yeast haploid deletion collection with individual knockouts of most nonessential yeast genes, and identified 51 genes that are required for yeast resistance to imatinib. The genes identified are involved mainly in DNA repair and transcription control, cell cycle control and differentiation, vacuolar pH homeostasis, vesicular transport, and protein trafficking. Remarkably, approximately 80% of the genes identified in our screen have human orthologs. The vacuolar pH homeostasis function is associated to our dataset by 13 genes that encode subunits and assembly factors of the yeast vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase). Further studies using fluorescence microscopy showed that physiological acidification of the vacuole is severely compromised following imatinib treatment of yeast cells, an effect that was found to be dose dependent. Results suggest that imatinib might act as an effective inhibitor of V-ATPase function in yeast, identifying V-ATPase activity and vacuolar function as novel imatinib targets.","['dos Santos, Sandra C', 'Sa-Correia, Isabel']","['dos Santos SC', 'Sa-Correia I']","['IBB-Institute for Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Centre for Biological and Chemical Engineering, Instituto Superior Tecnico, Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,OMICS,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal/*genetics', 'Genome, Fungal', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae/drug effects/genetics/growth & development', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Stress, Physiological', 'Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/03/06 09:00,2009/10/15 06:00,['2009/03/06 09:00'],"['2009/03/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/omi.2008.0086 [doi]'],ppublish,OMICS. 2009 Jun;13(3):185-98. doi: 10.1089/omi.2008.0086.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve the safety and efficacy of lentivector vaccination, we sought to target vector transduction to antigen-presenting cells by modifying the viral envelope. To do this we screened a nonimmunized human single-chain antibody phage display library for phage that bound mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and isolated three single-chain antibodies (scFvs) that bound to more than 20% of cells in the BMDC culture. The three scFvs also bound to dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, and B cells from mouse spleen, but not to neutrophils, eosinophils, or T cells. Immunoblotting demonstrated that two unique scFvs, C2 and C7, recognized MHC class II. We constructed chimeric envelope proteins, by fusing these two scFvs to the amino terminus of the amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope (MLV-A). These chimeric envelopes were expressed on the surface of lentiviral vector particles and enhanced infection (5- to 10-fold) of BMDC cultures, compared with lentiviral vectors with unmodified MLV-A envelope. Similarly, the chimeric envelopes enhanced (10- to 20-fold) the infection of primary lymph node class II-positive cells. One of the envelopes, C2, gave increased interferon-gamma production from splenocytes of vaccinated mice compared with MLV-A, achieving a level similar to that obtained with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G, when used to deliver an ovalbumin model antigen gene. These results demonstrate that surface-targeting lentiviral vector transduction of antigen-presenting cells gives efficient and potentially safer immunization.","['Gennari, Francesca', 'Lopes, Luciene', 'Verhoeyen, Els', 'Marasco, Wayne', 'Collins, Mary K']","['Gennari F', 'Lopes L', 'Verhoeyen E', 'Marasco W', 'Collins MK']","['Infection and Immunity, University College London , London W1T4JF, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/*immunology', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/virology', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Peptide Library', 'Spleen/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Virion/pathogenicity']",2009/03/06 09:00,2009/08/19 09:00,['2009/03/06 09:00'],"['2009/03/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2008.189 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2009 Jun;20(6):554-62. doi: 10.1089/hum.2008.189.,,,,"['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of the overall profile, 6-azido-5-fluoro and 6-amino-5-fluoro uridine derivatives exhibited potential for further investigations.","['Bello, Angelica M', 'Konforte, Danijela', 'Poduch, Ewa', 'Furlonger, Caren', 'Wei, Lianhu', 'Liu, Yan', 'Lewis, Melissa', 'Pai, Emil F', 'Paige, Christopher J', 'Kotra, Lakshmi P']","['Bello AM', 'Konforte D', 'Poduch E', 'Furlonger C', 'Wei L', 'Liu Y', 'Lewis M', 'Pai EF', 'Paige CJ', 'Kotra LP']","['Center for Molecular Design and Preformulations and Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Toronto General Research Institute, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2C4, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', ""EC 4.1.1.23 (Orotidine-5'-Phosphate Decarboxylase)""]",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', ""Orotidine-5'-Phosphate Decarboxylase/*antagonists & inhibitors"", 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2009/03/06 09:00,2009/04/21 09:00,['2009/03/06 09:00'],"['2009/03/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jm801224t [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2009 Mar 26;52(6):1648-58. doi: 10.1021/jm801224t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: All data were from the Shanghai Cancer Registry. Time trends of period 1973-2005 in urban Shanghai of males and females were assessed by annual percentage change of incidence. The current characteristics of Shanghai childhood cancer average annual incidence were analyzed regarding sex, age, and cancer types. All cancers were allocated into 12 major groupings of ICCC. RESULTS: Over the 33-year period, the overall age-standardized incidence rate for all cancers combined has no substantial change or trend in urban Shanghai aged 0-14. A total of 609 cases of childhood cancer were diagnosed in Shanghai from 2002 to 2005. The ASR of 2002-2005 is 129.0 per million for all cancers combined, and it was almost similar in males (128.5 per million) and in females (129.6 per million). Incidence rates are highest in the first 5 years of life with 173.3 per million. Leukaemia was the most common cancer (34.5%). Brain and spinal tumour was the second most common cancer (20.2%), followed by lymphomas (8.4%). The relative frequencies of Wilms tumour (2.0%) and Ewing sarcoma (0.5%) were lower than those reported from western countries. CONCLUSION: During 1973-2005, the trend of childhood cancer incidence in urban Shanghai has shown no significant change. Incidence of childhood cancers in Shanghai was in the medium level compared to other parts of the world and the relative frequencies of various cancers were comparable.","['Bao, Ping-Ping', 'Zheng, Ying', 'Wang, Chun-Fang', 'Gu, Kai', 'Jin, Fan', 'Lu, Wei']","['Bao PP', 'Zheng Y', 'Wang CF', 'Gu K', 'Jin F', 'Lu W']","['Shanghai Cancer Registry, Department of Cancer Control & Prevention, Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Prevention & Control, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Brain Neoplasms/classification/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/epidemiology', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/epidemiology', 'Sex Distribution', 'Urban Population', 'Wilms Tumor/epidemiology']",2009/03/05 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/03/05 09:00'],"['2009/03/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21939 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jul;53(1):13-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21939.,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jul;53(1):1-2.

This leads to a decreased ability to convert cytarabine into its inactive metabolite, resulting in high intracellular concentration of this cytotoxic agent.

Information is needed about how TH has been impacted by changes in ALL therapy. This study examined the prevalence of TH in a cohort of pediatric ALL patients and the impact on TH of type of steroid or asparaginase used and of risk factors such as age, gender, and overweight. METHODS: Retrospective record review of patients aged 2-18 years diagnosed with ALL in 1999-2006. TH was defined as >or=2 random glucose values >or=200 mg/dl. Overall prevalence of TH was calculated. Risk factors were evaluated using Chi-square analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-two subjects (70 female) were reviewed, 33 (20.4%) of whom had TH. 42.2% of subjects over age 10 years had TH, compared to 12.0% of younger children (P < 0.001). No gender difference was found. Overweight (BMI >or= 95th percentile) and at risk for overweight (BMI >or= 85th percentile) were significant risk factors for TH (P = 0.007 and P = 0.003, respectively). Native L-asparaginase was associated with increased TH compared to PEG-asparaginase (P = 0.047). There was a non-significant trend toward more TH in patients who received prednisone, but this disappeared in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of TH in this study was higher than previously reported. Overweight, age >or=10 years, and use of native L-asparaginase were significant predictors of TH.","['Lowas, Stefanie R', 'Marks, Daniel', 'Malempati, Suman']","['Lowas SR', 'Marks D', 'Malempati S']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA. stefanie.r.lowas@vanderbilt.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prevalence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2009/03/05 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2009/03/05 09:00'],"['2009/03/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21980 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jul;52(7):814-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21980.,,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

This may make leukaemic cells easier to target by immunotherapy than in other types of cancer. Various immunotherapy strategies have been trialled in several leukaemias including chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and in general, these have been aimed at targeting tumour-associated antigens (TAA). There are numerous TAA expressed by CML patients including WT1, proteinase 3, BCR-ABL and HAGE amongst others. The immunogenicity of the CML-specific tumour antigen, BCR-ABL, has been the subject of much debate and its role in the development of the disease and its unique sequence spanning the breakpoint region make it an ideal target for immunotherapy. However, there are a limited number of immunogenic epitopes across the junctional region, which are restricted to only a few HLA types, namely A2, A3 and B7 (Clark et al. in Blood 98:2887-2893, 2001). The second CML-associated antigen is the helicase antigen HAGE, a cancer-testis antigen found to be over-expressed in more than 50% of myeloid leukaemias (Adams et al. in Leukaemia 16:2238-2242, 2002). Very little is known about the function of this antigen and its significance to CML. However, its membership of the DEAD-box family of ATP-dependent RNA helicases and the involvement of other members of this family in tumour cell proliferation (Eberle et al. in Br J Cancer 86:1957-1962, 2002; Yang et al. in Cell Signal 17:1495-504, 2005) suggest a crucial role in the RNA metabolism of tumour cells. For these reasons, HAGE also seems to be a good target for immunotherapy as it would be applicable for the majority of patients with CML. This review aims to discuss the potential of immunotherapy for the treatment of leukaemia, in particular CML, and the prospect of targeting three CML associated antigens: BCR, ABL and HAGE. During his career, Prof. Tony Dodi made a significant contribution in this area of leukaemia research, confirming the identity of immunogenic HLA-A3 and B7-restricted peptides as targets for CTL. Published, as a highlighted paper in Clark et al. (Blood 98:2887-2893, 2001), this study demonstrated the expression of MHC-peptide complexes on the surface of CML cells and the presence of tetramer-positive CTL activity in CML patients positive for these two HLA alleles. His drive and dedication for research excellence will be remembered by all who knew and worked with him.","['Riley, Catherine L', 'Mathieu, Morgan G', 'Clark, Richard E', 'McArdle, Stephanie E B', 'Rees, Robert C']","['Riley CL', 'Mathieu MG', 'Clark RE', 'McArdle SE', 'Rees RC']","['The John Van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham NG11 8NS, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090304,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology']",2009/03/05 09:00,2009/08/01 09:00,['2009/03/05 09:00'],"['2008/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/01 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-009-0675-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2009 Sep;58(9):1489-99. doi: 10.1007/s00262-009-0675-x.

ETV6 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor (TF) of the ETS family with very few known targeted genes. We recently compiled a list of 87 ETV6-modulated genes that can be classified into a number of subgroups based on their coordinated expression patterns. In the present report, we hypothesized that genes presenting a similar profile of modulation could also share biological features, promoter sequence similarities and/or, common transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Using an exploratory approach based on hierarchical clustering of expression data, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, sequence similarity and evolutionary conserved putative TFBSs, we found that many genes presenting a similar expression profile also share biological features and/or conserved predicted TFBSs but rarely show detectable promoter sequence similarities. We also calculated the proportion of ETV6-modulated genes that have any conserved TFBSs of the Jaspar database in their regulatory sequence and compared these proportions to those calculated for two other gene lists, ETV6 non-modulated and ETS-regulated. We found that the NF-kB, c-REL and p65 TFBSs, which all bind TFs of the REL class, were under-represented among the ETV6-modulated genes compared to the ETV6-non-modulated genes, while the Broad-complex 1 TFBS appeared to be over-represented. NF-Y and Chop/cEBP TFBSs were over-represented in the promoters of ETV6-modulated genes compared to ETS-regulated genes. These analyses will help direct further studies intending to understand the role of ETV6 as a transcriptional regulator and aid in constructing the ETV6-regulatory gene network.","['Boily, Gino', 'Beaulieu, Patrick', 'Healy, Jasmine', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Boily G', 'Beaulieu P', 'Healy J', 'Sinnett D']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Research Center, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080421,United States,Cancer Inform,Cancer informatics,101258149,,,,2008/01/01 00:00,2008/01/01 00:01,['2009/03/05 09:00'],"['2009/03/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4137/cin.s556 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Inform. 2008;6:183-201. doi: 10.4137/cin.s556.

From the US Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, 13 486 myeloid malignancy patients (aged 67+ years) and 160 086 population-based controls were selected. Logistic regression models adjusted for gender, age, race, calendar year and number of physician claims were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for myeloid malignancies in relation to autoimmune conditions. Multiple comparisons were controlled for using the Bonferroni correction (P<0.0005). Autoimmune conditions, overall, were associated with an increased risk of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (OR 1.29) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, OR 1.50). Specifically, AML was associated with rheumatoid arthritis (OR 1.28), systemic lupus erythematosus (OR 1.92), polymyalgia rheumatica (OR 1.73), autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (OR 3.74), systemic vasculitis (OR 6.23), ulcerative colitis (OR 1.72) and pernicious anaemia (OR 1.57). Myelodysplastic syndrome was associated with rheumatoid arthritis (OR1.52) and pernicious anaemia (OR 2.38). Overall, autoimmune conditions were not associated with chronic myeloid leukaemia (OR 1.09) or chronic myeloproliferative disorders (OR 1.15). Medications used to treat autoimmune conditions, shared genetic predisposition and/or direct infiltration of bone marrow by autoimmune conditions, could explain these excess risks of myeloid malignancies.","['Anderson, L A', 'Pfeiffer, R M', 'Landgren, O', 'Gadalla, S', 'Berndt, S I', 'Engels, E A']","['Anderson LA', 'Pfeiffer RM', 'Landgren O', 'Gadalla S', 'Berndt SI', 'Engels EA']","[""Centre for Public Health, Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK. l.anderson@qub.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*complications/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",2009/03/05 09:00,2009/04/11 09:00,['2009/03/05 09:00'],"['2009/03/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [medline]']","['6604935 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6604935 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2009 Mar 10;100(5):822-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604935.,['Acta Haematol. 2016;136(2):108-17.

Human Bcr-Abl(+) K562 cells were incubated with imatinib in a dose-escalating manner (starting at 0.1 microM with a weekly increase of 0.1 microM imatinib) for up to 5 weeks. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry were performed to assess a global metabolic profile, including glucose metabolism, energy state, lipid metabolism and drug uptake, after incubation with imatinib. Initially, imatinib treatment completely inhibited the activity of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, followed by the inhibition of cell glycolytic activity and glucose uptake. This was accompanied by the increased mitochondrial activity and energy production. With escalating imatinib doses, the process of cell death rapidly progressed. Phosphocreatine and NAD(+) concentrations began to decrease, and mitochondrial activity, as well as the glycolysis rate, was further reduced. Subsequently, the synthesis of lipids as necessary membrane precursors for apoptotic bodies was accelerated. The concentrations of the Kennedy pathway intermediates, phosphocholine and phosphatidylcholine, were reduced. After 4 weeks of exposure to imatinib, the secondary necrosis associated with decrease in the mitochondrial and glycolytic activity occurred and was followed by a shutdown of energy production and cell death. In conclusion, monitoring of metabolic changes in cells exposed to novel signal transduction modulators supplements molecular findings and provides further mechanistic insights into longitudinal changes of the mitochondrial and glycolytic pathways of oncogenesis.","['Klawitter, J', 'Anderson, N', 'Klawitter, J', 'Christians, U', 'Leibfritz, D', 'Eckhardt, S G', 'Serkova, N J']","['Klawitter J', 'Anderson N', 'Klawitter J', 'Christians U', 'Leibfritz D', 'Eckhardt SG', 'Serkova NJ']","['Department of Anesthesiology, University of Colorado, Denver, CO 80045, USA.

HCL-variant describes an entity of HCL that is important from the point of view of requiring differential diagnosis from HCL, and for requiring careful consideration of the treatment approach. HCL-variant differs from the classic form with respect to the lack of monocytopaenia, its elevated WBC and unique morphology and immunophenotype. Indeed, there is currently no adequate standard treatment for this condition - HCL-variant is generally resistant to interferon-alpha, and complete remission is rarely achieved with either pentostatin or cladribine. We report a 57-year-old female patient who presented at our institution in November 2004 with high white blood counts and splenomegaly. Based on her blood morphology, bone marrow and spleen histology, immunophenotype and clinical characteristics, the patient was diagnosed as having HCL-variant, with blastoid variant transformation. The patient had advanced-stage disease. She was initially treated with spleenctomy, which resulted in short-term normalization of blood counts. One month later the blood counts deteriorated, she developed peripheral and abdominal lymphadenopathy and had poor performance status. One cycle of cladribine combined with rituximab was immediately administered. We started with rituximab 375 mg/m(2), which resulted in a remarkable recovery of blood counts, followed by cladribine 0.1 mg/kg for 7 days. However, the patient's general condition worsened, and she subsequently died from heart failure. Our experience from this case suggests that rituximab is a promising therapy for patients with HCL-variant, particularly when combined with cladribine. However, further clinical study is required before rituximab can be considered as a front-line therapy for this form of malignancy.","['Hadzi-Pecova, Liljana', 'Stojanovik, A', 'Petrusevska, G', 'Panovska, I']","['Hadzi-Pecova L', 'Stojanovik A', 'Petrusevska G', 'Panovska I']","['Haematology Department, Clinical Centre, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia. lhpecova@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Prilozi,Prilozi,101189513,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab']",2009/03/05 09:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/03/05 09:00'],"['2009/03/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Prilozi. 2008 Dec;29(2):355-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because platelets are anuclear, their collagen receptors must be expressed by megakaryocytes, platelet precursors that arise in the collagen-rich environment of the bone marrow. Whether and how megakaryocytes regulate collagen adhesion during their development in the bone marrow are unknown. We find that surface expression of activated, but not wild-type, alpha2 integrins in hematopoietic cells in vivo results in the generation of platelets that lack surface alpha2 receptors. Culture of hematopoietic progenitor cells ex vivo reveals that surface levels of activated, but not wild-type, alpha2 integrin receptors are rapidly down-regulated during cell growth on collagen but reach wild-type levels when cells are grown in the absence of collagen. Progenitor cells that express activated alpha2 integrins are normally distributed in the bone marrow in vivo and exhibit normal migration across a collagen-coated membrane ex vivo. This migration is accompanied by rapid down-regulation of activated surface integrins.

Here, microRNAs (miRNA), which act as negative regulators of gene expression principally through translational repression, are investigated for the mediation of high CREB protein levels. A series of miRNAs that target CREB were identified. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that miR-34b was expressed significantly less in myeloid cell lines, previously known for high CREB protein levels. Exogenous miR-34b expression was induced, and results revealed a direct interaction with the CREB 3'-untranslated region, with the consequent reduction of the CREB protein levels in vitro. miR-34b restored expression caused cell cycle abnormalities, reduced anchorage-independent growth, and altered CREB target gene expression, suggesting its suppressor potential. Using reverse-phase protein array, CREB target proteins (BCL-2, cyclin A1, cyclin B1, cyclin D, nuclear factor-kappaB, Janus-activated kinase 1, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), as well as many downstream protein kinases and cell survival signaling pathways (AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin and extracellular signal-regulated kinase) usually elicited by CREB, were observed to have decreased. The miR-34b/miR-34c promoter was shown to be methylated in the leukemia cell lines used. This epigenetic regulation should control the observed miR-34b expression levels to maintain the CREB protein overexpressed. In addition, the inverse correlation between miR-34b and CREB expression was found in a cohort of 78 pediatric patients at diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, supporting this relationship in vivo. Our results identify a direct miR-34b target gene, provide a possible mechanism for CREB overexpression, and provide new information about myeloid transformation and therapeutic strategies.","['Pigazzi, Martina', 'Manara, Elena', 'Baron, Emma', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Pigazzi M', 'Manara E', 'Baron E', 'Basso G']","['Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Padova, Italy. martina.pigazzi@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090303,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Acute Disease', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2009/03/05 09:00,2009/05/14 09:00,['2009/03/05 09:00'],"['2009/03/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/14 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-3404 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3404 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Mar 15;69(6):2471-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3404.

Recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial uncoupling-the abrogation of ATP synthesis in response to mitochondrial membrane potential-promotes the Warburg effect in leukemia cells, and may contribute to chemoresistance. Intriguingly, leukemia cells cultured on bone marrow-derived stromal feeder layers are more resistant to chemotherapy, increase the expression of uncoupling protein 2, and decrease the entry of pyruvate into the Krebs cycle-without compromising the consumption of oxygen, suggesting a shift to the oxidation of nonglucose carbon sources to maintain mitochondrial integrity and function. Because fatty acid oxidation has been linked to chemoresistance and mitochondrial uncoupling, it is tempting to speculate that Warburg's observations may indeed be the result of the preferential oxidation of fatty acids by cancer cell mitochondria. Therefore, targeting fatty acid oxidation or anaplerotic pathways that support fatty acid oxidation may provide additional therapeutic tools for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies.","['Samudio, Ismael', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Samudio I', 'Fiegl M', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

Following administration, sunitinib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 to an active metabolite (SU12662). The objective of this analysis was to assess sunitinib and SU12662 pharmacokinetics and to identify covariates that might explain variability in exposure following oral administration. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Data from 590 subjects (73 volunteers and 517 patients) in 14 studies were analyzed. Plasma concentration-time data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling to estimate population pharmacokinetic parameters, as well as relationships between these parameters and gender, race, age, weight, creatinine clearance, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, and tumor type. Simulations were done to determine the predicted effect of these covariates on exposure. RESULTS: Separate models were developed for sunitinib and SU12662 (each a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination). Sunitinib parameters were estimated as CL/F, 51.8 L/h and Vd/F(central), 2,030 liters. SU12662 parameters were estimated as CL/F, 29.6 L/h and Vd/F(central), 3,080 liters. Tumor type (except acute myeloid leukemia), Asian race, gender, body weight, and elevated Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score described a portion of the variability in CL/F for sunitinib and metabolite; gender and body weight explained some of the variability in Vd/F(central) for sunitinib and metabolite. Among patients, the predicted changes in sunitinib and metabolite AUC and C(max) as a result of the individual covariates ranged up to 17%. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of the predicted changes in exposure with the covariates studied minimizes the necessity for dose adjustment in any of these subpopulations.","['Houk, Brett E', 'Bello, Carlo L', 'Kang, Dongwoo', 'Amantea, Michael']","['Houk BE', 'Bello CL', 'Kang D', 'Amantea M']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Pfizer, Inc, La Jolla, California 92121, USA.

APT antibody was labeled with 111In using ethylenedicysteine (EC) as a chelator. To determine if 111In-EC-APT could assess a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, xenografts of the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 were used. gamma-Scintigraphy of the tumor-bearing mice, before and after imatinib treatment, was obtained 1, 24, and 48 h after they were given 111In-EC-APT (100 microCi/mouse i.v.). 111In-EC-APT is preferentially taken up by Bcr-Abl-bearing tumor cells when compared with 111In-EC-BSA or 111In-EC-IgG1 controls and comparable with the level of uptake of 111In-EC-Bcr-Abl. Imatinib treatment resulted in decreased expression of phospho-Bcr-Abl by Western blot analysis, which correlated with early (4 days after starting imatinib) kinase down-regulation as assessed by imaging using 111In-EC-APT. The optimal time to imaging was 24 and 48 h after injection of 111In-EC-APT. Although tumor regression was insignificant on day 4 after starting imatinib treatment, it was marked by day 14. 111In-EC-APT can assess intracellular phosphokinase activity, and down-regulation of phosphokinase activity predates tumor regression. This technique may therefore be useful in the clinic to detect the presence of phosphokinase activity and for early prediction of response.","['Wu, Ji Yuan', 'Yang, David J', 'Angelo, Laura S', 'Kohanim, Saady', 'Kurzrock, Razelle']","['Wu JY', 'Yang DJ', 'Angelo LS', 'Kohanim S', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics (Phase I Program), Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas M.

Induction therapy consisted of standard treatment with all-trans-retinoic-acid (ATRA) and idarubicin. Subsequent cytological and molecular ana?lysis of bone marrow demonstrated complete hematological and molecular remission. Due to the poor general condition, consolidation treatment with ATRA was given in March and April 2007. The last follow-up 14 months later, showed sustained molecular APL remission.

A total of 128 case subjects and 128 control subjects were enrolled in this study. The information was collected using a structured questionnaire and a global positioning system (GPS) device. All factors were analyzed using unmatched logistic regression. RESULTS: The analysis showed that the occurrence of acute leukemia among children was strongly determined by the following factors: family income (odds ratio (OR) 0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09-0.42), father with higher social contact (OR 7.61, 95% CI: 3.78-15.4), number of elder siblings (OR 0.36, 95% CI: 0.18-0.77), father who smokes (OR 2.78, 95% CI: 1.49-5.16), and the distance of the house from a power line (OR 2.30, 95% CI: 1.18-4.49). CONCLUSIONS: Some socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors are strong predictors of the occurrence of acute leukemia among children in Klang Valley, Malaysia. In terms of environmental factors, it is recommended that future housing areas should be developed at least 200 m away from power lines.","['Abdul Rahman, Hairul Izwan', 'Shah, Shamsul Azhar', 'Alias, Hamidah', 'Ibrahim, Hishamshah Mohd']","['Abdul Rahman HI', 'Shah SA', 'Alias H', 'Ibrahim HM']","['Community Health Dept, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Air Pollution, Indoor/*statistics & numerical data', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Developing Countries', 'Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Environmental Pollution/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Malaysia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Distribution', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",2009/03/05 09:00,2009/05/29 09:00,['2009/03/05 09:00'],"['2009/03/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2008 Oct-Dec;9(4):649-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first report of a translocation in myeloid leukemia occurring only in the promoter/enhancer regions of the two genes involved, similar to translocations commonly found in lymphoid malignancies. Analysis of ZNF342 protein levels in a large dataset of leukemia samples by reverse phase protein array showed that higher levels of ZNF342 expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia was associated with poorer outcome (P = 0.033). In the myeloid leukemia samples with the highest ZNF342 expression, there was overrepresentation of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (P = 0.0016) and AML subtype M7 (P = 0.0002).

Our recent findings suggest that the number of smudge cells may have important biologic correlations rather than being only an artifact of slide preparation. In this study, we evaluated whether the smudge cell percentage on a blood smear predicted survival of CLL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We calculated smudge cell percentages (ratio of smudged to intact cells plus smudged lymphocytes) on archived blood smears from a cohort of previously untreated patients with predominantly early-stage CLL enrolled onto a prospective observational study. The relationship between percentage of smudge cells, patient survival, and other prognostic factors was explored. RESULTS: Between 1994 and 2002, 108 patients were enrolled onto the study and had archived blood smears available for review; 80% of patients had Rai stage 0 or I disease. The median smudge cell percentage was 28% (range, 1% to 75%). The percentage of smudge cells was lower in CD38(+) versus CD38(-) patients (P = .019) and in Zap70-positive versus Zap70-negative patients (P = .028). Smudge cell percentage as a continuous variable was associated with prolonged survival (P = .042). The 10-year survival rate was 50% for patients with 30% or less smudge cells compared with 80% for patients with more than 30% of smudge cells (P = .015). In multivariate analysis, the percentage of smudge cells was an independent predictor of overall survival. CONCLUSION: Percentage of smudge cells on blood smear is readily available and an independent factor predicting overall survival in CLL.","['Nowakowski, Grzegorz S', 'Hoyer, James D', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Bone, Nancy D', 'Laplant, Betsy', 'Dewald, Gordon W', 'Tschumper, Renee C', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Witzig, Thomas E', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Nowakowski GS', 'Hoyer JD', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Zent CS', 'Call TG', 'Bone ND', 'Laplant B', 'Dewald GW', 'Tschumper RC', 'Jelinek DF', 'Witzig TE', 'Kay NE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

RESULTS: Of patients randomly assigned to AZA 5-2-2 (n = 50), AZA 5-2-5 (n = 51), or AZA 5 (n = 50), most were French-American-British (FAB) lower risk (refractory anemia [RA]/RA with ringed sideroblasts/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with < 5% bone marrow blasts, 63%) or RA with excess blasts (30%), and 79 (52%) completed > or = six treatment cycles. Hematologic improvement (HI) was achieved by 44% (22 of 50), 45% (23 of 51), and 56% (28 of 50) of AZA 5-2-2, AZA 5-2-5, and AZA 5 arms, respectively. Proportions of RBC transfusion-dependent patients who achieved transfusion independence were 50% (12 of 24), 55% (12 of 22), and 64% (16 of 25), and of FAB lower-risk transfusion-dependent patients were 53% (nine of 17), 50% (six of 12), and 61% (11 of 18), respectively. In the AZA 5-2-2, AZA 5-2-5, and AZA 5 groups, 84%, 77%, and 58%, respectively, experienced > or = 1 grade 3 to 4 adverse events. CONCLUSION: All three alternative dosing regimens produced HI, RBC transfusion independence, and safety responses consistent with the currently approved AZA regimen. These results support AZA benefits in transfusion-dependent lower-risk MDS patients.","['Lyons, Roger M', 'Cosgriff, Thomas M', 'Modi, Sanjiv S', 'Gersh, Robert H', 'Hainsworth, John D', 'Cohn, Allen L', 'McIntyre, Heidi J', 'Fernando, Indra J', 'Backstrom, Jay T', 'Beach, C L']","['Lyons RM', 'Cosgriff TM', 'Modi SS', 'Gersh RH', 'Hainsworth JD', 'Cohn AL', 'McIntyre HJ', 'Fernando IJ', 'Backstrom JT', 'Beach CL']","['Cancer Care Centers of South Texas and US Oncology, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA. roger.lyons@usoncology.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20090302,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/03/04 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.17.1058 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.17.1058 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 10;27(11):1850-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.17.1058.

This review includes previously published manuscripts that used CCSS data focused on psychological outcome measures, including the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Cantril Ladder of Life, and other self-report questionnaires. Comparisons and contrasts are made between siblings and survivors, and to normative data when available, in light of demographic/health information and abstracted data from the medical record. These studies demonstrate that a significant proportion of survivors report more symptoms of global distress and poorer physical, but not emotional, domains of HRQOL. Other than brain tumor survivors, most survivors report both good present and expected future life satisfaction. Risk factors for psychological distress and poor HRQOL are female sex, lower educational attainment, unmarried status, annual household income less than $20,000, unemployment, lack of health insurance, presence of a major medical condition, and treatment with cranial radiation and/or surgery. Cranial irradiation impacted neurocognitive outcomes, especially in brain tumor survivors. Psychological distress also predicted poor health behaviors, including smoking, alcohol use, fatigue, and altered sleep. Psychological distress and pain predicted use of complementary and alternative medicine. Overall, most survivors are psychologically healthy and report satisfaction with their lives. However, certain groups of childhood cancer survivors are at high risk for psychological distress, neurocognitive dysfunction, and poor HRQOL, especially in physical domains. These findings suggest targeting interventions for groups at highest risk for adverse outcomes and examining the positive growth that remains despite the trauma of childhood cancer.","['Zeltzer, Lonnie K', 'Recklitis, Christopher', 'Buchbinder, David', 'Zebrack, Bradley', 'Casillas, Jacqueline', 'Tsao, Jennie C I', 'Lu, Qian', 'Krull, Kevin']","['Zeltzer LK', 'Recklitis C', 'Buchbinder D', 'Zebrack B', 'Casillas J', 'Tsao JC', 'Lu Q', 'Krull K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control Research, David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California-Los Angeles, UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1752, USA. lzeltzer@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090302,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Neoplasms/psychology', 'Brain Neoplasms/psychology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Promotion/*methods', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/psychology', 'Leukemia/psychology', 'Lymphoma/psychology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/*psychology/therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/psychology', 'Psychological Tests', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Wilms Tumor/psychology', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/04 09:00,2009/05/16 09:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.21.1433 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.21.1433 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 May 10;27(14):2396-404. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.21.1433.

This maternal-embryonic crosstalk involves local mediators within the uterine microenvironment. We demonstrate that a secreted protein, prokineticin 1 (PROK1), is expressed in the receptive endometrium and during early pregnancy. PROK1 induces expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in endometrial epithelial cells and first trimester decidua via a Gq-Ca(2+)-cSrc-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-mediated pathway. We show that human embryonic chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induces sequential mRNA expression of PROK1 and LIF in an in vivo baboon model, in human endometrial epithelial cells, and in first-trimester decidua. We have used micro RNA constructs targeted to PROK1 to demonstrate that hCG-mediated LIF expression in the endometrium is dependent on prior induction of PROK1. Dual immunohistochemical analysis colocalized expression of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor, PROK1, PROKR1, and LIF to the glandular epithelial cells of the first trimester decidual tissue. PROK1 enhances adhesion of trophoblast cells to fibronectin and laminin matrices, which are mediated predominantly via LIF induction. These data describe a novel signaling pathway mediating maternal-embryonic crosstalk, in which embryonic hCG via endometrial PROK1 may play a pivotal role in enhancing receptivity and maintaining early pregnancy.","['Evans, Jemma', 'Catalano, Rob D', 'Brown, Pamela', 'Sherwin, Rob', 'Critchley, Hilary O D', 'Fazleabas, Asgerally T', 'Jabbour, Henry N']","['Evans J', 'Catalano RD', 'Brown P', 'Sherwin R', 'Critchley HO', 'Fazleabas AT', 'Jabbour HN']","[""MRC Human Reproductive Sciences Unit, Queen's Medical Research Institute, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090302,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Gastrointestinal Hormones)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (PROK1 protein, human)', '0 (PROKR1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, LH)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Endocrine-Gland-Derived)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*cytology/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/analysis', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/*cytology/physiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Hormones', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Papio', 'Paracrine Communication/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Receptors, LH/analysis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Endocrine-Gland-Derived/analysis/*physiology']",2009/03/04 09:00,2009/08/14 09:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/14 09:00 [medline]']","['fj.08-124495 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.08-124495 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2009 Jul;23(7):2165-75. doi: 10.1096/fj.08-124495.

Pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation physicians are currently best situated to use cord blood therapeutically. We sought to describe the experiences and views of these physicians regarding private cord blood banking. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We e-mailed a cross-sectional survey to pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation physicians in the United States and Canada; 93 of 152 potentially eligible physicians (93 of 130 confirmed survey recipients) from 57 centers responded. Questions addressed the number of transplants performed by using privately banked cord blood, willingness to use banked autologous cord blood in specific clinical settings, and recommendations to parents regarding private cord blood banking. RESULTS: Respondents reported having performed 9 autologous and 41 allogeneic transplants using privately banked cord blood. In 36 of 40 allogeneic cases for which data were available, the cord blood had been collected because of a known indication in the recipient. Few respondents would choose autologous cord blood over alternative stem cell sources for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in second remission. In contrast, 55% would choose autologous cord blood to treat high-risk neuroblastoma, or to treat severe aplastic anemia in the absence of an available sibling donor. No respondent would recommend private cord blood banking for a newborn with 1 healthy sibling when both parents were of northern European descent; 11% would recommend banking when parents were of different minority ethnicities. CONCLUSIONS: Few transplants have been performed by using cord blood stored in the absence of a known indication in the recipient. Willingness to use banked autologous cord blood varies depending on disease and availability of alternative stem cell sources. Few pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation physicians endorse private cord blood banking in the absence of an identified recipient, even for mixed-ethnicity children for whom finding a suitably matched unrelated donor may be difficult.","['Thornley, Ian', 'Eapen, Mary', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Joffe, Steven']","['Thornley I', 'Eapen M', 'Sung L', 'Lee SJ', 'Davies SM', 'Joffe S']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/blood/therapy', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Blood Banks/ethics', 'Brain Neoplasms/blood/therapy', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Directed Tissue Donation/ethics', 'Ethics, Medical', '*Fetal Blood', 'Graft Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/ethics', 'Histocompatibility Testing/ethics', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Minority Groups', 'Neuroblastoma/blood/therapy', '*Pediatrics/ethics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/therapy', '*Privatization/ethics', 'Remission Induction', 'Retinoblastoma/blood/therapy']",2009/03/04 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['123/3/1011 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2008-0436 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2009 Mar;123(3):1011-7. doi: 10.1542/peds.2008-0436.,,,,"['U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3120215,,['NIHMS297589'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before the introduction of this tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), 5-year survival in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was approximately 40%-60%, but since the introduction of imatinib, overall survival has increased to approximately 90% for patients with chronic-phase disease. However, nearly one fifth of patients are intolerant or resistant to imatinib, resulting in patients with persistent or progressive disease. Recent research has identified a number of additional compounds that more efficiently inhibit the Abl tyrosine kinase and additional kinases that potentially play a role in imatinib resistance. The advent of dasatinib and nilotinib has provided additional options for patients with progressive disease. A number of phase II clinical trials have recently demonstrated that these second-generation TKIs are well tolerated and effective in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias. Recent clinical trial developments raise questions regarding the proper dosage and schedule of these newer agents as well as the timing of their use in the treatment of patients with CML. Additionally, the development of nonoverlapping resistance patterns with sequential drug exposure argues for the possibility of a drug selection scheme that might limit the development of resistant disease. As the era of personalized medicine has begun to take shape in the 21st century, the addition of newer TKIs might facilitate this trend in the treatment of Ph+ leukemias.","['Bixby, Dale L', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Bixby DL', 'Talpaz M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/03/04 09:00,2009/04/04 09:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [medline]']","['S1557-9190(11)70270-0 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2008.s.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2008 Mar;8 Suppl 3:S95-S106. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2008.s.005.,,92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of accelerated phase and blast crisis yields disappointing results and is rarely associated with long-term disease control. Imatinib failures can now be potentially salvaged with new TKIs or, if a donor exists, by a hematopoetic stem cell transplantation.

The first oral inhibitor of Brc-Abl was imatinib, which also targets KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor kinase and has demonstrated improved outcomes when compared with interferon, the previous standard of care. Imatinib resistance and intolerance have been an issue for patients, and as a result, new therapeutic approaches have been evaluated. Dose-escalated imatinib (800 mg daily) has shown some limited activity in patients with imatinib-resistant CML, but the development of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors has broadened the treatment options. Dasatinib is also an oral kinase inhibitor, but it has increased potency for Brc-Abl compared with imatinib. Dasatinib has demonstrated activity in all phases of CML and Ph+ acute lymphocytic leukemia and is approved for the treatment of adults in this setting. Recent phase III data have demonstrated that, in patients with chronic-phase CML, dasatinib 100 mg once daily is equally effective, with improved tolerability, compared with the previously approved 70-mg twice-daily dose. Nilotinib, which has been recently approved, has increased potency for Brc-Abl compared with imatinib and has demonstrated activity in patients with imatinib-resistant and -intolerant chronic- and accelerated-phase CML.

However, point mutations in the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl can lead to imatinib resistance and reactivation of kinase activity. The second-generation Abl kinase inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib were developed to reestablish disease control. A rising clinical challenge is using imatinib and novel Abl kinase inhibitors with the aim of completely preempting resistance. Fortunately, relapse on imatinib therapy so far has affected a minority of patients commencing treatment in the chronic phase of CML, and relapse rates continue to decline with treatment duration. In contrast, nearly all patients with CML have molecularly detectable disease. Thus, even among the best responders to imatinib, disease eradication is not achieved within a timeframe of years. Herein, we review current and emerging paradigms for using Abl kinase inhibitors to achieve maximal disease control and strategies to eradicate disease by targeting leukemic stem cells.","['Snead, Jennifer L', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Deininger, Michael W']","['Snead JL', ""O'Hare T"", 'Eide CA', 'Deininger MW']","['Oregon Health & Science University Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2009/03/04 09:00,2009/04/04 09:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [medline]']","['S1557-9190(11)70265-7 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2008.s.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2008 Mar;8 Suppl 3:S107-17. doi: 10.3816/CLM.2008.s.006.,,132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of zinc in some proteins is fundamental for their functioning as transcription factors. Little is known about interaction between zinc and DNA, which can be important in light of reports on the role of zinc in cancer transformation and sometimes contradictory character of these reports. In the present study we studied cyto- and genotoxicity of zinc sulfate (ZnSO(4)) in normal human lymphocytes and human myelogenous leukemia K562 cancer cells in the presence of zinc and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Zinc at concentrations from the range 10-1000 microM decreased the viability of cancer cells and this effect, especially for low concentrations of the element, was much more pronounced than in normal cells. Zinc did not induce DNA damage in normal cells, but did so in cancer cells. We observed a key difference between the action of zinc in normal and cancer cells in the presence of H(2)O(2), since the element exerted a protective effect against cyto- and geno-toxic action of H(2)O(2) in the former, whereas it increased such action in the latter. Zinc inhibited the repair of DNA damage induced by H(2)O(2) in cancer cells. The results suggest that zinc may protect normal cells against DNA-damaging action and increase this action in cancer cells, which indicates the dual action of this element in dependency of target cells and can be useful in cancer therapy.","['Sliwinski, Tomasz', 'Czechowska, Agnieszka', 'Kolodziejczak, Magdalena', 'Jajte, Jolanta', 'Wisniewska-Jarosinska, Maria', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Sliwinski T', 'Czechowska A', 'Kolodziejczak M', 'Jajte J', 'Wisniewska-Jarosinska M', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090228,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['7733-02-0 (Zinc Sulfate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Cytoprotection', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology/toxicity', 'K562 Cells', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Zinc Sulfate/*pharmacology/toxicity']",2009/03/04 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['S1065-6995(09)00052-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellbi.2009.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2009 Apr;33(4):542-7. doi: 10.1016/j.cellbi.2009.02.004.

Through genetic analyses in C. elegans, we find that the trithorax-group gene lin-59 and the TALE-class Hox cofactor unc-62 are required for survival of the VC motor neurons. With the goal of providing a model for how aberrantly active Hox complexes might promote leukemia, we elucidate the mechanism through which these new inhibitors of programmed cell death act: lin-59 maintains transcription of the Hox gene lin-39, while unc-62 promotes nuclear localization of the TALE-class Hox cofactor ceh-20. A LIN-39/CEH-20 complex binds the promoter of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only gene egl-1, repressing its transcription and ensuring survival of the VC neurons. In the absence of this regulatory mechanism, egl-1 is transcribed and the VC neurons die. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the Hox gene lin-39, as occurs for human Hox genes in leukemia, is sufficient to block death of some cells. This work identifies BH3-only pro-apoptotic genes as targets of Hox-mediated repression and suggests that aberrant activation of Hox networks may promote leukemia in part by inhibiting apoptosis.","['Potts, Malia B', 'Wang, David P', 'Cameron, Scott']","['Potts MB', 'Wang DP', 'Cameron S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390-9148, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090228,United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (EGL-1 protein, C elegans)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Motor Neurons/cytology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/03/04 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2008/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['S0012-1606(09)00141-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.02.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2009 May 15;329(2):374-85. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.02.022.

To identify new markers, we first performed extensive analysis of surface markers on several B-ALL cell lines.

We show high levels of JAK2 expression in MPD patients and these levels correlate with survival.","['Ma, W', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Zhang, X', 'Yeh, C-H', 'Zhang, Z J', 'Verstovsek, S', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Giles, F', 'Albitar, M']","['Ma W', 'Kantarjian H', 'Zhang X', 'Yeh CH', 'Zhang ZJ', 'Verstovsek S', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles F', 'Albitar M']","['Haematopathology Department, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090225,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood/diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/blood']",2009/03/04 09:00,2010/09/10 06:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1140 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01140.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2010 Feb;32(1 Pt 2):95-102. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01140.x.

We observed the effects of bortezomib on a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) positive leukemia line K562/A02. The results showed that bortezomib has significant effects on P-gp positive K562/A02 cells including cytotoxicity (48 h IC(50): 171.36 nM), induction of apoptosis (31.71 +/- 1.07% apoptotic cells after 24 h treatment at 100 nM), and inhibition of proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity (relative activity to untreated controls: 20.07 +/- 0.66% at 24 h with 10 nM bortezomib). These effects were lower than those observed in K562 cells (IC(50), percentage of apoptotic cells, relative chymotrypsin-like activity to untreated controls were 56.28 nM, 77.95 +/- 0.35%, 5.35 +/- 2.05% after the same treatments, respectively). No synergy between daunorubicin and bortezomib was shown in the killing of K562/A02 cells (synergistic ratios were <1). P-gp expression levels did not decrease in K562/A02 cells after bortezomib treatment. Pretreatment with bortezomib does not improve the intracellular anthracycline concentration in K562/A02 cells. Bortezomib shows a promising effect for the treatment of refractory/relapsed leukemia, but it does not improve the effect of anthracycline to MDR leukemia cells.","['Lu, S', 'Chen, Z', 'Yang, J', 'Chen, L', 'Zhou, H', 'Xu, X', 'Li, J', 'Han, F', 'Wang, J']","['Lu S', 'Chen Z', 'Yang J', 'Chen L', 'Zhou H', 'Xu X', 'Li J', 'Han F', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090225,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Chymotrypsin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology']",2009/03/04 09:00,2010/04/08 06:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1145 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01145.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2010 Feb;32(1 Pt 1):e123-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01145.x.

Posaconazole is a recently approved extended-spectrum triazole available as an oral suspension. It exhibits fungistatic activity against a variety of fungal pathogens. Pharmacokinetic data in special patient populations (such as neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, febrile neutropenic patients and pediatric patients) have been published recently. Controlled clinical trials establish posaconazole's safety and efficacy in infections, such as oropharyngeal candidiasis and prophylaxis against invasive fungal infections. Data are also emerging in the treatment of zygomycosis and selected cases of aspergillosis. Posaconazole is well tolerated during short- and long-term use, with the most commonly reported adverse events being mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal disturbances. Data suggest a relationship between posaconazole plasma concentrations and prophylactic efficacy; however, the role of therapeutic drug monitoring has yet to be completely defined. Since posaconazole is available only as an oral formulation, its use may be limited in critically ill patient populations.","['Smith, Winter J', 'Drew, Richard H', 'Perfect, John R']","['Smith WJ', 'Drew RH', 'Perfect JR']","['University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center College of Pharmacy, PO Box 26901, Oklahoma City, OK 73126, USA. winter-smith@ouhsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,101181284,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antifungal Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Triazoles/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2009/03/04 09:00,2009/04/10 09:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/14787210.7.2.165 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2009 Mar;7(2):165-81. doi: 10.1586/14787210.7.2.165.,,115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we covalently link the antitumor agent doxorubicin (Dox) to the DNA aptamer sgc8c, which was selected by the cell-SELEX method. In doing so, we expected that this sgc8c-Dox conjugate would specifically kill the target CCRF-CEM (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-cell ALL) cells, but with minimal toxicity towards nontarget cells. The results demonstrated that the sgc8c-Dox conjugate possesses many of the properties of the sgc8c aptamer, including high binding affinity (K(d)=2.0+/-0.2 nM) and the capability to be efficiently internalized by target cells. Moreover, due to the specific conjugation method, the acid-labile linkage connecting the sgc8c-Dox conjugate can be cleaved inside the acidic endosomal environment. Cell viability tests demonstrate that the sgc8c-Dox conjugates not only possess potency similar to unconjugated Dox, but also have the required molecular specificity that is lacking in most current targeted drug delivery strategies. Furthermore, we found that nonspecific uptake of membrane-permeable Dox to nontarget cell lines could also be inhibited by linking the drug with the aptamer; thus, the conjugates are selective for cells that express higher amounts of target proteins. Compared to the less effective Dox-immunoconjugates, these sgc8c-Dox conjugates make targeted chemotherapy more feasible with drugs having various potencies. When combined with the large number of recently created DNA aptamers that specifically target a wide variety of cancer cells, this drug-aptoconjugation method will have broad implications for targeted drug delivery.","['Huang, Yu-Fen', 'Shangguan, Dihua', 'Liu, Haipeng', 'Phillips, Joseph A', 'Zhang, Xiaoling', 'Chen, Yan', 'Tan, Weihong']","['Huang YF', 'Shangguan D', 'Liu H', 'Phillips JA', 'Zhang X', 'Chen Y', 'Tan W']","['Department of Chemistry, Shands Cancer Center and Center for Research at Bio/Nano Interface, Genetics Institute and McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use', '*Aptamers, Nucleotide/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Doxorubicin/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Endocytosis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', '*SELEX Aptamer Technique']",2009/03/04 09:00,2009/06/09 09:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbic.200800805 [doi]'],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2009 Mar 23;10(5):862-8. doi: 10.1002/cbic.200800805.,,,,"['R01 GM079359/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM079359-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM079359-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM079359-01S1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM079359-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2992821,,['NIHMS149610'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In those early days, there was great doubt and skepticism about the utility of UCB as a source of hematopoietic stem cells. Doubts about whether UCB, containing 10-20x fewer cells than bone marrow, had sufficient cells to durably engraft a myeloablated patient and, after demonstration that engraftment occurred with less graft-versus-host disease, whether it would confer graft-versus-leukemia activity were raised. RECENT FINDINGS: Transplantation with UCB is effective in the treatment of children with hematological malignancies, marrow failure, immunodeficiencies, hemoglobinopathies and inherited metabolic diseases. Transplantation without full human leukocyte antigen matching is possible and, despite a lower incidence of graft-versus-host disease, graft-versus-leukemia is preserved. The number of cells in a single UCB can be limiting, but the use of two UCBs for a single transplant shows promise to overcome this obstacle. SUMMARY: Cord blood transplantation is now an established field with enormous potential. UCB increases access to transplantation therapy for many patients unable to identify a fully matched adult donor. In the future, it may emerge as a source of cells for cellular therapies focused on tissue repair and regeneration.","['Kurtzberg, Joanne']",['Kurtzberg J'],"['The Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, The Carolinas Cord Blood Bank, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA. kurtz001@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,,IM,"['Blood Banks/methods/organization & administration', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/*trends', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/immunology/*transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/surgery', 'Research/trends', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/03/04 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/03/04 09:00'],"['2009/03/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/mop.0b013e32832130bc [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2009 Feb;21(1):22-9. doi: 10.1097/mop.0b013e32832130bc.,,29,,"['P01 HL067314-01A10003/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL069274-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL069274/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL067314-030003/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL069274-08/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL069274-07/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL067314/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL067314-040003/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL069274-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL067314-020003/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3682484,,['NIHMS94583'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 4 normal individuals and 40 CLL patients, a significant decrease in the relative abundance of histone H2A variants (H2AFL and H2AFA/M*) was observed in primary CLL cells as compared to normal B cells. Protein identities were determined using high mass accuracy MS and shotgun proteomics.","['Su, Xiaodan', 'Lucas, David M', 'Zhang, Liwen', 'Xu, Hua', 'Zabrouskov, Vlad', 'Davis, Melanie E', 'Knapp, Amy R', 'Young, Donn C', 'Payne, Philip R O', 'Parthun, Mark R', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Byrd, John C', 'Freitas, Michael A']","['Su X', 'Lucas DM', 'Zhang L', 'Xu H', 'Zabrouskov V', 'Davis ME', 'Knapp AR', 'Young DC', 'Payne PR', 'Parthun MR', 'Marcucci G', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC', 'Freitas MA']","['Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histones/*analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/06/03 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pmic.200800333 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2009 Mar;9(5):1197-206. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200800333.,,,,"['R01 CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR023647/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA134232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 CA107106-05A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 CA107106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR023647/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA107106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3108439,,['NIHMS148357'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, mechanisms for osteogenic differentiation are not understood in detail. In a previous study, real-time RT-PCR results demonstrated molecular mechanisms in dental follicle cells (DFCs) during osteogenic differentiation that are different from those in bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. We analysed gene expression profiles in DFCs before and after osteogenic differentiation with the Affymetrix GeneChip(R) Human Gene 1.0 ST Array. Transcripts of 98 genes were up-regulated after differentiation. These genes could be clustered into subcategories such as cell differentiation, cell morphogenesis, and skeletal development. Osteoblast-specific transcription factors like osterix and runx2 were constitutively expressed in differentiated DFCs. In contrast, the transcription factor ZBTB16, which promotes the osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells as an up-stream regulator of runx2, was differentially expressed after differentiation. Transcription factors NR4A3, KLF9 and TSC22D3, involved in the regulation of cellular development, were up-regulated as well. In conclusion, we present the first transcriptome of human DFCs before and after osteogenic differentiation. This study sheds new light on the complex mechanism of osteogenic differentiation in DFCs.","['Morsczeck, Christian', 'Schmalz, Gottfried', 'Reichert, Torsten Eugen', 'Vollner, Florian', 'Saugspier, Michael', 'Viale-Bouroncle, Sandra', 'Driemel, Oliver']","['Morsczeck C', 'Schmalz G', 'Reichert TE', 'Vollner F', 'Saugspier M', 'Viale-Bouroncle S', 'Driemel O']","['Department of Operative Dentistry and Periodontology, University of Regensburg, Franz-Josef-Strauss-Allee 11, 93053 Regensburg, Germany. christian.morsczeck@klinik.uni-regensburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090228,Germany,Clin Oral Investig,Clinical oral investigations,9707115,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (KLF9 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (NR4A3 protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RUNX2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (Sp7 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp7 protein, human)', '0 (TSC22D3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dental Sac/*cytology/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/physiology', 'Morphogenesis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Osteoblasts/physiology', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Receptors, Steroid/genetics', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sp7 Transcription Factor', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Young Adult', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",2009/03/03 09:00,2010/03/06 06:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2008/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00784-009-0260-x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Oral Investig. 2009 Dec;13(4):383-91. doi: 10.1007/s00784-009-0260-x.

Several antibodies against various cancer cell-surface antigens have been conjugated with different cytotoxic agents that inhibit essential cellular targets such as microtubules or DNA. Antibody-cytotoxic agent conjugates (ACCs) against several types of cancer are currently in advanced stages of clinical trials and one, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg), is approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. The linker group connecting the antibody to the cytotoxic agent is an important feature of the ACC, modulating the release of the active cytotoxic agent in the targeted cell. Several linker strategies employed for ACCs in current clinical trials include cleavable linkers with disulfide, hydrazone, lysosomal protease-substrate groups, and non-cleavable linkers. This chapter describes the methods of preparation of conjugates of antibodies with small-molecule cytotoxic agents (maytansinoids, calicheamicin, and auristatins) bearing different linkers. Methods to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of ACC are described in brief. Analytical methods are described to evaluate the mechanism of cellular processing of the ACCs with different linkers and the generation of the active metabolites.","['Singh, Rajeeva', 'Erickson, Hans K']","['Singh R', 'Erickson HK']","['ImmunoGen Inc., Waltham, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Disulfides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disulfides/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Biology/*methods']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/04/23 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-554-1_23 [doi]'],ppublish,"Methods Mol Biol. 2009;525:445-67, xiv. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-554-1_23.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine whether the anti-proliferative effect observed for this compound, is differentiation-dependent among the drug-treated cells, using U937 cells. METHODS: Monocyte differentiation was evaluated by Wright-Giemsa staining, latex particle assay and flow cytometry. Induction of apoptosis was analyzed by Annexin-PI double staining. RESULTS: The new compound, at 0.5-2.5 microg/ml inhibited proliferation of U937 cells by more than 70% and their viabilities were decreased by 47 +/- 2.1% after 72 h of treatments. In addition, we found that the effect of the new compound on U937 cells was associated with differentiation toward monocyte/macrophage lineage based on nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay, morphology change, phagocytic activity and expression of cell surface markers (CD14 and CD11b) as analyzed by flow cytometry. Moreover, our results indicated that the treatment of U937 cells with the new compound for 3 to 4 days induced apoptosis as assayed qualitatively by acridine orange/ethidium bromide and Annexin-V/PI double staining technique using flow cytometry. CONCLUSION: Based on these observations, it is concluded that the anti-proliferative function of the new compound is exerted through differentiation-dependent apoptosis among the treated cells, similar to the function of 3-hydrogenkwadaphnin previously characterized from D. lessertii crude extract.","['Meshkini, Azadeh', 'Yazdanparast, Razieh', 'Haidari, Mojgan']","['Meshkini A', 'Yazdanparast R', 'Haidari M']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysic, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysic, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Medical School, P.

It is reported that TLR9 gene variants, T1486C and T1237C, are associated with a reduced TLR9 expression compared with the wild-type gene. In two cohort analyses, we evaluated the influence of these gene variants on the outcome of transplant in 413 patients and donors. A retrospective analysis of the first cohort (n=293) showed that the homozygous CC gene variant of TLR9 (1486) compared with TC/TT gene variants was significantly associated with a markedly improved 5-year TRM (11.7 versus 36.4%, P<0.003), 5-year OS (86.1 vs 48.3%, P<0.001) and a lower relapse rate (13.2 vs 33.3%, P<0.007), whereas the occurrence of acute GVHD was not different. A prospectively performed analysis of the second cohort (n=120) and multivariate analyses confirmed the influence of the CC gene variant on these end points. Compared with patients with TC/TT gene at position 1486 of TLR9, patients with the homozygous CC gene variant had a lower TLR9 mRNA expression and a delayed T-cell immune reconstitution after transplant, which might prevent them from overwhelming immune responses as sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) associated with an increased TRM.

SP is one of the mediators responsible for the neural-immune/hematopoietic cross-talk. It is released from the nerve fibers of the autonomic and enteric nervous systems in lymphoid organs and is also produced by the resident, stromal or hematopoietic cells. SP stimulates the production of hematopoietic cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, SCF, GM-CSF) by bone marrow stromal cells. It enhances the proliferation of bone marrow progenitors, both directly by binding to progenitor's receptors and indirectly by interacting with marrow stromal cells. SP can also modulate immune and hematopoietic functions like phagocytosis, immunoglobulin production, lymphocyte proliferation and platelet aggregation. SP fragments derived from endopeptidase activity could also exert immune and hematopoietic regulation. The biological effects of SP are mediated through interactions with certain G protein-coupled receptors: the neurokinin (NK) receptors. Different studies have shown that NK receptors are localized on immuno-competent cells, including monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, dendritic cells and T or B lymphocytes, bone marrow stromal cells and hematopoietic progenitors. The disturbance of the neural-hematopoietic-immune axis may be implicated in hematological malignancies. SP seems to be important in the neoplastic transformation of bone marrow, leading to the development of acute leukaemia in children; myelofibrosis and also metastases to bone marrow of solid tumors in early stages of these diseases.","['Adamus, Maria']",['Adamus M'],"['Zaklad Hematologii Eksperymentalnej, Instytut Zoologii Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego, Poland.']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20090302,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/*physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/physiology', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/physiology', 'Substance P/*physiology']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]']",['880058 [pii]'],epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2009 Mar 2;63:106-13.,,87,,,,Wplyw Substancji P na komorki krwi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency of JAK2exon12 mutations was 10/63 (15.9%) in PV but only 5/346 (1.4%) in the erythrocytosis cases. Nine different mutations including four new types (D544-L545del, H538DK539LI540S, H538-K539del, V536-F547dup) were detected. In 2 cases we found evidence for the presence of cells homozygous for mutated JAK2exon12. As this was the case in only 2/15 cases with JAK2exon12 mutations (13%) homozygosity seemed to be less frequent than in V617F-mutated polycythemia vera (69%) (p<0.001). There were more females than males in the group of patients with a JAK2exon12 mutation (10 vs. 5) compared to the group with wildtype JAK2 (132 vs. 262; p=0.012). Median age of onset was lower than in the V617Fmut controls (58.5 vs. 67.8 years, p<0.001).

However, whether the percentage of cells with 13q- influences the prognosis or the biological characteristics of this disease is unknown. We analyzed the clinico-biological characteristics and outcome of patients with B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia with loss of 13q as the sole cytogenetic aberration. DESIGN AND METHODS: Three hundred and fifty patients with B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia were studied. Clinical data were collected and fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular studies were carried out. In addition, a gene expression profile was obtained by microarray-based analysis. RESULTS: In 109 out of the 350 cases (31.1%) loss of 13q was the sole cytogenetic aberration at diagnosis. In the subgroup of patients with 80% or more of cells with loss of 13q (18 cases), the overall survival was 56 months compared with not reached in the 91 cases in whom less than 80% of cells had loss of 13q (p< 0.0001). The variables included in the multivariate analysis for overall survival were the percentage of losses of 13q14 (p=0.001) and B symptoms (p=0.007). The time to first therapy in the group with 80% or more vs. less than 80% of losses was 38 months vs. 87 months, respectively (p=0.05). In the multivariate analysis the variables selected were unmutated status of IgV(H) (p=0.001) and a high level of beta(2)microglobulin (p=0.003). Interestingly, these differences regarding overall survival and time to first therapy were also present when other cut-offs were considered. The gene expression profile of patients with a high number of losses in 13q14 showed a high proliferation rate, downregulation of apoptosis-related genes, and dysregulation of genes related to mitochondrial functions. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia with a high number of losses in 13q14 as the sole cytogenetic aberration at diagnosis display different clinical and biological features: short overall survival and time to first therapy as well as more proliferation and less apoptosis. A quantification of the number of cells showing a genetic abnormality should, therefore, be included in the study of the prognostic factors of B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia.","['Hernandez, Jose Angel', 'Rodriguez, Ana Eugenia', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Fontanillo, Celia', 'Sandoval, Virgilio', 'Romero, Mercedes', 'Martin-Nunez, Guillermo', 'de Coca, Alfonso Garcia', 'Fisac, Rosa', 'Galende, Josefina', 'Recio, Isabel', 'Ortuno, Francisco', 'Garcia, Juan Luis', 'de las Rivas, Javier', 'Gutierrez, Norma Carmen', 'San Miguel, Jesus F', 'Hernandez, Jesus Maria']","['Hernandez JA', 'Rodriguez AE', 'Gonzalez M', 'Benito R', 'Fontanillo C', 'Sandoval V', 'Romero M', 'Martin-Nunez G', 'de Coca AG', 'Fisac R', 'Galende J', 'Recio I', 'Ortuno F', 'Garcia JL', 'de las Rivas J', 'Gutierrez NC', 'San Miguel JF', 'Hernandez JM']","['Servicios de Hematologia, Hospital Infanta Leonor, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/06/23 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [medline]']","['94/3/364 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13862 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2009 Mar;94(3):364-71. doi: 10.3324/haematol.13862.,,,,,PMC2649343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic and dendritic cells (DCs) develop from the same transformed hematopoietic progenitors. How BCR/ABL interferes with the immunoregulatory function of DCs in vivo is unknown. We analyzed the function of BCR/ABL-expressing DCs in a retroviral-induced murine CML model using the glycoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus as a model leukemia antigen. BCR/ABL-expressing DCs were found in bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and blood of CML mice. They were characterized by a low maturation status and induced only limited expansion of naive and memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In addition, immunization with in vitro-generated BCR/ABL-expressing DCs induced lower frequencies of specific CTLs than immunization with control DCs. BCR/ABL-expressing DCs preferentially homed to the thymus, whereas only few BCR/ABL-expressing DCs reached the spleen. Our results indicate that BCR/ABL-expressing DCs do not efficiently induce CML-specific T-cell responses resulting from low DC maturation and impaired homing to secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, BCR/ABL-expressing DCs in the thymus may contribute to CML-specific tolerance induction of specific CTLs.","['Mumprecht, Sabine', 'Claus, Christina', 'Schurch, Christian', 'Pavelic, Viktor', 'Matter, Matthias S', 'Ochsenbein, Adrian F']","['Mumprecht S', 'Claus C', 'Schurch C', 'Pavelic V', 'Matter MS', 'Ochsenbein AF']","['Department of Clinical Research, University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090227,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/*physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39195-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-156471 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 May 7;113(19):4681-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-05-156471.

The timing of this complication, risk, mortality and relationship to exposure remain uncertain. METHODS: We searched literature for publications relating to Mitoxantrone in MS, reviewed publication references and handsearched abstract lists to identify case-series reporting follow-up and complications of treatment with Mitoxantrone. We combined this with our local database of 250 cases treated since 1997. We also identified all reported individual cases of TRAL and extracted data reporting exposure (dose or mg/m(2)), timing and outcome of TRAL. RESULTS: Case-series including 5472 patients were identified; mean dose of Mitoxantrone was 74.2 mg/m(2) (range:12-120 mg/m(2)). TRAL was diagnosed in 0.30% (1 in 333). In 34 TRAL cases, sufficient data was available to inform analysis of exposure. Onset was a median of 18.5 months following Mitoxantrone treatment (range:4-60). Acute Myelocytic Leukaemia and Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia represented 46.4% each of the leukaemia subtypes. Six of 25 TRAL patients, where outcome was reported, died (24%). Over 80% of cases occurred in patients exposed to >60 mg/m(2), with a relative risk of 1.44 (CI95%:1.18-1.70) when comparing total dose >60 mg/m(2) against <60 mg/m(2) strongly suggesting a relationship between risk of TRAL and total dose.","['Ellis, R', 'Boggild, M']","['Ellis R', 'Boggild M']","['Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Neurological Sciences, Liverpool, UK. md0u3194@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090227,England,Mult Scler,"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",9509185,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*adverse effects', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/07/11 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/11 09:00 [medline]']","['1352458508100967 [pii]', '10.1177/1352458508100967 [doi]']",ppublish,Mult Scler. 2009 Apr;15(4):505-8. doi: 10.1177/1352458508100967.

This raises the question of whether imatinib increases susceptibility to TB. There are several reports suggesting that imatinib might impair the immune system, leading to a variety of infections, including varicella zoster and hepatitis B. Control of TB in healthy individuals is achieved through acquired immunity, in which antigen-specific T-cells and macrophages arrest growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli and maintain control over persistent bacilli. In the chronic stage of the infection, CD8+ T-cells assist macrophages in controlling intracellular mycobacteria. The T-cell receptor orchestrates this process. The fact that tyrosine kinases play an important role in T-cell receptor signal transduction and that imatinib has been shown to affect T-cell receptor signal transduction, presents a mechanism by which imatinib might impair control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; thereby leaving the host susceptible to reactivation of tuberculosis.","['Daniels, J M A', 'Vonk-Noordegraaf, A', 'Janssen, J J W M', 'Postmus, P E', 'van Altena, R']","['Daniels JM', 'Vonk-Noordegraaf A', 'Janssen JJ', 'Postmus PE', 'van Altena R']","['Department of Pulmonary Diseases, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. j.m.a.daniels@mca.nl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Eur Respir J,The European respiratory journal,8803460,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antitubercular Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antitubercular Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immune System', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tuberculosis/*complications/*drug therapy']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']","['33/3/670 [pii]', '10.1183/09031936.00025408 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Respir J. 2009 Mar;33(3):670-2. doi: 10.1183/09031936.00025408.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LIF 3' UTR StuI polymorphism was genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Statistical analysis of genotype and allele frequencies included Hardy-Weinberg law and conventional contingency table analysis incorporating the standard chi-squared test for independence. RESULTS: Allelic and genotype frequencies did not demonstrate a significant association between the case and control groups for the tested LIF 3' UTR StuI polymorphism. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the LIF 3' UTR StuI polymorphism is not associated with multiple sclerosis, however we cannot exclude the hypothesis that other polymorphic alleles of LIF could be implicated in MS susceptibility.","['Mackenzie, Jason', 'Tajouri, Lotti', 'Szvetko, Attila', 'Weth, Verena', 'Moreau, Julie', 'Greer, Judith M', 'Csurhes, Peter A', 'Pender, Michael P', 'Griffiths, Lyn R']","['Mackenzie J', 'Tajouri L', 'Szvetko A', 'Weth V', 'Moreau J', 'Greer JM', 'Csurhes PA', 'Pender MP', 'Griffiths LR']","['Genomics Research Centre, School of Health Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Southport, Queensland 4215, Australia. jason.mackenzie@griffith.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090228,Netherlands,J Neurol Sci,Journal of the neurological sciences,0375403,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"[""*3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Australia', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Male', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Whites/genetics']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/08/11 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/11 09:00 [medline]']","['S0022-510X(09)00049-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jns.2009.01.026 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurol Sci. 2009 May 15;280(1-2):62-4. doi: 10.1016/j.jns.2009.01.026.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We examined the kinetics of ceramide generation at the whole-cell level and in different subcellular compartments (plasma membrane rafts, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum) after irradiation with photons. Ceramide was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography or after pulse labeling experiments, and the presence of sphingomyelinase within mitochondria was assessed by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Irradiation of Jurkat leukemia cells resulted in the sequential triggering of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, followed by de novo synthesis that led to a late ceramide response (from 24 h) correlated with the triggering of apoptosis. At the subcellular level, pulse-label experiments, using [(3)H]-palmitate as a precursor, strengthened the involvement of the radiation-induced sphingomyelin breakdown and revealed a very early peak (15 min) of ceramide in plasma membrane rafts. A second peak in mitochondria was measured 4 h after irradiation, resulting from an increase of the sphingomyelin content relating to the targeting of acid sphingomyelinase toward this organelle. CONCLUSION: These data confirm that ceramide is a major determinant in the triggering of radiation-induced apoptosis and highlight the complexity of the sequential compartment-specific ceramide-mediated response of Jurkat leukemia cells to gamma-rays.","['Ardail, Dominique', 'Maalouf, Mira', 'Boivin, Anthony', 'Chapet, Olivier', 'Bodennec, Jacques', 'Rousson, Robert', 'Rodriguez-Lafrasse, Claire']","['Ardail D', 'Maalouf M', 'Boivin A', 'Chapet O', 'Bodennec J', 'Rousson R', 'Rodriguez-Lafrasse C']","['Laboratoire de Radiobiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Faculte de Medecine Lyon-Sud, Universite Lyon 1, Universite de Lyon, Oullins, France. ardail@sante.univ-lyon1.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Palmitates)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Ceramides/*biosynthesis', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Palmitates', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/*biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/03/26 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2008/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(08)03867-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.11.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Mar 15;73(4):1211-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.11.033.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is composed of a large extracytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail that lacks intrinsic catalytic activity. The receptor cycles continuously between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane, and at steady state is predominantly localized in the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments, and to a lesser extent on the cell surface. The receptor binds IGF-2 with higher affinity than IGF-1 and does not bind insulin. It interacts, via distinct sites, with lysosomal enzymes and a variety of other M6P-containing ligands. IGF-2/M6P receptors perform diverse cellular functions related to lysosome biogenesis and the regulation of growth and development. It regulates extracellular IGF-2 concentrations, modulating signaling through the growth-stimulatory IGF-1 receptor pathway. It appears to mediate the uptake and processing of M6P-containing cytokines and peptide hormones, such as transforming growth factor-beta, leukemia inhibitory factor, and proliferin. Some data suggest that the IGF-2/M6P receptor also functions in signal transduction by transactivating G protein-coupled sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors. Genetic evidence clearly supports a role for IGF-2/M6P receptors in organ development and growth, and recent data indicate that it may play an important role in tumor progression.","['El-Shewy, Hesham M', 'Luttrell, Louis M']","['El-Shewy HM', 'Luttrell LM']","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Vitam Horm,Vitamins and hormones,0413601,"['0 (Receptor, IGF Type 2)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Receptor, IGF Type 2/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/06/24 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [medline]']","['S0083-6729(08)00624-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0083-6729(08)00624-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Vitam Horm. 2009;80:667-97. doi: 10.1016/S0083-6729(08)00624-9.,,216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frequently, AIV infections in ducks are asymptomatic and long-lasting in contrast to the clinically apparent and transient infections observed in chickens. These differences may be due in part to the host response to AIV infection. Using real-time quantitative PCR, we examined the expression of immune-related genes in response to low pathogenic AIV H11N9 infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from the blood of chickens and Pekin ducks. While chicken PBMC expressed IL-1beta and IL-6 at high levels similar to mammalian species, duck PBMC expression levels were minimal or unchanged. Similarly, duck IFN-beta expression was nearly unaffected, whereas chicken expression was highly upregulated. Chicken IFN-gamma was expressed to higher levels than duck IFN-gamma, while IFN-alpha was expressed similarly by both species. IL-2 was elevated early in infection in duck PBMC, but returned to baseline levels by the end of the experiment; in contrast, IL-2 was weakly induced in chicken PBMC at late time points. TLR-7 and MHC class I molecule expressions were conserved between species, whereas duck MHC class II expression was downregulated and chicken expression was unchanged. These results show distinct PBMC expression patterns of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFNs between species. The differences in pro-inflammatory cytokine and IFN expression reflect the asymptomatic and lasting infection observed in ducks and the tendency towards clinical signs and rapid clearance seen in chickens. These results highlight important differences in the host response to AIV of two species thought to be critical in the genesis and maintenance of epidemic strains of AIV.","['Adams, Sean C', 'Xing, Zheng', 'Li, Jinling', 'Cardona, Carol J']","['Adams SC', 'Xing Z', 'Li J', 'Cardona CJ']","['Department of Population Health and Reproduction, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090227,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents/metabolism', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Avian Leukosis/blood/*genetics/immunology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Ducks/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, MHC Class I', '*Genes, MHC Class II', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Poultry Diseases/blood/genetics/immunology', 'Species Specificity', 'Th1 Cells/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/genetics/metabolism']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2008/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(09)00064-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2009.01.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2009 May;46(8-9):1744-9. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2009.01.025.

A diagnosis of CLL requires a count of B-lymphocytes >/=5.0x10(9)/L. Asymptomatic person with <5.0x10(9)/L B-lymphocytes is defined as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). To compare the clinical characteristics, prognostic factors, and outcome of Chinese patients with MBL and CLL, we present a study from our single centre of 20 patients with MBL and 136 patients with CLL. The factors included: age at diagnosis, gender, direct antiglobulin test (DAT), immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IgHV) mutational status, ZAP-70 protein, CD38 expression level, and molecular cytogenetic aberrations were analyzed in MBL and CLL subgroups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to construct survival curves, and results were compared using the log-rank test. Patients in the MBL category were slightly older than in the CLL category. There was no significant difference of these clinical and biological characteristics between patients in MBL subgroup and early stage CLL (Binet A). The incidence of positive DAT was significantly increased in CLL patients at Binet B and C, compared with MBL (P=0.036). IgHV gene mutation in MBL is skewed, with more than 92.3% of subjects harbored mutated IgVH genes (P=0.025). The proportion of MBL patients with a 13q14 deletion or trisomy 12 was similar to that of CLL patients. Moreover, markers associated with poor prognosis (deletion of 11q22 or 17p13) in these MBL populations were less than those in Binet B and C CLL patients (P=0.025). No statistically significant differences in ZAP-70 and CD38 status were observed between the MBL and CLL subgroups. During a median follow-up period of 45.5 months, MBL patients had a low probability of progression, with no patients transformed to aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or dying of CLL-related causes. The overall survival of MBL was very similar to Binet A CLL, but longer than that of CLL patients at advanced stages (Binet B and C) (P=0.024).

These phenomena led us to hypothesize that TSC gene might be involved in acute leukemia (AL). In this study, we investigated the TSC1 and TSC2 mRNA expression in 104 newly diagnosed AL patients and 29 healthy controls using real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) and explored the potential mechanisms of the aberrant expression through methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The results showed that the expression of TSC2 was downregulated in AL patients and the TSC2 promoter was hypermethylated which might be an important mechanism for the downregulation of TSC2 expression.","['Xu, Zhifang', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Lin', 'Wang, Yang', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Rao, Qing', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Xu Z', 'Wang M', 'Wang L', 'Wang Y', 'Zhao X', 'Rao Q', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 30020, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090227,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TSC2 protein, human)', '0 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Survival Rate', 'Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/05/29 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00058-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.01.041 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Jul;33(7):891-7. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.01.041.

We demonstrate by glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays, in vivo biotinylation tagging and confocal laser microscopy that TLX1 interacts with TLE1 via an Eh1-like motif.

Using a well characterized target of the Hairy/Enhancer of split 1 (HES1).TLE1 repressor complex, the ASCL1 gene, we show that TLX1 counteraction of ASCL1 repression by HES1 in SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma cells is associated with dismissal of TLE1 from the ASCL1 promoter and requires the Eh1-like motif for maximal effect.

However, several treatment side effects such as gastrointestinal injury, cardiovascular toxicity, and acute renal failure limit their clinical use. We found that indomethacin caused renal epithelial cell injury independently of cyclooxygenase inhibition. Indomethacin treatment was associated with the disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c, down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, upregulation of Bax, and elevation of caspases activity. Enhanced Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 expression alleviated indomethacin-increased caspase-3 activity. Down-regulation of Akt-related and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT-3)-related pathways was found in indomethacin-treated cells. Pharmacological and genetic studies revealed a potential mechanistic link between Akt/Mcl-1 and STAT-3/Mcl-1 signaling pathways and indomethacin-induced cytotoxicity. Mcl-1 is a determinant molecule for the induction of epithelial cell injury caused by indomethacin.

Inhibition of the polyamines resulted in a significant induction of PI3K/AKT and its down-stream target MCL-1, i.e. an anti-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family. Specific inhibitors of PI3K reversed the decrease of hypoxia-induced apoptosis as well as the induction of MCL-1 in polyamine-deprived cells. Moreover, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of MCL-1 was found to counter-act the protective effect of polyamine inhibition. We conclude that the polyamines regulate hypoxia-induced apoptosis in ECs through PI3K/AKT and MCL-1 dependent pathways.

However, distinct roles for JNK1 and JNK2 in hepatocyte apoptosis are still unresolved. Although myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) has been reported as a substrate of JNK, the role of Mcl-1 and its functional regulation by JNK in TNF-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury remain to be elucidated. METHODS: TNF-induced hepatocyte apoptosis was investigated in wild-type, jnk1-/- and jnk2-/- mice in vitro and in the galactosamine/TNF (GalN/TNF) liver injury model. For further analysis, we used adenoviruses expressing wild-type Mcl-1 or its substitution mutant, and the Cre/loxP system (mcl-1f/f) to delete mcl-1. RESULTS: jnk2-/- Hepatocytes showed increased Mcl-1 expression and were more resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis compared with wild-type or jnk1-/- hepatocytes. Increased Mcl-1 expression in jnk2-/- hepatocytes correlated with their JNK activity, which is mediated by residual JNK1 and higher than in wild-type or jnk1-/- hepatocytes. JNK activation led to phosphorylation of Mcl-1 in hepatocytes, and this increased the half-life of the Mcl-1 protein. Overexpression of Mcl-1 confirmed its antiapoptotic effect in TNF-induced hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.

Moreover it might be of use in hematooncological patients for the prevention and therapy of infections like cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation due to immunosuppression. To meet good manufacturing practice (GMP) criteria, we introduce here a bio-assay to validate peptide vaccines for peptide content and bio-activity. As a paradigm for peptide vaccine preparation the immunogenic CMV peptide 495-503 NLVPMVATV lyophilisate was resolubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide, phosphate buffered saline and admixed with Montanide. Addition of different amounts of peptide (10-80 microg) to a mixed lymphocyte peptide culture (MLPC) resulted in the generation of interferon (IFN) gamma and granzyme B releasing CD8(+) CMV tetramer(+) T cells in a dose dependent manner. The combination of FACS and ELISPOT results allowed the definition of the peptide amount in a vaccine preparation. Storage at +/-4 degrees C over 24 h did not result in a significant change of the immunogenicity of the vaccine. In contrast, cryopreservation of the vaccine at -20 degrees C resulted in a loss of immunogenicity. Quantitation of tumor/viral antigen peptides admixed with adjuvants, such as incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), is feasible through bio-assays as the modified ELISPOT/FACS assay described here, meeting GMP criteria for multi-center trials.","['Schmitt, Anita', 'Bechter, Clemens', 'Yao, Junxia', 'Goetz, Marlies', 'Maccari, Birgit', 'Schauwecker, Peter', 'Wiesneth, Markus', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Schmitt A', 'Bechter C', 'Yao J', 'Goetz M', 'Maccari B', 'Schauwecker P', 'Wiesneth M', 'Schmitt M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20090225,Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Cytomegalovirus Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/*analysis/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines/*immunology/standards', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Granzymes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Vaccines, Subunit/immunology/standards', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/immunology/standards']",2009/03/03 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2009/03/03 09:00'],"['2009/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]']","['S0022-1759(09)00054-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jim.2009.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2009 Apr 15;343(2):140-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2009.02.003.

To circumvent the in vitro production of such retroVLPs, we used DNA plasmids generating recombinant retroVLPs (plasmo-retroVLPs) as immunogens. We previously demonstrated that plasmo-retroVLPs induce significantly better antigen-specific T cell responses and antiviral immune protection than plasmids bearing a single mutation preventing retroVLPs assembly. In the present study, we investigated the possibility of using such plasmo-retroVLPs in prime-boost immunization strategies for hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine development. METHODS: To define the best immunization regimen with plasmo-retroVLPs and serotype 5 recombinant adenovirus vectors (rAd5), we used standardized methodologies measuring immune responses to the GP(33-41) 'gold standard' antigen. The protective efficacy of these immunization schedules was also evaluated in mice after tumor challenge. We then applied the optimal prime-boost immunization strategy using vectors expressing HCV-E1/E2 envelope glycoproteins. RESULTS: Using vectors expressing the model antigen, we demonstrated that rAd5(GP33-41)/plasmo-retroVLP(GP33-41) regimen induced significantly higher cellular immune responses than plasmo-retroVLP(GP33-41)/rAd5(GP33-41). Consequently, HCV-specific plasmo-retroVLPs (plasmo-retroVLP(E1E2)) were used as boost in mice primed with rAd5(E1E2) and we observed that plasmo-retroVLP(E1E2) significantly increased E1/E2-specific interferon-gamma cellular responses and E2-specific antibody generation. By contrast, plasmids unable to form E1/E2-pseudotyped retroVLPs had no boosting effect, revealing the importance of presenting E1/E2 in a particulate form. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, combining plasmo-retroVLPs that represent a new class of genetic vaccines in a heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy appears to be a promising strategy for HCV vaccine development.","['Desjardins, Delphine', 'Huret, Christophe', 'Dalba, Charlotte', 'Kreppel, Florian', 'Kochanek, Stefan', 'Cosset, Francois-Loic', 'Tangy, Frederic', 'Klatzmann, David', 'Bellier, Bertrand']","['Desjardins D', 'Huret C', 'Dalba C', 'Kreppel F', 'Kochanek S', 'Cosset FL', 'Tangy F', 'Klatzmann D', 'Bellier B']","['UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMR 7211, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (E1 protein, Hepatitis C virus)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Hepatitis Vaccines)', '157184-61-7 (glycoprotein E2, Hepatitis C virus)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Hepacivirus', 'Immunization', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vaccines, DNA/genetics/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Viral Hepatitis Vaccines/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Virion/*immunology']",2009/02/28 09:00,2009/05/28 09:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jgm.1307 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2009 Apr;11(4):313-25. doi: 10.1002/jgm.1307.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook this study to analyze the relevance of myeloid-related proteins (MRPs) 8 and 14, endogenous activators of Toll-like receptor 4, in diagnosis and pathogenesis of systemic-onset JIA. METHODS: Serum concentrations of MRP-8/MRP-14 were analyzed in 60 patients with systemic-onset JIA, 85 patients with systemic infections, 40 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 5 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, 18 patients with neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), and 50 healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the link between interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and MRP-8/MRP-14 in systemic-onset JIA. RESULTS: Serum MRP-8/MRP-14 concentrations were significantly (P < 0.001) elevated in patients with active systemic-onset JIA (mean +/- 95% confidence interval 14,920 +/- 4,030 ng/ml) compared with those in healthy controls (340 +/- 70 ng/ml), patients with systemic infections (2,640 +/- 720 ng/ml), patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (650 +/- 280 ng/ml), patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (840 +/- 940 ng/ml), and patients with NOMID (2,830 +/- 580 ng/ml). In contrast to C-reactive protein levels, MRP-8/MRP-14 concentrations distinguished systemic-onset JIA from infections, with a specificity of 95%. MRP-14 in serum of patients with systemic-onset JIA was a strong inducer of IL-1beta expression in phagocytes. CONCLUSION: The analysis of MRP-8/MRP-14 in serum is an excellent tool for the diagnosis of systemic-onset JIA, allowing early differentiation between patients with systemic-onset JIA and those with other inflammatory diseases. MRP-8/MRP-14 and IL-1beta represent a novel positive feedback mechanism activating phagocytes via 2 major signaling pathways of innate immunity during the pathogenesis of systemic-onset JIA.","['Frosch, Michael', 'Ahlmann, Martina', 'Vogl, Thomas', 'Wittkowski, Helmut', 'Wulffraat, Nico', 'Foell, Dirk', 'Roth, Johannes']","['Frosch M', 'Ahlmann M', 'Vogl T', 'Wittkowski H', 'Wulffraat N', 'Foell D', 'Roth J']","['University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (Calgranulin B)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arthritis, Juvenile/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Calgranulin A/*blood', 'Calgranulin B/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Communicable Diseases/blood/diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Feedback, Physiological/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-1beta/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/blood/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Monocytes/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2009/02/28 09:00,2009/04/28 09:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/art.24349 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2009 Mar;60(3):883-91. doi: 10.1002/art.24349.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD26 expression was evaluated by means of flow cytometry in various peripheral B-cell lymphoid tumours: 12 follicular and 12 mantle cell lymphomas, 20 multiple myelomas (MMs), 12 hairy cell leukaemias (HCLs), 112 chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (CLLs), 20 CD5(negative) B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative diseases (CD5(neg) B-CLPDs) and 12 diffuse large cell lymphomas (DLCLs). CD26 expression was absent or barely detectable in follicular and mantle cell lymphomas, high in MMs and HCLs, and variable in CLLs, in CD5(neg) B-CLPDs and in DLCLs. CD26 significantly correlated with CD49d and CD38 expressions (p < 0.0001) in B-CLLs, and there was a significant correlation between CD26 and ZAP-70 expressions or IgVH mutational status (p < 0.0001). After a median follow-up of 36 months, 65 B-CLL patients were treated; taking 10% as the best CD26 cut-off value, Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a significantly shorter time to treatment in the CD26-positive cases (p < 0.0001).

In B-CLL, T cell function is shown to be dysregulated. CD38 has been demonstrated to be an important transmembrane signalling molecule of T cell with a direct effect on its function. The present study was conducted to analyse CD38 expression on T cells by flow cytometry to evaluate its impact on the clinical course of 88 unselected B-CLL patients and correlate it with other risk factors. CD38 expression level on T cells was shown to predict the clinical course of B-CLL in male patients but not in female patients. Male patients showed CD38 expression on T cells in a stage-dependent manner, in contrast to female patients who showed higher expression irrespective to clinical staging. CD38 expression on T cells negatively interacted with treatment-free survival in male patients.

Early subdivision of the limb bud into proximal Meis-positive and distal Meis-negative domains is necessary for correct proximo-distal (P-D) limb development in the chick, since ectopic Meis1 overexpression abolishes distal limb structures, produces a proximal shift of limb identities along the P-D axis, and proximalizes distal limb cell affinity properties. To determine whether Meis activity is also required for P-D limb specification in mammals, we generated transgenic mice ectopically expressing Meis1 in the distal limb mesenchyme under the control of the Msx2 promoter. Msx2:Meis1 transgenic mice display altered P-D patterning and shifted P-D Hox gene expression domains, similar to those previously described for the chicken. Meis proteins function in cooperation with PBX factors, another TALE homeodomain subfamily. Meis-Pbx interaction is required for nuclear localization of both proteins in cell culture, and is important for their DNA-binding and transactivation efficiency. During limb development, Pbx1 nuclear expression correlates with the Meis expression domain, and Pbx1 has been proposed as the main Meis partner in this context; however, we found that Pbx1 deficiency did not modify the limb phenotype of Msx2:Meis1 mice. Our results indicate a conserved role of Meis activity in P-D specification of the tetrapod limb and suggest that Pbx function in this context is either not required or is provided by partners other than Pbx1.","['Mercader, Nadia', 'Selleri, Licia', 'Criado, Luis Miguel', 'Pallares, Pilar', 'Parras, Carlos', 'Cleary, Michael L', 'Torres, Miguel']","['Mercader N', 'Selleri L', 'Criado LM', 'Pallares P', 'Parras C', 'Cleary ML', 'Torres M']","['Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares, Melchor Fernandez Almagro 3, 28029 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Spain,Int J Dev Biol,The International journal of developmental biology,8917470,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxa11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA13)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Patterning/genetics/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/embryology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Limb Buds/*embryology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2009/02/28 09:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['072430nm [pii]', '10.1387/ijdb.072430nm [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dev Biol. 2009;53(8-10):1483-94. doi: 10.1387/ijdb.072430nm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A longer interval is believed to give rise to infections. However, frequent dressing changes might cause local cutaneous damage. MATERIAL/METHODS: Local cutaneous damage and infections were compared in patients with once-weekly versus twice-weekly changes of central venous catheters occlusive dressings. This was a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients with acute myeloid leukemia being treated with intensive chemotherapy were enrolled (twice-weekly group: n=42, once-weekly group: n=39). They had a non-tunneled polyurethane central venous catheter inserted into the vena subclavia and the insertion site was covered by a polyurethane semi-permeable occlusive dressing. No differences were observed between the groups with respect to local cutaneous damage, fevers, or positive catheter blood cultures. There were more insertion-site inflammations in the twice-weekly group (55% vs. 25%, p=0.008). In the once-weekly group it was necessary to change the occlusive dressing sooner in 42% of the cases, mostly due to a soiled dressing and local bleeding, and the real mean interval of changes was 5.4 days. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonging the frequency of occlusive dressing change to a once-weekly interval was limited by an increasing number of unplanned dressing changes. The prolonged interval of dressing changes, with a real mean interval of 5.4 days, did not lead to an increased number of local cutaneous complications or central venous catheter blood culture positivity and even contributed to reduced insertion-site inflammation occurrence.","['Vokurka, Samuel', 'Bystricka, Eva', 'Visokaiova, Maria', 'Scudlova, Jana']","['Vokurka S', 'Bystricka E', 'Visokaiova M', 'Scudlova J']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital in Plzen (Pilsen), Plzen, Czech Republic. vokurka@fnplzen.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,,IM,"['Catheter-Related Infections/blood/complications/microbiology', '*Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fever/complications', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Occlusive Dressings/adverse effects', 'Pain/complications', 'Skin/pathology', 'Time Factors']",2009/02/28 09:00,2009/04/30 09:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [medline]']",['869585 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2009 Mar;15(3):CR107-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the effect of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and sigma1-receptor ligands on the secretion of the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) in human leukemia Jurkat cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). We have shown that NMDA increased IL-8 and decreased IL-10 secretion and that sigma-ligands modulated the action of NMDA. Moreover, the effects of NMDA and sigma-ligands were interrelated with the nitric oxide (NO) content, suggesting that the intracellular concentration of NO could play a major role in the synthesis of cytokines. Western blots against the NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA glutamate receptor revealed that long-term (48 h) treatment of PBLs with glutamate at concentrations within normal plasma levels (1 x 10(-5)M), in contrast to low concentrations (0.3 x 10(-6)M), downregulates the NR2A subunit, probably by internalization. Furthermore, we found that PBLs with noninternalized NR2A secreted less IL-10 than lymphocytes with downregulated NR2A; under these conditions, the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB was increased whereas the transcriptional activity of c-Fos was decreased. These findings implicate that the activities of NF-kappaB and c-Fos control the expression of the IL8 and IL10 genes, depending on the subunit composition of the NMDA receptor. In conclusion, we suggest that lymphocytes express an active NMDA receptor only in a low-glutamate milieu.","['Kvaratskhelia, Eka', 'Maisuradze, Ekaterine', 'Dabrundashvili, Nino G', 'Natsvlishvili, Nino', 'Zhuravliova, Elene', 'Mikeladze, David G']","['Kvaratskhelia E', 'Maisuradze E', 'Dabrundashvili NG', 'Natsvlishvili N', 'Zhuravliova E', 'Mikeladze DG']","['Institute of Medical Biotechnology, Tbilissi, Georgia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090224,Switzerland,Neuroimmunomodulation,Neuroimmunomodulation,9422763,"['0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NR2A NMDA receptor)', '0 (NR2B NMDA receptor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)', '0 (Receptors, sigma)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)']",IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Glutamic Acid/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics', 'Interleukin-8/*genetics', 'Interleukins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neuroimmunomodulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, sigma/*agonists/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",2009/02/28 09:00,2009/06/23 09:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/23 09:00 [medline]']","['000204234 [pii]', '10.1159/000204234 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroimmunomodulation. 2009;16(3):201-7. doi: 10.1159/000204234.

These molecules have become recognized as one of the major regulatory gatekeepers of coding genes in the human genome. CONTENT: We review the structure, nomenclature, mechanism of action, technologies used for miRNA detection, and associations of miRNAs with human cancer. miRNAs are produced in a tissue-specific manner, and changes in miRNA within a tissue type can be correlated with disease status. miRNAs appear to regulate mRNA translation and degradation via mechanisms that are dependent on the degree of complementarity between the miRNA and mRNA molecules. miRNAs can be detected via several methods, such as microarrays, bead-based arrays, and quantitative real-time PCR. The tissue concentrations of specific miRNAs have been associated with tumor invasiveness, metastatic potential, and other clinical characteristics for several types of cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and breast, colorectal, hepatic, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. SUMMARY: By targeting and controlling the expression of mRNA, miRNAs can control highly complex signal-transduction pathways and other biological pathways. The biologic roles of miRNAs in cancer suggest a correlation with prognosis and therapeutic outcome. Further investigation of these roles may lead to new approaches for the categorization, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancers.","['Bartels, Claudine L', 'Tsongalis, Gregory J']","['Bartels CL', 'Tsongalis GJ']","['Department of Pathology, Dartmouth Medical School, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090226,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*genetics', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation']",2009/02/28 09:00,2009/04/14 09:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2008.112805 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2008.112805 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2009 Apr;55(4):623-31. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2008.112805.

Treatment of mouse or human T-ALL cell lines in vitro with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) results in growth arrest and/or apoptosis. These studies suggest GSIs as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of T-ALL. To determine whether GSIs have antileukemic activity in vivo, we treated near-end-stage Tal1/Ink4a/Arf+/- leukemic mice with vehicle or with a GSI developed by Merck (MRK-003). We found that GSI treatment significantly extended the survival of leukemic mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. Notch1 target gene expression was repressed and increased numbers of apoptotic cells were observed in the GSI-treated mice, demonstrating that Notch1 inhibition in vivo induces apoptosis. T-ALL cell lines also exhibit PI3K/mTOR pathway activation, indicating that rapamycin may also have therapeutic benefit. When GSIs are administered in combination with rapamycin, mTOR kinase activity is ablated and apoptosis induced. Moreover, GSI and rapamycin treatment inhibits human T-ALL growth and extends survival in a mouse xenograft model. This work supports the idea of targeting NOTCH1 in T-ALL and suggests that inhibition of the mTOR and NOTCH1 pathways may have added efficacy.","['Cullion, Kathleen', 'Draheim, Kyle M', 'Hermance, Nicole', 'Tammam, Jennifer', 'Sharma, Vishva M', 'Ware, Christopher', 'Nikov, George', 'Krishnamoorthy, Veena', 'Majumder, Pradip K', 'Kelliher, Michelle A']","['Cullion K', 'Draheim KM', 'Hermance N', 'Tammam J', 'Sharma VM', 'Ware C', 'Nikov G', 'Krishnamoorthy V', 'Majumder PK', 'Kelliher MA']","['Department of Cancer Biology and the Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090226,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic S-Oxides)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (MRK 003)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclic S-Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/physiology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Thiadiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/02/28 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37297-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-02-136762 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jun 11;113(24):6172-81. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-02-136762.

Strikingly, our data also revealed significant differences between ex vivo ATL tumor cells and in vitro HTLV-I cell lines.

Here, Rhesus monkey was used as an animal model to investigate molecular and phenotypic characteristics of SSCs in the adult testes. METHODS: A variety of immunohistological, molecular biological and functional assays were used to study different populations of SSCs in the adult testes. RESULTS: In adult primate testes, there are distinct populations of CD90+ CD49f+ CD117- (Triple Stained) cells and a small population of stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA-4)+ cells which both localized at the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules. Both SSEA-4+ and Triple Stained cells express germ cell and SSC-specific markers and show high telomerase activity; however, only adult Rhesus monkey SSEA-4+ testis cells appear to contain functional and actively dividing SSCs that can repopulate recipient mouse testes following spermatogonial transplantation. DNA analysis of these populations showed that SSEA-4+ cells contain a DNA profile similar to the actively dividing cells, whereas Triple Stained cells showed an accumulated number of cells arrested in the S phase of the cell cycle. SSEA-4+ cells also showed significantly higher proliferation activity, as shown by proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining, than Triple Stained cells (P < 0.01). Interestingly, SSEA-4+ cells expressed a significantly higher level of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger, a factor required for SSC self-renewal, than Triple Stained cells (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that Triple Stained cells may represent a quiescent population of SSCs, whereas SSEA-4 might be expressed on a subpopulation of actively dividing SSCs.","['Maki, Chad B', 'Pacchiarotti, Jason', 'Ramos, Thomas', 'Pascual, Michael', 'Pham, Jane', 'Kinjo, Jessie', 'Anorve, Sandra', 'Izadyar, Fariborz']","['Maki CB', 'Pacchiarotti J', 'Ramos T', 'Pascual M', 'Pham J', 'Kinjo J', 'Anorve S', 'Izadyar F']","['PrimeGen Biotech, 213 Technology Drive, Irvine, CA 92618, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090225,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phenotype', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Telomerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Testis/*cytology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2009/02/28 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']","['dep033 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/dep033 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2009 Jun;24(6):1480-91. doi: 10.1093/humrep/dep033.

Overexpression of Bcl-2 is also observed in HNSCC, albeit less frequently. We have previously shown that peptides derived from the BH3 domains of proapoptotic proteins can be used to target Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 in HNSCC cells, promoting apoptosis. In this report, we examined the impact of ABT-737 (for structure, see Nature 435: 677-681, 2005 ), a potent small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2, on HNSCC cells. As a single agent, ABT-737 was largely ineffective at promoting HNSCC cell death. By contrast, ABT-737 strongly synergized with the chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and etoposide to promote HNSCC cell death and loss of clonogenic survival. Synergism between ABT-737 and chemotherapy was associated with synergistic activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Treatment with ABT-737 plus chemotherapy resulted in dramatic up-regulation of proapoptotic Noxa protein, and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of Noxa up-regulation partially attenuated cell death by the synergistic combination. Treatment with cisplatin or etoposide, alone or in combination with ABT-737, resulted in substantial down-regulation of Mcl-1L, a known inhibitor of ABT-737 action. Further down-regulation of Mcl-1L using siRNA failed to enhance killing by the cisplatin/ABT-737 synergistic combination, indicating that chemotherapy treatment of HNSCC cells is sufficient to remove this impediment to ABT-737. Together, our results demonstrate potent synergy between ABT-737 and chemotherapy drugs in the killing of HNSCC cells and reveal an important role for Noxa in mediating synergism by these agents.","['Li, Rongxiu', 'Zang, Yan', 'Li, Changyou', 'Patel, Neil S', 'Grandis, Jennifer R', 'Johnson, Daniel E']","['Li R', 'Zang Y', 'Li C', 'Patel NS', 'Grandis JR', 'Johnson DE']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090225,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2009/02/28 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]']","['mol.108.052969 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.108.052969 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2009 May;75(5):1231-9. doi: 10.1124/mol.108.052969.

In stem cell- and myelopoietic neoplasms, eosinophils are derived from the malignant clone, whereas in lymphoid neoplasms and reactive states, eosinophilia is usually triggered by eosinopoietic cytokines. Myeloid neoplasms typically presenting with eosinophilia include chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), other myeloproliferative neoplasms, some acute leukemias, advanced mast cell disorders, and rare forms of myelodysplastic syndromes. Diagnostic evaluations in unexplained eosinophilia have to take these diagnoses into account. In such patients, a thorough hematologic work-up including bone marrow histology and immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, molecular markers, and a complete staging of potentially affected organ systems has to be initiated. Endomyocardial fibrosis, the most dangerous cardiovascular complication of the hypereosinophilic state, is frequently detected in PDGFR-mutated neoplasms, specifically in FIP1L1/PDGFRA+ CEL, but is usually not seen in other myeloid neoplasms or reactive eosinophilia, even if eosinophilia is recorded for many years. Treatment of hypereosinophilic patients depends on the variant of disease, presence of end organ damage, molecular targets, and the overall situation in each case.

Determining the molecular basis of the disease has been hampered by its heterogeneity. Thrombocytopenia is often a manifestation of MDS and needs to be monitored and treated accordingly. Treating the underlying disorder with a variety of differentiation and immunosuppressive agents alleviates the problem in a small percentage of patients but more often complicates the issue. Several treatments used for primary immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) have been tried in MDS patients, though with only modest success rates. Preliminary studies suggest that the use of a thrombopoietic growth factor may afford substantial increases in platelet levels without excessive deleterious side effects. Primary myelofibrosis (MF) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder associated with hepatosplenomegaly and refractory cytopenias. Immunomodulatory agents have shown promise in treating the anemia associated with this MF.

Secondary ITP can also occur with lymphoproliferative malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Hodgkin's disease (HD), and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). ITP associated with lymphoproliferative disorders has the same mechanism of platelet destruction as in idiopathic or primary ITP. The current treatment paradigm for secondary ITP varies according to the underlying condition. Standard treatments for primary ITP, which include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), anti-D, and splenectomy, are often successful in secondary ITP. However, in most situations with secondary ITP, treatment should focus on resolving the underlying disorder before treating the shortage of platelets, and, in the circumstances of ITP developing in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders, responses are frequently linked to remission of the primary malignancy.","['Liebman, Howard A']",['Liebman HA'],"['Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Southern California-Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA. liebman@usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,,IM,"['Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/blood/*complications/*therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/blood/diagnosis/*etiology/*therapy', 'Remission Induction']",2009/03/31 09:00,2009/07/01 09:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(08)00203-5 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2008.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2009 Jan;46(1 Suppl 2):S33-6. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2008.12.004.,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathobiology, natural history, and response to therapy of the diverse causes of secondary ITP differ from each other and from primary ITP, so accurate diagnosis is essential. Immune thrombocytopenia can be secondary to medications or to a concurrent disease, such as an autoimmune condition (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [APS], immune thyroid disease, or Evans syndrome), a lymphoproliferative disease (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or large granular T-lymphocyte lymphocytic leukemia), or chronic infection, eg, with Helicobacter pylori, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Response to infection may generate antibodies that cross-react with platelet antigens (HIV, H pylori) or immune complexes that bind to platelet Fcgamma receptors (HCV), and platelet production may be impaired by infection of megakaryocyte (MK) bone marrow-dependent progenitor cells (HCV and HIV), decreased production of thrombopoietin (TPO), and splenic sequestration of platelets secondary to portal hypertension (HCV). Sudden and severe onset of thrombocytopenia has been observed in children after vaccination for measles, mumps, and rubella or natural viral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella zoster virus. This thrombocytopenia may be caused by cross-reacting antibodies and closely mimics acute ITP of childhood.

This pathophysiological mechanism could also apply to otherwise unexplained pancytopenic syndromes which frequently occur in patients with leukemia and lymphoma and non-hematological malignancies. Observations supporting an anti-tumor effect of marrow hypoplasia/aplasia are presented and illustrated with case reports. The conclusion would be that pancytopenia occurring in AA or in AA-like syndromes reflects an ongoing immune reaction against underlying malignancy or infection.","['Nissen, Catherine', 'Stern, Martin']","['Nissen C', 'Stern M']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital CH - 4031 Basel, Switzerland. nissen@magnet.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090224,Netherlands,Autoimmun Rev,Autoimmunity reviews,101128967,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/diagnosis/etiology/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis/pathology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission, Spontaneous']",2009/02/28 09:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S1568-9972(09)00072-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.autrev.2009.02.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Autoimmun Rev. 2009 Sep;9(1):11-6. doi: 10.1016/j.autrev.2009.02.032.

OBJECTIVE: The in vitro antileukemic activity of 20 different anticancer agents was characterized in tumor cells from CLL, aiming at identifying agents active in poor-prognostic subgroups. DESIGN AND METHODS: In tumor cells from 40 CLL patients and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from three healthy controls, the activity of 20 substances was assessed using a non-clonogenic assay. The CLL samples were characterized regarding genomic aberrations by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene mutational status. RESULTS: In line with clinical experience, cells from patients with unfavourable genomic aberrations [del(11q)/del(17p)] showed lower drug sensitivity to fludarabine and chlorambucil than cells from patients with favourable cytogenetics [del(13q)/no aberration]. Most investigated drugs demonstrated similar activity in CLL cells from patients with unmutated and mutated IGHV genes as well as in CLL cells vs. PBMC. Interestingly, prednisolone and rolipram displayed high CLL specificity, high activity in CLL cells with unmutated IGHV genes and retained the effect in several cases with 11q/17p deletion. Further studies on prednisolone and rolipram revealed a synergy when these agents were combined in CLL cells, and suggested correlation between drug sensitivity and difference in downstream signaling. CONCLUSION: Prednisolone and rolipram are interesting for further studies in CLL with inferior prognosis. The study can also be considered a basis for future efforts to find drugs active in subsets of CLL patients that are resistant to conventional therapy.","['Lindhagen, Elin', 'Norberg, Maria', 'Kanduri, Meena', 'Tobin, Gerard', 'Saisanen, Laura', 'Aberg, Magnus', 'Gustafsson, Mats G', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Aleskog, Anna']","['Lindhagen E', 'Norberg M', 'Kanduri M', 'Tobin G', 'Saisanen L', 'Aberg M', 'Gustafsson MG', 'Sundstrom C', 'Rosenquist R', 'Aleskog A']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090224,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'K676NL63N7 (Rolipram)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prednisolone/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics', 'Rolipram/*pharmacology', 'Trisomy']",2009/02/28 09:00,2009/07/03 09:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [medline]']","['EJH1248 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01248.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Jul;83(1):22-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01248.x.

However, the contribution of Hh signaling to leukemic cell regulation has remained unclear. In this study, we assessed the possibility that Hh pathway activation contributes to the survival and drug resistance of cluster of differentiation (CD)34+ leukemia cells. Hh signaling in leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic cells was screened by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a Hh signaling reporter assay. We found that Hh signaling is active in several human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, especially primary CD34+ leukemic cells and cytokine-responsive CD34+ cell lines such as Kasumi-1, Kasumi-3 and TF-1. These CD34+ cells express the downstream effectors glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI)1 or GLI2, indicative of active Hh signaling. Moreover, inhibition of Hh signaling with the naturally derived Smoothened antagonist cyclopamine, endogenous Hh inhibitor hedgehog-interacting protein or anti-hedgehog neutralizing antibody induced apoptosis after 48 h of exposure, although these CD34+ cell lines exhibited resistance to cytarabine (Ara-C). In contrast, cyclopamine failed to affect growth or survival in U937 and HL-60 cell lines that lack expression of Hh receptor components, confirming that the effect of Hh inhibition is specific. Furthermore, combination with 10 microM cyclopamine significantly reduced drug resistance of CD34+ cell lines and primary CD34+ leukemic cells to Ara-C. These results suggest that aberrant Hh pathway activation is a feature of some CD34+ myeloid leukemic cells and Hh inhibitors may have a therapeutic role in the treatment of AML.","['Kobune, Masayoshi', 'Takimoto, Rishu', 'Murase, Kazuyuki', 'Iyama, Satoshi', 'Sato, Tsutomu', 'Kikuchi, Shohei', 'Kawano, Yutaka', 'Miyanishi, Kohji', 'Sato, Yasushi', 'Niitsu, Yoshiro', 'Kato, Junji']","['Kobune M', 'Takimoto R', 'Murase K', 'Iyama S', 'Sato T', 'Kikuchi S', 'Kawano Y', 'Miyanishi K', 'Sato Y', 'Niitsu Y', 'Kato J']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South-1, West-16, Chuo-Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, 060-8543, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090224,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Veratrum Alkaloids)', 'ZH658AJ192 (cyclopamine)']",IM,"['Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Veratrum Alkaloids/pharmacology']",2009/02/28 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['CAS1111 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01111.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 May;100(5):948-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01111.x.

We analysed immediate ex vivo expression of HLA-DR (DR), CD74, DM and DO in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a highly significant upregulation of DRA, CD74, DMB, DOA and DOB mRNA in purified malignant cells compared to B cells from healthy donors. The increased mRNA levels were not translated into enhanced protein levels but could reflect aberrant transcriptional regulation. Indeed, upregulation of DRA, DMB, DOA and DOB mRNA correlated with enhanced expression of class II transactivator (CIITA). In-depth analysis of the various CIITA transcripts demonstrated a significant increased activity of the interferon-gamma-inducible promoter CIITA-PIV in B-CLL. Comparison of the aberrant mRNA levels with clinical outcome identified DOA mRNA as a prognostic indicator for survival.

Activation of either GM-CSFR or VEGF-R2 was shown to determine the migration of both receptor elements (VEGF-R2 and the common beta-chain of the GM-CSFR) to lipid rafts. The study of receptor phosphorylation showed that GM-CSF induced the phosphorylation of its own receptor and the transphosphorylation of VEGF-R2; on the other hand, VEGF triggered the phosphorylation of its receptor and transphosphorylated the beta-chain of the GM-CSFR. Co-stimulation of TF1-KDR cells with both GM-CSF and VEGF-A resulted in massive migration of both the common GM-CSFR beta-chain and VEGF-R2 to lipid rafts and sustained p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Disruption of lipid rafts inhibited the capacity of both GM-CSF and VEGF-A to activate p38. Experiments with specific p38 inhibitors showed that p38 activation was required to sustain the VEGF- and GM-CSF-dependent proliferation of TF1-KDR and the survival of primary acute myeloid leukaemia blasts.","['Saulle, Ernestina', 'Riccioni, Roberta', 'Coppola, Simona', 'Parolini, Isabella', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Riti, Viviana', 'Mariani, Gualtiero', 'Laufer, Stefan', 'Sargiacomo, Massimo', 'Testa, Ugo']","['Saulle E', 'Riccioni R', 'Coppola S', 'Parolini I', 'Diverio D', 'Riti V', 'Mariani G', 'Laufer S', 'Sargiacomo M', 'Testa U']","['Department of Haematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090224,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0', '((4-(5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-methylsulfanyl-3H-imidazol-4-yl)pyridin-2-yl)-(1-phenyl', 'ethyl)amine)', '0 (Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2009/02/28 09:00,2009/06/25 09:00,['2009/02/28 09:00'],"['2009/02/28 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7627 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07627.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 May;145(3):399-411. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07627.x.

The UKALLXII/ECOG 2993 study evaluated the outcome of assigning alloHSCT with a sibling (sib) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) to patients younger than 55 years of age achieving complete remission (CR). The CR rate of 267 patients, median age 40, was 82%. Twenty-eight percent of patients proceeded to alloHSCT in first CR. Age older than 55 years or a pre-HSCT event were the most common reasons for failure to progress to alloHSCT. At 5 years, overall survival (OS) was 44% after sib alloHSCT, 36% after MUD alloHSCT, and 19% after chemotherapy. After adjustment for sex, age, and white blood count and excluding chemotherapy-treated patients who relapsed or died before the median time to alloHSCT, only relapse-free survival remained significantly superior in the alloHSCT group (odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.61). An intention-to-treat analysis, using the availability or not of a matched sibling donor, showed 5-year OS to be nonsignificantly better at 34% with a donor versus 25% with no donor. This prospective trial in adult Ph(+) ALL indicates a modest but significant benefit to alloHSCT. This trial has been registered with clinicaltrials.gov under identifier NCT00002514 and as ISRCTN77346223.","['Fielding, Adele K', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Richards, Susan M', 'Buck, Georgina', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Durrant, I Jill', 'Marks, David I', 'McMillan, Andrew K', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Dewald, Gordon', 'Franklin, Ian M', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Wiernik, Peter H', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Goldstone, Anthony H']","['Fielding AK', 'Rowe JM', 'Richards SM', 'Buck G', 'Moorman AV', 'Durrant IJ', 'Marks DI', 'McMillan AK', 'Litzow MR', 'Lazarus HM', 'Foroni L', 'Dewald G', 'Franklin IM', 'Luger SM', 'Paietta E', 'Wiernik PH', 'Tallman MS', 'Goldstone AH']","['University College London, London, United Kingdom.

Variation in the functional group at C-terminal of the thiazolidinone led to set of compounds bearing amide moiety. Their chemical structures were confirmed by (1)H NMR, IR and Mass Spectra analysis. These thiazolidinone compounds containing furan moiety exhibits moderate to strong antiproliferative activity in a cell cycle stage-dependent and dose dependent manner in two different human leukemia cell lines. The importance of the electron donating groups on thiazolidinone moiety was confirmed by MTT and Trypan blue assays and it was concluded that the 4th position of the substituted aryl ring plays a dominant role for its anticancer property. Among the synthesized compounds, 5e and 5f have shown potent anticancer activity on both the cell lines tested. To rationalize the role of electron donating group in the induction of cytotoxicity we have chosen two molecules (5e and 5k) having different electron donating group at different positions.

This figure is unknown for hematooncology patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A 24-year retrospective study was conducted to determine whether RBC-immunized hematooncology patients differ from other patient cohorts regarding this strong immune response toward additional RBC challenge with clinically relevant RH, KEL, FY, JK, and MNS antigens. RESULTS: Overall, 25 of 115 immunized patients (21.7%) formed 30 additional antibodies after a median number of 7 RBC units transfused. The median interval between primary and additional antibody detection was 4 months. Diagnosis or treatment intensity did not significantly influence additional antibody development. CONCLUSION: Additional antibody formation occurs in more than 20 percent of RBC-alloimmunized hematooncology patients after subsequent transfusions and this is comparable with the frequency in other immunized patients. To avoid extensive RBC alloimmunization, preventive extended antigen matching may be considered in hematooncology patients, who have shown to be capable of antibody formation.","['Schonewille, Henk', 'de Vries, Rene R P', 'Brand, Anneke']","['Schonewille H', 'de Vries RR', 'Brand A']","['Sanquin Blood Bank, South West Region, Leiden, The Netherlands. h.schonewille@sanquin.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Autoimmunity/*immunology', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Child', 'Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunization', 'Leukemia/*immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2009/02/27 09:00,2009/03/17 09:00,['2009/02/27 09:00'],"['2009/02/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [medline]']","['TRF01980 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01980.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2009 Mar;49(3):453-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01980.x.,['Transfusion. 2009 Mar;49(3):406-8.

The clinical manifestations are protean and may involve any organ system, but especially the skin. Our understanding of these diseases has drastically changed over the past 15 years, along with new classifications that characterize patients with marked eosinophilia. One HES variant, myeloproliferative, is actually chronic eosinophilic leukaemia with a unique genetic marker, FIP1L1-PDGFRA. Such patients are well-controlled by administration of the kinase inhibitor, imatinib, and remissions appear durable with continued imatinib therapy. FIP1L1-PDGFRA is expressed in several cell lineages, thus explaining increases in neutrophils and mast cells in HES. The lymphocytic HES variant is associated with T-cell clones producing interleukin-5 (IL-5) and can evolve into lymphoma. While myeloproliferative and lymphocytic HES are well established and permit elimination of the term, idiopathic, to these varieties, most HES patients do not fall into these categories and are classified as complex (using the 2006 Workshop Report). A recent study showed that a monoclonal antibody to IL-5, mepolizumab, reduced glucocorticoid therapy in HES patients who did not possess the FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutation while controlling eosinophilia and preventing recurrence or progression of tissue damage. These advances augur well for continued progress in the understanding and treatment of HES.","['Gleich, Gerald J', 'Leiferman, Kristin M']","['Gleich GJ', 'Leiferman KM']","['Departments of Dermatology and Medicine, The Health Sciences Center, School of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84103, USA. gerald.gleich@hsc.utah.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/classification/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/genetics']",2009/02/27 09:00,2009/06/25 09:00,['2009/02/27 09:00'],"['2009/02/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7599 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07599.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 May;145(3):271-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07599.x.,,106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are only sparse data on the characteristics and determinants for procedure-related pain among adult cancer patients. METHODS: In this prospective study, we evaluated the characteristics and determinants of procedure-related pain in 235 consecutive hematologic patients (M/F:126/109; median age 62 years, range 20-89 years) undergoing a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy (BMA) under local anesthesia. Questionnaires were used to assess patients before-, 10 min and 1-7 days post BMA. Using logistic regression models, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: 165/235 (70%) patients reported pain during BMA; 92 (56%), 53 (32%) and 5 (3%) of these indicated moderate [visual analogue scale (VAS)>or=30 mm], severe (VAS>54 mm) and worst possible pain (VAS=100 mm), respectively. On multivariate analyses, pre-existing pain (OR=2.60 95% CI 1.26-5.36), anxiety about the diagnostic outcome of BMA (OR=3.17 95% CI 1.54-6.52), anxiety about needle-insertion (OR=2.49 95% CI 1.22-5.10) and low employment status (sick-leave/unemployed) (OR=3.14 95% CI 1.31-7.55) were independently associated with an increased risk of pain during BMA. At follow-up 10 min after BMA, 40/235 (17%) patients reported pain. At 1, 3, 6 and 7 days post BMA, pain was present in 137 (64%), 90 (42%), 43 (20%) and 25 (12%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found that 3/4 of hematologic patients who underwent BMA reported procedural pain; one third of these patients indicated severe pain. Pre-existing pain, anxiety about the diagnostic outcome of BMA or needle-insertion, and low employment status were independent risk factors.","['Liden, Y', 'Landgren, O', 'Arner, S', 'Sjolund, K-F', 'Johansson, E']","['Liden Y', 'Landgren O', 'Arner S', 'Sjolund KF', 'Johansson E']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Section for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. ylva.liden@karolinska.se']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,0370270,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/*etiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2009/02/27 09:00,2009/04/08 09:00,['2009/02/27 09:00'],"['2009/02/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/08 09:00 [medline]']","['AAS1874 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-6576.2008.01874.x [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. 2009 Mar;53(3):354-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-6576.2008.01874.x.,,,,['ZIA BC011205-01/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6889807,,['NIHMS1022747'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression and enzyme activity of acid sphingomyelinase, which digests sphingomyeline to produce ceramide and plays an essential role in lipid raft assembling, were higher in the rafts of TIB152 than in TIB153.

SAMPLE AND METHODS: A 12-week exercise program was developed and tested for feasibility in nine children who survived cancer. RESULTS: From the 16 eligible children for the intervention, 9 participated, while 4 were able to complete the entire program. Feasibility of the program was scored by five children, two of them reported the program as being too demanding. The participating physiotherapists were satisfied with training methodology and training progress. The efficacy of the program on muscle strength, exercise capacity, functional mobility and fatigue showed no significant differences between pre and post training. CONCLUSION: In designing a community-based exercise training program, not only the stage of the disease needs to be considered, but more so the age of the children, the variety of exercises, the location of implementation and even more importantly the views and motivation of the parents concerning the execution of an exercise training program. A careful balance between these parameters could lead to a greater adherence and by that, to a better outcome of these programs.","['Takken, Tim', 'van der Torre, Patrick', 'Zwerink, Marlies', 'Hulzebos, Erik H', 'Bierings, Marc', 'Helders, Paul J M', 'van der Net, Janjaap']","['Takken T', 'van der Torre P', 'Zwerink M', 'Hulzebos EH', 'Bierings M', 'Helders PJ', 'van der Net J']","[""Department of Pediatric Physical Therapy and Exercise Physiology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. t.takken@umcutrecht.nl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', '*Community Health Services', '*Exercise', 'Fatigue/epidemiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscle Strength', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Program Development', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",2009/02/27 09:00,2009/07/14 09:00,['2009/02/27 09:00'],"['2009/02/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.1484 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2009 Apr;18(4):440-8. doi: 10.1002/pon.1484.,,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,

We immunostained 15 cases of CMML, focusing at two new antibodies staining for CD14 and CD16 on paraffin-embedded tissues. CD68 (KP1), CD68 (PG-M1), and CD163 were not differentially expressed between CMML and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In CMML BMB, we found a significant increase in the number of CD14+ monocytes. This increase was made of dispersed cells in the interstitium, often exhibiting bilobated nuclei, and being difficult to differentiate from neutrophils. There was no expansion of CD16+ monocyte-like cells. However, we found a significant decrease in the number of granulocytes expressing CD16, MPO, and CD15 in CMML compared to CML and control BMB, probably related to dysgranulopoiesis. Indeed, BMB immunohistochemistry can be helpful in CMML by identifying both the monocyte expansion with CD14 and the dysgranulopoiesis with CD16.","['Qubaja, Marwan', 'Marmey, Beatrice', 'Le Tourneau, Agnes', 'Haiat, Stephanie', 'Cazals-Hatem, Dominique', 'Fabiani, Bettina', 'Diebold, Jacques', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Audouin, Josee', 'Geissmann, Frederic', 'Molina, Thierry Jo']","['Qubaja M', 'Marmey B', 'Le Tourneau A', 'Haiat S', 'Cazals-Hatem D', 'Fabiani B', 'Diebold J', 'Marie JP', 'Audouin J', 'Geissmann F', 'Molina TJ']","[""Service d'Anatomie et de Cytologie Pathologiques Jacques Delarue, AP-HP, Hotel Dieu, 1, Place du Parvis Notre-Dame, 75181 Paris Cedex 04, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090226,Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*diagnosis/metabolism/surgery', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Receptors, IgG/*biosynthesis']",2009/02/27 09:00,2009/08/19 09:00,['2009/02/27 09:00'],"['2008/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00428-009-0726-x [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2009 Apr;454(4):411-9. doi: 10.1007/s00428-009-0726-x.

Although these approaches have identified many important abnormalities, they have been unable to identify the full repertoire of genetic alterations in ALL. The advent of high-resolution, microarray-based techniques to identify DNA copy number alterations and loss-of-heterozygosity in a genome-wide fashion has enabled the identification of multiple novel genetic alterations targeting key cellular pathways, including lymphoid differentiation, cell cycle, tumor suppression, apoptosis and drug responsiveness. Recent studies have extended these approaches to examine the biologic basis of high-risk ALL and treatment relapse. As these techniques continue to evolve and are integrated with genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptomic data, we will obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic and epigenetic alterations in ALL, and ultimately will be able to translate these findings into the development of novel therapeutic approaches directed against rational therapeutic targets. Here, we review recent data obtained from genome-wide profiling studies in ALL, and discuss potential avenues for future investigation.","['Mullighan, C G', 'Downing, J R']","['Mullighan CG', 'Downing JR']","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. charles.mullighan@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090226,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Recurrence']",2009/02/27 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/02/27 09:00'],"['2009/02/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']","['leu200918 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.18 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jul;23(7):1209-18. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.18.

Patients received a 5-day course of cladribine (9 mg/m(2) per dose) and cytarabine either as daily 2-h infusions (500 mg/m(2) per dose) (arm A) or a continuous infusion (500 mg/m(2) per day) (arm B). Ara-CTP levels and inhibition of DNA synthesis increased from day 1 to day 2, but were not different between the two arms. In addition, the median blast percentages at day 15 did not differ between arms A and B, but patients treated in arm A had shorter intervals between the initiation of the first and second courses of therapy. Thus, although there were trends toward better complete remission rates and overall survival for patients treated in arm B, the reduced efficacy of arm A may have been partially compensated by more intense timing of therapy for that group.

We assessed the sensitivity of the ""extended PG4(S+L-) assay"" to detect gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) RCR, and applied this assay to measure GALV RCR spread in retrovirally transduced T cells. To this end, T cells were expanded for 12 days after transduction with a GALV-envelope pseudotyped retroviral vector expressing single chain variable fragment (anticarbonic anhydrase IX) in presence or absence of GALV RCR. Results showed that: (1) the ""extended PG4(S+L-) assay"" detects 1 focus-forming unit (ffu) GALV RCR and thus is applicable and sufficiently sensitive to screen human T-cell cultures for absence of infectious GALV RCR; (2) although GALV RCR infect human T cells, it very poorly replicate in T cells; (3) GALV RCR, when present at low levels immediately upon gene transduction (ie, 100 ffu/20x10 T cells in 100 mL), did not spread during a 12-day T-cell culture at clinical scale. Our observation that GALV RCR poorly spreads in primary human T-cell cultures questions the relevance of testing T-cell transductants for RCR on top of testing the vector-producing cells and the clinical vector batch for RCR and warrants evaluation of the current policy for safety testing of ex vivo retrovirally transduced T lymphocytes for GALV RCR.","['Lamers, Cor H J', 'Willemsen, Ralph A', 'van Elzakker, Pascal M M L', 'Gratama, Jan Willem', 'Debets, Reno']","['Lamers CH', 'Willemsen RA', 'van Elzakker PM', 'Gratama JW', 'Debets R']","['Unit of Clinical and Tumor Immunology, Department of Medical Oncology, Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, AE Rotterdam, The Netherlands. c.lamers@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/*physiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Virus Replication']",2009/02/27 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2009/02/27 09:00'],"['2009/02/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CJI.0b013e318199840a [doi]', '00002371-200904000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2009 Apr;32(3):272-9. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e318199840a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The poor clinical outcome of the subgroup with unmutated Ig VH genes has been linked to the persistent ability of the B-cell receptor in tumor cells from these cases to respond to antigen. As B-cell receptor signaling generally relies on T-cell help, we hypothesized that the course of B-CLL might not only be influenced by the Ig VH mutational status but also by the activation/differentiation status of T cells. We assessed the relative distribution of naive and memory T-cell subsets in peripheral blood from patients with mutated (M-CLL, n=71) and unmutated Ig VH genes (UM-CLL, n=42) and correlated it with the course of disease. We also compared the prosurvival potential of naive and memory T cells cocultured with B-CLL cells in vitro. A significant increase in relative numbers of central and effector memory T cells was observed in the CD4 T-cell pool from UM-CLL as compared with M-CLL cases and was associated with high Rai stage, progressive disease and shorter treatment-free survival (TFS). In a multivariate analysis, the relative number of CD4 central and effector memory T cells remained a significant prognostic parameter for TFS after correction for CD38 expression, Ig VH status, genomic aberrations, and Rai stage. The inverse correlation of memory CD4 T cells with TFS might be explained by their potential to support survival of B-CLL cells.","['Tinhofer, Inge', 'Weiss, Lukas', 'Gassner, Franz', 'Rubenzer, Gabriele', 'Holler, Claudia', 'Greil, Richard']","['Tinhofer I', 'Weiss L', 'Gassner F', 'Rubenzer G', 'Holler C', 'Greil R']","['Laboratory for Translational Radiobiology and Radiooncology, 3rd Medical Department at the Salzburg University Hospital, Muellner Hauptstrasse 48, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria. ingeborg.tinhofer@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics/immunology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Regression Analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism']",2009/02/27 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2009/02/27 09:00'],"['2009/02/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CJI.0b013e318197b5e4 [doi]', '00002371-200904000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2009 Apr;32(3):302-9. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e318197b5e4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This success was achieved, in part, through the implementation of risk-stratified therapy. However, for the 15-20% of children with newly diagnosed ALL who will ultimately relapse, traditional risk assessment remains inadequate. This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of prognostic factors that may be used to refine risk group classification. RECENT FINDINGS: An increasingly sophisticated understanding of genetic abnormalities in leukemia cells (including chromosomal abnormalities and patterns of gene expression), response to treatment, and host pharmacogenomics offers the potential to enhance or supplant currently applied prognostic criteria for use in treatment planning for childhood ALL. SUMMARY: Identification of biologically distinctive subsets of ALL through cytogenetic, molecular, and gene expression studies, as well as investigations of minimal residual disease and host pharmacogenomics, offer promising avenues of research. Integration of molecular tools into clinical practice will ultimately allow for more precise risk stratification and individualized treatment planning.","['Vrooman, Lynda M', 'Silverman, Lewis B']","['Vrooman LM', 'Silverman LB']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. lynda_vrooman@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Pharmacogenetics/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/02/27 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2009/02/27 09:00'],"['2009/02/27 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOP.0b013e32831f1f24 [doi]', '00008480-200902000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2009 Feb;21(1):1-8. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0b013e32831f1f24.,,84,,['T32 CA009172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apparent DNA fragmentation and morphological changes occurred in U937 cells after incubating for 48 h to 72 h with the conditioned medium that had been prepared with 400 microg CR solids/mL. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the percentage of apoptotic U937 cells increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The upregulation of Bax expression, the downregulation of Bcl-2 and procaspase-3 expression, and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in U937 cells were all observed. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detected cytokine-related mRNA expressions in human mononuclear cells incubated with CR. An increase in the concentration of CR in culturing medium downregulated granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulatory factor mRNA expression while upregulated interleuken-2 mRNA expression.

Unfortunately, its poor aqueous solubility hampers its parenteral formulation, whereas oral administration of ATRA is associated with progressively diminishing drug levels in plasma, which is related to induction of retinoic acid-binding proteins and increased drug catabolism by cytochrome P450-mediated reactions. An ATRA formulation, obtained by complexation of the drug into polymeric micelles, might be suitable for parenteral administration overcoming these unwanted effects. To this purpose, amphiphilic polymers were prepared by polyvinylalcohol (PVA) partial esterification with nicotinoyl moieties and their functional properties evaluated with regard to ATRA complexation. The physicochemical characteristics of the polymers and the complexes were analyzed by 1H-NMR, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Capillary Electophoresis (CE), and were correlated with the complex ability to improve the drug solubilization and release the free drug in an aqueous environment. Subsequently, the best complex, providing the highest ATRA solubilization and release, was evaluated in vitro to test its cytotoxicity towards neuroblastoma cell lines. The PVA substitution degree calculated from 1H-NMR was found to be 5.0%, 8.2%, 15.3% (nicotinoyl moiety:PVA monomer molar ratio), while capillary electrophoresis analysis on the complexes revealed that the drug loadings were 0.95%, 1.20%, 4.76% (ATRA:polymer w:w) for PVA substitution degrees of 5.0%, 8.2%, and 15.3%, respectively. Complexation strongly increased ATRA aqueous solubility, which reached 1.20 +/- 0.25 mg/mL. The DLS measurements of the polymers and the complexes in aqueous solutions revealed mean sizes always below 400 nm, low polydispersity (min 0.202 +/- 0.013, max 0.450 +/- 0.032), and size almost unaffected by concentration. Drug fractional release did not exceed 8% after 48 h. The cytotoxicity studies against neuroblastoma cell lines outlined a significant growth inhibition effect of complexed ATRA with respect to free ATRA. These data suggest that the systems analyzed may be suitable carriers for parenteral administration of ATRA and other hydrophobic antitumor drugs, where the carriers are required to improve drug aqueous solubility and delay drug release almost after their accumulation in solid tumors.","['Zuccari, G', 'Bergamante, V', 'Carosio, R', 'Gotti, R', 'Montaldo, P G', 'Orienti, I']","['Zuccari G', 'Bergamante V', 'Carosio R', 'Gotti R', 'Montaldo PG', 'Orienti I']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Bologna, Italy. guendalina.zuccari@unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Drug Deliv,Drug delivery,9417471,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Esters)', '0 (Micelles)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9002-89-5 (Polyvinyl Alcohol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Drug Carriers/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Esters/chemistry', 'Humans', '*Infusions, Parenteral', 'Micelles', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Polyvinyl Alcohol/chemistry', 'Solubility', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/02/26 09:00,2009/11/03 06:00,['2009/02/26 09:00'],"['2009/02/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['909051219 [pii]', '10.1080/10717540902757499 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Deliv. 2009 May;16(4):189-95. doi: 10.1080/10717540902757499.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is currently recommended that patients with CLL stages 0 and I follow a watchful waiting strategy. These patients are, therefore, a suitable group for testing immunotherapeutic approaches to avoid problems of immunosuppression as a result of disease progression and chemotherapy. In this study, we investigated the expression of SEMG-1 in early CLL to determine the suitability of SEMG-1 as a target for further development of tumor vaccines for early CLL. METHODS: A combination of reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunocytochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of SEMG-1 in early CLL. The results were correlated with Zap 70 expression. Recombinant SEMG-1 protein was used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine the presence of SEMG-1 antibodies (Ab) in serum from these patients. RESULTS: The SEMG-1 gene was expressed in 19/41 (46%) patients with early CLL. Gene expression was associated with protein synthesis in CLL cells. Protein expression, however, was heterogeneous within individual patients. Only transcripts encoding the SEMG-1(50) variant and not SEMG-1(43) were detected. SEMG-1(50) was expressed irrespective of the Zap 70 status. High-titer SEMG-1 IgG but not IgM Ab were detected in some of these patients, suggesting that SEMG-1-reactive immune responses are intact within the immune repertoire of early CLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: SEMG-1 is expressed in nearly half of patients with early CLL and may be a target for further investigations into its use for immunotherapy of early CLL.","['Ahmed, Sharif Uddin', 'Meklat, Farouk', 'Shahriar, Masum', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Mastulov, Suhkrob', 'Giannakouros, Thomas', 'Jewell, Andrew', 'Zhang, Yana', 'Lim, Seah H']","['Ahmed SU', 'Meklat F', 'Shahriar M', 'Zhang J', 'Mastulov S', 'Giannakouros T', 'Jewell A', 'Zhang Y', 'Lim SH']","['Harrington Regional Medical Center Inc., Amarillo, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Seminal Vesicle Secretory Proteins)', '0 (seminal vesicle-specific antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Seminal Vesicle Secretory Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/immunology/metabolism']",2009/02/26 09:00,2009/11/11 06:00,['2009/02/26 09:00'],"['2009/02/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['909034716 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240802716608 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2009;11(2):238-44. doi: 10.1080/14653240802716608.,,,,"['R01 CA 088434/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 106283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, both tested substances induced the expression of the megakaryocytic marker CD41a, whereas the expression of the erythroid marker glycophorin-a was decreased or unchanged. Even though the expression of differentiation markers was similar after benoxathian and prazosin treatment in both cell lines, endomitosis of erythroleukemia cells was observed only after prazosin treatment. So far, benoxathian and prazosin are the first described extracellular ligands, which cause megakaryocytic differentiation in K562 and HEL cells.

Survival estimates were much higher for the Filipino-Americans than the Philippine resident population, with particularly large differences (more than 20-30% units) for cancers with good prognosis if diagnosed and treated early (colorectal, breast and cervix), or those with expensive treatment regimens (leukaemias). Filipino-Americans and Caucasians showed very similar survival for all cancer sites except stomach cancer (30.7 vs 23.2%) and leukaemias (37.8 vs 48.4%). The very large differences in the survival estimates of Filipino-Americans and the Philippine resident population highlight the importance of the access to and utilisation of diagnostic and therapeutic facilities in developing countries.

We evaluated two potentially functional CD38 SNPs, intronic rs6449182 (184C>G) and missense rs1800561 (418C>T, Arg140Trp) in two hospital-based case-control studies (study A and validation study B). Genotyping was done using PCR-based assays in a total of 460 Polish Caucasian patients with B-CLL and 503 age-matched and gender-matched controls. We found that frequencies of both variant alleles (rs6449182 G and rs1800561 T) were significantly higher in B-CLL. In study A, logistic regression analysis revealed an association between B-CLL and genotypes: rs6449182 CG [odds ratio (OR), 3.57; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.4-5.3], rs6449182 GG (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.36-11.5), and rs1800561 CT (OR, 6.72; 95% CI, 1.5-30.1), although no homozygous rs1800561 TT genotype was detected in either study. These results were confirmed in study B, which showed an association between B-CLL and genotypes rs6449182 CG (OR, 4.00; 95% CI, 2.7-6.0), rs6449182 GG (OR, 12.84; 95% CI, 4.3-38.7), and rs1800561 CT (OR, 10.12; 95% CI, 1.3-81.6), and in the combined analysis of both studies. We also observed that rs6449182 G carriers had more advanced clinical stage (P=0.002) and tended to be younger at diagnosis (P=0.056). Furthermore, we found higher CD38 transcript levels and higher proportions of CD38-positive cells in carriers of rs6449182 G and rs1800561 T alleles (P<0.05 for all comparisons).

Resistance to drug therapy can develop from increased drug export and/or altered intracellular signaling. Both mechanisms are mediated by the efflux transporters ABCC4 (MRP4), ABCC5 (MRP5), and ABCC11 (MRP8), which are involved in cellular efflux of endogenous signaling molecules (e.g., cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate) and nucleoside analogues. The nucleoside analogue cytosine arabinoside (AraC) is administered to all patients with AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of ABCC transporters MRP4, MRP5, and MRP8 in blast samples from 50 AML patients was investigated by real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis and correlated with clinical outcome measures. Accumulation of radiolabeled AraC, transport of AraC metabolites, and AraC cytotoxicity were analyzed in MRP8-transfected LLC-PK1 cells. RESULTS: Regression analysis revealed that high expression of MRP8 is associated with a low probability of overall survival assessed over 4 years (P<0.03). MRP8-transfected LLC-PK1 cells accumulated reduced intracellular levels of AraC (63% of the parental vector-transfected LLC-PK1 control cells) as well as AraC metabolites. Furthermore, AraC monophosphate was transported by MRP8-enriched membrane vesicles (116+/-6 versus 65+/-13 pmol/mg/10 minutes by control vesicles), and MRP8-transfected cells were resistant to AraC. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that MRP8 is differentially expressed in AML blasts, that expression of MRP8 serves as a predictive marker for treatment outcome in AML, and that efflux of AraC metabolites by MRP8 is a mechanism that contributes to resistance of AML blasts.","['Guo, Yanping', 'Kock, Kathleen', 'Ritter, Christoph A', 'Chen, Zhe-Sheng', 'Grube, Markus', 'Jedlitschky, Gabriele', 'Illmer, Thomas', 'Ayres, Mary', 'Beck, James F', 'Siegmund, Werner', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Kroemer, Heyo K', 'Kruh, Gary D', 'Schaich, Markus']","['Guo Y', 'Kock K', 'Ritter CA', 'Chen ZS', 'Grube M', 'Jedlitschky G', 'Illmer T', 'Ayres M', 'Beck JF', 'Siegmund W', 'Ehninger G', 'Gandhi V', 'Kroemer HK', 'Kruh GD', 'Schaich M']","['Medical Science Division, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090224,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ABCC11 protein, human)', '0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (ABCC5 protein, human)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Blast Crisis', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'LLC-PK1 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Survival Rate']",2009/02/26 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/02/26 09:00'],"['2009/02/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-0442 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0442 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Mar 1;15(5):1762-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0442.

Mutation in the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl is the predominant mechanism of the acquired resistance to STI571. In the present study, we investigated the effect of triptolide on cell survival or apoptosis in CML cells bearing Bcr-Abl-T315I or wild-type Bcr-Abl. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CML cell lines (KBM5 versus KBM5-T315I, BaF3-Bcr-Abl versus BaF3-Bcr-Abl-T315I) and primary cells from CML patients with clinical resistance to STI571 were treated with triptolide, and analyzed in terms of growth, apoptosis, and signal transduction. Nude mouse xenograft model was also used to evaluate the antitumor activity. RESULTS: Triptolide potently down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of Bcr-Abl independently of the caspase or proteosome activation in CML cells. It induced mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in Bcr-Abl-T315I CML cells and primary cells from CML patients with clinical resistance to STI571. Additionally, triptolide inhibited the growth of STI571-sensitive KBM5 and STI571-resistant KBM5-T315I CML cells in nude mouse xenografts. Triptolide also down-regulated the expression of survivin, Mcl-1, and Akt in CML cells, which suggests that it may have multiple targets. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that triptolide is a promising agent to overcome STI571-resistant CML cells, and warrant a clinical trial of triptolide derivatives for CML with Bcr-Abl-T315I mutation.","['Shi, Xianping', 'Jin, Yanli', 'Cheng, Chao', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Zou, Waiyi', 'Zheng, Qin', 'Lu, Zhongzheng', 'Chen, Qi', 'Lai, Yingrong', 'Pan, Jingxuan']","['Shi X', 'Jin Y', 'Cheng C', 'Zhang H', 'Zou W', 'Zheng Q', 'Lu Z', 'Chen Q', 'Lai Y', 'Pan J']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090224,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epoxy Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phenanthrenes/*therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tripterygium/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",2009/02/26 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/02/26 09:00'],"['2009/02/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-2141 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2141 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Mar 1;15(5):1686-97. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2141.

We have previously shown that statins promote differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and enhance generation of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-dependent antileukemic responses. We now provide evidence that statin-dependent leukemic cell differentiation requires engagement and activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase kinase pathway. In addition, in experiments, to define the molecular targets and mediators of statin-induced differentiation, we found a remarkable effect of statins on ATRA-dependent gene transcription, evidenced by the selective induction of over 400 genes by the combination of atorvastatin and ATRA. Altogether, our studies identify novel statin molecular targets linked to differentiation, establish that statins modulate ATRA-dependent transcription, and suggest that combined use of statins with retinoids may provide a novel approach to enhance antileukemic responses in acute promyelocytic leukemia and possibly other leukemias.","['Sassano, Antonella', 'Lo Iacono, Marco', 'Antico, Giovanni', 'Jordan, Alison', 'Uddin, Shahab', 'Calogero, Raffaele A', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Sassano A', 'Lo Iacono M', 'Antico G', 'Jordan A', 'Uddin S', 'Calogero RA', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

Here we report the hydrolysis of the alpha- and beta2-subunits of the tetrameric adaptor protein complex 2 by calpain. Calcium-dependent alpha- and beta2-adaptin hydrolysis was observed in several rat tissues, including brain and primary neuronal cultures. Neuronal alpha- and beta2-adaptin cleavage was inducible by glutamate stimulation and was accompanied by the decreased endocytosis of transferrin. Heterologous expression of truncated forms of the beta2-adaptin subunit significantly decreased the membrane recruitment of clathrin and inhibited clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis. Moreover, the presence of truncated beta2-adaptin sensitized neurons to glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Proteolysis of alpha- and beta2-adaptins, as well as the accessory clathrin adaptors epsin 1, adaptor protein 180, and the clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein, was detected in brain tissues after experimentally induced ischemia and in cases of human Alzheimer disease. The present study further clarifies the central role of calpain in regulating clathrin-dependent endocytosis and provides evidence for a novel mechanism through which calpain activation may promote neurodegeneration: the sensitization of cells to glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity via the decreased internalization of surface receptors.","['Rudinskiy, Nikita', 'Grishchuk, Yulia', 'Vaslin, Anne', 'Puyal, Julien', 'Delacourte, Andre', 'Hirling, Harald', 'Clarke, Peter G H', 'Luthi-Carter, Ruth']","['Rudinskiy N', 'Grishchuk Y', 'Vaslin A', 'Puyal J', 'Delacourte A', 'Hirling H', 'Clarke PG', 'Luthi-Carter R']","['Brain Mind Institute, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Station 15, Lausanne CH1015, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090224,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits)', '0 (Adaptor Protein Complex beta Subunits)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (Picalm protein, rat)', '0 (epsin)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adaptor Protein Complex beta Subunits/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Alzheimer Disease/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Brain/*metabolism/pathology', 'Brain Ischemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calpain/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Clathrin/genetics/*metabolism', '*Endocytosis', 'Female', 'Glutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Male', 'Membrane Lipids/genetics/metabolism', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neurons/*metabolism/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rats, Wistar']",2009/02/26 09:00,2009/06/09 09:00,['2009/02/26 09:00'],"['2009/02/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)58402-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M804740200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 May 1;284(18):12447-58. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M804740200.

Conventional chemotherapy and radiation are efficacious for some lymphoma and leukaemia, however relapse and progressive disease often occurs. The evidence that the immune system can play an essential role in controlling cancer progression provide a basis for the development of active therapies, such as immunization, aimed to evoke or amplify a tumour-specific immune response. However, the inability of the patient's own immune system to mount effective responses against tumour antigens is a major limit of vaccination approaches. The adoptive transfer of effectors of the adaptive immune system is an attractive strategy to circumvent the limitations of autologous immune responses. Donor lymphocyte infusion and the transfer of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) have been the first forms of adoptive therapy approved for clinical use and are still fundamental components of immunotherapy of haematological malignancies. Due to the continuous characterization of tumour-specific antigen, the development of tumour-tailored therapies that exploit the specificity of antibodies and T cell receptors (TCRs) is progressing rapidly. This review highlights the current advances in the field of adoptive immunotherapy of haematological malignancies, starting by elucidating the ongoing progress in passive transfer of MoAbs. We will also discuss recent advances in the adoptive transfer with tumour-specific high avidity T cells, which can be generated ex vivo by the transfer of gene constructs encoding single chain antibodies or TCRs, thus redirecting T cell specificity to selected tumour antigens. The ability to produce gene-modified T cells of desired specificity and defined functional activity may improve in the future T cell based immunotherapy of cancer.","['Cesco-Gaspere, Michela', 'Morris, Emma', 'Stauss, Hans J']","['Cesco-Gaspere M', 'Morris E', 'Stauss HJ']","['Department of Immunology and Molecular Pathology, University College Medical School, Royal Free Hospital Campus, NW3 2PF London, UK. cescogaspere@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090224,Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/immunology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2009/02/25 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2008/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10238-009-0037-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2009 Jun;9(2):81-92. doi: 10.1007/s10238-009-0037-1.

The tetrazolium dye colorimetric assay was used to determine the cytotoxic activity of anthracyclines toward L1210 leukemia cells. DNA damage was measured by alkaline elution technique. The effect of anthracyclines on DNA cleavage was studied in a cell-free system containing supercoiled pBR322 DNA and purified human topoisomerase II. The cytotoxicity data and the results of studies on the mechanism of DNA break formation by anthracyclines at the cellular level and in the cell-free system showed that the presence of the formamidino group in the doxorubicin molecule reduced its ability to stimulate DNA cleavage by DNA topoisomerase II. CONCLUSION: DNA topoisomerase II is not a primary cellular target for DOXM or DOXH. An advantageous feature of formamidinoanthracyclines is their mechanism of cytotoxic action which is not related to the inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II. Therefore this class of anthracyclines seems to be a good source for selection of an anticancer drug directed toward cancer cells with the developed multidrug resistance attributed to the presence of altered DNA topoisomerase II.","['Kik, Krzysztof', 'Studzian, Kazimierz', 'Wasowska-Lukawska, Malgorzata', 'Oszczapowicz, Irena', 'Szmigiero, Leszek']","['Kik K', 'Studzian K', 'Wasowska-Lukawska M', 'Oszczapowicz I', 'Szmigiero L']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090223,Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,"['0 (Amidines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '463-52-5 (formamidine)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Amidines/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Free System', 'DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Razoxane/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2009/02/25 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2008/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]']",['20091749 [pii]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2009;56(1):135-42.

Gene transfer vectors derived from gamma-retroviruses target at high frequency genes involved in the control of growth, development and differentiation of the target cell, and may induce insertional tumors or pre-neoplastic clonal expansions in patients treated by gene therapy. The gene expression program of the target cell is apparently instrumental in directing gamma-retroviral integration, although the molecular basis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. We report a bioinformatic analysis of the distribution of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) flanking >4,000 integrated proviruses in human hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. We show that gamma-retroviral, but not lentiviral vectors, integrate in genomic regions enriched in cell-type specific subsets of TFBSs, independently from their relative position with respect to genes and transcription start sites. Analysis of sequences flanking the integration sites of Moloney leukemia virus (MLV)- and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived vectors carrying mutations in their long terminal repeats (LTRs), and of HIV vectors packaged with an MLV integrase, indicates that the MLV integrase and LTR enhancer are the viral determinants of the selection of TFBS-rich regions in the genome. This study identifies TFBSs as differential genomic determinants of retroviral target site selection in the human genome, and suggests that transcription factors binding the LTR enhancer may synergize with the integrase in tethering retroviral pre-integration complexes to transcriptionally active regulatory regions. Our data indicate that gamma-retroviruses and lentiviruses have evolved dramatically different strategies to interact with the host cell chromatin, and predict a higher risk in using gamma-retroviral vs. lentiviral vectors for human gene therapy applications.","['Felice, Barbara', 'Cattoglio, Claudia', 'Cittaro, Davide', 'Testa, Anna', 'Miccio, Annarita', 'Ferrari, Giuliana', 'Luzi, Lucilla', 'Recchia, Alessandra', 'Mavilio, Fulvio']","['Felice B', 'Cattoglio C', 'Cittaro D', 'Testa A', 'Miccio A', 'Ferrari G', 'Luzi L', 'Recchia A', 'Mavilio F']","['IFOM, FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology Foundation, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090224,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Gammaretrovirus/physiology', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Integrases/genetics', 'Lentivirus/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Virus Integration']",2009/02/25 09:00,2009/04/14 09:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2008/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0004571 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(2):e4571. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004571.

We present here the validation of the bioprocess which we developed for the production and expansion of clinical grade autologous T cells derived from patients with CLL. We demonstrate that T cells genetically modified with a replication-defective gammaretroviral vector derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeted to CD19 (1928z) can be expanded with Dynabeads CD3/CD28. This bioprocess allows us to generate clinical doses of 1928z+ T cells in approximately 2 to 3 weeks in a large-scale semiclosed culture system using the Wave Bioreactor. These 1928z+ T cells remain biologically functional not only in vitro but also in severe combined immunodeficient-beige mice bearing disseminated tumors. The validation requirements in terms of T-cell expansion, T-cell transduction with the 1928z CAR, biologic activity, quality control testing, and release criteria were met for all 4 validation runs using apheresis products from patients with CLL. Additionally, after expansion of the T cells, the diversity of the skewed Vbeta T-cell receptor repertoire was significantly restored. This validated process will be used in phase I clinical trials in patients with chemorefractory CLL and in patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It can also be adapted for other clinical trials involving the expansion and transduction of patient or donor T cells using any CAR or T-cell receptor.","['Hollyman, Daniel', 'Stefanski, Jolanta', 'Przybylowski, Mark', 'Bartido, Shirley', 'Borquez-Ojeda, Oriana', 'Taylor, Clare', 'Yeh, Raymond', 'Capacio, Vanessa', 'Olszewska, Malgorzata', 'Hosey, James', 'Sadelain, Michel', 'Brentjens, Renier J', 'Riviere, Isabelle']","['Hollyman D', 'Stefanski J', 'Przybylowski M', 'Bartido S', 'Borquez-Ojeda O', 'Taylor C', 'Yeh R', 'Capacio V', 'Olszewska M', 'Hosey J', 'Sadelain M', 'Brentjens RJ', 'Riviere I']","['Gene Transfer and Somatic Cell Engineering Facility, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Bioreactors', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen/*genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2009/02/25 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CJI.0b013e318194a6e8 [doi]', '00002371-200902000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2009 Feb-Mar;32(2):169-80. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e318194a6e8.,,,,"['P01 CA059350-129002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA086438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA059350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748-44/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-059350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA086438-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA023766-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2683970,,['NIHMS87197'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a first-in-man, open-label, phase I dose-escalation study. AEG35156 was administered by continuous intravenous infusion over 7 days (7DI) or 3 days (3DI) of a 21-day treatment cycle. Dose escalation started at 48 mg/m(2)/d and continued until consistent dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were entered in seven cohorts. Grade 3 to 4 adverse events were uncommon and were predominantly abnormal laboratory values: elevated ALT, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia. DLTs comprised elevated hepatic enzymes, hypophosphatemia, and thrombocytopenia. The maximum-tolerated doses were defined as 125 mg/m(2)/d for the 7DI regimen and < or = 213 mg/m(2)/d for the 3DI schedule. AEG35156 area under the plasma concentration curve and peak plasma concentration increased proportionally with dose. Suppression of XIAP mRNA levels was maximal at 72 hours (mean suppression, 21%), and this coincided with a dramatic decrease in circulating tumor cells in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Two further patients had unconfirmed partial responses. Circulating biomarkers of cell death and apoptosis altered in association with drug infusion and toxicity. CONCLUSION: In this first-in-man study, AEG35156 was well tolerated, with predictable toxicities, pharmacokinetic properties, and clinical evidence of antitumor activity in patients with refractory lymphoma, melanoma, and breast cancer. Phase I/II trials of AEG35156 chemotherapy combinations are ongoing in patients with pancreatic, breast, non-small-cell lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors for which docetaxel is indicated.","['Dean, Emma', 'Jodrell, Duncan', 'Connolly, Kate', 'Danson, Sarah', 'Jolivet, Jacques', 'Durkin, Jon', 'Morris, Stephen', 'Jowle, Debra', 'Ward, Tim', 'Cummings, Jeff', 'Dickinson, Gemma', 'Aarons, Leon', 'Lacasse, Eric', 'Robson, Lesley', 'Dive, Caroline', 'Ranson, Malcolm']","['Dean E', 'Jodrell D', 'Connolly K', 'Danson S', 'Jolivet J', 'Durkin J', 'Morris S', 'Jowle D', 'Ward T', 'Cummings J', 'Dickinson G', 'Aarons L', 'Lacasse E', 'Robson L', 'Dive C', 'Ranson M']","['Christie Hospital National Health Service Foundation Trust, Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, and School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090223,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (AEG 35156)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Oligonucleotides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/drug effects/genetics']",2009/02/25 09:00,2009/04/30 09:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.19.5677 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.19.5677 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 1;27(10):1660-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.19.5677.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) represents an important paradigm for understanding the genetic and epigenetic events involved in CSC production. CML progresses from a chronic phase (CP) in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that harbor the BCR-ABL translocation, to blast crisis (BC), characterized by aberrant activation of beta-catenin within granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP). A major barrier to predicting and inhibiting blast crisis transformation has been the identification of mechanisms driving beta-catenin activation. Here we show that BC CML myeloid progenitors, in particular GMP, serially transplant leukemia in immunocompromised mice and thus are enriched for leukemia stem cells (LSC). Notably, cDNA sequencing of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway regulatory genes, including adenomatous polyposis coli, GSK3beta, axin 1, beta-catenin, lymphoid enhancer factor-1, cyclin D1, and c-myc, revealed a novel in-frame splice deletion of the GSK3beta kinase domain in the GMP of BC samples that was not detectable by sequencing in blasts or normal progenitors. Moreover, BC CML progenitors with misspliced GSK3beta have enhanced beta-catenin expression as well as serial engraftment potential while reintroduction of full-length GSK3beta reduces both in vitro replating and leukemic engraftment. We propose that CP CML is initiated by BCR-ABL expression in an HSC clone but that progression to BC may include missplicing of GSK3beta in GMP LSC, enabling unphosphorylated beta-catenin to participate in LSC self-renewal.

However, it is not clear whether or not abnormal expression of Runx1 will induce leukemia and how the change of Runx1 expression level could affect BCR-ABL-induced leukemogenesis. In the present study, we aimed to analyze if abnormal expression of Runx1 in BaF3 cells alone would induce leukemogenesis. And we also wanted to know if abnormal expression of Runx1 in leukemic cells would affect leukemogenesis. Furthermore, we investigated whether overexpression or knock-down of Runx1 in BaF3 cells would induce leukemogenesis. METHODS: Plasmids containing full-length Runx1 cDNA were transduced into BaF3 cells and BaF3-P185wt cells (BCR-ABL transformed BaF3 cells) by electroporation. Plasmids containing a short hairpin RNA of Runx1 were transduced into BaF3 cells and BaF3-P185wt cells by electroporation. Runx1 expression level was quantified by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR. The effects of overexpression or knock-down of Runx1 on proliferation, apoptosis and migration of cells were detected in vitro. Then, using MSCV-P185wt-EGFP as a control, we transplanted MSCV-P185wt-Runx1 cells or MSCV-P185wt-shRNA cells into Balb/c mice through tail vein and observed tumorgenesis of the different phenotypes. RESULTS: In vitro analysis revealed that overexpression of Runx1 in P185wt cells could inhibit cell proliferation and slow down cell migration; while knock-down of Runx1 could promote cell proliferation and speed up cell migration. In vivo analysis indicated that mice transplanted with MSCV-P185wt-Runx1 survived longer than controls. In contrast, mice transplanted with MSCV-P185wt-shRNA survived shorter than the control group. Gross pathological analysis revealed that the MSCV-P185wt-Runx1 group had less severe splenomegaly and hepatomegaly compared to the control group, and the MSCV-P185wt-shRNA group had more severe splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. No splenomegaly or hepatomegaly was detected in mice transplanted with MSCV-BaF3-Runx1 cells or MSCV-BaF3-shRNA cells. Both the mice of MSCV-BaF3-Runx1 group and MSCV-BaF3-shRNA group were healthy with no sign of leukemia for up to three months. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression or knock-down of Runx1 gene in BaF3 cells alone could not induce leukemogenesis. However, in BaF3-P185wt cells, alteration of Runx1 expression could affect BCR-ABL-induced proliferation and migration in vitro and leukemogenesis in vivo.","['Yang, Li-jun', 'Yu, Wei-dong', 'DU, Jun-bao', 'Chao, Shuang', 'Chen, Min-xia', 'Zhao, He-hua', 'Guo, Jing-zhu']","['Yang LJ', 'Yu WD', 'DU JB', 'Chao S', 'Chen MX', 'Zhao HH', 'Guo JZ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/02/25 09:00,2009/05/23 09:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2009 Feb 5;122(3):331-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Phi bodies were observed with detection rate of Phi bodies in different leukemias. 69 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) specimens were chosen randomly, the positive rate and the number of Phi bodies between the improved HPO and POX stain based on the same substrate of 3, 3'diaminobenzidine were compared. The results showed that the shape of bundle-like Phi bodies was variable, long or short. while the nubbly Phi bodies often presented oval and smooth. Club-like Phi bodies were found in M(3). The detection rates of bundle-like Phi bodies in AML M(1)-M(5) were 42.9% (6/14), 83.3% (15/18), 92.0% (23/25), 52.3% (11/21), 33.3% (5/15) respectively, and those of nubbly Phi bodies were 28.6% (4/14), 66.7% (12/18), 11.1% (3/25), 33.3% (7/21), 20.0% (3/15) respectively. The detection rate of bundle-like Phi bodies in M(3) was significantly higher than that in (M(1) + M(2)) or (M(4) + M(5)) groups. The detection rate of nubbly Phi bodies in (M(1) + M(2)) group was higher than that in M(3) group. In conclusion, after improvement of staining method, the HPO stain becomes simple, the detection rate of Phi bodies is higher than that by the previous method, the positive granules are more obvious, and the results become stable.

Cytogenetic analysis was performed in all patients, 15 patients had cytogenetic aberrations including 4 complex abnormalities. All patients were treated with standard-dose idarubicin [12 mg/(m(2).d), days 1 to 3] and continuous infusion of cytarabine [100 mg/(m(2).d), days 1 to 7]. The results showed that after one course of induction therapy, the overall response rate was 89.5% (34/38), and 32 out of 38 (84.2%) patients achieved complete remission (CR), including 27 of 30 (90.0%) new diagnosed AML patients, 5 (62.5%) refractory and relapsed AML patients, all 4 patients with complex cytogenetic aberrations achieved cytogenetic CR. Out of 6 relapsed patients 2 showed as extramedullary relapse, 4 showed as bone marrow relapse. The median survival duration was > 22 months and median disease-free survival time was > 16 months. Myelosuppression and infections due to neutropenia were the most frequent adverse effects, severe nonhematologic toxicity and the early death were not observed in the patients. It is concluded that standard-dose of idarubicin combined with continuous infusions of cytarabine as the induction therapy is highly effective and well tolerated approach in patients with AML, this regimen provides an opportune moment for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Qian, Si-Xuan', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Wu, Han-Xin', 'Lu, Hua', 'Qiu, Hong-Xia', 'Chen, Li-Juan', 'Lu, Rui-Nan', 'Xu, Wei', 'Sheng, Rui-Lan']","['Qian SX', 'Li JY', 'Wu HX', 'Lu H', 'Qiu HX', 'Chen LJ', 'Lu RN', 'Xu W', 'Sheng RL']","['Department of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province People Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.']",['chi'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/02/25 09:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)01-0209-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Feb;17(1):209-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that the Id4 gene was methylated in 18 patients before allo-PBSCT, out of which Id4 gene methylation in 8 patients could be detected sustainedly after allo-PBSCT, whereas among remaining 11 patients with Id4 gene unmethylation before PBSCT, the Id4 gene of only one case was found to be methylated after PBSCT. Out of 9 patients with Id4 gene methylation after allo-PBSCT, 4 had relapse during the follow-up. 20 patients with Id4 gene unmethylation after allo-PBSCT were in continuously complete remission status. Id4 gene methylation was found more frequently between 6 months and 1 year after allo-PBSCT. It is concluded that detecting Id4 gene methylation is important for the AL patients who underwent allo-PBSCT. Choosing the patients with Id4 gene unmethylaiton to receive allo-PBSCT may help to reduce relapse rate. After allo-PBSCT, Id4 gene methylation status can be regarded as an indicator for predicting prognosis of acute leukemias.","['Zhao, Yu', 'Li, Hong-Hua', 'Bo, Jian', 'Jing, Yu', 'Gao, Chun-Ji', 'Wang, Quan-Shun', 'Yu, Li']","['Zhao Y', 'Li HH', 'Bo J', 'Jing Y', 'Gao CJ', 'Wang QS', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (ID4 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2009/02/25 09:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2009)01-0151-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Feb;17(1):151-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunofluorescent analysis by multiparameter flow cytometry was performed at the double gating of CD45/SSC to determine the immunophenotype of MDS cells in all cases. All patients were followed up. 47 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M1, 51 cases of AML-M(2) and 38 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were selected as control. Software SPSS 13.0 was applied to analyze all the related data. The results showed that the positive expression rate of HLA-DR in RAEB-II was 100%, which was high in sensitivity and specificity. CD13 (94.74%), CD33 (84.21%) and CD117 (78.95%) were also highly expressed in RAEB-II.

Compared with AML-M(1) and AML-M(2), no significant difference of CD13 and CD117 in RAEB-II was found (p > 0.05). CD33 (p < 0.01) and CD34 (p < 0.05) were significantly lower than that in AML-M(1), but no significant difference was found as compared with AML-M(2) (p > 0.05); CD15 (p < 0.01) and CD11b (p < 0.05) was significantly lower than that in M(2), but no significant difference was found as compared with AML-M(1) (p > 0.05); MPO was significantly lower than that in AML-M(1) and M(2) (p < 0.05); HLA-DR was significantly higher than that on AML-M(2) (p < 0.05), but no significant difference was found as compared with AML-M(1) (p > 0.05). RAEB-II did not express CD2, CD3, CD5 and CD8 (positive rate 0%, p < 0.01) when compared with T-ALL; CD4 (p < 0.05) and CD7 (p < 0.01) were significantly lower than that in T-ALL. RAEB-II did not express CD19 and CD20 (positive rate 0%, p < 0.01) as compared with B-ALL; CD10, CD22 and cCD79a were significantly lower than that in B-ALL (p < 0.05). CD117 (p = 0.0197) and MPO (p = 0.0085) were the two prognostic immunological antigens as regards the overall survival (OS) of MDS; CD117 (p = 0.003) was the single parameter in Cox regression. It is concluded that RAEB-II expresses mainly myeloid antigen without or with little expression of lymphoid antigen. Unique individual immunophenotypic features can be detected in patients with RAEB-II. HLA-DR can be a specific parameter to distinguish the other subtypes of MDS.

Telomerase activity was analyzed by telomere repeat amplification protocol. Gene expression was detected by microarray and confirmed by RT-PCR assay. The results showed that diimide small molecule inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells and induced apoptosis of these cells. After treating with diimide G-quadruplex ligand, telomerase activity of K562 cells was reduced and the transcriptional levels of some important genes were changed significantly.

Using electronic absorption spectroscopy, we show that imatinib binding results in a perturbation of the protein environment around the flavin prosthetic group in NQO2. We have determined the crystal structure of the complex of imatinib with human NQO2 at 1.75 A resolution, which reveals that imatinib binds in the enzyme active site, adjacent to the flavin isoalloxazine ring. We find that phosphorylation of NQO2 has little effect on enzyme activity and is therefore likely to regulate other aspects of NQO2 function. CONCLUSION: The structure of the imatinib-NQO2 complex demonstrates that imatinib inhibits NQO2 activity by competing with substrate for the active site. The overall conformation of imatinib when bound to NQO2 resembles the folded conformation observed in some kinase complexes. Interactions made by imatinib with residues at the rim of the active site provide an explanation for the binding selectivity of NQO2 for imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. These interactions also provide a rationale for the lack of inhibition of the related oxidoreductase NQO1 by these compounds. Taken together, these studies provide insight into the mechanism of NQO2 inhibition by imatinib, with potential implications for drug design and treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia in patients.","['Winger, Jonathan A', 'Hantschel, Oliver', 'Superti-Furga, Giulio', 'Kuriyan, John']","['Winger JA', 'Hantschel O', 'Superti-Furga G', 'Kuriyan J']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley, USA. wingerj@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090224,England,BMC Struct Biol,BMC structural biology,101088689,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.99.- (NRH - quinone oxidoreductase2)', 'EC 1.6.99.- (Quinone Reductases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Molecular Structure', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/chemistry/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Quinone Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use']",2009/02/25 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2009/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['1472-6807-9-7 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6807-9-7 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Struct Biol. 2009 Feb 24;9:7. doi: 10.1186/1472-6807-9-7.,,,,,PMC2655291,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has 325-fold greater in vitro activity against native BCR-ABL (breakpoint cluster region-Abelson leukemia virus) compared with imatinib and can overcome primary (intrinsic) and secondary (acquired) imatinib resistance. Here, we review the clinical profile of dasatinib in imatinib-resistant and -intolerant patients and share clinical approaches for managing adverse events (AEs) to ensure maximum patient benefit. References were obtained through literature searches on PubMed as well as from the Proceedings of Annual Meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society of Hematology, and European Hematology Association. Phase II and III studies of dasatinib in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML in any phase or Ph+ ALL were selected for discussion. Dasatinib is currently indicated for the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML or Ph+ ALL. AEs associated with dasatinib are typically mild to moderate, and are usually resolved with temporary treatment interruption and/or dose adjustments. A Phase III dose optimization study showed that in patients with chronic phase (CP) CML, 100 mg once-daily dasatinib improves the safety profile, particularly pleural effusion and thrombocytopenia, while maintaining efficacy compared with the previously recommended dose of 70 mg twice-daily. Dasatinib has a manageable safety profile. For patients with CP CML, a new recommended starting dose of 100 mg once daily has recently been approved. The recommended dose for patients with advanced CML or Ph+ ALL remains 70 mg twice daily.","['Wong, Siu-Fun']",['Wong SF'],"['Western University of Health Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Pomona, CA, USA. siuwong@westernu.edu']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20090223,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Thiazoles/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/02/25 09:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2008/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-10 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Feb 23;2:10. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-10.,,57,,,PMC2649947,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), sustains proliferation and not differentiation of embryonic stem cells. We used CD133 to purify adult human retinal cells and aimed to determine what effect LIF had on these cultures and whether they still had the ability to generate neurospheres. METHODS: Retinal cell suspensions were derived from adult human post-mortem tissue with ethical approval. With magnetic automated cell sorting (MACS) CD133+ retinal cells were enriched from post mortem adult human retina. CD133+ retinal cell phenotype was analysed by flow cytometry and cultured cells were observed for proliferative capacity, neuropshere generation and differentiation with or without LIF supplementation. RESULTS: We demonstrated purification (to 95%) of CD133+ cells from adult human postmortem retina. Proliferating cells were identified through BrdU incorporation and expression of the proliferation markers Ki67 and Cyclin D1. CD133+ retinal cells differentiated whilst forming neurospheres containing appropriate lineage markers including glia, neurons and photoreceptors. LIF maintained CD133+ retinal cells in a proliferative and relatively undifferentiated state (Ki67, Cyclin D1 expression) without significant neurosphere generation. Differentiation whilst forming neurospheres was re-established on LIF withdrawal. CONCLUSION: These data support the evidence that CD133 expression characterises a population of cells within the resident adult human retina which have progenitor cell properties and that their turnover and differentiation is influenced by LIF. This may explain differences in retinal responses observed following disease or injury.","['Carter, Debra A', 'Dick, Andrew D', 'Mayer, Eric J']","['Carter DA', 'Dick AD', 'Mayer EJ']","['Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Department of Clinical Sciences South Bristol, University of Bristol, Bristol Eye Hospital, Lower Maudlin Street, Bristol BS12LX, UK. debbie.carter@bristol.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090223,England,BMC Ophthalmol,BMC ophthalmology,100967802,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Adult', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/analysis/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin D1/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Neuroglia/cytology/metabolism', '*Peptides', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate/cytology/metabolism', 'Retina/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism']",2009/02/25 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2008/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2415-9-1 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2415-9-1 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Ophthalmol. 2009 Feb 23;9:1. doi: 10.1186/1471-2415-9-1.,,,,,PMC2649894,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results were grouped and combined according to: addition of an anthracycline to standard therapy, type of anthracycline, mode of administration, and the use of a cardioprotectant. Data from 958 patients in 4 trials, recruiting between 1972 and 1984, showed that addition of an anthracycline reduced bone marrow relapse and, non-significantly, non-bone marrow relapse, resulting in an increased relapse-free interval. However there was a non-significant increase in induction failures, and in deaths in first remission. Event-free survival at 5 years was 56.7% with anthracycline versus 52.8% without (Odds Ratio = 0.91; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.76-1.10; P = 0.3). There were no significant differences found in other treatment comparisons. The limited data from trials did not demonstrate differences in clinically evident cardiotoxicity.

RESULTS: A total of 402 patients were studied (median age, 56 yrs; median follow-up 70 months). The prevalence of abnormal cytogenetics at diagnosis was 7% (28 of 402). The most common cytogenetic anomalies were trisomy 9 (four patients), abnormal chromosome 1 (three patients) and trisomy 8 (two patients). Parameters at diagnosis that were significantly associated with abnormal cytogenetics included palpable splenomegaly (P = 0.03), current tobacco use (P = 0.04); venous thrombosis (P = 0.02), and anemia with a hemoglobin of <10 g/dL (P = 0.02); but did not include JAK2V617F mutation status, or advanced age. During follow up, patients with abnormal cytogenetics did not have shorter survival, or increased transformation to acute leukemia or myelofibrosis.

These cytokines have been shown to alter neural stem cell (NSC) self-renewal and progenitor cell division and differentiation, which could be mediated by the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Using neurospheres from the adult mouse subventricular zone (SVZ), we found that acute or chronic exposure to LIF or CNTF differentially affects sphere development and sphere growth. Both cytokines also favor the amplification of NSCs. Contrasting results were obtained with IL-6 or leptin, although both cytokines also activate the JAK/STAT pathway. Stimulating NSC self-renewal in vivo could be of therapeutic interest for treating neurodegeneration. When applied to the adult mouse brain, chronic LIF stimulates NSC self-renewal but prevents the emergence of more differentiated progeny. On the other hand, acute LIF treatment stimulates SVZ regeneration, most likely through an increase in NSCs. These results reveal that cytokine effects could vary as a function of exposure duration and suggest that, in the search for strategies to promote brain repair, in vivo acute LIF treatment could promote cell replacement.","['Bauer, Sylvian']",['Bauer S'],"['Centre de Recherche en Neurobiologie et Neurophysiologie de Marseille (CRN2M), Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 6231, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)-Universites Aix-Marseille I and II, Marseille, France. sylvian.bauer@univ-cezanne.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Neurons/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Regeneration/drug effects']",2009/02/25 09:00,2009/03/26 09:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/26 09:00 [medline]']","['NYAS03986 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.03986.x [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2009 Feb;1153:48-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.03986.x.,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the most significant applications of mAb-based regimens in the treatment of hematological malignancies and explore their possible role in the future management of these patients. RESULTS: Rituximab (anti-CD20) was the first mAb developed for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas. Several randomized studies have demonstrated its efficacy in lymphomas and low toxicity profile; rituximab also has significant activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) has shown efficacy in previously untreated or refractory CLL patients, while gemtuzumab ozogamicin (anti-CD33) appears to have significant activity in acute myeloid leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes.

The mechanisms through which the thiopurines elicit their cytotoxic effects remain unclear. We postulate that the incorporation of 6-thioguanine into the CpG site may perturb the methyltransferase-mediated cytosine methylation at this site, thereby interfering with the epigenetic pathways of gene regulation. To gain biochemical evidence for this hypothesis, we assessed, by using a restriction enzyme digestion coupled with LC-MS/MS method, the impact of 6-thioguanine on cytosine methylation mediated by two DNA methyltransferases, human DNMT1 and bacterial HpaII. Our results revealed that the incorporation of 6-thioguanine into the CpG site could affect the methylation of the cytosine residue by both methyltransferases and the effect on cytosine methylation is dependent on the position of 6-thioguanine with respect to the cytosine to be methylated. The presence of 6-thioguanine at the methylated CpG site enhanced the DNMT1-mediated methylation of the opposing cytosine in the complementary strand, whereas the presence of 6-thioguanine at the unmethylated CpG site abolished almost completely the methylation of its 5' adjacent cytosine by both DNMT1 and HpaII. We further demonstrated that the treatment of Jurkat T cells, which were derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with 6-thioguanine could result in an appreciable drop in the level of global cytosine methylation. These results showed that 6-thioguanine, after being incorporated into DNA, may perturb the epigenetic pathway of gene regulation.","['Wang, Hongxia', 'Wang, Yinsheng']","['Wang H', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, California 92521-0403, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)"", '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA modification methylase HpaII)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA-Cytosine Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytosine/*metabolism', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA-Cytosine Methylases/*metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Thioguanine/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2009/02/25 09:00,2009/12/18 06:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi801467z [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2009 Mar 17;48(10):2290-9. doi: 10.1021/bi801467z.,,,,"['R01 CA101864-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096906-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA96906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2673989,,['NIHMS97728'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with B-cell NHL of many types had consistently lower median immunoglobulin subclass levels than controls. In every subclass except IgD, about 10-15% of B-cell NHL patients had absolute levels below the 2.5 percentile of controls. Subclass levels correlated with each other and many patients had more than one significantly low level. Levels were lowest for IgG(4) and IgE. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma had especially low total IgE levels. In other B-cell NHL types, total IgE levels were decreased to a similar extent as other immunoglobulin subclasses. In conclusion, low IgE levels are only part of a more generalized loss of immunoglobulins of all subtypes in a wide variety of B-cell NHL types. Low immunoglobulin levels appear to be a consequence of B-cell NHL presence, and we speculate about molecular mechanisms that could reduce all immunoglobulin subclasses in B-cell NHL.","['Biggar, Robert J', 'Christiansen, Michael', 'Rostgaard, Klaus', 'Smedby, Karin Ekstrom', 'Adami, Hans-Olov', 'Glimelius, Bengt', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Melbye, Mads']","['Biggar RJ', 'Christiansen M', 'Rostgaard K', 'Smedby KE', 'Adami HO', 'Glimelius B', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Melbye M']","['Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark. rjb@ssi.dk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B7-1 Antigen/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Immunoglobulins/blood/*classification', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2009/02/25 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24245 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Jun 1;124(11):2616-20. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24245.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antiproliferative properties of each test compound are in agreement with those reported in the literature, while the high potency of amarbellisine is reported for the first time. It was also found that with the exception of ungeremine, amarbellisine, and hippeastrine, the antiproliferative effect of the potent compounds is apoptosis mediated. Thus, apoptosis in Jurkat cells was triggered by narciclasine, narciclasine tetraacetate, C10b-R-hydroxypancratistatin, cis-dihydronarciclasine, trans-dihydronarciclasine, lycorine, 1-O-acetyllycorine, lycorine-2-one, pseudolycorine, and haemanthamine.

The anti-invasive activity of buphanamine is particularly promising because this alkaloid is not toxic to cells even at much higher doses.

The aberrant methylation of AR gene could be one molecular and genetic alteration in leukemia.","['Liu, Ze-Jun', 'Wang, Gang', 'Cai, Yun', 'Gu, Shou-Zhi', 'Zhang, Xiao-Bing', 'Liu, Li', 'Gao, Xing']","['Liu ZJ', 'Wang G', 'Cai Y', 'Gu SZ', 'Zhang XB', 'Liu L', 'Gao X']","['Laboratory of International cooperation, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China. zejunliu2000@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (AR protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Androgen/*genetics']",2009/02/25 09:00,2009/03/12 09:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [medline]']","['908975492 [pii]', '10.1080/07357900802208590 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2009 Feb;27(2):156-62. doi: 10.1080/07357900802208590.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m) and apoptosis was maximized in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes after incubation with gossypol. Pretreatment with a caspase-9 inhibitor or antioxidants (superoxide dismutase or Trolox) inhibited gossypol-induced loss of the delta psi m and apoptosis. Likewise, we observed participation of caspase -3, -7, and -10 in gossypol-induced apoptosis. Expression of the proapoptotic genes bax, bak, bad and p53/Tp53 increased in polymorphonuclear leukocytes exposed to gossypol. The expression of the anti-apoptotic genes bcl-(XL) and mcl-1 was reduced when polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes were treated with gossypol. Gossypol treatment also inhibited yeast phagocytosis by these cells. We concluded that gossypol induces apoptosis in phagocytic cells and that this effect was dose-dependent. The findings in this report may be important to consider in light of possible gossypol use in clinical strategies for cancer treatment.","['Barba-Barajas, Martha', 'Hernandez-Flores, Georgina', 'Lerma-Diaz, Jose M', 'Ortiz-Lazareno, Pablo C', 'Dominguez-Rodriguez, Jorge R', 'Barba-Barajas, Leticia', 'de Celis, Ruth', 'Jave-Suarez, Luis F', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy, Adriana C', 'Guevara-Barraza, Mario G', 'Bravo-Cuellar, Alejandro']","['Barba-Barajas M', 'Hernandez-Flores G', 'Lerma-Diaz JM', 'Ortiz-Lazareno PC', 'Dominguez-Rodriguez JR', 'Barba-Barajas L', 'de Celis R', 'Jave-Suarez LF', 'Aguilar-Lemarroy AC', 'Guevara-Barraza MG', 'Bravo-Cuellar A']","['Division de Inmunologia, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente, IMSS, Guadalajara, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)', 'S18UL9710X (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Chromans/metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Gossypol/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis', 'Young Adult', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/biosynthesis']",2009/02/25 09:00,2010/10/21 06:00,['2009/02/25 09:00'],"['2009/02/25 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['908958725 [pii]', '10.1080/08923970902718049 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2009 Jun;31(2):320-30. doi: 10.1080/08923970902718049.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: : The drug was given to 17 patients with acute leukemia as salvage for disease recurrence after HSCT (n = 9 patients) or as maintenance therapy (n = 8 patients). 5-Azacitidine was given subcutaneously daily for 5 days and was repeated every 4 weeks at doses of 16 mg/m(2) (n = 4 patients), 24 mg/m(2) (n = 9 patients), and 40 mg/m(2) (n = 4 patients). A median of 8 cycles was delivered. The median follow-up was 16 months and 11 months after HSCT and 5-azacitidine treatment, respectively. RESULTS: : Five of 9 patients with recurrent disease responded. Four of 13 responding patients developed disease recurrence while they were receiving 5-azacitidine after a median of 10 months. The actuarial 1-year event-free and overall survival rates were 55% and 90%, respectively. There were no extramedullary toxicities, and no graft-versus-host disease exacerbation was observed. CONCLUSIONS: : Low-dose 5-azacitidine may induce durable remissions for patients who develop disease recurrence after HSCT.

Previous authors have reported both positive and negative human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations with CML, possibly as the result of different antigenic peptide presentation capabilities. We examined HLA Class I and Class II antigen polymorphisms in 31 patients with CML and compared these with 258 control individuals drawn from Maritime Canada. HLA-B*13 (odds ratios (OR) 4.92, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.70-14.24), HLA-B*55 (OR 4.50, 95%CI 1.07-18.99), and HLA-DRB1*16 (OR 4.07, 95%CI 1.17-14.09) were all statistically significant risk markers for CML. After a Bonferroni correction for Type I error was applied, only HLA-B*13 remained statistically significant as a risk marker for CML. No HLA antigens were found to be protective. The lack of reproducibility of HLA antigen associations with CML suggests that these associations are population-specific and may not be due to HLA antigen-restricted differences in CML antigen presentation.","['Naugler, Christopher', 'Liwski, Robert']","['Naugler C', 'Liwski R']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Risk Factors']",2009/02/24 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/02/24 09:00'],"['2009/02/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']","['908860063 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802668873 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Feb;50(2):254-9. doi: 10.1080/10428190802668873.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for CSC in human tumors initially arose from studies of AML, but functionally similar cell populations have been identified in an increasing number of malignancies. Despite these findings, controversy surrounds the CSC hypothesis, especially the generalization that clonogenic tumor cells are rare. Nevertheless, efforts to define the cellular processes regulating self-renewal and resistance to anticancer therapeutics, two of the major properties ascribed to CSC, are likely to provide useful insights into tumor biology as a whole. BMT has been at the forefront of clinically translating basic stem cell concepts starting with the original hypothesis that normal hematopoietic precursors could rescue patients from myeloablative doses of radiation or chemotherapy. Even today, a better understanding of CSC may enhance ongoing efforts to induce specific and effective anti-tumor immune responses in both the allogeneic and autologous setting. It is also likely that new clinical research approaches will be required to accurately evaluate novel CSC-targeting strategies. Owing to the capacity to produce remissions in most diseases, SCT may provide the ideal clinical platform to carry out these investigations by studying the ability of anti-CSC agents to prolong relapse free and overall survival.","['Lin, T', 'Jones, R J', 'Matsui, W']","['Lin T', 'Jones RJ', 'Matsui W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology and Oncology, LSU School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090223,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/etiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2009/02/24 09:00,2009/07/07 09:00,['2009/02/24 09:00'],"['2009/02/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/07 09:00 [medline]']","['bmt200919 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2009.19 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2009 Apr;43(7):517-23. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2009.19.

In Bcr-Abl+ cells inhibition of Jak2, a downstream target of Bcr-Abl, by either Jak2 inhibitors or Jak2-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the level of the SET protein, and increased PP2A Ser/Thr phosphatase and Shp1 tyrosine phosphatase activities, which led to decreased levels of activated Lyn. Activation of PP2A combined with Jak2 inhibition enhanced the reduction of activated Lyn kinase compared with Jak2 inhibition alone. In contrast, inhibition of either PP2A or Shp1 combined with Jak2 inhibition interfered with the loss of Lyn kinase activation more so than Jak2 inhibition alone, indicating the involvement of PP2A and Shp1 in the inactivation of the Lyn kinase caused by Jak2 inhibition. Inhibition of Jak2 induced apoptosis and reduced colony formation in IM-sensitive and -resistant Bcr-Abl mutant cell lines. Jak2 inhibition also induced apoptosis in CML cells from blast crisis patients but not in normal hematopoietic cells. These results indicate that Lyn is downstream of Jak2, and Jak2 maintains activated Lyn kinase in CML through the SET-PP2A-Shp1 pathway.","['Samanta, A K', 'Chakraborty, S N', 'Wang, Y', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Sun, X', 'Hood, J', 'Perrotti, D', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Samanta AK', 'Chakraborty SN', 'Wang Y', 'Kantarjian H', 'Sun X', 'Hood J', 'Perrotti D', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090223,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (1,2,3,4,5,6-hexabromocyclohexane)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Cyclohexanes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*physiology', 'Cyclohexanes/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*physiology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",2009/02/24 09:00,2009/04/23 09:00,['2009/02/24 09:00'],"['2009/02/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/23 09:00 [medline]']","['onc20097 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.7 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Apr 9;28(14):1669-81. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.7.

Jak2 dysfunction has been implicated in myeloproliferative diseases and leukemia. Although Jaks were studied extensively for many years, the molecular mechanism of Jak activation upon cytokine stimulation of cells is still incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the importance of an unusual insertion located within the kinase domain in Jak2. We found that the deletion of this insertion, which we named the Jak-specific insertion (JSI), totally abrogates Jak2 autophosphorylation. We further point mutated four residues within the JSI that are conserved in all Jak family members. Three of these mutants showed abrogated or reduced autophosphorylation, whereas the fourth displayed increased autophosphorylation. We found that the phosphorylation state of these mutants is not influenced by other domains of the kinase. Our data further suggest that the JSI is not required for the negative regulation of kinase activity by the suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins, SOCS. Most importantly, we show that mutations in this region differentially affect IFN-gamma and erythropoietin signal transduction. Taken together, the dramatic effects on the phosphorylation status of Jak2 as well as the differential effects on the signaling via different cytokines highlight the importance of this unusual region for the catalytic activity of Jaks.","['Haan, Claude', 'Kroy, Daniela C', 'Wuller, Stefan', 'Sommer, Ulrike', 'Nocker, Tanja', 'Rolvering, Catherine', 'Behrmann, Iris', 'Heinrich, Peter C', 'Haan, Serge']","['Haan C', 'Kroy DC', 'Wuller S', 'Sommer U', 'Nocker T', 'Rolvering C', 'Behrmann I', 'Heinrich PC', 'Haan S']","['Life Sciences Research Unit, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Catalytic Domain/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Point Mutation']",2009/02/24 09:00,2009/04/22 09:00,['2009/02/24 09:00'],"['2009/02/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [medline]']","['182/5/2969 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0800572 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Mar 1;182(5):2969-77. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0800572.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further study the functional role of these two DNA elements, mutant mice with targeted mutations of both SIE and CRE-2 sites (SC mutants) were generated. Homozygous SC mutants manifested a markedly reduced level of Mcl-1 in thymus but not in other major organs such as spleen, liver, lung, or heart. Reduced expression of Mcl-1 in SC mutant thymus resulted in attenuated positive selection of double-positive thymocytes into both CD4 and CD8 lineages, a result likely due to reduced survival of SC mutant double-positive thymocytes that were supposed to be positively selected. In contrast, in the peripheral lymphoid organs, only CD8(+) but not CD4(+) T cells were significantly reduced in homozygous SC mutant mice, a result consistent with a more dramatic decrease both of Mcl-1 expression and cell viability in mutant CD8(+) compared with mutant CD4(+) T cells. Impaired T cell development and peripheral CD8(+) lymphopenia in homozygous SC mutant mice were both cell autonomous and could be rescued by enforced expression of human Mcl-1. Together, the promoter-knock-in mouse model generated in this study not only revealed a role of Mcl-1 in thymocyte-positive selection, but also uncovered that Mcl-1 expression is regulated in a tissue or cell lineage-specific manner.","['Yang, Chia-Yu', 'Lin, Nai-Hui', 'Lee, Jan-Mou', 'Huang, Ching-Yu', 'Min, Hsiang-Ju', 'Yen, Jeffrey Jong-Young', 'Liao, Nan-Shih', 'Yang-Yen, Hsin-Fang']","['Yang CY', 'Lin NH', 'Lee JM', 'Huang CY', 'Min HJ', 'Yen JJ', 'Liao NS', 'Yang-Yen HF']","['Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', '*Gene Knock-In Techniques/methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Organ Specificity/genetics/immunology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*immunology/metabolism']",2009/02/24 09:00,2009/04/22 09:00,['2009/02/24 09:00'],"['2009/02/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [medline]']","['182/5/2959 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0803550 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2009 Mar 1;182(5):2959-68. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0803550.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate molecular mechanism(s) underlying disease evolution, CML-exhibiting p210BCR/ABL transgenic mice were crossed with BXH2 mice that transmit a replication-competent retrovirus. Whereas nontransgenic mice in the BXH2 background exclusively developed acute myeloid leukemia, p210BCR/ABL transgenic littermates developed nonmyeloid leukemias, in which inverse polymerase chain reaction detected 2 common viral integration sites (CISs). Interestingly, one CIS was transgene's own promoter, which up-regulated p210BCR/ABL expression.

The cooperative activities of Zfp423 and p210BCR/ABL were demonstrated as follows: (1) introduction of Zfp423 in p210BCR/ABL transgenic bone marrow (BM) cells increased colony-forming ability, (2) suppression of ZNF423 (human homologue of Zfp423) in ZNF423-expressing, p210BCR/ABL-positive hematopoietic cells retarded cell growth, (3) mice that received a transplant of BM cells transduced with Zfp423 and p210BCR/ABL developed acute leukemia, and (4) expression of ZNF423 was found in human BCR/ABL-positive cell lines and CML BC samples.

Here we studied the novel Cdk inhibitor SNS-032, which exhibits potent and selective inhibitory activity against Cdk2, Cdk7, and Cdk9. We hypothesized that transient inhibition of transcription by SNS-032 would decrease antiapoptotic proteins, resulting in cell death. SNS-032 effectively killed chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro regardless of prognostic indicators and treatment history. This was associated with inhibition of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and inhibition of RNA synthesis. Consistent with the intrinsic turnover rates of their transcripts and proteins, antiapoptotic proteins, such as Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), were rapidly reduced on exposure to SNS-032, whereas Bcl-2 protein was not affected. The initial decrease of Mcl-1 protein was the result of transcriptional inhibition rather than cleavage by caspase. Compared with flavopiridol and roscovitine, SNS-032 was more potent, both in inhibition of RNA synthesis and at induction of apoptosis. SNS-032 activity was readily reversible; removal of SNS-032 reactivated RNA polymerase II, which led to resynthesis of Mcl-1 and cell survival. Thus, these data support the clinical development of SNS-032 in diseases that require short-lived oncoproteins for survival.","['Chen, Rong', 'Wierda, William G', 'Chubb, Sherri', 'Hawtin, Rachael E', 'Fox, Judith A', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Plunkett, William']","['Chen R', 'Wierda WG', 'Chubb S', 'Hawtin RE', 'Fox JA', 'Keating MJ', 'Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

Many mHags derive from single amino acid polymorphisms in MHC-restricted epitopes, but our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing mHag immunogenicity and recognition is incomplete. Here we examined antigenic presentation and T-cell recognition of HA-1, a prototypic autosomal mHag derived from single nucleotide dimorphism (HA-1(H) versus HA-1(R)) in the HMHA1 gene. The HA-1(H) peptide is restricted by HLA-A2 and is immunogenic in HA-1(R/R) into HA-1(H) transplants, while HA-1(R) has been suggested to be a ""null allele"" in terms of T cell reactivity. We found that proteasomal cleavage and TAP transport of the 2 peptides is similar and that both variants can bind to MHC. However, the His>Arg change substantially decreases the stability and affinity of HLA-A2 association, consistent with the reduced immunogenicity of the HA-1(R) variant. To understand these findings, we determined the structure of an HLA-A2-HA-1(H) complex to 1.3A resolution. Whereas His-3 is accommodated comfortably in the D pocket, incorporation of the lengthy Arg-3 is predicted to require local conformational changes. Moreover, a soluble TCR generated from HA-1(H)-specific T-cells bound HA-1(H) peptide with moderate affinity but failed to bind HA-1(R), indicating complete discrimination of HA-1 variants at the level of TCR/MHC interaction. Our results define the molecular mechanisms governing immunogenicity of HA-1, and highlight how single amino acid polymorphisms in mHags can critically affect both MHC association and TCR recognition.","['Nicholls, Sarah', 'Piper, Karen P', 'Mohammed, Fiyaz', 'Dafforn, Timothy R', 'Tenzer, Stefan', 'Salim, Mahboob', 'Mahendra, Premini', 'Craddock, Charles', 'van Endert, Peter', 'Schild, Hansjorg', 'Cobbold, Mark', 'Engelhard, Victor H', 'Moss, Paul A H', 'Willcox, Benjamin E']","['Nicholls S', 'Piper KP', 'Mohammed F', 'Dafforn TR', 'Tenzer S', 'Salim M', 'Mahendra P', 'Craddock C', 'van Endert P', 'Schild H', 'Cobbold M', 'Engelhard VH', 'Moss PA', 'Willcox BE']","['Cancer Research UK Institute for Cancer Studies, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090220,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (TAP1 protein, human)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Arginine/metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Epitopes/chemistry/immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*chemistry/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/*immunology', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tissue Donors']",2009/02/24 09:00,2009/03/27 09:00,['2009/02/24 09:00'],"['2009/02/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [medline]']","['0900411106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0900411106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Mar 10;106(10):3889-94. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0900411106.

We recently described coamplification at lower denaturation temperature-PCR (COLD-PCR), a method that amplifies minority alleles selectively from mixtures of wild-type and mutation-containing sequences during the PCR. We demonstrate that combining COLD-PCR with TaqMan technology provides TaqMan genotyping with the selectivity needed to detect low-level somatic mutations. METHODS: Minor-groove binder-based or common TaqMan probes were designed to contain a nucleotide that matches the desired mutation approximately in the middle of the probe. The critical denaturation temperature (T(c)) of each amplicon was then experimentally determined. COLD-PCR/TaqMan genotyping was performed in 2 steps: denaturation at the T(c), followed by annealing and extension at a single temperature (fast COLD-PCR). The threshold cycle was used to identify mutations on the basis of serial dilutions of mutant DNA into wild-type DNA and to identify TP53 (tumor protein p53) and EGFR [epidermal growth factor receptor (erythroblastic leukemia viral (v-erb-b) oncogene homolog, avian)] mutations in tumors. RESULTS: COLD-PCR/TaqMan genotyping identified G>A mutations within TP53 exon 8 (codon 273 mutation hot spot) and C>T mutations within the EGFR gene (drug-resistance mutation T790M) with a selectivity improvement of 15- to 30-fold over regular PCR/TaqMan genotyping. A second round of COLD-PCR/TaqMan genotyping improved the selectivity by another 15- to 30-fold and enabled detection of 1 mutant in 2000 wild-type alleles. Use of COLD-PCR/TaqMan genotyping allowed quantitative identification of low-level TP53 and T790 mutations in colon tumor samples and in non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines treated with kinase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: The major improvement in selectivity provided by COLD-PCR enables the popular TaqMan genotyping method to become a powerful tool for detecting low-level mutations in clinical samples.","['Li, Jin', 'Wang, Lilin', 'Janne, Pasi A', 'Makrigiorgos, G Mike']","['Li J', 'Wang L', 'Janne PA', 'Makrigiorgos GM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Divisions of Genomic Stability and DNA Repair, and Medical Physics, Lowe Center for Thoracic Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090220,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Probes/*analysis/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",2009/02/24 09:00,2009/04/14 09:00,['2009/02/24 09:00'],"['2009/02/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2008.113381 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2008.113381 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2009 Apr;55(4):748-56. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2008.113381.

Polybia-MPI was a short cationic alpha-helical amphiphilic peptide that has selective toxicity toward cancer cells but no hemolytic activity. Its target selectivity is based on the binding preference to membranes containing anionic phospholipids by electrostatic driving. Its ability to make PI and trypan blue permeate into tumor cells at the same rate (within minutes), suggests a killing mechanism that involves plasma membrane perturbation. SEM and confocal microscopy experiments verified that the cell died as a result of acute injury and bursting, suggesting necrosis. As compared to the conventional chemotherapy, polybia-MPI targets at the cell membrane rather than enters into the cell to exert its action. So it is difficult for tumor cells to develop resistance to polybia-MPI during treatment and its action is not affected by the common multi-drug resistant mechanism. Although this is an initial study that looked at its in vitro activity rather than the in vivo activity, with the increasing resistance of conventional chemotherapy, polybia-MPI may offer a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of multi-drug resistant cancer.","['Wang, Kai-rong', 'Yan, Jie-xi', 'Zhang, Bang-zhi', 'Song, Jing-jing', 'Jia, Peng-fei', 'Wang, Rui']","['Wang KR', 'Yan JX', 'Zhang BZ', 'Song JJ', 'Jia PF', 'Wang R']","['State Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology, Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China. wangkr04@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090223,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Insect Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Insect Proteins/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Necrosis', 'Peptides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Wasps']",2009/02/24 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2009/02/24 09:00'],"['2008/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(08)00979-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2008.12.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2009 Jun 8;278(1):65-72. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2008.12.027.

It has been demonstrated that B7-H1, a newly identified homologue of CD80/CD86, is abundant in human carcinomas and dendritic cells (DC), can exert co-stimulatory and immune regulatory functions. We demonstrated that B7-H1 was significantly expressed on AML cells and was strongly enhanced after differentiation to DLLC. Blockade of B7-H1 expressed on DLLC results in increased T cell proliferation and Th1 cytokine production, and decreased Th2 cytokine production. Importantly, autologous CTLs induced by DLLC treated with B7-H1 mAb showed significantly increased specific cytotoxcity against AML blasts. We further demonstrated that a significant decrease in IL-12 production, increase in IL-10 production by DLLC, and an increased CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T regulatory population lead to the defective T cell immune response that is induced by B7-H1 up-regulation on DLLC.

The linear cDNA product of reverse transcription is the integration substrate and two different integrase activities, 3' processing and DNA strand transfer, are required for provirus formation. Integrase nicks the cDNA ends adjacent to phylogenetically-conserved CA dinucleotides during 3' processing. After nuclear entry and locating a suitable chromatin acceptor site, integrase joins the recessed 3'-OHs to the 5'-phosphates of a double-stranded staggered cut in the DNA target. Integrase functions in the context of a large nucleoprotein complex, called the preintegration complex (PIC), and PICs are analyzed to determine levels of integrase 3' processing and DNA strand transfer activities that occur during acute virus infection.

The Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) is also pertinent to the development of a new immuno-suppressant. This study aimed to inhibit JAK3 expression using RNAi to determine allograft tolerance. To silence JAK3 expression, one dsRNA was tested to incorporate the JAK3 mRNA sequence. The expression vector containing the pre-mRNA expression cassette was transfected into rat basophilic leukemia cell line, RBL-2H3, for RNAi analysis (in vitro). The alloskin and composite tissue allograft were then transplanted to recipients using RNAi protocol to determine the allograft tolerance (in vivo). The results showed effective in vitro and in vivo downregulation of JAK3 expression by RNAi. Moreover, the histology of alloskin graft and composite tissue allograft (in vivo) under the siRNA showed more prominently diminished inflammatory infiltration than the control group. This is the first time in the literature that the suppressive effect of JAK3 silenced by siRNA has been tested both in vitro and in vivo, and shows that siRNA is capable of specific and functional silencing in allograft rejection.","['Chang, Kao-Ping', 'Lai, Ching-Hung', 'Huang, Shu-Hung', 'Tai, Hsiao-Ting', 'Chang, Lin-Li', 'Lin, Sin-Daw', 'Hwang, Shiuh-Lin', 'Lai, Chung-Sheng']","['Chang KP', 'Lai CH', 'Huang SH', 'Tai HT', 'Chang LL', 'Lin SD', 'Hwang SL', 'Lai CS']","['Faculty of Medicine, Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090220,Netherlands,Transpl Immunol,Transplant immunology,9309923,"['0 (Jak3 protein, rat)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Graft Rejection/genetics/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Janus Kinase 3/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Skin Transplantation/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation Tolerance/*genetics/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/02/24 09:00,2009/10/02 06:00,['2009/02/24 09:00'],"['2008/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0966-3274(09)00017-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.trim.2009.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Transpl Immunol. 2009 May;21(1):27-32. doi: 10.1016/j.trim.2009.02.004.

Recent discussions of this problem were illustrated with scenarios and computer simulations. In this short communication, we reanalyzed a published phase II trial to highlight the need to consider between-patient heterogeneity and the possibility of treatment-subgroup interaction when designing and analyzing phase II studies. The single-arm trial evaluated amsacrine plus cytosine arabinoside, vincristine, and prednisone (a combination abbreviated as OAP) for adult acute leukemia, when standard treatment was adriamycin plus OAP. We carried out an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) incorporating data from historical control patients who met eligibility criteria for the trial and received standard treatment at the study center in the years immediately preceding the trial. Patients administered experimental treatment and control patients were classified as having favorable or unfavorable prognosis according to their predicted probability of response to standard treatment. When the prognostic subgroup of patients was ignored, the response rates for experimental and standard treatment appeared similar. However, fitting an ANCOVA model determined that the effects of subgroup, treatment, and their interaction were statistically significant: experimental treatment was superior to standard treatment in patients with unfavorable prognosis and inferior to standard treatment in patients with favorable prognosis.

It has been proved that the LTRs of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) could constitutively activate genes in diverse cell types. Recently, a retrovirus-like element, OSP-1 (ovarian-specific promoter 1), was extracted from rat ovary according to the LTRs of MoMLV, whose name was derived from the fact of ovarian-specific transcription. It was reasonable to speculate that the tissue-specificity was acquired through mutations and that there should be abound other mutants, active or inactive. In the present study, we isolated several homologous sequences to OSP-1 and detected their function. Consequently, one of them could also drive target gene expression specifically to ovarian cell lines and was named OSP-2 which shared 98% similarity to OSP-1. On the other hand, we picked up other two closest sequences and proved them inactive, which was 97% and 95% similar to OSP-1, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed the different mutations around/within the binding sites of transcriptional factors that might play important roles in tissue-specificity. In summary, we extracted a novel ovarian-specific promoter as well as other nonfunctional mutants, which in part shed light on the study of ovarian-specific transcription. In addition, it also provided a new tool in cancer gene therapy and to create transgenic animals.","['Tu, Chun-Hua', 'Liu, Wei-Peng', 'Huang, Li-Li', 'Mo, Ya-Qin', 'Yang, Dong-Zi']","['Tu CH', 'Liu WP', 'Huang LL', 'Mo YQ', 'Yang DZ']","['Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, No. 107 Yanjiang Road, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090220,United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,['0 (Retroelements)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/therapy', 'Ovary/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2009/02/24 09:00,2009/05/16 09:00,['2009/02/24 09:00'],"['2008/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2009/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [medline]']","['S0003-9861(09)00042-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.abb.2009.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2009 May 1;485(1):24-9. doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2009.02.004.

However, factors influencing their expression remain under consideration. In our study, modulation of type III sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporters expression by inorganic phosphate (Pi) was investigated in the murine odontoblast-like cell line MO6-G3. Experiments were designed to determine the effects of phosphate release on dental cells during tooth decay. By real-time RT-PCR we demonstrated that Glvr-1 and -2 expressions are up-regulated by Pi. The increase in Glvr-1 and -2 expressions was correlated with ERK1/2 phosphorylation and calcium/phosphate crystals formation in cultured wells. Using calcium-free culture conditions or the specific inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation (UO126), we demonstrated that Pi effects on Glvr-1 and -2 up-regulation require the presence of calcium and involve ERK signalling pathways. This study contributes to give new insights in the control of Pi transport during carious diseases.","['Wittrant, Y', 'Bourgine, A', 'Khoshniat, S', 'Alliot-Licht, B', 'Masson, M', 'Gatius, M', 'Rouillon, T', 'Weiss, P', 'Beck, L', 'Guicheux, J']","['Wittrant Y', 'Bourgine A', 'Khoshniat S', 'Alliot-Licht B', 'Masson M', 'Gatius M', 'Rouillon T', 'Weiss P', 'Beck L', 'Guicheux J']","['INSERM Unite 791, Universite de Nantes, Faculte de Chirurgie Dentaire, Nantes, France. yohann.wittrant@univ-nantes.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090214,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Dental Caries/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Odontoblasts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphates/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Virus/*biosynthesis', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III/*biosynthesis']",2009/02/24 09:00,2009/04/21 09:00,['2009/02/24 09:00'],"['2009/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)00288-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.02.034 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Apr 3;381(2):259-63. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.02.034.

Monoclonal antibody panels are often useful, with CD23 being the most reliable. However, MCL diagnosis should be confirmed by immunohistochemical cyclin D1 detection, sometimes with equivocal or even negative results. Other cytofluorimetric, cytogenetics or molecular techniques are reliable but not widely available. B-CLL leukemic cells express CD200, a membrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. We investigated its expression on fresh neoplastic cells of 93 patients with a CD5+ lymphoproliferative disease (79 selected B-CLL and 14 MCL in leukemic phase). Although these data cannot be generalized, all B-CLL samples we examined were positive, with CD200 present on the vast majority of the cells while, in MCL patients, CD200 was expressed by a small minority of CD5+ cells in three subjects and totally absent in the remaining 11. We then examined CD200 expression on paraffin-embedded lymphoid tissues and bone marrow (BM) trephine biopsies from 23 B-CLL and 44 MCL patients. Again, all B-CLL cells were CD200+ both in lymph nodes and in BM while all MCL cells were negative.

Here we investigated the molecules affecting the survival of human naive and memory B cells. Without stimulation, naive B cells survived longer than memory B cells. Moreover, the viability of memory B cells decreased more rapidly than that of naive B cells following with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain (SAC), anti-immunoglobulin (Ig), or anti-CD40 stimulation, but displayed the same levels of survival following CpG DNA stimulation. We analyzed the transcriptional differences between B-cell subsets by gene expression profiling, and identified 15 genes significantly correlated to survival/proliferation. Among them, IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) and T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL1) proto-oncogene were highly expressed in naive B cells. IL-21 induced the proliferation of both naive and memory B cells. Marked phosphorylation of Akt was found in naive B cells compared with memory B cells.

Aurora A, a mitotic checkpoint protein, is overexpressed in human cancer cells. The cell cycle-dependent turnover of Aurora A is regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligases such as checkpoint with fork head-associated and ring finger (CHFR). Here, we found overexpression of Aurora A protein in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells. The expression of CHFR mRNA was reduced in these cells by abnormal methylation of CHFR promoter region. Knockdown of Aurora A using small interfering RNA suppressed the growth of HTLV-1-infected T-cell line. Transfection of Aurora A expression plasmid enhanced Tax-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) reporter activity. Transfection of CHFR expression plasmid into an HTLV-1-infected T-cell line reduced cell growth, Aurora A protein level and constitutive NF-kappaB reporter activity. Aurora kinase inhibitor suppressed the growth and survival of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells. It also reduced constitutive NF-kappaB activity in an HTLV-1-infected T-cell line by reducing IkappaB kinase beta phosphorylation and the expression of antiapoptotic protein survivin. Our results suggested that loss of CHFR expression resulted to accumulation of Aurora A, which increased NF-kappaB activity. These findings highlight the critical role of Aurora A in HTLV-1-infected T cells, making this molecule a potentially suitable target for future therapies for ATL.","['Tomita, Mariko', 'Toyota, Minoru', 'Ishikawa, Chie', 'Nakazato, Tetsuro', 'Okudaira, Taeko', 'Matsuda, Takehiro', 'Uchihara, Jun-Nosuke', 'Taira, Naoya', 'Ohshiro, Kazuiku', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Saya, Hideyuki', 'Tokino, Takashi', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Tomita M', 'Toyota M', 'Ishikawa C', 'Nakazato T', 'Okudaira T', 'Matsuda T', 'Uchihara JN', 'Taira N', 'Ohshiro K', 'Senba M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Ohshima K', 'Saya H', 'Tokino T', 'Mori N']","['Division of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (CHFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Methylation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology/*virology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.24257 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Jun 1;124(11):2607-15. doi: 10.1002/ijc.24257.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Int J Cancer. 2011 Dec 1;129(11):2762-3.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of infants with recurrent or refractory ALL from two previous consecutive Japanese studies to clarify the characteristics and prognostic factors among these patients PROCEDURE: All recurrent or refractory ALL infants with MLL gene rearrangement (MLL-R) who were registered in two consecutive Japanese nation-wide multicentric trials (MLL96 and MLL98; between 1995 and 2001) were eligible for the study. RESULTS: Among 80 MLL-R ALL infants, 34 cases of recurrence and 5 induction failures occurred. The median duration of first remission was 5 months (range, 0-28 months). All patients underwent various salvage chemotherapies; remission was achieved in 40.5% (15/37). A total of 23 patients received subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT): 9 in remission, 12 without remission, and 2 with unknown status. With median follow-up period of 5.5 years, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate after the second-line treatment was 25.6% +/- 6.9%. Young age (<3 months) and central nervous system involvement at initial diagnosis were associated with poor outcome; however, failure to achieve remission after salvage therapy was the sole independent poor prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of infants with recurrent or refractory MLL-R ALL is extremely poor despite alternative treatments including HSCT; therefore, it is necessary to develop novel treatment strategies.","['Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Hirayama, Masahiro', 'Miyamura, Takako', 'Hatanaka, Michiki', 'Saikawa, Yutaka', 'Ishii, Eiichi']","['Tomizawa D', 'Koh K', 'Hirayama M', 'Miyamura T', 'Hatanaka M', 'Saikawa Y', 'Ishii E']","['Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan. dtomizawa.ped@tmd.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21975 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jul;52(7):808-13. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21975.,,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We used allelic discrimination method to genotype 19 polymorphisms in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), transforming growth factor-beta receptor 1 (TGF-betaR1) and transforming growth factor-beta receptor 2 (TGF-betaR2) genes in 460 cases of childhood acute ALL and 552 ethnically matched controls. The genotyped polymorphisms included functional and tagging variants to cover the three genes in entirety. We used multidimensionality reduction (MDR) method to test effect of multiple genes on disease susceptibility. In order to increase statistical power and detect susceptibility variants not directly genotyped in this study, we used imputation using HapMap data. RESULTS: None of the genotyped polymorphisms or the consequent haplotypes showed any association with risk modulation. The results, however, did show a marginal association (odds ratio OR 0.76, 95% confidence interval CI 0.59-0.97) of the variant allele for the rs10417924 polymorphism located at 3'untranslated region of the TGF-beta1 gene with the B-cell lineage ALL. No other polymorphism showed any association with childhood ALL susceptibility. A signal of marginal significance for the rs10417924 polymorphism in the TGF-beta1 gene in B-cell lineage ALL showed up with both MDR and imputation techniques. CONCLUSION: These data rule out the role of polymorphisms in the TGF-beta1, TGF-betaR1 and TGF-betaR2 genes in susceptibility to childhood ALL. However, for B-lineage ALL, the role of the rs10417924 polymorphism in TGF-beta1 gene needs further investigation.","['Dai, Liping', 'Gast, Andreas', 'Horska, Alexandra', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Bartram, Claus R', 'Hemminki, Kari', 'Kumar, Rajiv', 'Bermejo, Justo Lorenzo']","['Dai L', 'Gast A', 'Horska A', 'Schrappe M', 'Bartram CR', 'Hemminki K', 'Kumar R', 'Bermejo JL']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II)']",IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/*genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*genetics']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21971 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jul;52(7):819-23. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21971.,,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of Nanog maintains mouse ES cells pluripotency independent of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). However, little is known about the effect of PI3K signaling pathway on ES cells with Nanog overexpression. Our experiments aimed to explore the relationship between PI3K signaling pathway and Nanog expression in ES cells. We observed the effect of LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K pathway, on wild-type J1 cells and Nanog overexpressing (Ex-Nanog) J1 cells in the presence or absence of LIF. With LY294002 treatment, both of them lost their ES features even in the presence of LIF. But the differentiation induced by LY294002 on Ex-Nanog J1 cells was slighter lower than that on wild-type J1 cells. These results indicate that inhibition of PI3K pathway induces mouse ES cells differentiation. Exogenous Nanog sustains mouse ES cells pluripotency independent of LIF, and alleviates the differentiation induced by LY294002.

Basically as a modulator of chromatin structure, it can involve in various DNA and RNA-dependent processes and function as either an activator or repressor. Despite of numerous efforts to suggest the biological role of DEK, direct target proteins of DEK in different physiological status remains elusive. To investigate if DEK protein triggers the changes in certain protein networks, DEK was knocked down at both types of cell clones using siRNA expression. Here we provide a catalogue of proteome profiles in total cell lysates derived from normal HeLa and DEK knock-down HeLa cells and a good in vitro model system for dissecting the protein networks due to this proto-oncogenic DEK protein. In this biological context, we compared total proteome changes by the combined methods of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, quantitative image analysis and MALDI-TOF MS analysis. There were a large number of targets for DEK, which were differentially expressed in DEK knock-down cells and consisted of 58 proteins (41 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated) differentially regulated expression was further confirmed for some subsets of candidates by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. In the identified 58 spots, 16% of proteins are known to be associated with apoptosis. Among others, we identified apoptosis related proteins such as Annexins, Enolase1, Lamin A, and Glutathione-S-transferase omega 1. These results are consistent with recent studies indicating the crucial role of DEK in apoptosis pathway. We further demonstrated by ChIP analysis that knock-down of DEK caused hyperacetylation of histones around Prx VI promoter which is upregulated in our profile. Using immunoblotting analysis, we have demonstrated the modulation of other caspase-dependent apoptosis related proteins by DEK knock-down and further implicate its role in apoptosis pathway.","['Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Chae, Jung-Il', 'Kim, Ji-Young', 'Pak, Jhang Ho', 'Koo, Deog-Bon', 'Bahk, Young Yil', 'Seo, Sang-Beom']","['Kim DW', 'Chae JI', 'Kim JY', 'Pak JH', 'Koo DB', 'Bahk YY', 'Seo SB']","['Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX6 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxin VI)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peroxiredoxin VI/genetics/metabolism', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22083 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2009 Apr 15;106(6):1048-59. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22083.,,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

To explore the molecules that interact with VDR and facilitate its nuclear localization, we screened a human kidney cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid approach, and found that VDR binds to the carboxy-terminal region of an oncogenic nucleoporin, CAN/Nup214. CAN/Nup214 was originally identified through its involvement in a certain type of acute myeloid leukemia, and is a component of nuclear pore complex (NPC). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction between VDR and the carboxy-terminus of CAN/Nup214 containing a cluster of the phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat in mammalian cells. The exogenously expressed full-length CAN/Nup214 was localized predominantly at the nuclear envelope, suggesting its integration in the NPCs. We then examined the effects of exogenous expression of full-length CAN/Nup214 and its carboxy-terminal fragment on the VDR-mediated transactivation. The overexpression of full-length CAN/Nup214 facilitated the VDR-mediated transactivation, while the expression of the carboxy-terminal fragment suppressed it. The DNA-binding domain of VDR was required for the facilitation of the VDR-dependent transactivation by CAN/Nup214. Although the subcellular distribution of VDR was not obviously altered by the overexpression of full-length CAN/Nup214 or the carboxy-terminal fragment, the expression of the carboxy-terminal fragment inhibited the interaction between full-length CAN/Nup214 and VDR. These results indicate that CAN/Nup214 interacts with VDR and modulates its function as a transcription factor.","['Miyauchi, Yoshiteru', 'Sakaguchi, Naoko', 'Okada, Tomoko', 'Makishima, Makoto', 'Ozono, Keiichi', 'Michigami, Toshimi']","['Miyauchi Y', 'Sakaguchi N', 'Okada T', 'Makishima M', 'Ozono K', 'Michigami T']","['Department of Bone and Mineral Research, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Izumi, Osaka 594-1101, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22101 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2009 Apr 15;106(6):1090-101. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22101.,,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral leukocytosis of 160 x 10(9)/L, splenomegaly and fatigue suggested CML. In peripheral blood and bone marrow smears, white blood cells in all maturation stages and only few blasts were seen and therefore the diagnosis of chronic phase CML was proposed. Cytogenetics performed on peripheral blood cells revealed the characteristic t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation as solitary abnormality. Analyzing the bone marrow biopsy a focal nodular B-lymphoid blast component was additionally seen. BCR-ABL FISH analysis demonstrated 31% atypical split signals in the B-lymphoid blasts and in the maturing myeloid cells, furthermore, BCR-ABL fusion transcripts were seen in the RT-PCR assay. Imatinib-based therapy led to temporary regression of peripheral leukocytosis. Bone marrow examination 3 weeks after therapy induction demonstrated considerably reduced cellularity and the proportion of B-lymphoid blasts had decreased to 20% of the nuclear cells. BCR-ABL FISH analysis still presented 21% atypical split signals but levels of BCR-ABL transcripts had significantly fallen indicating a rather favourable prognosis. However, 3 months after diagnosis the patient relapsed and developed an immunodeficiency with soor esophagitis and aspergillus pneumonia. A therapy with dasatinib was not successful and the patient died in consequence of immunodeficiency. This report demonstrates the high diagnostic value of bone marrow biopsy in the evaluation of CML. Besides morphology investigation of diverse methods including RT-PCR and FISH performed on diagnostic bone marrow biopsies are obligatory for ideal monitoring of drug response.","['Markert, Eva', 'Siebolts, Udo', 'Odenthal, Margarete', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton', 'Wickenhauser, Claudia']","['Markert E', 'Siebolts U', 'Odenthal M', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Wickenhauser C']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital of Cologne, 50924, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Leipzig, Liebigstrasse 26, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine, University of Cologne (CMMC), 50924, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital of Cologne, 50924, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, 50924, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital of Cologne, 50924, Cologne, Germany. claudia.wickenhauser@uniklinik-leipzig.de.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Leipzig, Liebigstrasse 26, 04103, Leipzig, Germany. claudia.wickenhauser@uniklinik-leipzig.de.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090220,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*metabolism/surgery']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/06/27 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2008/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/27 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0257-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0257-x [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Apr;89(3):294-297. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0257-x.

This cell death was significantly restricted by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), and a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, 5-aminoisoquinoline (AIQ). Indeed, NO production and PARP overactivation were detected in the cells treated with AA. On the one hand, L-NMMA partly eliminated NO production and on the other, AIQ and L-NMMA also restricted PARP activation. Excessive signals related to PARP overactivation induce the translocation of an apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria to the nuclei, resulting in DNA fragmentation. In AA-treated cells, the nuclear translocation of AIF occurred. This translocation was restricted by pretreatment with AIQ and L-NMMA. Although pretreatment with ascorbic acid eliminated the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation induced by the blockade of complex III by AA, the pretreatment did not protect the cells from AA-induced cell death. Furthermore, cytochrome c release or caspase-3 activation was not observed in the cells treated with AA.

The B-Cell Leukemia/lymphoma 3 (BCL3) gene has been suggested as a candidate gene for CL/P based on association and linkage studies in some populations. This study tests for an association between markers in BCL3 and isolated, non-syndromic CL/P using a case-parent trio design, while considering parent-of-origin effects. METHODS: Forty case-parent trios were genotyped for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BCL3 gene. We performed a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) on individual SNPs, and the FAMHAP package was used to estimate haplotype frequencies and to test for excess transmission of multi-SNP haplotypes. RESULTS: The odds ratio for transmission of the minor allele, OR (transmission), was significant for SNP rs8100239 (OR=3.50, p=0.004) and rs2965169 (OR=2.08, p=0.027) when parent-of-origin was not considered. Parent-specific TDT revealed that SNP rs8100239 showed excess maternal transmission. Analysis of haplotypes of rs2965169 and rs8100239 also suggested excess maternal transmission. CONCLUSIONS: BCL3 appears to influence risk of CL/P through a parent-of-origin effect with excess maternal transmission.","['Park, Beyoung Yun', 'Sull, Jae Woong', 'Park, Jung Yong', 'Jee, Sun Ha', 'Beaty, Terri H']","['Park BY', 'Sull JW', 'Park JY', 'Jee SH', 'Beaty TH']","['Yonsei University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Korea (South),J Prev Med Public Health,Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,101242972,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/genetics', 'Cleft Lip/*genetics', 'Cleft Palate/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Korea', 'Male', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/04/04 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [medline]']","['200901001 [pii]', '10.3961/jpmph.2009.42.1.1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Prev Med Public Health. 2009 Jan;42(1):1-4. doi: 10.3961/jpmph.2009.42.1.1.,,,,"['R01 DE014581/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE014581-05/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2882880,,['NIHMS206020'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These primitive neural stem cells have the ability to differentiate to non-neural tissues and transition into FGF2-dependent, definitive neural stem cells between embryonic day 7.5 and 8.5 in vivo, accompanied by a decrease in non-neural competency. We found that Oct4 is expressed in LIF-dependent primitive neural stem cells and suppressed in FGF-dependent definitive neural stem cells. In mice lacking germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF), a transcriptional repressor of Oct4, generation of definitive neural stem cells was dramatically suppressed, accompanied by a sustained expression of Oct4 in the early neuroectoderm. Knockdown of Oct4 in GCNF(-/-) neural stem cells rescued the GCNF(-/-) phenotype. Overexpression of Oct4 blocked the differentiation of primitive to definitive neural stem cells, but did not induce the dedifferentiation of definitive to primitive neural stem cells. These results suggested that primitive neural stem cells develop into definitive neural stem cells by means of GCNF induced suppression of Oct4. The Oct4 promoter was methylated during the development from primitive neural stem cell to definitive neural stem cell, while these neural stem cells lose their pluripotency through a GCNF dependent mechanism. Thus, the suppression of Oct4 by GCNF is important for the transition from primitive to definitive neural stem cells and restriction of the non-neural competency in the early neural stem cell lineage.","['Akamatsu, Wado', 'DeVeale, Brian', 'Okano, Hideyuki', 'Cooney, Austin J', 'van der Kooy, Derek']","['Akamatsu W', 'DeVeale B', 'Okano H', 'Cooney AJ', 'van der Kooy D']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S3E1. wado@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nr6a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 6, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Ectoderm/cytology/embryology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nervous System/cytology/*embryology', 'Neural Tube/cytology/embryology', 'Neurogenesis/*genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 6, Group A, Member 1', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/04/17 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [medline]']","['29/7/2113 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4527-08.2009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2009 Feb 18;29(7):2113-24. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4527-08.2009.,,,,,PMC6666351,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides its endocrine role, the Men1 gene product menin interacts with the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) protein, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase. Although menin and MLL fusion proteins cooperate to activate Homeobox (Hox) gene expression during transformation, little is known about the normal hematopoietic functions of menin. Here, we studied hematopoiesis after Men1 ablation. Menin loss modestly impaired blood neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts. Without hematopoietic stress, multilineage and myelo-erythroid bone marrow progenitor numbers were preserved, while B lymphoid progenitors were decreased. In contrast, competitive transplantation revealed a marked functional defect of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the absence of menin, despite normal initial homing of progenitors to the bone marrow. HoxA9 gene expression was only modestly decreased in menin-deficient HSCs. These observations reveal a novel and essential role for menin in HSC homeostasis that was most apparent during situations of hematopoietic recovery, suggesting that menin regulates molecular pathways that are essential during the adaptive HSC response to stress.","['Maillard, Ivan', 'Chen, Ya-Xiong', 'Friedman, Ann', 'Yang, Yuqing', 'Tubbs, Anthony T', 'Shestova, Olga', 'Pear, Warren S', 'Hua, Xianxin']","['Maillard I', 'Chen YX', 'Friedman A', 'Yang Y', 'Tubbs AT', 'Shestova O', 'Pear WS', 'Hua X']","['Center for Stem Cell Biology, Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA. imaillar@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Men1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1/genetics/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Platelet Count', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/metabolism']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/04/02 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37668-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-01-135012 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Feb 19;113(8):1661-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-01-135012.,,,,"['R01CA113962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113962-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA100912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2647667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been postulated that loss of NF1 expression resulting from loss of transcriptional activation by ICSBP contributes to human hematologic malignancies. To investigate the functional cooperation of these 2 proteins, we have established Icsbp-deficient mice with Nf1 haploinsufficiency. We here demonstrate that loss of Icsbp and Nf1 haploinsufficiency synergize to induce a forced myeloproliferation in Icsbp-deficient mice because of an expansion of a mature myeloid progenitor cell. Furthermore, Nf1 haploinsufficiency and loss of Icsbp contribute synergistically to progression of the myeloproliferative disorder toward transplantable leukemias. Leukemias are characterized by distinct phenotypes, which correlate with progressive genetic abnormalities. Loss of Nf1 heterozygosity is not mandatory for disease progression, but its occurrence with other genetic abnormalities indicates progressive genetic alterations in a defined subset of leukemias. These data show that loss of the 2 tumor suppressor genes Nf1 and Icsbp synergize in the induction of leukemias.","['Koenigsmann, Jessica', 'Rudolph, Cornelia', 'Sander, Sandrine', 'Kershaw, Olivia', 'Gruber, Achim D', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Carstanjen, Dirk']","['Koenigsmann J', 'Rudolph C', 'Sander S', 'Kershaw O', 'Gruber AD', 'Bullinger L', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Carstanjen D']","['Leibniz-Institut fuer Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090219,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*physiology', 'Leukemia/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myelopoiesis', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Neurofibromin 1/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39196-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-158485 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 May 7;113(19):4690-701. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-05-158485.

Relative to the process that initiates and promotes cGVHD, the regulation is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the role of naturally occurring regulatory dendritic cells (DC(regs)) in murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-compatible and multiple minor histocompatibility antigen (miHAg)-incompatible model of cGVHD in alloHSCT. DC(regs) generated from bone marrow in vitro (BM-DC(regs)) exclusively expressed CD200 receptor 3 (CD200R3), which exerted a suppressive function in the Ag-specific CD4(+) T-cell response. CD49(+)CD200R3(+) cells showed similarities in phenotype and function to BM-DC(regs), which formally distinguishes them from other leukocytes, suggesting that they are the natural counterpart of BM-DC(regs). Treatment of the recipient mice after alloHSCT with the recipient-type CD49(+)CD200R3(+) cells as well as BM-DC(regs) protected against cGVHD, and the protection was associated with the generation of Ag-specific anergic CD4(+) T cells as well as CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (T(regs)) from donor-derived alloreactive CD4(+)CD25(-)Foxp3(-) T cells. In addition, the depletion of CD49(+)CD200R3(+) cells before alloHSCT enhanced the progression of cGVHD.

There is growing evidence suggesting that chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules are critical for malignant B-cell trafficking and homing to supportive tissue microenvironments, where they receive survival and drug resistance signals. Therefore, we examined chemokine receptor and adhesion molecule expression and function in MCL cells and their importance for migration and adhesion to marrow stromal cells (MSCs). We found that MCL cells display high levels of functional CXCR4 and CXCR5 chemokine receptors and VLA-4 adhesion molecules. We also report that MCL cells adhere and spontaneously migrate beneath MSCs in a CXCR4- and VLA-4-dependent fashion (pseudoemperipolesis). Moreover, we demonstrate that MSCs confer drug resistance to MCL cells, particularly to MCL cells that migrate beneath MSC. To target MCL-MSC interactions, we tested Plerixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist, and natalizumab, a VLA-4 antibody. Both agents blocked functional responses to the respective ligands and inhibited adhesive interactions between MCL cells and MSCs. These findings provide a rationale to further investigate the therapeutic potential of these drugs in MCL.","['Kurtova, Antonina V', 'Tamayo, Archito T', 'Ford, Richard J', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Kurtova AV', 'Tamayo AT', 'Ford RJ', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230-1402, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090219,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR5 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Natalizumab)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR5)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Anti-HIV Agents/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Benzylamines', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Migration Inhibition', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemotaxis', 'Cyclams', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Natalizumab', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR5/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39187-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-10-185827 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 May 7;113(19):4604-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-10-185827.

The pharmacodynamic effects of seliciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, were studied in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with treatment-naive locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma received seliciclib at 800 mg or 400 mg twice daily on days 1 to 3 and 8 to 12. Paired tumor samples obtained at baseline and on day 13 were assessed by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and transcriptional profiling using real-time PCR low-density array consisting of a panel of 380 genes related to cell cycle inhibition, apoptosis, signal transduction, and cell proliferation. RESULTS: At 800 mg bd, one patient experienced grade 3 liver toxicity and another had grade 2 vomiting; no significant toxicities were experienced in 13 patients treated at 400 mg bd. Seven of fourteen evaluable patients had clinical evidence of tumor reduction. Some of these responses were associated with increased tumor apoptosis, necrosis, and decreases in plasma EBV DNA posttreatment. Reduced protein expression of Mcl-1, cyclin D1, phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein pRB (T821), and significant transcriptional down-regulation of genes related to cellular proliferation and survival were shown in some patients posttreatment, indicative of cell cycle modulation by seliciclib, more specifically inhibition of cdk2/cyclin E, cdk7/cyclin H, and cdk9/cyclin T. CONCLUSIONS: Brief treatment with this regimen of seliciclib in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma is tolerable at 400 mg bd and associated with tumor pharmacodynamic changes consistent with cdk inhibition, and warrants further efficacy studies in this tumor.","['Hsieh, Wen-Son', 'Soo, Ross', 'Peh, Bee-Keow', 'Loh, Thomas', 'Dong, Difeng', 'Soh, Donny', 'Wong, Lim-Soon', 'Green, Simon', 'Chiao, Judy', 'Cui, Chun-Ying', 'Lai, Yoke-Fong', 'Lee, Soo-Chin', 'Mow, Benjamin', 'Soong, Richie', 'Salto-Tellez, Manuel', 'Goh, Boon-Cher']","['Hsieh WS', 'Soo R', 'Peh BK', 'Loh T', 'Dong D', 'Soh D', 'Wong LS', 'Green S', 'Chiao J', 'Cui CY', 'Lai YF', 'Lee SC', 'Mow B', 'Soong R', 'Salto-Tellez M', 'Goh BC']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Hospital, Oncology Research Institute, School of Computing, and Department of Head and Neck Surgery, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology/virology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Purines/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Roscovitine']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['15/4/1435 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1748 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Feb 15;15(4):1435-42. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1748.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), an active ingredient in the spice turmeric, inhibits tumor metastasis, invasion, and angiogenesis in tumor cell lines. We evaluated the effects of curcumin on the viability of primary CLL B cells and its ability to overcome stromal mediated protection. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The in vitro effect of curcumin on primary CLL B cells was evaluated using fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis and Western blotting. For some experiments, CLL B cells were cocultured with human stromal cells to evaluate the effects of curcumin on leukemia cells cultured in their microenvironment. Finally, the effect of curcumin in combination with the green tea extract epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG) was evaluated. RESULTS: Curcumin induced apoptosis in CLL B cells in a dose-dependent (5-20 micromol/L) manner and inhibited constitutively active prosurvival pathways, including signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), AKT, and nuclear factor kappaB. Moreover, curcumin suppressed expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and up-regulated the pro-apoptotic protein BIM. Coculture of CLL B cells with stromal cells resulted in elevated levels of STAT3, increased expression of Mcl-1 and XIAP, and decreased sensitivity to curcumin. When curcumin was administered simultaneously with EGCG, antagonism was observed for most patient samples. In contrast, sequential administration of these agents led to substantial increases in CLL B-cell death and could overcome stromal protection. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin treatment was able to overcome stromal protection of CLL B cells on in vitro testing and to synergize with EGCG when administered in a sequential fashion. Additional evaluation of curcumin as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of CLL seems warranted.","['Ghosh, Asish K', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Secreto, Charla R', 'Shanafelt, Tait D']","['Ghosh AK', 'Kay NE', 'Secreto CR', 'Shanafelt TD']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Catechin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcumin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/analysis']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['15/4/1250 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1511 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Feb 15;15(4):1250-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1511.,['Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Feb 15;15(4):1123-5.

This is the largest national occupational radiation exposure database, comprising records for about 600,000 nuclear, industrial, medical and dental workers. An analysis of the NDR data based on a cohort of about 200,000 workers first exposed before 1984 and followed through 1987 and 1988 for mortality and cancer incidence, respectively, revealed that the mortality from most causes of death considered was lower than that in the general population, which is typical of occupational cohorts. Although the same was also observed for cancer incidence, there was a significant increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer and melanoma which, however, was not clearly related to radiation exposure. A significant dose-response was found for mortality from all causes, all cancers, lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, accidents, for incidence of all cancers, cancers of the rectum and lung, leukaemia, all cancers except lung, and all cancers except leukaemia. In addition, in male workers, a significant dose-response was found for the incidence of colon, pancreatic, and testicular cancers. The estimates of cancer risks (mortality and incidence) were higher than those in most other occupational cohorts and in the studies on atomic bomb survivors. The biologically based dose-response models used to describe lung cancer incidence in the NDR showed that for a protracted exposure to low radiation doses there was a significant radiation effect on the promotion and malignant conversion, but not on the initiation stage of carcinogenesis. This stands in contrast to the findings for high-dose acute exposures in A-bomb survivors, where the initiation and possibly promotion were found to be affected by radiation exposure. Evidence of an inverse dose-rate effect (i.e. an increase in the risk with a protraction of a given cumulative dose) was found in the NDR cohort.","['Zielinski, Jan M', 'Shilnikova, Natalia S', 'Krewski, Daniel']","['Zielinski JM', 'Shilnikova NS', 'Krewski D']","[""Health Environments and Consumer Safety Branch, Health Canada, Tunney's Pasture, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. jan_zielinski@hc-sc.gc.ca""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Poland,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,9437093,,IM,"['Canada/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Radiation Injuries/*epidemiology', 'Radiometry', '*Registries']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/05/22 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/22 09:00 [medline]']","['V633U33Q14P2X31G [pii]', '10.2478/v10001-008-0037-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2008;21(4):269-75. doi: 10.2478/v10001-008-0037-5.,,36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there have been no reports on the role of HBZ in patients with HTLV-1 associated inflammatory diseases. RESULTS: We quantified the HBZ and tax mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood from 56 HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients, 10 ATL patients, 38 healthy asymptomatic carriers (HCs) and 20 normal uninfected controls, as well as human leukemic T-cell lines and HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, and the data were correlated with clinical parameters. The spliced HBZ gene was transcribed in all HTLV-1-infected individuals examined, whereas tax mRNA was not transcribed in significant numbers of subjects in the same groups. Although the amount of HBZ mRNA expression was highest in ATL, medium in HAM/TSP, and lowest in HCs, with statistical significance, neither tax nor the HBZ mRNA expression per HTLV-1-infected cell differed significantly between each clinical group. The HTLV-1 HBZ, but not tax mRNA load, positively correlated with disease severity and with neopterin concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid of HAM/TSP patients. Furthermore, HBZ mRNA expression per HTLV-1-infected cell was decreased after successful immunomodulatory treatment for HAM/TSP.

METHODS: This study examined the microbial spectrum of gram-negative bacteria in various infection sites in patients with leukemia and solid tumors. The antimicrobial resistance patterns of the isolated bacteria were studied. RESULTS: The most frequently isolated gram-negative bacteria were Klebsiella pneumonia (31.2%) followed by Escherichia coli (22.2%). We report the isolation and identification of a number of less-frequent gram negative bacteria (Chromobacterium violacum, Burkholderia cepacia, Kluyvera ascorbata, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Salmonella arizona). Most of the gram-negative isolates from Respiratory Tract Infections (RTI), Gastro-intestinal Tract Infections (GITI), Urinary Tract Infections (UTI), and Bloodstream Infections (BSI) were obtained from leukemic patients. All gram-negative isolates from Skin Infections (SI) were obtained from solid-tumor patients. In both leukemic and solid-tumor patients, gram-negative bacteria causing UTI were mainly Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while gram-negative bacteria causing RTI were mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae. Escherichia coli was the main gram-negative pathogen causing BSI in solid-tumor patients and GITI in leukemic patients. Isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter species were resistant to most antibiotics tested. There was significant imipenem -resistance in Acinetobacter (40.9%), Pseudomonas (40%), and Enterobacter (22.2%) species, and noticeable imipinem-resistance in Klebsiella (13.9%) and Escherichia coli (8%). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report the evolution of imipenem-resistant gram-negative strains in Egypt. Mortality rates were higher in cancer patients with nosocomial Pseudomonas infections than any other bacterial infections. Policies restricting antibiotic consumption should be implemented to avoid the evolution of newer generations of antibiotic resistant-pathogens.","['Ashour, Hossam M', 'El-Sharif, Amany']","['Ashour HM', 'El-Sharif A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. hossamking@mailcity.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090219,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Gram-Negative Aerobic Bacteria/*drug effects/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology/mortality', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*microbiology/mortality']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/06/30 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/30 09:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-7-14 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-7-14 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2009 Feb 19;7:14. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-7-14.,,,,,PMC2654854,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stabilization of infection permitted further chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) without breakthrough fungemia and further dissemination of candidiasis. The favorable outcome provides further evidence that with optimal treatment, the presence of stable or non-progressive HSC is not an absolute contraindication for HCT.

Produced by cardiac ventricles, its expression is highly regulated by various mediators. Canine cardiac fibroblasts have been identified as a source of BNP. Cardiac fibroblasts are key regulators of myocardial structure and function. We treated cultured human adult cardiac fibroblasts (HACF) with 2000 U/ml tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), 200 U/ml interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) or 50 ng/ml transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the presence or absence of 500 nM fluvastatin. N-terminal pro-BNP (Nt-proBNP) concentration was determined by a competitive enzyme immunoassay. RealTime polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) was performed to investigate changes in BNP mRNA expression. Nt-proBNP peptide was present in the conditioned media of HACF and incubation with fluvastatin significantly reduced Nt-proBNP peptide levels. Treatment of HACF with TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha or TGF-beta significantly increased Nt-proBNP levels compared with untreated cells. This effect was completely abolished in the presence of fluvastatin. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed these changes at the level of mRNA expression. Our data suggest that cardiac fibroblasts are a potential source of BNP in the human heart. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, associated with ventricular dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis, seem to be major inducers of BNP production in cardiac fibroblasts. This effect can be reverted by a statin. Based on our data, we speculate that elevated plasma BNP levels might not only reflect increased myocardial stretch but also inflammatory and remodelling processes. A possible benefit of statin-induced reduction in BNP production requires further studies.","['Jarai, Rudolf', 'Kaun, Christoph', 'Weiss, Thomas W', 'Speidl, Walter S', 'Rychli, Kathrin', 'Maurer, Gerald', 'Huber, Kurt', 'Wojta, Johann']","['Jarai R', 'Kaun C', 'Weiss TW', 'Speidl WS', 'Rychli K', 'Maurer G', 'Huber K', 'Wojta J']","['Department of Cardiology and Emergency Medicine, Wilhelminenhospital, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090217,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-1alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)', '4L066368AS (Fluvastatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Fluvastatin', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Myocardium/*cytology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/metabolism', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncostatin M/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",2009/02/21 09:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['JCMM704 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00704.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2009 Nov-Dec;13(11-12):4415-21. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00704.x.

The chronic exposure of humans to benzene in the workplace has been associated with blood disorders, as well as toxicity in lymphopoiesis, including aplastic anaemia and leukaemia. However, the mechanisms of benzene-induced haematotoxicity and leukaemogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the level of T-cell receptor excision DNA circles (TRECs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in benzene-exposed workers. This would therefore be considered as a potential marker for estimates of thymic output and an evaluation of the content of naive T-cells. It is hoped that the data will bring a comprehensive understanding on the influence of benzene exposure in the host T-cell immune function. Quantitative detection of TRECs in DNA of PBMCs from benzene-exposed workers was preformed by real-time polymerase chain reaction using the TaqMan technique. The benzene-exposed workers were divided into four groups, and 27 normal individuals were served as controls. The result indicated that the TRECs levels of all benzene-exposed groups were significantly decreased as compared with those of controls. In conclusion, the recent thymic output function and the T-cell immune function were apparently impaired in workers after benzene exposure.","['Li, B', 'Li, Y Q', 'Yang, L J', 'Chen, S H', 'Yu, W', 'Chen, J Y', 'Liu, W W']","['Li B', 'Li YQ', 'Yang LJ', 'Chen SH', 'Yu W', 'Chen JY', 'Liu WW']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Immunogenet,International journal of immunogenetics,101232337,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'DNA/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic/*drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/06/16 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/16 09:00 [medline]']","['EJI832 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1744-313X.2009.00832.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunogenet. 2009 Apr;36(2):107-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1744-313X.2009.00832.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decrease in immunoglobulin concentration under the lower physiological limit is not referred to as a characteristic sign of WM, yet it was recorded in 7 out of 19 patients in our patient group and continued after chemotherapy, with the affected patients suffering from infections in remission more often than those with physiological values of immunoglobulins. 36% (7/19) patients were treated with R-FC (rituximab + fludarabine + cyclophosphamide) therapy, 15% (3/19) with FC therapy, 15% (3/19) with R-CHOP concluded by high-dose chemotherapy with autologous transplantation in 1 case, and 5% (1/19) with CHOP therapy. VAD (vancristine, ariamycine and dexamethasone) therapy was used in 10% (2/19) of patients and 10% (2/19) of patients were treated with oral chlorambucil. The first line of treatment achieved complete remission (CR) in 15% cases (3/15). Two patients who achieved CR were treated with R-FC, and one patient with VAD. Partial remission (PR) was achieved by 63% of patients (12/19). Minor response (MR) was achieved by 10% (2/19), and stable disease (SD) was recorded in 10% of patients (2/19) after initial treatment. The first relaps of the disease was recorded in 5 patients (2 of whom had PR and 3 MR) who achieved remission after additional lines of therapy. Thirteen patients are in the first PR. With a follow up median of 31 months (7-121), only 2 patients died from other than the underlying disease. Additional malignant disease was diagnosed in 3 patients: 1 colon carcinoma, 1 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 1 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). All three received fludarabine and cyclophopsphamide as initial therapy. Of the three patients only the patient with MDS has survived and is now without any evidence of the presence of WM, i.e. in complete remission at 41 months after the start of therapy. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous transplantation was used in 2 cases, once as part of initial therapy and once as part of the therapy for the first relaps resistant to R-CHOP chemotherapy. It is not possible to determine the median of the first remission or the median of total survival due to the short follow up interval.","['Adam, Z', 'Pour, L', 'Krejci, M', 'Koristek, Z', 'Navratil, M', 'Krivanova, A', 'Zahradova, L', 'Hajek, R']","['Adam Z', 'Pour L', 'Krejci M', 'Koristek Z', 'Navratil M', 'Krivanova A', 'Zahradova L', 'Hajek R']","['Interni hematoonkologicka klinika Lekarske fakulty MU a FN Brno, pracoviste Bohunice. z.adam@fnbrno.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*diagnosis/*drug therapy']",2009/02/21 09:00,2009/03/20 09:00,['2009/02/21 09:00'],"['2009/02/21 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 2009 Jan;55(1):9-17.,,,,,,Lecba Waldenstromovy makroglobulinemie-- zkusenosti jednoho pracoviste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment with berberine, curcumin or picroliv were found to (a) elevate the life span of leukemia harboring animals by more than 60 days; (b) decreased the anemic condition which was highly prevalent in FMuLv alone treated group; (c) histopathological evaluations showed that the compounds tested here inhibited the massive leukemic cell infiltrations to sinusoidal spaces in spleen; (d) decrease the expression of Bcl-2, Raf-1, Erk-1 IFNgamma receptor and erythropoietin; (e) induce the expression of p53.

This study investigated the effect of VPA on proliferation and apoptosis of human Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphatic (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells and on colony formation of human chronic-phase CML progenitor cells. Strong anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of VPA were observed on human ALL and CML cell lines at concentrations achievable in vivo. These effects were most pronounced in ALL cell lines as well as in primary ALL cells. Notably, VPA revealed enhanced activity with imatinib mesylate, nilotinib, the farnesyl transferase inhibitor SCH66336, interferon-alpha and cytosine arabinoside. VPA inhibited the growth of colony-forming cells from 12 Ph+ chronic-phase CML patients but also of those from normal healthy controls in a dose-dependent fashion. HDAC-inhibiting activity of VPA was confirmed on ALL and CML cells. In conclusion, VPA, whether alone or in combination with other non-classical anti-leukemic compounds, exerts significant anti-leukemic effects on human ALL and CML cells.","['Kircher, Brigitte', 'Schumacher, Petra', 'Petzer, Andreas', 'Hoflehner, Elisabeth', 'Haun, Margot', 'Wolf, Anna Maria', 'Nachbaur, David', 'Gastl, Gunther']","['Kircher B', 'Schumacher P', 'Petzer A', 'Hoflehner E', 'Haun M', 'Wolf AM', 'Nachbaur D', 'Gastl G']","['Department of Internal Medicine V - Hematology and Oncology, Immunobiology and Stem Cell Laboratory, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria. brigitte.kircher@i-med.ac.at']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090217,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Genes, abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Valproic Acid/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",2009/02/20 09:00,2009/07/03 09:00,['2009/02/20 09:00'],"['2009/02/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [medline]']","['EJH1242 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01242.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Jul;83(1):48-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01242.x.

The human genome contains 720-800 GPCRs, and their diverse signal characteristics are determined by their specific tissue and subcellular expression profiles, as well as their coupling profile to the various G protein families (G(s), G(i), G(q), G(12)). The G protein coupling pattern links GPCR activation to the specific downstream effector pathways. G(12/13) signalling of GPCRs has been studied only recently in more detail, and involves activation of RhoGTPase nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs). Four mammalian RhoGEFs regulated by G(12/13) proteins are known: p115-RhoGEF, PSD-95/Disc-large/ZO-1 homology-RhoGEF, leukemia-associated RhoGEF and lymphoid blast crisis-RhoGEF. These link GPCRs to activation of the small monomeric GTPase RhoA, and other downstream effectors. Misregulated G(12/13) signalling is involved in multiple pathophysiological conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, arterial and pulmonary hypertension, and bronchial asthma. Specific targeting of G(12/13) signalling-related diseases of GPCRs hence provides novel therapeutic approaches. Assays to quantitatively measure GPCR-mediated activation of G(12/13) are only emerging, and are required to understand the G(12/13)-linked pharmacology. The review gives an overview of G(12/13) signalling of GPCRs with a focus on RhoGEF proteins as the immediate mediators of G(12/13) activation.","['Siehler, Sandra']",['Siehler S'],"['Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research Basel, Center for Proteomic Chemistry, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland. sandra.siehler@novartis.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090218,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (ARHGEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13)']",IM,"['Animals', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, G12-G13/chemistry/*physiology', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/chemistry/physiology', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2009/02/20 09:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2009/02/20 09:00'],"['2009/02/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['BPH121 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00121.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2009 Sep;158(1):41-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00121.x.

In this report, C57BL6 mice were vaccinated with DC pulsed with peptides eluted (EP) from the syngeneic C1498 myelomonocytic leukemic cell line in a prophylactic setting. In this model, a natural antileukemic immunity mediated by NK cells was observed in the control unloaded DC-vaccinated group. On the other hand, we showed that the cytotoxic antileukemic immune response induced by vaccination with eluted peptides pulsed-DC (DC/EP), in vitro and in vivo, was mainly mediated by CD4(+) T cells. Treatment with anti-CD25 antibody to deplete CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells before DC-vaccination dramatically improved the antileukemic immune response induced by immunization, and allowed the development of long-lasting immune responses that were tumor protective after a re-challenge with leukemic cells.

As a result, topological properties of the genetic material, including DNA underwinding and overwinding, knotting, and tangling, profoundly influence virtually every major nucleic acid process. Despite the importance of DNA topology, it is a conceptionally difficult subject to teach, because it requires students to visualize three-dimensional relationships. This article will familiarize the reader with the concept of DNA topology and offer practical approaches and demonstrations to teaching this ""knotty"" subject in the classroom. Furthermore, it will discuss topoisomerases, the enzymes that regulate the topological state of DNA in the cell. These ubiquitous enzymes perform a number of critical cellular functions by generating transient breaks in the double helix. During this catalytic event, topoisomerases maintain genomic stability by forming covalent phosphotyrosyl bonds between active site residues and the newly generated DNA termini. Topoisomerases are essential for cell survival. However, because they cleave the genetic material, these enzymes also have the potential to fragment the genome. This latter feature of topoisomerases is exploited by some of the most widely prescribed anticancer and antibacterial drugs currently in clinical use. Finally, in addition to curing cancer, topoisomerase action also has been linked to the induction of specific types of leukemia.","['Deweese, Joseph E', 'Osheroff, Michael A', 'Osheroff, Neil']","['Deweese JE', 'Osheroff MA', 'Osheroff N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0146.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biochem Mol Biol Educ,Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,100970605,,,,2009/02/20 09:00,2009/02/20 09:01,['2009/02/20 09:00'],"['2009/02/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/bmb.20244 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Educ. 2008;37(1):2-10. doi: 10.1002/bmb.20244.,,,,"['R01 GM053960-11/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM053960/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM033944-25/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM033944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2643378,,['NIHMS78467'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these molecules have been shown to compromise assembly of HIV infectious particles in cell cultures by interfering with the activity of the SR protein SF2/ASF and by subsequently suppressing production of splicing-dependent retroviral accessory proteins. For all replication-competent retroviruses, a limiting requirement for infection and pathogenesis is the expression of the envelope glycoprotein which strictly depends on the host splicing machinery. Here, we have evaluated the efficiency of IDC on an animal model of retroviral pathogenesis using a fully replication-competent retrovirus. In this model, all newborn mice infected with a fully replicative murine leukemia virus (MLV) develop erythroleukemia within 6 to 8 weeks of age. We tested several IDC for their ability to interfere ex vivo with MLV splicing and virus spreading as well as for their protective effect in vivo. We show here that two of these IDC, IDC13 and IDC78, selectively altered splicing-dependent production of the retroviral envelope gene, thus inhibiting early viral replication in vivo, sufficiently to protect mice from MLV-induced pathogenesis. The apparent specificity and clinical safety observed here for both IDC13 and IDC78 strongly support further assessment of inhibitors of SR protein splicing factors as a new class of antiretroviral therapeutic agents.","['Keriel, Anne', 'Mahuteau-Betzer, Florence', 'Jacquet, Chantal', 'Plays, Marc', 'Grierson, David', 'Sitbon, Marc', 'Tazi, Jamal']","['Keriel A', 'Mahuteau-Betzer F', 'Jacquet C', 'Plays M', 'Grierson D', 'Sitbon M', 'Tazi J']","['Universite Montpellier 2 Universite Montpellier 1 CNRS, Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, UMR5535, IFR122, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090219,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Retroviridae', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors']",2009/02/20 09:00,2009/04/14 09:00,['2009/02/20 09:00'],"['2008/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0004533 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(2):e4533. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004533.

Even when those with low-risk karyotypes were excluded, patients with t(7;11) had poorer overall survival than the other AML group (median 13.5 and 20 months, respectively, P=0.045) and poorer relapse-free survival (median 6 and 12 months, respectively, P=0.003).

We characterized four varieties of this fusion, among which NUP98 exon 12/HOXA9 exon 1b was present in all 11 patients. We developed a highly sensitive and specific assay to quantify the abundance of leukemic cells, and found that the fusion remained detectable in morphological complete remission, even after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, suggesting that this disease was highly refractory to very intensive treatment. AML with NUP98-HOXA9 fusion therefore appears to have a distinct clinical and biological profile, and should be regarded as a poor prognostic group.","['Chou, W-C', 'Chen, C-Y', 'Hou, H-A', 'Lin, L-I', 'Tang, J-L', 'Yao, M', 'Tsay, W', 'Ko, B-S', 'Wu, S-J', 'Huang, S-Y', 'Hsu, S-C', 'Chen, Y-C', 'Huang, Y-N', 'Tseng, M-H', 'Huang, C-F', 'Tien, H-F']","['Chou WC', 'Chen CY', 'Hou HA', 'Lin LI', 'Tang JL', 'Yao M', 'Tsay W', 'Ko BS', 'Wu SJ', 'Huang SY', 'Hsu SC', 'Chen YC', 'Huang YN', 'Tseng MH', 'Huang CF', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090219,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2009/02/20 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/02/20 09:00'],"['2009/02/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']","['leu200925 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.25 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jul;23(7):1303-10. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.25.

A high proportion of MCL tumors harbor wild-type (wt) and potentially functional p53 gene. We show here that stabilization and activation of wt-p53 using a recently developed potent MDM2 inhibitor, nutlin 3A, results in significant p53-dependent G1-S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCL cells through regulation of p53 target genes. As mTOR signaling is activated in MCL and may control cyclin D1 levels, we show that p53 activation may downregulate the AKT/mTOR pathway through a mechanism involving AMP kinase (AMPK). Despite the non-genotoxic mode of nutlin 3A treatment, we show evidence that stabilization of p53 is associated with its phosphorylation at serine 15 residue and activation of AMPK. Stimulation of AMPK kinase activity using AICAR inhibits phosphorylation of critical downstream effectors of mTOR signaling, such as 4E-BP1 and rpS6. Pharmacologic inhibition of AMPK using compound C in nutlin-3A-treated MCL cells harboring wt-p53 did not affect the level of (ser15)p-p53, suggesting that the (ser15)p-p53 --> AMPK is the direction involved in the p53/AMPK/mTOR cross talk.

Moreover, the T cells efficiently lysed peptide-pulsed but not unpulsed T2 cells and autologous dendritic cells; cyclin D1(+) and HLA-A(*)0201(+) human MCL lines MINO, SP53, Jeko-1 and Granta 519; and more importantly, HLA-A(*)0201(+) primary lymphoma cells from MCL patients. No killing was observed with HLA-A(*)0201(-) primary lymphoma cells or HLA-A(*)0201(+) normal blood cells, including B cells. These results indicate that these T cells are potent cytotoxic T cells and recognize cyclin D1 peptides naturally presented by patient lymphoma cells in the context of HLA-A(*)0201 molecules. Taken together, our work identifies cyclin D1 as a potentially important antigen for immunotherapy of MCL.","['Wang, M', 'Sun, L', 'Qian, J', 'Han, X', 'Zhang, L', 'Lin, P', 'Cai, Z', 'Yi, Q']","['Wang M', 'Sun L', 'Qian J', 'Han X', 'Zhang L', 'Lin P', 'Cai Z', 'Yi Q']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090219,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin D1/chemistry/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2009/02/20 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/02/20 09:00'],"['2009/02/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']","['leu200919 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.19 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jul;23(7):1320-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.19.

Adapted cells showed increased transcription rates, activities and polypeptide levels of the bortezomib-sensitive beta5, but also of the beta2 proteasome subunit and consistently retained elevated levels of active beta1/beta5-type proteasome subunits in the presence of therapeutic levels of bortezomib. Bortezomib-adapted HL-60 cells showed increased expression and proteasome association of the 11S proteasome activator, and did not accumulate poly-ubiquitinated protein, activate the UPR or UPR-mediated apoptosis in response to bortezomib. The rate of protein biosynthesis was reduced, and the transcription of chaperone genes downmodulated. We did not observe major changes in the activities of TPPII, cathepsins or deubiquitinating proteases.

This process of complementation, known as pseudotyping, often can occur even when the glycoprotein is from an unrelated virus. Although pseudotyping is widely used for engineering chimeric viruses, it has remained unknown whether a virus can actively recruit foreign glycoproteins to budding sites or, alternatively, if a virus obtains the glycoproteins through a passive mechanism. We have studied the specificity of glycoprotein recruitment by immunogold labeling viral glycoproteins and imaging their distribution on the host plasma membrane using scanning electron microscopy. Expressed alone, all tested viral glycoproteins were relatively randomly distributed on the plasma membrane. However, in the presence of budding HIV-1 or Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) particles, some glycoproteins, such as those encoded by murine leukemia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus, were dramatically redistributed to viral budding sites. In contrast, the RSV Env glycoprotein was robustly recruited only to the homologous RSV budding sites.

Identifying pretreatment patient characteristics or prognostic factors associated with clinical outcomes is important for counseling patients, conducting clinical research, and evaluating trial results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the pretreatment characteristics of 595 previously untreated patients who had National Cancer Institute Working Group indications to initiate front-line therapy for predictors of complete response (CR), time to treatment failure (TTF), and overall survival (OS). Multivariable models were developed for all three end points. RESULTS: CR is an important treatment end point correlated with longer TTF and OS. In this retrospective analysis, front-line treatment regimen was a significant independent predictive factor for all three end points; chemoimmunotherapy was the superior treatment regimen. Considering front-line treatment regimen, other independent patient characteristics associated with CR included age and beta(2)-microglobulin (beta-2M). TTF was independently associated with age, beta-2M, percent lymphocytes in bone marrow, and treatment regimen. Improved OS was independently associated with younger age, lower beta-2M, and treatment regimen. Two weighted prognostic models or nomograms, one including and one excluding treatment regimen, were constructed using significant characteristics to predict 5- and 10-year survival probability and estimate median survival time. CONCLUSION: Identifying pretreatment patient characteristics associated with CR, TTF, and OS establishes a baseline to compare and incorporate new prognostic factors. Treatment had an impact on the significance of these factors. Prognostic models may help patients and clinicians in decision making as well as facilitate clinical research through design and analyses of clinical trials.","['Wierda, William G', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Do, Kim-Anh', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Koller, Charles', 'Burger, Jan', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Keating, Michael']","['Wierda WG', ""O'Brien S"", 'Wang X', 'Faderl S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Do KA', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Cortes J', 'Thomas D', 'Koller C', 'Burger J', 'Lerner S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating M']","['Department of Leukemia and Biostatistics and Applied Mathematics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. wwierda@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090217,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nomograms', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*blood']",2009/02/20 09:00,2009/04/30 09:00,['2009/02/20 09:00'],"['2009/02/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.18.1701 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.18.1701 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 1;27(10):1637-43. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.18.1701.

Early clinical studies conducted in the German Democratic Republic more than 30 years ago suggested promising activity in indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Two North American trials reported responses in more than 70% of patients with chemotherapy- and rituximab-refractory disease, suggesting that bendamustine may be the most effective drug available for this patient population. Response rates of 90% to 92%, with complete remission in 55% to 60%, have been reported in patients with follicular and mantle-cell lymphoma with the combination of bendamustine and rituximab. Superiority over chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) led to its recent approval for this disease in the United States. Bendamustine is approved in Germany for the treatment of patients with indolent NHL, CLL, and multiple myeloma. Activity has also been noted in patients with breast cancer and small-cell lung cancer [corrected]. Questions related to the optimization of bendamustine therapy, including dose and schedule, role relative to other available agents, and management of toxicities, are being investigated. However, the availability of bendamustine provides another effective treatment option for patients with lymphoid malignancies.","['Cheson, Bruce D', 'Rummel, Mathias J']","['Cheson BD', 'Rummel MJ']","['Georgetown University Hospital, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC 20007, USA. bdc4@georgetown.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090217,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",2009/02/20 09:00,2009/03/28 09:00,['2009/02/20 09:00'],"['2009/02/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.18.7252 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.18.7252 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Mar 20;27(9):1492-501. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.18.7252.

Current criteria for the selection of URDs include consideration for HLA alleles determined by high resolution typing methods, with preference for allele-matched donors. However, the utility and outcome associated with transplants from URDs compared with those from MSDs remains undefined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined clinical outcome after patients received bone marrow transplants (BMTs) from MSDs; HLA-A, -B, -C, and DRB1 allele-matched URDs (8/8); and HLA-mismatched URDs in a homogeneous population of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in first chronic phase (CP1) where a strong allogeneic effect and hence a lower risk of relapse is anticipated. Transplantation outcomes were compared between 1,052 URD and 3,514 MSD BMT recipients with CML in CP1. RESULTS: Five-year overall survival and leukemia-free survival (LFS) after receipt of BMTs from 8/8 matched URDs were worse than those after receipt of BMTs from MSDs (5-year survival, 55% v 63%; RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.56; P < .001; LFS, 50% v 55%; RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.40; P = .006). Survival was progressively worse with greater degrees of mismatch. Similar and low risk of relapse were observed after receipt of transplant from either MSD or URD. CONCLUSION: In this homogeneous cohort of good risk patients with CML in CP1, 5-year overall survival and LFS after receipt of transplant from 8/8 allele-matched donors were modestly though significantly worse than those after receipt of transplant from MSDs. Additive adverse effects of multilocus mismatching are not well tolerated and should be avoided if possible.","['Arora, Mukta', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Haagenson, Michael D', 'Klein, John P', 'Hurley, Carolyn K', 'Selby, George B', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Kernan, Nancy A', 'Kollman, Craig', 'Nademanee, Auayporn', 'McGlave, Philip', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Petersdorf, Effie W']","['Arora M', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Spellman SR', 'Haagenson MD', 'Klein JP', 'Hurley CK', 'Selby GB', 'Antin JH', 'Kernan NA', 'Kollman C', 'Nademanee A', 'McGlave P', 'Horowitz MM', 'Petersdorf EW']","['University of Minnesota, National Marrow Donor Program, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. arora005@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090217,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Siblings', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/02/20 09:00,2009/04/30 09:00,['2009/02/20 09:00'],"['2009/02/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/30 09:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.18.7740 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.18.7740 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 1;27(10):1644-52. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.18.7740.

Nine of the 16 acute myeloid leukemias or myelodysplastic syndromes had monosomy 7 (n = 7) or 7q deletions (n = 2). In Cox multivariate analysis, longer duration of oral 6-mercaptopurine (6MP)/methotrexate (MTX) maintenance therapy (P = .02; longest for standard-risk patients) and presence of high hyperdiploidy (P = .07) were related to increased risk of SMN. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) methylates 6MP and its metabolites, and thus reduces cellular levels of cytotoxic 6-thioguanine nucleotides. Of 524 patients who had erythrocyte TPMT activity measured, the median TPMT activity in 9 patients developing an SMN was significantly lower than in the 515 that did not develop an SMN (median, 12.1 vs 18.1 IU/mL; P = .02). Among 427 TPMT wild-type patients for whom the 6MP dose was registered, those who developed SMN received higher average 6MP doses than the remaining patients (69.7 vs 60.4 mg/m2; P = .03). This study indicates that the duration and intensity of 6MP/MTX maintenance therapy of childhood ALL may influence the risk of SMNs in childhood ALL.","['Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Al-Modhwahi, Ibrahim', 'Andersen, Mette Klarskov', 'Behrendtz, Mikael', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Kristinsson, Jon', 'Nersting, Jacob', 'Nygaard, Randi', 'Svendsen, Anne Louise', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Weinshilboum, Richard']","['Schmiegelow K', 'Al-Modhwahi I', 'Andersen MK', 'Behrendtz M', 'Forestier E', 'Hasle H', 'Heyman M', 'Kristinsson J', 'Nersting J', 'Nygaard R', 'Svendsen AL', 'Vettenranta K', 'Weinshilboum R']","['Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Gynecology, Obstetrics, and Pediatrics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. kschmiegelow@rh.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090217,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/02/20 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/02/20 09:00'],"['2009/02/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37286-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-11-187880 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jun 11;113(24):6077-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-11-187880.

Until now, luteinizing GCs have been considered to be terminally differentiated, destined to undergo death after ovulation. Present concepts of luteal function, endocrine regulation of early pregnancy, and the recruitment of new ovarian follicles are all based on the cyclical renewal of the entire population of GCs. We now demonstrate that luteinizing GCs isolated from the ovarian follicles of infertile patients and sorted with flow cytometry based upon the presence of their specific marker, the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), can be maintained in culture over prolonged periods of time in the presence of the leukemia-inhibiting factor (LIF). Under those conditions the markers of GC function such as FSHR and aromatase gradually disappeared. POU5F1 (POU domain, class 5, homeobox 1), a typical stem cell marker, was expressed throughout the culture, but germ line cell markers such as nanog, vasa, and stellar were not. Mesenchymal lineage markers such as CD29, CD44, CD90, CD105, CD117, and CD166, but not CD73, were expressed by substantial subpopulations of GCs. The multipotency of a subset of GCs was established by in vitro differentiation into other cell types, otherwise not present within ovarian follicles, such as neurons, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. Follicle-derived stem cells were also able to survive when transplanted into the backs of immunoincompetent mice, in vivo generating tissues of mesenchymal origin. The unexpected findings of multipotency of cells with prolonged lifespans originating from ovarian follicles are likely to have a significant impact on evolving theories in ovarian pathophysiology, particularly with reference to ovarian endometriosis and ovarian cancer.","['Kossowska-Tomaszczuk, Katarzyna', 'De Geyter, Christian', 'De Geyter, Maria', 'Martin, Ivan', 'Holzgreve, Wolfgang', 'Scherberich, Arnaud', 'Zhang, Hong']","['Kossowska-Tomaszczuk K', 'De Geyter C', 'De Geyter M', 'Martin I', 'Holzgreve W', 'Scherberich A', 'Zhang H']","[""Woman's Hospital, University of Basel, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Chondrogenesis', 'Female', 'Granulosa Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Luteinization/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Neurogenesis', 'Osteogenesis', 'Time Factors']",2009/02/19 09:00,2009/06/26 09:00,['2009/02/19 09:00'],"['2009/02/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/26 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1634/stemcells.2008-0233 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2009 Jan;27(1):210-9. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2008-0233.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that T cells recognizing minor histocompatibility antigens (mHag) selectively expressed on hematopoietic cells mediate antileukemic reactivity after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, large numbers of T cells with defined specificity are difficult to attain. An attractive strategy to obtain large numbers of leukemia-reactive T cells is retroviral transfer of mHag-specific T-cell receptors (TCR). TCR transfer into T cells specific for persistent viruses may enable these T cells to proliferate both after encountering with viral antigens as well as mHags, increasing the possibility of in vivo survival. We analyzed whether the dual specificity of the TCR-transferred T cells after repetitive stimulation via either the introduced antileukemic HA-2-TCR or the endogenous cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific CMV-TCR was preserved. We show that after repetitive stimulation, T cells skew to a population predominantly expressing the triggered TCR. However, HA-2-TCR-transferred CMV-specific T cells with high antileukemic HA-2-TCR expression but low CMV-TCR expression were able to persist and proliferate after repetitive stimulation with pp65. Moreover, HA-2-TCR-transferred CMV-specific T cells remained dual specific after repetitive stimulation and TCR expression could be reverted after additional stimulation via the previously nonstimulated TCR, restoring high-avidity interactions. These data imply persistence of TCR-transferred virus-specific T cells with both antileukemic and antivirus reactivity in vivo.","['van Loenen, Marleen M', 'Hagedoorn, Renate S', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'Hoogeboom, Manja', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M']","['van Loenen MM', 'Hagedoorn RS', 'Kester MG', 'Hoogeboom M', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Heemskerk MH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090217,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (HA-2 antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2009/02/19 09:00,2009/03/21 09:00,['2009/02/19 09:00'],"['2009/02/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-2523 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2523 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Mar 1;69(5):2034-41. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2523.

In this preclinical study, we evaluated combining cytosine arabinoside [1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C)] and/or etoposide with vorinostat for use in the treatment of acute leukemias. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cell survival was examined in vitro in HL-60 human myeloid leukemia cells and K562 myeloid blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, using the 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt and/or fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide assays. Drug interactions were analyzed by the combination index method (CalcuSyn) and by a novel statistical method that we developed (SynStat). Cell cycle phase distribution was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Cytotoxic antagonism resulted when vorinostat was combined concomitantly with ara-C; however, when vorinostat was given first followed by a drug-free interval before ara-C treatment, this sequential combination was mostly synergistic. Etoposide combined with vorinostat was additive to synergistic, and the synergism became more pronounced when etoposide was given after vorinostat. Cell cycle analyses revealed that the sequence-dependent interaction of vorinostat and ara-C or etoposide reflected the arrest of cells in G1 or G2 phase during vorinostat treatment and recovery into S phase after removal of vorinostat. CONCLUSIONS: These findings using two independent methods to assess drug combination effects provide a preclinical rationale for phase I trials of the sequential combination of vorinostat followed by ara-C and etoposide in patients with advanced or refractory leukemias. CalcuSyn findings were concordant with those of SynStat, validating the use of the latter in analyzing drug interactions.","['Shiozawa, Ken', 'Nakanishi, Takeo', 'Tan, Ming', 'Fang, Hong-Bin', 'Wang, Wen-chyi', 'Edelman, Martin J', 'Carlton, David', 'Gojo, Ivana', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Ross, Douglas D']","['Shiozawa K', 'Nakanishi T', 'Tan M', 'Fang HB', 'Wang WC', 'Edelman MJ', 'Carlton D', 'Gojo I', 'Sausville EA', 'Ross DD']","['Program in Experimental Therapeutics, University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, and Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090217,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vorinostat']",2009/02/19 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/02/19 09:00'],"['2009/02/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-08-1587 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1587 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Mar 1;15(5):1698-707. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1587.

In contrast, the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), a negatively regulated target of AKT1 signaling, antagonizes self-renewal. Here, we show that PI3K/AKT1 signaling promotes self-renewal by suppressing GSK3beta activity and restricting its access to nuclear substrates such as c-myc. GSK3beta shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus in mESCs but accumulates in the cytoplasm in an inactive form due to AKT1-dependent nuclear export and inhibitory phosphorylation. When PI3K/AKT1 signaling declines following leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal, active GSK3beta accumulates in the nucleus, where it targets c-myc through phosphorylation on threonine 58 (T58), promoting its degradation. Ectopic nuclear localization of active GSK3beta promotes differentiation, but this process is blocked by a mutant form of c-myc (T58A) that evades phosphorylation by GSK3beta. This novel mechanism explains how AKT1 promotes self-renewal by regulating the activity and localization of GSK3beta. This pathway converges on c-myc, a key regulator of mESC self-renewal.","['Bechard, Matthew', 'Dalton, Stephen']","['Bechard M', 'Dalton S']","['Paul D.

These include t(4;14) multiple myeloma associated with ectopic expression of FGFR3 and t(4;12)(p16;p13) acute myeloid leukemia associated with expression of a constitutively activated fusion tyrosine kinase, TEL-FGFR3. We recently reported that FGFR3 directly tyrosine phosphorylates RSK2 at Y529, which consequently regulates RSK2 activation. Here we identified Y707 as an additional tyrosine in RSK2 that is phosphorylated by FGFR3. Phosphorylation at Y707 contributes to RSK2 activation, through a putative disruption of the autoinhibitory alphaL-helix on the C terminus of RSK2, unlike Y529 phosphorylation, which facilitates ERK binding. Moreover, we found that FGFR3 interacts with RSK2 through residue W332 in the linker region of RSK2 and that this association is required for FGFR3-dependent phosphorylation of RSK2 at Y529 and Y707, as well as the subsequent RSK2 activation. Furthermore, in a murine bone marrow transplant assay, genetic deficiency in RSK2 resulted in a significantly delayed and attenuated myeloproliferative syndrome induced by TEL-FGFR3 as compared with wild-type cells, suggesting a critical role of RSK2 in FGFR3-induced hematopoietic transformation.

Establishing a prognostic classification is a difficult process, especially in rare cancers: the availability of a growing number of candidate prognostic factors may lead to competitive stratifications, whose validation may not be feasible due to small numbers and the need for a long follow-up. Our goal is to illustrate a strategy to compare stratifications, based on the performance in clinically relevant subgroups of patients.

METHODS: Real-time PCR was used for detecting WAVE1 and p22phox expression in PBMCs in 41 children with ALL and 10 normal controls. Plasma activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was measured by the xanthine oxidase method. Plasma activity of GSH-Px was measured by the DTNB reaction test. RESULTS: The expression of WAVE1 and p22phox was significantly higher in the active ALL groups (newly diagnosed and relapse ALL) than that in the normal control and the complete remission (CR) ALL groups (<0.01). The CR ALL group showed increased WAVE1 and p22phox expression than those in the normal control group (<0.05). Plasma activities of SOD (22.62+/-7.39 U/mL) and GSH-Px (91.73+/-28.88 micromol/L) in the active ALL group were significantly lower than those in the normal control (166.35+/-27.93 U/mL and 490.94+/-39.38 micromol/L, respectively) and the CR ALL groups (107.11+/-28.57 U/mL and 267.56+/-82.64 micromol/L, respectively) (<0.01). WAVE1 expression was positively correlated with p22phox expression (r=0.34, <0.05) but negatively correlated with plasma activities of SOD and GSH-Px ( r=-0.336 and-0.408, respectively; <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: WAVE1 and p22phox expression in PBMCs increased and was associated with the disease course in children with ALL. Oxidative stress may be involved in the regulation of WAVE1 expression in ALL children.","['He, Yu-Lei', 'Cao, Li-Zhi', 'Yang, Jing', 'Yang, Ming-Hua', 'Xu, Wang-Qiong', 'Xie, Min', 'Shi, Zhuang']","['He YL', 'Cao LZ', 'Yang J', 'Yang MH', 'Xu WQ', 'Xie M', 'Shi Z']","['Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WASF1 protein, human)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein Family)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (CYBA protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Male', 'NADPH Oxidases/*genetics', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'Superoxide Dismutase/blood', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein Family/*genetics']",2009/02/19 09:00,2009/06/25 09:00,['2009/02/19 09:00'],"['2009/02/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/25 09:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2009)02-0088-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2009 Feb;11(2):88-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, a systems level view is necessary for understanding how a cell coordinates this process and for developing effective therapeutic strategies to treat diseases, such as cancer, in which differentiation plays a significant role. Theoretical considerations and recent experimental evidence support the view that cell fates are high dimensional attractor states of the underlying molecular networks. The temporal behavior of the network states progressing toward different cell fate attractors has the potential to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms governing differentiation. RESULTS: Using the HL60 multipotent promyelocytic leukemia cell line, we performed experiments that ultimately led to two different cell fate attractors by two treatments of varying dosage and duration of the differentiation agent all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). The dosage and duration combinations of the two treatments were chosen by means of flow cytometric measurements of CD11b, a well-known early differentiation marker, such that they generated two intermediate populations that were poised at the apparently same stage of differentiation. However, the population of one treatment proceeded toward the terminally differentiated neutrophil attractor while that of the other treatment reverted back toward the undifferentiated promyelocytic attractor. We monitored the gene expression changes in the two populations after their respective treatments over a period of five days and identified a set of genes that diverged in their expression, a subset of which promotes neutrophil differentiation while the other represses cell cycle progression. By employing promoter based transcription factor binding site analysis, we found enrichment in the set of divergent genes, of transcription factors functionally linked to tumor progression, cell cycle, and development. CONCLUSION: Since many of the transcription factors identified by this approach are also known to be implicated in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemia, this study points to the utility of incorporating a dynamical systems level view into a computational analysis framework for elucidating transcriptional mechanisms regulating differentiation.","['Huang, Albert C', 'Hu, Limei', 'Kauffman, Stuart A', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Shmulevich, Ilya']","['Huang AC', 'Hu L', 'Kauffman SA', 'Zhang W', 'Shmulevich I']","['University of Washington, Seattle, USA. achuang@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090218,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2009/02/19 09:00,2009/06/02 09:00,['2009/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/02 09:00 [medline]']","['1752-0509-3-20 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-0509-3-20 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2009 Feb 18;3:20. doi: 10.1186/1752-0509-3-20.,,,,"['P50 GM076547/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM072855/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 GM070600/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2652435,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The voltage across the plasma membrane also decreases or disappears during apoptosis, but the physiological significance of this is unknown. RESULTS: Here we show that transmembrane potential regulates membrane binding of two unrelated proteins that recognize exposed phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. In Jurkat T leukemia cells and K562 promyelocytic leukemia cells undergoing apoptosis, extracellular binding of annexin V was increased by decreasing membrane potential in a dose-dependent manner. Studies with phospholipid vesicles showed that the effect was mediated via an increase in binding affinity. The effect was independent of the apoptotic stimulus. The same phenomenon occurred with lactadherin, a structurally unrelated protein that also binds to apoptotic cells via phosphatidylserine and is essential for in vivo clearance of dying cells. CONCLUSION: Alterations in membrane potential regulate the binding of annexin V and lactadherin to cell membranes, and may also influence the membrane binding of other classes of phosphatidylserine-binding proteins.","['Smith, Christina', 'Gibson, Donald F', 'Tait, Jonathan F']","['Smith C', 'Gibson DF', 'Tait JF']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7110, USA. smithc@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090217,England,BMC Biochem,BMC biochemistry,101084098,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (MFGE8 protein, human)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Neuromuscular Depolarizing Agents)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/*physiology', 'Milk Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Models, Chemical', 'Neuromuscular Depolarizing Agents/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/physiology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2009/02/19 09:00,2009/04/02 09:00,['2009/02/19 09:00'],"['2008/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2091-10-5 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2091-10-5 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Biochem. 2009 Feb 17;10:5. doi: 10.1186/1471-2091-10-5.,,,,"['R01 CA102348/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-102348/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2653547,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The response to therapy may vary because of development of secondary cytogenetic changes or resistance. In addition, suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins is also hypothesized as a cause of resistance and poor prognosis when aberrantly overexpressed. This study aims to determine the incidence and prognostic value of the 9q34 deletion using fluorescence in situ hybridization and SOCS-1 mRNA aberrant expression by PCR in 43 CML patients at different phases of the disease and in 10 normal controls and correlate the data to interferon response. All patients were Philadelphia-positive, deletions of 9q34 were observed in 20.9% of all patients (13.3% chronic phase, 10% accelerated phase and 33.3% in blast crisis). SOCS expressions were positive in 53.4% of all patients (40% chronic phase, 50% AP and 66.67% in blast crisis). Analysing outcome based on 9q34 deletion and SOCS expression status showed a statistically significant difference in overall survival and progression-free survival between those with deletions and those without (P<0.001) and between those with abnormal SOCS expression and those without (P<0.001). Deletion of 9q34 and aberrant expression of SOCS-1 are associated with poor prognosis in CML patients with different phases of the disease under interferon therapy.","['Ghaith, F', 'Abdou, S', 'El-Bendary, A', 'Shahin, D', 'Eid, M', 'Megeed, W A', 'El-Sheikh, I', 'Farrag, W', 'Yousuf, S']","['Ghaith F', 'Abdou S', 'El-Bendary A', 'Shahin D', 'Eid M', 'Megeed WA', 'El-Sheikh I', 'Farrag W', 'Yousuf S']","['Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090213,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Deletion', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics']",2009/02/19 09:00,2010/09/10 06:00,['2009/02/19 09:00'],"['2009/02/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1143 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01143.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2010 Feb;32(1 Pt 2):103-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01143.x.

Once such a truncation is completed, multiple testing methods applied to any subsequent analysis no longer control the appropriate Type I error rates. Here we propose a modified marginal Benjamini & Hochberg step-up FDR controlling procedure for multi-stage analyses (FDR-MSA), which correctly controls Type I error in terms of the entire variable set when only a subset of the initial set of variables is tested. The method is presented with respect to a variable importance application. As the initial subset size increases, we observe convergence to the standard Benjamini & Hochberg step-up FDR controlling multiple testing procedures. We demonstrate the power and Type I error control through simulation and application to the Golub Leukemia data from 1999.","['Tuglus, Catherine', 'van der Laan, Mark J']","['Tuglus C', 'van der Laan MJ']","['University of California, Berkeley, USA. ctuglus@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090204,Germany,Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol,Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,101176023,,IM,"['Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', '*Models, Statistical']",2009/02/19 09:00,2009/03/21 09:00,['2009/02/19 09:00'],"['2009/02/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.2202/1544-6115.1397 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol. 2009;8:Article 12. doi: 10.2202/1544-6115.1397.

Genetic screens have been an informative method to identify genes involved in developmental processes. In the zebrafish, loss-of-function screens have been the primary approach for these studies. We sought to complement loss-of-function screens using an unbiased approach to overexpress genes with a Gal4-UAS based system, similar to the gain-of-function screens in Drosophila. Using MMLV as a mutagenic vector, a cassette containing a UAS promoter was readily inserted in the genome, often at the 5' end of genes, allowing Gal4-dependent overexpression. We confirmed that genes downstream of the viral insertions were overexpressed in a Gal4-VP16 dependent manner. We further demonstrate that misexpression of one such downstream gene gucy2F, a membrane-bound guanylate cyclase, throughout the nervous system results in multiple defects including a loss of forebrain neurons. This suggests proper control of cGMP production is important in neuronal survival. From this study, we propose that this gain-of-function approach can be applied to large-scale genetic screens in a vertebrate model organism and may reveal previously unknown gene function.","['Maddison, Lisette A', 'Lu, Jianjun', 'Victoroff, Tristan', 'Scott, Ethan', 'Baier, Herwig', 'Chen, Wenbiao']","['Maddison LA', 'Lu J', 'Victoroff T', 'Scott E', 'Baier H', 'Chen W']","['Vollum Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090217,Germany,Mol Genet Genomics,Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG,101093320,"['EC 4.6.1.2 (Guanylate Cyclase)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Cyclic GMP/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Guanylate Cyclase/*genetics', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'Male', 'Models, Neurological', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Nerve Degeneration/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Zebrafish/embryology/*genetics/*physiology']",2009/02/18 09:00,2009/05/29 09:00,['2009/02/18 09:00'],"['2008/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00438-009-0428-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Genet Genomics. 2009 May;281(5):551-63. doi: 10.1007/s00438-009-0428-8.

Here evidence is provided that an exposure of HL60 and U937 cells to low (1-10 nM) concentrations of 1,25D decreases the expression of miR181a and miR181b in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Since the predicted miR181 targets include the 3'-UTR of p27(Kip1), we expressed pre-miR181a in these cells, and found that the elevation of cellular miR181a levels abrogates the 1,25D-induced increase in p27(Kip1) at both mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, transfection of pre-miR181a resulted in a slight elevation of p21(Cip1) expression. Importantly, transfection of pre-miR181a blunted the effect of 1,25D on the expression of monocytic differentiation markers, and reduced the G(1) block in 1,25D-treated cells, while transfection of anti-miR181a increased 1,25D-induced differentiation. Together, these data show that miR181a participates in 1,25D-induced differentiation of HL60 and U937 cells, and suggest that a high constitutive expression of members of miR181 family may contribute to the malignant phenotype in the myeloid lineage.","['Wang, Xuening', 'Gocek, Elzbieta', 'Liu, Chang-Gong', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Wang X', 'Gocek E', 'Liu CG', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Medicine and Dentistry, New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey 07101-1709, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090318,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '66772-14-3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*genetics/metabolism', 'G1 Phase', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells/metabolism', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2009/02/18 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/02/18 09:00'],"['2009/02/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']","['7870 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.5.7870 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 Mar 1;8(5):736-41. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.5.7870.

The first promising reports on this notion prompted a review article on this subject by us 25 years ago. In this review, we revisit this interesting field of study and report the progress achieved in the course of nearly 3 decades. The best proof of principle for differentiation therapy has been the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia with all-trans retinoic acid.

Three major Fv1 resistance alleles have been identified in laboratory mice, and they target virus capsid genes to produce characteristic patterns of resistance to mouse leukemia viruses (MLVs). We identified Fv1 in 3 of the 4 Mus subgenera; its absence from Coelomys and 1 of 3 species of Pyromys indicate Fv1 was acquired shortly after the origin of the Mus genus. We sequenced Fv1 genes from 21 mice representative of the major taxonomic groups of Mus. Two lines of evidence indicate that Fv1 has had antiviral function for 7 million years of evolution. First, 2 species of African pygmy mice (subgenus Nannomys) show an Fv1-like MLV resistance, and transduced cells expressing the Nannomys Fv1 gene reproduce this resistance pattern. Second, sequence comparisons suggest that Fv1 has been involved in genetic conflicts throughout Mus evolution. We found evidence for strong positive selection of Fv1 and identified 6 codons that show evidence of positive selection: 3 codons in the C-terminal region including 2 previously shown to contribute to Fv1 restriction in laboratory mice, and 3 codons in a 10-codon segment overlapping the major homology region of Fv1; this segment is known to be involved in capsid multimerization. This analysis suggests that Fv1 has had an antiviral role throughout Mus evolution predating exposure of mice to the MLVs restricted by laboratory mouse Fv1, and suggests a mechanism for Fv1 restriction.","['Yan, Yuhe', 'Buckler-White, Alicia', 'Wollenberg, Kurt', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Yan Y', 'Buckler-White A', 'Wollenberg K', 'Kozak CA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20090212,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Phylogeny', 'Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/metabolism/virology', '*Selection, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/metabolism/virology']",2009/02/18 09:00,2009/04/02 09:00,['2009/02/18 09:00'],"['2009/02/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [medline]']","['0900181106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0900181106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Mar 3;106(9):3259-63. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0900181106.

Interfering with their activity using small-molecule inhibitors (SMI) is being explored as a new therapeutic strategy for treating B-cell tumors. We evaluated the efficacy of TW-37, a non-peptidic SMI of Bcl-2 against a range spectrum of human B-cell lines, fresh patient samples and animal xenograft models. Multiple cytochemical and molecular approaches such as acridine orange/ethidium bromide assay for apoptosis, co-immunoprecipitation of complexes and western blot analysis, caspase luminescent activity assay and apoptotic DNA fragmentation assay were used to demonstrate the effect of TW-37 on different B-cell lines, patient derived samples, as well as in animal xenograft models. Nanomolar concentrations of TW-37 were able to induce apoptosis in both fresh samples and established cell lines with IC50 in most cases of 165-320 nM. Apoptosis was independent of proliferative status or pathological classification of B-cell tumor. TW-37 was able to block Bim-Bcl-XL and Bim-Mcl-1 heterodimerization and induced apoptosis via activation of caspases -9, -3, PARP and DNA fragmentation. TW-37 administered to tumor-bearing SCID mice led to significant tumor growth inhibition (T/C), tumor growth delay (T-C) and Log10kill, when used at its maximum tolerated dose (40 mg/kg x 3 days) via tail vein. TW-37 failed to induce changes in the Bcl-2 proteins levels suggesting that assessment of baseline Bcl-2 family proteins can be used to predict response to the drug. These findings indicate activity of TW-37 across the spectrum of human B-cell tumors and support the concept of targeting the Bcl-2 system as a therapeutic strategy regardless of the stage of B-cell differentiation.","['Al-Katib, Ayad M', 'Sun, Yuan', 'Goustin, Anton Scott', 'Azmi, Asfar Sohail', 'Chen, Ben', 'Aboukameel, Amro', 'Mohammad, Ramzi M']","['Al-Katib AM', 'Sun Y', 'Goustin AS', 'Azmi AS', 'Chen B', 'Aboukameel A', 'Mohammad RM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA. alkatib@med.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090216,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (TW-37 compound)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Weight', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sulfones/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/02/18 09:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2009/02/18 09:00'],"['2008/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-2-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-2-8 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2009 Feb 16;2:8. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-2-8.,,,,"['P30 CA022453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA22453-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2651908,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This enzyme is an anti-neoplastic agent; it is used extensively in the chemotherapy of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In this study, we describe the use of in vitro directed evolution to create a new enzyme variant with improved thermal stability. A library of enzyme variants was created by a staggered extension process using the genes that code for the L-ASNases from Erwinia chrysanthemi and Erwinia carotovora. The amino acid sequences of the parental L-ASNases show 77% identity, but their half-inactivation temperature (T(m)) differs by 10 degrees C. A thermostable variant of the E. chrysamthemi enzyme was identified that contained a single point mutation (Asp133Val). The T(m) of this variant was 55.8 degrees C, whereas the wild-type enzyme has a T(m) of 46.4 degrees C. At 50 degrees C, the half-life values for the wild-type and mutant enzymes were 2.7 and 159.7 h, respectively. Analysis of the electrostatic potential of the wild-type enzyme showed that Asp133 is located at a neutral region on the enzyme surface and makes a significant and unfavourable electrostatic contribution to overall stability. Site-saturation mutagenesis at position 133 was used to further analyse the contribution of this position on thermostability. Screening of a library of random Asp133 mutants confirmed that this position is indeed involved in thermostability and showed that the Asp133Leu mutation confers optimal thermostability.","['Kotzia, Georgia A', 'Labrou, Nikolaos E']","['Kotzia GA', 'Labrou NE']","['Laboratory of Enzyme Technology, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Agricultural University of Athens, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090213,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', '*Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Hot Temperature', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Conformation', '*Protein Engineering', 'Static Electricity']",2009/02/18 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/02/18 09:00'],"['2009/02/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['EJB6910 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.06910.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2009 Mar;276(6):1750-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.06910.x.

In particular, constitutive tyrosine kinase (TK) activity of p210 BCR-ABL blocks c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation leading to 14-3-3 sigma phosphorylation at a critical residue (Ser(186)) for c-ABL binding in response to DNA damage. Moreover, it is associated with 14-3-3 sigma over-expression arising from epigenetic mechanisms (promoter hyper-acetylation). Accordingly, p210 BCR-ABL TK inhibition by the TK inhibitor Imatinib mesylate (IM) evokes multiple events, including JNK phosphorylation at Thr(183), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation at Thr(180), c-ABL de-phosphorylation at Ser residues involved in 14-3-3 binding and reduction of 14-3-3 sigma expression, that let c-ABL release from 14-3-3 sigma and nuclear import, and address BCR-ABL-expressing cells towards apoptotic death. Informational spectrum method (ISM), a virtual spectroscopy method for analysis of protein interactions based on their structure, and mathematical filtering in cross spectrum (CS) analysis identified 14-3-3 sigma/c-ABL binding sites. Further investigation on CS profiles of c-ABL- and p210 BCR-ABL-containing complexes revealed the mechanism likely involved 14-3-3 precluded phosphorylation in CML cells.","['Mancini, Manuela', 'Veljkovic, Nevena', 'Corradi, Valentina', 'Zuffa, Elisa', 'Corrado, Patrizia', 'Pagnotta, Eleonora', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Barbieri, Enza', 'Santucci, Maria Alessandra']","['Mancini M', 'Veljkovic N', 'Corradi V', 'Zuffa E', 'Corrado P', 'Pagnotta E', 'Martinelli G', 'Barbieri E', 'Santucci MA']","['Istituto di Ematologia e Oncologia Medica Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli, University of Bologna-Medical School, Bologna, Italy. mancini_manu@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090211,England,Traffic,"Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)",100939340,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*metabolism']",2009/02/18 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/02/18 09:00'],"['2009/02/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['TRA897 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.00897.x [doi]']",ppublish,Traffic. 2009 Jun;10(6):637-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.00897.x.

The mitochondrial cell death pathway commences when apoptogenic molecules present between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes are released into the cytosol by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). BCL-2 family members are the sentinels of MOMP in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway; the pro-apoptotic B cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 proteins, BCL-2 associated x protein and BCL-2 antagonist killer 1 induce MOMP whereas the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, BCL-2, BCL-x(l) and myeloid cell leukaemia 1 prevent MOMP from occurring. The release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c from mitochondria leads to formation of a multimeric complex known as the apoptosome and initiates caspase activation cascades. These pathways are important for normal cellular homeostasis and play key roles in the pathogenesis of many diseases. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of the mitochondrial death pathway and focus on a selection of diseases whose pathogenesis involves the mitochondrial death pathway and we will examine the various pharmacological approaches that target this pathway.","['Gupta, Sanjeev', 'Kass, George E N', 'Szegezdi, Eva', 'Joseph, Bertrand']","['Gupta S', 'Kass GE', 'Szegezdi E', 'Joseph B']","['NCBES, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.

As chromatin condensation, relaxation and differential gene expression are keys to correct cell cycle progression, we analyzed the dynamic association of MLL and H3K4 trimethylation at different stages of the cell cycle. Interestingly, MLL1, which is normally associated with transcriptionally active chromatins (G1 phase), dissociates from condensed mitotic chromatin and returns at the end of telophase when the nucleus starts to relax. In contrast, H3K4 trimethylation mark, which is also normally associated with euchromatins (in G1), remains associated, even with condensed chromatin, throughout the cell cycle. The global levels of MLL1 and H3K4 trimethylation are not affected during the cell cycle, and H3Ser28 phosphorylation is only observed during mitosis. Interestingly, MLL target homeobox-containing (Hox) genes (HoxA5, HoxA7 and HoxA10) are differentially expressed during the cell cycle, and the recruitment of MLL1 and H3K4 trimethylation levels are modulated in the promoter of these Hox genes as a function of their expression. In addition, down-regulation of MLL1 results in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. The fluctuation of H3K4 trimethylation marks at specific promoters, but not at the global level, indicates that H3K4 trimethylation marks that are present in the G1 phase may not be the same as the marks in other phases of the cell cycle; rather, old marks are removed and new marks are introduced. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that MLL1 and H3K4 methylation have distinct dynamics during the cell cycle and play critical roles in the differential expression of Hox genes associated with cell cycle regulation.","['Mishra, Bibhu P', 'Ansari, Khairul I', 'Mandal, Subhrangsu S']","['Mishra BP', 'Ansari KI', 'Mandal SS']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington 76019, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090207,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Cycle', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/02/18 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/02/18 09:00'],"['2009/02/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['EJB6895 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.06895.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2009 Mar;276(6):1629-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.06895.x.

A study of other differentiation signaling pathways is therefore useful to predict potential targets of anti-leukemic therapy. We demonstrated previously that the co-treatment of HL-60 cells with Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (1 ng/mL) and inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase MK886 (5 microm) potentiated both monocytic differentiation and apoptosis. In this study, we detected enhanced activation of three main types of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (p38, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase [JNK], extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]), so we assessed their role in differentiation using appropriate pharmacologic inhibitors. The inhibition of pro-apoptotic MAPKs (p38 and JNK) suppressed the effect of MK886 + TNF-alpha co-treatment. On the other hand, down-regulation of pro-survival ERK pathway led to increased differentiation. Those effects were accompanied by increased activation of caspases in cells treated by MK886 + TNF-alpha. Pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk significantly decreased both number of apoptotic and differentiated cells. The same effect was observed after inhibition of caspase 9, but not caspase 3 and 8. To conclude, we evidenced that the activation of apoptotic processes and pathways supporting apoptosis (p38 and JNK MAPKs) is required for the monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Prochazkova, Jirina', 'Stixova, Lenka', 'Soucek, Karel', 'Hofmanova, Jirina', 'Kozubik, Alois']","['Prochazkova J', 'Stixova L', 'Soucek K', 'Hofmanova J', 'Kozubik A']","['Department of Cytokinetics, Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic, vvi, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090205,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '080626SQ8C (MK-886)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2009/02/18 09:00,2009/07/03 09:00,['2009/02/18 09:00'],"['2009/02/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [medline]']","['EJH1240 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01240.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Jul;83(1):35-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01240.x.

We have previously shown that chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Japan rarely expresses the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) 1-69 gene (1 out of 43 patients, 2.3%), which is a gene most commonly expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases from western countries. In the current study, we extended the previous study by examining immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain gene expression in 80 Japanese patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in 52 Japanese patients with other leukemic chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. IGHV1-69 gene expression was again quite low in our cohort, found in only two patients: one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the other with splenic marginal zone lymphoma. The IGHV4-34 gene was most frequently expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (27.5%), whereas it was rarely found in leukemic chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (7.7%, P = 0.005). There was also a significant difference in the expression of IGLV3-21 between chronic lymphocytic leukemia and leukemic chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (29.4 vs 4.8%, P = 0.018). The IGLV3-21 gene in the majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases was associated with homologous complementarity determining region 3 sequences. Recent studies identified subsets of cases expressing almost identical B-cell receptors. We found that two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the patient with splenic marginal zone lymphoma expressed IGHV4-39/IGKV1-39 and IGHV1-69/IGKV3-20, respectively, which belong to these subsets.","['Nakahashi, Hirotaka', 'Tsukamoto, Norifumi', 'Hashimoto, Yoko', 'Koiso, Hiromi', 'Yokohama, Akihiko', 'Saitoh, Takayuki', 'Uchiumi, Hideki', 'Handa, Hiroshi', 'Murakami, Hirokazu', 'Nojima, Yoshihisa', 'Karasawa, Masamitsu']","['Nakahashi H', 'Tsukamoto N', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Koiso H', 'Yokohama A', 'Saitoh T', 'Uchiumi H', 'Handa H', 'Murakami H', 'Nojima Y', 'Karasawa M']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090210,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology/metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology/metabolism']",2009/02/18 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2009/02/18 09:00'],"['2009/02/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]']","['CAS1092 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01092.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Apr;100(4):671-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01092.x.

When STO cells were used as feeder cells, no rES cell lines were established using either intact blastocysts or inner cell masses (ICMs). On the mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) feeder, rES cell lines were efficiently (24%) derived. Addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to the cells cultured on the MEF feeders further increased the derivation efficiency (57%) of rES cells. The fact that LIF induced serine-phosphorylation of STAT3 suggested LIF-dependent maintenance of rES cells. Most of the rES cell lines expressed AP, SSEA-4, Oct4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81. Western blot or RT-PCR analysis also confirmed the expression of Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2. When induced to form EBs in vitro or injected to the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, the rES cells generated embryoid bodies (EBs) and teratomas with three germ layers expressing the marker genes including MAP2, Desmin, and GATA4, respectively. In conclusion, rabbit ES cell lines can be efficiently established using our current protocols with LIF supplement. These ES cells express pluripotent stem cell markers and retain their capability to differentiate into different tissue cells. Furthermore, rES cells depend on LIF for self-renewal, likely via the JAK-STAT pathway.","['Intawicha, Payungsuk', 'Ou, Yao-Wen', 'Lo, Neng-Wen', 'Zhang, Su-Chun', 'Chen, Yin-Zhi', 'Lin, Tzu-An', 'Su, Hong-Lin', 'Guu, Hwa-Fen', 'Chen, Ming-Jer', 'Lee, Kun-Hsiung', 'Chiu, Yung-Tsung', 'Ju, Jyh-Cherng']","['Intawicha P', 'Ou YW', 'Lo NW', 'Zhang SC', 'Chen YZ', 'Lin TA', 'Su HL', 'Guu HF', 'Chen MJ', 'Lee KH', 'Chiu YT', 'Ju JC']","['Department of Animal Science, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cloning Stem Cells,Cloning and stem cells,101125444,"['0 (Desmin)', '0 (GATA4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Stage-Specific Embryonic Antigens)', '0 (stage-specific embryonic antigen-4)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Desmin/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'GATA4 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Stage-Specific Embryonic Antigens/metabolism', 'Teratoma/*metabolism']",2009/02/18 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2009/02/18 09:00'],"['2009/02/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1089/clo.2008.0040 [doi]', '10.1089/clo.2008.0040 [pii]']",ppublish,Cloning Stem Cells. 2009 Mar;11(1):27-38. doi: 10.1089/clo.2008.0040.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 binds directly to several CBP/p300 domains (TAZ1, TAZ2, NCBD, and KIX). Here we map the interaction between the p53 TAD and the CBP KIX domain using isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy. KIX is a structural domain in CBP/p300 that can simultaneously bind two polypeptide ligands, such as the activation domain of MLL and the kinase-inducible activation domain (pKID) of CREB, using distinct interaction surfaces. The p53 TAD consists of two subdomains (AD1 and AD2); peptides corresponding to the isolated AD1 and AD2 subdomains interact with KIX with relatively low affinity, but a longer peptide containing both subdomains binds KIX tightly. In the context of the full-length p53 TAD, AD1 and AD2 bind synergistically to KIX. Mapping of the chemical shift perturbations onto the structure of KIX shows that isolated AD1 and AD2 peptides bind to both the MLL and pKID sites. Spin-labeling experiments show that the complex of the full-length p53 TAD with KIX is disordered, with the AD1 and AD2 subdomains each interacting with both the MLL and pKID binding surfaces. Phosphorylation of the p53 TAD at Thr18 or Ser20 increases the KIX binding affinity. The affinity is further enhanced by simultaneous phosphorylation of Thr18 and Ser20, and the specificity of the interaction is increased. The p53 TAD simultaneously occupies the two distinct sites that have been identified on the CBP KIX domain and efficiently competes for these sites with other known KIX-binding transcription factors.","['Lee, Chul Won', 'Arai, Munehito', 'Martinez-Yamout, Maria A', 'Dyson, H Jane', 'Wright, Peter E']","['Lee CW', 'Arai M', 'Martinez-Yamout MA', 'Dyson HJ', 'Wright PE']","['Department of Molecular Biology and The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/physiology', 'Binding, Competitive/physiology', 'CREB-Binding Protein/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Calorimetry', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2009/02/18 09:00,2009/12/18 06:00,['2009/02/18 09:00'],"['2009/02/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1021/bi802055v [doi]', '10.1021/bi802055v [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2009 Mar 17;48(10):2115-24. doi: 10.1021/bi802055v.,,,,"['R01 CA096865/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096865-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA96865/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2765525,,['NIHMS95842'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty primary skin-derived precursor cell (SKP) cultures were established from both male and female donors (age 29-65 years) and eight of them were randomly selected for in-depth characterization. Effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), epidermal growth factor (EGF), leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF) and dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (db-cAMP) on S-MSC proliferation were investigated. Primary SKP cultures were >95% homogenous for CD90, CD73, and CD105 marker expression enabling to classify these cells as S-MSC. FGF-2 dose-dependent stimulation was observed in low serum medium only, whereas EGF neither stimulated S-MSC proliferation nor potentates the effect of FGF-2. Pronounced donor to donor differences among S-MSC cultures were observed in 3-day proliferation assay. This study demonstrates that homogenous S-MSC populations can be reproducibly isolated from individual donors of different age. Optimal cell culture conditions for in vitro propagation of S-MSC are B27 supplemented or low serum media with FGF-2 (4 ng/ml).

Hut-78, a truncated form of p100, constitutively generates p52 and contributes to the development of T-cell lymphomas but the molecular mechanism underlying this oncogenic potential remains unclear. We show here that MMP9 gene expression is induced through the alternative NF-kappaB-activating pathway in fibroblasts and also on Hut-78 or p52 overexpression in fibroblasts as well as in lymphoma cells. p52 is critical for Hut-78-mediated MMP9 gene induction as a Hut-78 mutant as well as other truncated NF-kappaB2 proteins that are not processed into p52 failed to induce the expression of this metalloproteinase. Conversely, MMP9 gene expression is impaired in p52-depleted HUT-78 cells. Interestingly, MLL1 and MLL2 H3K4 methyltransferase complexes are tethered by p52 on the MMP9 but not on the IkappaBalpha promoter, and the H3K4 trimethyltransferase activity recruited on the MMP9 promoter is impaired in p52-depleted HUT-78 cells. Moreover, MLL1 and MLL2 are associated with Hut-78 in a native chromatin-enriched extract. Thus, we identified a molecular mechanism by which the recruitment of a H3K4 histone methyltransferase complex on the promoter of a NF-kappaB-dependent gene induces its expression and potentially the invasive potential of lymphoma cells harbouring constitutive activity of the alternative NF-kappaB-activating pathway.","['Robert, I', 'Aussems, M', 'Keutgens, A', 'Zhang, X', 'Hennuy, B', 'Viatour, P', 'Vanstraelen, G', 'Merville, M-P', 'Chapelle, J-P', 'de Leval, L', 'Lambert, F', 'Dejardin, E', 'Gothot, A', 'Chariot, A']","['Robert I', 'Aussems M', 'Keutgens A', 'Zhang X', 'Hennuy B', 'Viatour P', 'Vanstraelen G', 'Merville MP', 'Chapelle JP', 'de Leval L', 'Lambert F', 'Dejardin E', 'Gothot A', 'Chariot A']","['Interdisciplinary Cluster for Applied Genoproteomics (GIGA-R), CHU, Sart-Tilman, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090216,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism/physiology', 'Mutant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism/physiology', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/pharmacology', 'Protein Methyltransferases/metabolism/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2009/02/17 09:00,2009/04/22 09:00,['2009/02/17 09:00'],"['2009/02/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [medline]']","['onc20096 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.6 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2009 Apr 2;28(13):1626-38. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.6.

Recently, we showed that PAR bZIP proteins were able to regulate the BH3-only gene bcl-gS in tumor cells. Here, we have extended the role of these transcription factors in the control of apoptosis executors by analyzing the expression of BH3-only genes in PAR bZIP triple knockout mouse fibroblasts. We found that bik was the only BH3-only gene downregulated in knockout cells. Consistently, transfection of TEF or DBP induces the expression of endogenous bik, regardless of the presence of active p53. Moreover, both promoter-reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that PAR bZIP proteins activate the bik promoter directly. Treatment with different stress stimuli reveals a higher survival of knockout fibroblasts compared with that of wild-type cells, especially after incubation with H(2)O(2), which suggest that PAR bZIP proteins participate in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the apoptotic cell death promoted by treatment with H(2)O(2) can be impaired by reducing the expression of Bik in wild-type fibroblasts or enhanced by the overexpression of Bik in knockout cells. These findings reveal a novel transcriptional pathway relevant in transducing the apoptotic response to oxidative stress.","['Ritchie, A', 'Gutierrez, O', 'Fernandez-Luna, J L']","['Ritchie A', 'Gutierrez O', 'Fernandez-Luna JL']","['Unidad de Genetica Molecular, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Servicio Cantabro de Salud, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090213,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Bik protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dbp protein, mouse)', '0 (Hlf protein, mouse)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tef protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/02/17 09:00,2009/07/18 09:00,['2009/02/17 09:00'],"['2009/02/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [medline]']","['cdd200913 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2009.13 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2009 Jun;16(6):838-46. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2009.13.

The intracellular signal transduction pathway of MCP-1 production induced by CysLT in human monocytes/macrophages is unclear. METHODS: The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), including extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK by phosphorylation, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) by leukotriene (LT) D(4) and LTC(4) was determined in THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, and peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes/macrophages. We examined the inhibitory effects of inhibitors of ERK1/2, JNK, p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB and pranlukast as a CysLT1 receptor antagonist on induction of MCP-1 production by LTD(4) and LTC(4). RESULTS: LTD(4) and LTC(4) induced significant phosphorylations of ERK1/2 and JNK, but not p38 MAPK, in THP-1 cells and peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes/macrophages. Pretreatment with the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated MCP-1 production by CysLTs. NF-kappaB activation was induced by addition of LTD(4) and LTC(4). Pretreatment with the NF-kappaB inhibitors caffeic acid phenylethyl ester and MG-132 inhibited MCP-1 production by CysLTs. Pranlukast inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK, NF-kappaB activation, and the MCP-1 production induced by CysLTs. CONCLUSION: CysLTs induce MCP-1 and this induction is mediated by ERK1/2 and JNK in MAPK, and NF-kappaB pathways via the CysLT1 receptor, for the most part, in human monocytes/macrophages.","['Hashimoto, Kunio', 'Ichiyama, Takashi', 'Hasegawa, Masanari', 'Hasegawa, Shunji', 'Matsubara, Tomoyo', 'Furukawa, Susumu']","['Hashimoto K', 'Ichiyama T', 'Hasegawa M', 'Hasegawa S', 'Matsubara T', 'Furukawa S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090212,Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '73836-78-9 (Leukotriene D4)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'LRF7RW46ID (leukotriene D4 receptor)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL2/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukotriene C4/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Leukotriene D4/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'NF-kappa B/agonists/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Leukotriene/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",2009/02/17 09:00,2009/07/22 09:00,['2009/02/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/22 09:00 [medline]']","['000199724 [pii]', '10.1159/000199724 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2009;149(3):275-82. doi: 10.1159/000199724.

In peripheral T-cells NFATc1 and -c2 are predominantly expressed. Because of different promoter and poly(A) site usage as well as alternative splicing events, NFATc1 is synthesized in multiple isoforms. The highly inducible NFATc1/A contains a relatively short C terminus, whereas the longer, constitutively expressed isoform NFATc1/C spans an extra C-terminal peptide of 246 amino acids. Interestingly, this NFATc1/C-specific terminus can be highly sumoylated. Upon sumoylation, NFATc1/C, but not the unsumoylated NFATc1/A, translocates to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. This leads to interaction with histone deacetylases followed by deacetylation of histones, which in turn induces transcriptionally inactive chromatin. As a consequence, expression of the NFATc1 target gene interleukin-2 is suppressed. These findings demonstrate that the modification by SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) converts NFATc1 from an activator to a site-specific transcriptional repressor, revealing a novel regulatory mechanism for NFATc1 function.","['Nayak, Arnab', 'Glockner-Pagel, Judith', 'Vaeth, Martin', 'Schumann, Julia E', 'Buttmann, Mathias', 'Bopp, Tobias', 'Schmitt, Edgar', 'Serfling, Edgar', 'Berberich-Siebelt, Friederike']","['Nayak A', 'Glockner-Pagel J', 'Vaeth M', 'Schumann JE', 'Buttmann M', 'Bopp T', 'Schmitt E', 'Serfling E', 'Berberich-Siebelt F']","['Departments of Molecular Pathology and Neurology, Julius Maximilians-University, 97080 Wuerzburg and Institute of Immunology, Johannes Gutenberg-University, 55131 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090214,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/genetics/metabolism']",2009/02/17 09:00,2009/06/19 09:00,['2009/02/17 09:00'],"['2009/02/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)39934-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M900465200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Apr 17;284(16):10935-46. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M900465200.

Previously, we reported that the murine homologues (Cdx1, Cdx2, and Cdx4) affect formation and differentiation of embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells. Consistent with the notion that embryonic pathways can reactivate during adult oncogenesis, recent studies suggest involvement of CDX2 in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we study CDX2 in healthy and leukemic human lymphoid cells, and show that a majority of leukemic samples display various degrees of aberrant CDX2 expression. Analysis of a cohort of 37 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients treated in our hospital reveals that high CDX2 expression levels at diagnosis correlate with persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) during the course of treatment. Thus, CDX2 expression levels may serve as a marker for adverse prognosis in pediatric ALL.","['Riedt, Tamara', 'Ebinger, Martin', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Tomiuk, Jurgen', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Grunebach, Frank', 'Lengerke, Claudia']","['Riedt T', 'Ebinger M', 'Salih HR', 'Tomiuk J', 'Handgretinger R', 'Kanz L', 'Grunebach F', 'Lengerke C']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Tuebingen Medical Center II, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090213,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CDX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (CDX2 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'CDX2 Transcription Factor', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",2009/02/17 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/02/17 09:00'],"['2009/02/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39287-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-12-196634 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 23;113(17):4049-51. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-12-196634.

Using 2 independent analyses, we identified multiple pathways that are aberrantly regulated in leukemic stem cells compared with normal HSC. Several pathways, including Wnt signaling, MAP Kinase signaling, and Adherens Junction, are well known for their role in cancer development and stem cell biology. Other pathways have not been previously implicated in the regulation of cancer stem cell functions, including Ribosome and T Cell Receptor Signaling pathway.

C/EBP beta is critical for adipogenesis; however, its role in osteoblastogenesis is unclear, and its function in the postnatal skeleton is not known. To study C/EBP beta in osteoblasts in vivo, we created transgenic mice expressing full length C/EBP beta under the control of a 3.8 kb fragment of the human osteocalcin promoter. Two transgenic lines were established in a friend leukemia virus strain B genetic background, and compared with wild type littermate controls. Both C/EBP beta transgenic lines exhibited osteopenia, with a 30% decrease in bone volume, due to a decrease in trabecular number. The number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts per bone perimeter was not changed. Bone marrow stromal cells from C/EBP beta transgenics showed reduced mineralization, and reduced alkaline phosphatase mRNA levels. Calvarial osteoblasts from C/EBP beta transgenics displayed reduced alkaline phosphatase activity. To determine the consequences of the Cebpb deletion in vivo, the phenotype of Cebpb null mice was compared with that of wild type controls of identical genetic composition. Cebpb null mice exhibited reduced weight, body fat, and bone mineral density, and decreased bone volume, due to a decrease in trabecular number. The number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts per bone perimeter was not changed. C/EBP beta downregulation by RNA interference in calvarial osteoblasts had no effect on osteoblast differentiation/function. The phenotype of the Cebpb inactivation may be secondary to systemic indirect effects, and to direct effects of C/EBP beta in osteoblasts. In conclusion, C/EBP beta plays a role in mesenchymal cell differentiation and its misexpression in vivo causes osteopenia.","['Zanotti, Stefano', 'Stadmeyer, Lisa', 'Smerdel-Ramoya, Anna', 'Durant, Deena', 'Canalis, Ernesto']","['Zanotti S', 'Stadmeyer L', 'Smerdel-Ramoya A', 'Durant D', 'Canalis E']","['Department of Research, Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, 114 Woodland Street, Hartford, Connecticut 06105-1299, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090213,England,J Endocrinol,The Journal of endocrinology,0375363,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Density/genetics', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/*genetics/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology/physiology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/*genetics/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Female', 'Femur/pathology', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Osteoblasts/pathology/physiology']",2009/02/17 09:00,2009/07/23 09:00,['2009/02/17 09:00'],"['2009/02/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [medline]']","['JOE-08-0514 [pii]', '10.1677/JOE-08-0514 [doi]']",ppublish,J Endocrinol. 2009 May;201(2):263-74. doi: 10.1677/JOE-08-0514.

However, most advanced-phase CML and Ph+ ALL patients relapse on Imatinib therapy. Several mechanisms of refractoriness have been reported, including the activation of the Src-family kinases (SFK). Here, we investigated the biological effect of the new specific dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor AZD0530 on Ph+ leukaemic cells. METHODS: Cell lines used included BV173 (CML in myeloid blast crisis), SEM t(4;11), Ba/F3 (IL-3 dependent murine pro B), p185Bcr-Abl infected Ba/F3 cells, p185Bcr-Abl mutant infected Ba/F3 cells, SupB15 (Ph+ ALL) and Imatinib resistant SupB15 (RTSupB15) (Ph+ ALL) cells. Cells were exposed to AZD0530 and Imatinib. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, survival and signalling pathways were assessed by dye exclusion, flow cytometry and Western blotting respectively. RESULTS: AZD0530 specifically inhibited the growth of, and induced apoptosis in CML and Ph+ ALL cells in a dose dependent manner, but showed only marginal effects on Ph- ALL cells. Resistance to Imatinib due to the mutation Y253F in p185Bcr-Abl was overcome by AZD0530. Combination of AZD0530 and Imatinib showed an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of CML BV173 cells but not on Ph+ ALL SupB15 cells. An ongoing transphosphorylation was demonstrated between SFKs and Bcr-Abl. AZD0530 significantly down-regulated the activation of survival signalling pathways in Ph+ cells, resistant or sensitive to Imatinib, with the exception of the RTSupB15. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that AZD0530 targets both Src and Bcr-Abl kinase activity and reduces the leukaemic maintenance by Bcr-Abl.","['Gwanmesia, Patricia Mambou', 'Romanski, Annette', 'Schwarz, Kerstin', 'Bacic, Biserka', 'Ruthardt, Martin', 'Ottmann, Oliver G']","['Gwanmesia PM', 'Romanski A', 'Schwarz K', 'Bacic B', 'Ruthardt M', 'Ottmann OG']","['Med, Klinik II/Abt, Hamatologie, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.

This is an important finding as it highlights the possibility that CML may present as a sole extramedullary form, and illustrates potential treatment by tyrosine kinase inhibitor.","['Kuan, Jew-Win', 'Pathmanathan, Rajadurai', 'Chang, Kian-Meng', 'Tan, Sen-Moi']","['Kuan JW', 'Pathmanathan R', 'Chang KM', 'Tan SM']","['Hematology Department, Ampang Hospital, Jalan Mewah Utara, Pandan Mewah, 68000 Ampang, Selangor, Malaysia. kuanjewwin@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090212,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics']",2009/02/14 09:00,2009/09/04 06:00,['2009/02/14 09:00'],"['2008/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00023-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Nov;33(11):1574-7. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.01.016.

Amifostine has rarely been used in the childhood cancers as a multisystemic protective agent for minimizing these side effects. PROCEDURE: In this study, the effectiveness of amifostine in combination with chemotherapy for childhood cancer treatment has been researched. Of 11 subjects (2.5 months-17 years) 4 subjects had leukemia, 4 had solid tumor, and 3 had lymphoma. For these 11 subjects, 29 chemotherapy courses were given in combination with amifostine, and 20 without amifostine. Their hematological, gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicity were evaluated according to the WHO toxicity criteria. Amifostine was given intravenously in a dose of 740 mg/m(2), one to three consecutive days depending on the chemotherapy regimen. RESULTS: The hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet levels of the two groups were not statistically different. However, when comparing the courses of the patients receiving the same medications at the same doses, in the group with amifostine, mean erythrocyte transfusion requirement was significantly reduced (P = 0.025). In 31% of the courses with amifostine and 50% of the courses without amifostine, febrile neutropenia developed. Gastrointestinal system and hepatic toxicity was significantly reduced in the courses with amifostine with respect to those without it (P = 0.001). Vomiting, hypotension and nausea were the only side effects related to amifostine. CONCLUSION: Use of amifostine during the treatment of childhood cancers with intensive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy significantly reduced the erythrocyte transfusion requirements of the patients as well as gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicity.","['Cetingul, Nazan', 'Midyat, Levent', 'Kantar, Mehmet', 'Demirag, Bengu', 'Aksoylar, Serap', 'Kansoy, Savas']","['Cetingul N', 'Midyat L', 'Kantar M', 'Demirag B', 'Aksoylar S', 'Kansoy S']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amifostine/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytoprotection/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/02/14 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2009/02/14 09:00'],"['2009/02/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21959 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jul;52(7):829-33. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21959.,,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

To further enforces whether an increased leukocyte count is associated with thrombosis and whether this effect can be modulated by cytoreductive therapy, we analyzed the clinical course of 187 patients with Polycythemia Vera (PV) and Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) followed at two Italian Institutions over a period of 7 years. The association was measured at diagnosis or before thrombotic events: a multivariable analysis was carried out using data at baseline and time-dependent covariates. We found that white blood cells (WBC) count above 9.5 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis (baseline analysis) was associated with thrombosis during the follow-up (Hazard Ratio [HR] of 1.8, p 0.03). At the time-dependent analysis, therapy with hydroxyurea (HU), lowering by 35% the baseline WBC level, reduced such strength of association giving a HR of 1.3 (p value non significant). We found a trend between WBC level and thrombosis in untreated low-risk patients (RR of 1.9, 95% CI 0.9 to 3.1); in high-risk patients treated with HU this correlation was clearly lost (RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.7). Finally, we could not identify the presence of JAK2 (V617F) as a risk factor for thrombosis.

Each blood sample was taken 24 h after and immediately prior to taking a 400 mg oral dose of imatinib. Drug levels were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The mean plasma imatinib levels in the imatinib non-responders were significantly lower than those in the imatinib responders (0.70 vs. 2.34 microM, respectively; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of imatinib were correlated with response to the therapy, so routine monitoring of the therapeutic levels of the drug should be carried out specifically in treatment-resistant cases for determining dose escalation.","['Singh, N', 'Kumar, L', 'Meena, R', 'Velpandian, T']","['Singh N', 'Kumar L', 'Meena R', 'Velpandian T']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 110029, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20090212,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*blood', 'Benzamides', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', '*Drug Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*blood', 'Pyrimidines/*blood', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/02/14 09:00,2009/08/19 09:00,['2009/02/14 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-009-0621-z [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2009 Jun;65(6):545-9. doi: 10.1007/s00228-009-0621-z.

Defining these pathways and how they contribute to the anti-retroviral immune responses would assist in the development of more effective vaccines for retroviral pathogens such as HIV. We have investigated the roles played by CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs) and by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways in the generation of an anti-retroviral immune response against a mouse retroviral pathogen, Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MLV). Specific deletion of DCs during F-MLV infection caused a significant increase in viral titers at 14 days post-infection, indicating the importance of DCs in immune control of the infection. Similarly, Myd88 knockout mice failed to control F-MLV, and sustained high viral titers (10(7) foci/spleen) for several months after infection. Strikingly, both DC-depleted mice and Myd88 knockout mice exhibited only a partial reduction of CD8(+) T cell responses, while the IgG antibody response to F-MLV was completely lost. Furthermore, passive transfer of immune serum from wild-type mice to Myd88 knockout mice rescued control of F-MLV. These results identify TLR signaling and CD11c(+) DCs as playing critical roles in the humoral response to retroviruses.","['Browne, Edward P', 'Littman, Dan R']","['Browne EP', 'Littman DR']","['The Kimmel Center for Biology and Medicine at the Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090213,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Myd88 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood/immunology', 'CD11c Antigen/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology/physiology', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Toll-Like Receptors/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/virology', 'Virus Replication']",2009/02/14 09:00,2009/08/11 09:00,['2009/02/14 09:00'],"['2008/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/11 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1000298 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2009 Feb;5(2):e1000298. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000298.

We report here that increased telomerase activity results in increased telomere length that eventually reaches a plateau, accompanied by the generation of telomere length heterogeneity and the accumulation of extrachromosomal telomeric repeat DNA, principally in the form of telomeric circles (t-circles). Telomeric DNA was observed in promyelocytic leukemia bodies, but no intertelomeric copying or telomere exchange events were identified, and there was no increase in telomere dysfunction-induced foci. These data indicate that human cells possess a mechanism to negatively regulate telomere length by trimming telomeric DNA from the chromosome ends, most likely by t-loop resolution to form t-circles. Additionally, these results indicate that some phenotypic characteristics attributed to alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) result from increased mean telomere length, rather than from the ALT mechanism itself.","['Pickett, Hilda A', 'Cesare, Anthony J', 'Johnston, Rebecca L', 'Neumann, Axel A', 'Reddel, Roger R']","['Pickett HA', 'Cesare AJ', 'Johnston RL', 'Neumann AA', 'Reddel RR']","[""Cancer Research Group, Children's Medical Research Institute, Westmead, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090212,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA, Circular)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Circular/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/*chemistry/*metabolism']",2009/02/14 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/02/14 09:00'],"['2008/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['emboj200942 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2009.42 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2009 Apr 8;28(7):799-809. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2009.42.

IL-11 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), two IL-6 family cytokines, are produced by the endometrium and are absolutely required for implantation in mice. We examined the effect of IL-11 and LIF on human endometrial epithelial cell adhesion. Both cytokines increased adhesion of primary human endometrial epithelial cells to fibronectin and collagen IV. IL-11 stimulated, whereas LIF had no effect on the adhesion of trophoblast to endometrial epithelial cells. Focused oligogene arrays were used to identify extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules mRNAs regulated by endometrial epithelial cells. We demonstrated by real-time RT-PCR and antibody arrays that both cytokines increased integrin-alpha2 mRNA and protein by endometrial epithelial cells. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-3 inhibition reduced IL-11- and LIF-mediated epithelial cell adhesion to fibronectin, suggesting both cytokines regulated adhesion via phosphorylation of STAT3. Addition of either IL-11 neutralizing antibody and IL-11 or LIF and LIF antagonist to endometrial epithelial cells abolished cytokine induced phosphorylated STAT3. LIF but not IL-11 induced adhesion to collagen IV was reduced by an integrin-alpha2beta1 neutralizing antibody. This study demonstrated that IL-11 and LIF regulated endometrial epithelial cell adhesion, suggesting that targeting IL-11 and LIF may be useful in regulating fertility by either enhancing or blocking implantation.","['Marwood, M', 'Visser, K', 'Salamonsen, L A', 'Dimitriadis, E']","['Marwood M', 'Visser K', 'Salamonsen LA', 'Dimitriadis E']","[""Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research, 246 Clayton Road, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090212,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Collagen Type IV)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha2)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen Type IV/metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Endometrium/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fertility/*physiology', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha2/metabolism', 'Interleukin-11/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/cytology/metabolism']",2009/02/14 09:00,2009/06/19 09:00,['2009/02/14 09:00'],"['2009/02/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [medline]']","['en.2008-1538 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2008-1538 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2009 Jun;150(6):2915-23. doi: 10.1210/en.2008-1538.

METHODS: Population controls were frequency matched with cases on age and gender. Data were collected by standardised telephone interview with the mothers. The latter were asked to report the proximity of their homes to petrol stations, automotive repair garages and other businesses from the conception of the index child to the diagnosis (for cases) or interview (for controls). Odds ratios were estimated using unconditional regression models adjusted for age, gender, number of children under 15 years of age in the household, degree of urbanisation and type of housing. RESULTS: 765 cases of acute leukaemia and 1681 controls were included. Acute leukaemia was significantly associated with residence next to petrol stations or automotive repair garages (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.2) and next to a petrol station (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.0). The OR showed no tendency to increase with duration of exposure. The results were not modified by adjustment for potential confounding factors including urban/rural status and type of housing. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the findings of our previous study and suggest that living next to a petrol station may be associated with acute childhood leukaemia. The results also suggest that the role of low-level exposure to benzene in acute childhood leukaemia deserves further evaluation.","['Brosselin, P', 'Rudant, J', 'Orsi, L', 'Leverger, G', 'Baruchel, A', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Nelken, B', 'Robert, A', 'Michel, G', 'Margueritte, G', 'Perel, Y', 'Mechinaud, F', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Hemon, D', 'Clavel, J']","['Brosselin P', 'Rudant J', 'Orsi L', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A', 'Bertrand Y', 'Nelken B', 'Robert A', 'Michel G', 'Margueritte G', 'Perel Y', 'Mechinaud F', 'Bordigoni P', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['INSERM U754, 16, Avenue Paul Vaillant Couturier, F-94807 Villejuif Cedex, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090212,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Gasoline)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Air Pollutants/adverse effects', 'Benzene/adverse effects', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Educational Status', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Environmental Monitoring/methods', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Gasoline/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Sex Distribution', 'Social Class']",2009/02/14 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/02/14 09:00'],"['2009/02/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['oem.2008.042432 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2008.042432 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2009 Sep;66(9):598-606. doi: 10.1136/oem.2008.042432.

The quantitative amplification of the standards with MT4 (HTLV-1) and C19 (HTLV-2) cell lines and a molecular clone of HTLV-3 was linear, with the simplex and multiplex methods having similar efficiencies. A maximum difference of 0.9 (mean, 0.4; range, 0.0 to 0.9) was found between threshold cycle values in single and multiplex reactions. The efficiency with each probe in the multiplex reaction was close to 100%, indicating strong linear amplification. The albumin gene was used to standardize the copy number. Comparable results for the detection and quantification of HTLV-1 were obtained with our new methods and with other real-time PCR methods described previously. With our new multiplex assay, however, we were able to detect and quantify HTLV-2 and -3 and STLV-1 and -3 in clinical specimens, with an excellent dynamic range of 10(6) to 10(0) copies per assay, which the other assays could not do. Thus, it will be possible to determine a wide range of HTLV types in both standard and clinical samples, with a detection of 1 to 10 HTLV copies in samples containing at least 100 cells. Furthermore, our system can provide evidence for multiple infections with the three HTLV types, with separate proviral load results. Our new method also could be used for epidemiological studies in Africa and in countries where HTLVs and STLVs are endemic.","['Besson, Guillaume', 'Kazanji, Mirdad']","['Besson G', 'Kazanji M']","['Unite de Retrovirologie, Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville, Franceville, Gabon.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090211,United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)'],IM,"['Africa', 'Blood/virology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*diagnosis/virology', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/standards', 'Pregnancy', 'Primate T-lymphotropic virus 3/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*diagnosis/virology']",2009/02/14 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2009/02/14 09:00'],"['2009/02/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]']","['JCM.02006-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JCM.02006-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 2009 Apr;47(4):1129-35. doi: 10.1128/JCM.02006-08.

Hospital-based series indicate an excess risk of progression from MBL to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In this prospective cohort study, we tested the hypothesis that CLL is always preceded by MBL. METHODS: Among 77,469 healthy adults who were enrolled in the nationwide, population-based Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, we identified 45 subjects in whom CLL was subsequently diagnosed (up to 6.4 years later) through the collection of a peripheral-blood sample. Using six-color flow cytometry (with antibodies CD45, CD19, CD5, CD10, kappa, and lambda) and immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay, we determined the association between MBL and subsequent CLL and characterized the immunoglobulin gene repertoire of the prediagnostic B-cell clones. RESULTS: On the basis of either flow-cytometric or molecular analysis, 44 of 45 patients with CLL (98%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 88 to 100) had a prediagnostic B-cell clone; in 41 patients (91%; 95% CI, 79 to 98), the presence of the B-cell clone was confirmed by both methods. The presence of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (IGHV) genes was determined in 35 of 45 prediagnostic clones (78%). Of these clones, 16 (46%) were IGHV3 subgroup genes (including 6 [17%] IGHV3-23 genes) and 9 (26%) were IGHV4 subgroup genes (including 4 [11%] IGHV4-34 genes). Furthermore, 27 of 35 of the IGHV sequences (77%) had mutations, with similar distributions after stratification either below or above the median time between the collection of the prediagnostic blood sample and the subsequent CLL diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In peripheral blood obtained up to 77 months before a CLL diagnosis, prediagnostic B-cell clones were present in 44 of 45 patients with CLL.","['Landgren, Ola', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Ma, Wanlong', 'Abbasi, Fatima', 'Hayes, Richard B', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Marti, Gerald E', 'Caporaso, Neil E']","['Landgren O', 'Albitar M', 'Ma W', 'Abbasi F', 'Hayes RB', 'Ghia P', 'Marti GE', 'Caporaso NE']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. landgreo@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/02/14 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2009/02/14 09:00'],"['2009/02/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']","['360/7/659 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa0806122 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2009 Feb 12;360(7):659-67. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0806122.,"['N Engl J Med. 2009 Feb 12;360(7):722-3.

This study was to investigate the biomolecular mechanisms of cyclosporine A (CsA), tetrandrine (Tet) and their combination on multidrug resistance in cell line K562/A02. METHODS: K562/A02 cells were treated with CsA and (or) Tet. The intracellular daunorubicin (DNR) concentration and the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were observed by flow cytometry assay. The mRNA expression of mudtiding resistance gene (mdr1) was measured by fluorescent semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: CsA and Tet (alone or combination) elevated the intracellular DNR concentration in K562/A02 cells (the fluorescence intensity of intracellular DNR in K562/A02 cells was 60%, 65% and 98% respectively of that in K562 cells). The fluorescence intensity of P-gp in K562 and K562/A02 cells was 0.18% and 96.51%. The P-gp expression was down-regulated after treated with CsA, Tet and both (75.32%, 76.86% and 48.61%); mdr1 mRNA was also down-regulated, and the effect of their combination was more obvious. CONCLUSION: MDR can be partially reversed by CsA or Tet, the combination of both drugs shows a great synergistic reversal effect.","['Chen, Bao-An', 'Guo, Jing-Jing', 'Cheng, Jian']","['Chen BA', 'Guo JJ', 'Cheng J']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing. cba8888@hotmail.com']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '29EX23D5AJ (tetrandrine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/02/14 09:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2009/02/14 09:00'],"['2009/02/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2008 Nov;28(11):1010-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: data related to new cancer cases were reviewed from January, 1995 to December, 2004, according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancers. Frequency was analyzed according age and neoplasm group. The time elapsed until confirm a diagnosis was analyzed for each tumor class. RESULTS: 61 cases were analyzed, 42 in a group under 14-year-old, and 19 in the group of 14-19-year-old. Three most common neoplasms found in children under 14-year-old were: central nervous system tumors (29.5%), leukemia (23%), and bone tumors (14.8%); and in the other group were: central nervous system tumors (26.3%), lymphomas (21.1%), and bone tumors (15.8%). The time elapsed from the onset of signs and symptoms until the histopathology diagnosis for leukemia was less than a month in 71.4% of the population under study, while for solid tumors was one to six months in 44.6% of the population study.

Local therapy such as irradiation or extensive surgical resection of the mass is ineffective and unnecessary. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a 20-year period we observed two girls with ovarian relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in over 300 treated children for ALL. Pre-B ALL was diagnosed in a girl at the age of three. Treatment was initiated according to the CoALL 82-protocol. At the age of 11, the girl presented with a huge abdominal mass. Chemotherapy and low-dose radiotherapy succeeded in shrinking the tumour mass, making it operable. A salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. In the second case, a 14-year-old girl in whom pre-B ALL was diagnosed was treated according to the protocol CoALL 06-97. After having achieved complete haematological remission in the bone marrow, she stayed in remission for 18 months. Subsequently, she developed a painless abdominal tumour. Laparoscopic lymph node staging was performed and biopsies were taken. Chemotherapy was initiated according to the BFM protocol for ALL recurrence. Extensive surgical resection of the leukaemic mass, as well as additional radiation was avoided. CONCLUSION: Because we experienced favourable results with laparoscopic biopsy in our patients, we are of the opinion that laparoscopy-assisted biopsies are well suited for the management of intra-abdominal tumours in systemic malignant disease.","['Turial, S', 'Karabul, N', 'Gutjahr, P', 'Engel, V', 'Bierschock, S', 'Schier, F']","['Turial S', 'Karabul N', 'Gutjahr P', 'Engel V', 'Bierschock S', 'Schier F']","['Department of Paediatric Surgery, University Medical Centre, Mainz, Germany. turial@ukmainz.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090211,United States,Eur J Pediatr Surg,European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

Usually the subtypes are defined using complementary laboratory methods, such as multiparameter flow cytometry, cytogenetics in combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization, and molecular methods such as the polymerase chain reaction. The genetic variations of the different subtypes lead to distinct changes also in gene expression, which is comprehensively analysed by DNA microarrays. Thus, first gene expression profiling studies showed that analysis with whole-genome DNA microarrays leads to a prediction accuracy of 95.6% with respect to the classical methods, and even allowed a further distinction of subtypes. It is expected that diagnostic strategies can be optimized with this new technology and that the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of leukemias will be significantly improved. This could also lead to the identification of new targets for future drugs.","['Haferlach, Torsten', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Haferlach, Claudia']","['Haferlach T', 'Bacher U', 'Kohlmann A', 'Haferlach C']","['MLL Munchner Leukamielabor GmbH, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Biotechnology/*instrumentation/methods/trends', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/genetics', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling/instrumentation/*methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/instrumentation/*methods/trends']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/03/20 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-59745-372-1_2 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2009;509:15-33. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-372-1_2.,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a higher-than-expected incidence of co-occurrence of these neoplastic disorders. The cause for this association remains speculative. Two epidemiological studies have shown that the observed-to-expected ratio for occurrence of RCC in NHL patients were 1.86 to 2.67. We herein describe five patients with both RCC and lymphoid malignancies, and reviewed possible explanations for the association. In three of the five patients, RCC was diagnosed during lymphoproliferative disease work-up, and remaining two cases had been diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia 1 and 5 years prior to RCC.

As a result, we observed i) a decreased expression of Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1), an essential cofactor of GATA-1 transcription factor, ii) a downregulation of GATA-1 by proteasomal degradation and iii) a reduced acetylation level of GATA-1 in HM-induced K562 cells after TNF treatment. As a result, these modifications i) decreased the level of GATA-1/FOG-1 complex, ii) unsettled the GATA-1/GATA-2 balance, iii) reduced GATA-1 transcriptional activity and iv) inhibited erythroid marker gene expression (glycophorin A, erythropoietin receptor, gamma-globin) independently of the cell line or the inducer used.

Since immunotherapy would expectedly be most effective in animals in which the tumor mass had been reduced by other therapeutic means, we attempted to develop a combined therapeutic system for suppressing tumor growth. In the present study, mice inoculated with the aggressive 12B1 cells were treated with imatinib mesylate (IM), mouse interferon alpha (IFNalpha) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) in combination with genetically modified tumor cells engineered to produce various cytokines. These cell vaccines had been derived from B210 cells. Therapy with IM or IFNalpha alone or cell immunotherapy alone resulted in partial suppression of tumor growth. Of the different therapeutic regimens tested, a combination of repeated doses of IM, IFNalpha and cell vaccines with one relatively high dose of Cy (200 mg/kg) was the most effective, resulting in tumor-free survival of a large portion of mice. The spleens, livers and bone marrows of the successfully treated animals were tested for the presence of bcr-abl-positive cells by means of RT-PCR technique.

No increase of proinflammatory cytokine levels of TNF-alpha].,30-6,,"AIM: Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) serum levels may increase due to intensive conditioning regimes with high-dose-chemotherapy and total body irradiation (TBI) before stem cell transplantation. This increases the risk for developing acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) after stem cell transplantation. In this prospective study we investigated the influence of radioimmunotherapy with 188Re-CD-66-mAb on changes on TNF-alpha serum levels. PATIENTS, METHODS: In 18 patients we measured TNF-alpha before and up to 96 hours after radioimmunotherapy, in 2 patients in addition following TBI, in 9 patients also following chemotherapy. For measuring TNF-alpha we used an automated immunochemiluminescence assay (Immulite 1000 DPC Biermann, Bad Nauheim). The mean follow up period to record incidence of aGVHD was 100 days after stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: Compared to the basal levels before, the levels of TNF-alpha after conditioning with 188Re-CD-66-mAb did not increase significantly and remained in the physiological range. In contrast, these initial physiological cytokine levels increased and became pathological following 48 h after total body irradiation (13.2+/-6.6 pg/ml) and chemotherapy (10.8+/-15.7 pg/ml). In our study we found a low incidence of aGvHD (22.2%, n=4/18). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that additional conditioning therapy with 188Re-CD-66-mAb does not increase proinflammatory cytokine levels of TNF-alpha. This finding may indicate that additive radioimmunotherapy may not be a significant factor for increasing the rate of conditioning-associated aGvHD.","['Mutschler, J', 'Steinbach, G', 'Bunjes, D', 'Reske, S N', 'Buchmann, I']","['Mutschler J', 'Steinbach G', 'Bunjes D', 'Reske SN', 'Buchmann I']","['Klinik fur Nuklearmedizin, Universitatsklinik Ulm, Ulm. jochen.mutschler@zi-mannheim.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Nuklearmedizin,Nuklearmedizin.

Several studies in children and adults with ALL have shown that minimal residual disease (MRD) status is a strong and independent prognostic factor. We therefore evaluated the prognostic significance of MRD in infant ALL. Ninety-nine infant patients treated according to the Interfant-99 protocol were included in this study. MRD was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR analysis of rearranged immunoglobulin genes, T-cell receptor genes and MLL genes at various time points (TP) during therapy. Higher MRD levels at the end of induction (TP2) and consolidation (TP3) were significantly associated with lower disease-free survival. Combined MRD information at TP2 and TP3 allowed recognition of three patients groups that significantly differed in outcome. All MRD-high-risk patients (MRD levels > or =10(-4) at TP3; 26% of patients) relapsed. MRD-low-risk patients (MRD level <10(-4) at both TP2 and TP3) constituted 44% of patients and showed a relapse-rate of only 13%, whereas remaining patients (MRD-medium-risk patients; 30% of patients) had a relapse rate of 31%. Comparison between the current Interfant-06 stratification at diagnosis and the here presented MRD-based stratification showed that both stratifications recognized different subgroups of patients. These data indicate that MRD diagnostics has added value for recognition of risk groups in infant ALL and that MRD diagnostics can be used for treatment intervention in infant ALL as well.","['Van der Velden, V H J', 'Corral, L', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Jansen, M W J C', 'De Lorenzo, P', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E R', 'Schrappe, M', 'Schrauder, A', 'Meyer, C', 'Marschalek, R', 'Nigro, L L', 'Metzler, M', 'Basso, G', 'Mann, G', 'Den Boer, M L', 'Biondi, A', 'Pieters, R', 'Van Dongen, J J M']","['Van der Velden VH', 'Corral L', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Jansen MW', 'De Lorenzo P', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER', 'Schrappe M', 'Schrauder A', 'Meyer C', 'Marschalek R', 'Nigro LL', 'Metzler M', 'Basso G', 'Mann G', 'Den Boer ML', 'Biondi A', 'Pieters R', 'Van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090212,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['leu200917 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.17 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jun;23(6):1073-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.17.

Most FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive patients enjoy durable and complete molecular responses to low-dose imatinib (Glivec/Gleevec). However, resistance mediated by a T674I mutation in the ATP-binding pocket of PDGFRA has been reported in advanced disease, and sorafenib, a potent inhibitor of RAF-1, B-RAF, VEGFR and PDGFR, is active against this mutant in vitro. We describe a case of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha T674I CEL in blast crisis that responded to sorafenib (Nexavar). However, this clinical response was short-lived because of the rapid emergence of a FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha D842V mutant. An N-Nitroso-N-ethylurea-mutagenesis screen indeed identified this mutant as a major sorafenib-resistant mutant. In vitro, the novel FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha D842V mutant is highly resistant to sorafenib, imatinib, dasatinib (Sprycell) and PKC412 (Midostaurin). Thus, sorafenib is clinically active in imatinib-resistant FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha T674I CEL, but the rapid emergence of other mutants may limit the response duration. The identification of new PDGFR inhibitors will be required to overcome resistance by this D842V mutant.","['Lierman, E', 'Michaux, L', 'Beullens, E', 'Pierre, P', 'Marynen, P', 'Cools, J', 'Vandenberghe, P']","['Lierman E', 'Michaux L', 'Beullens E', 'Pierre P', 'Marynen P', 'Cools J', 'Vandenberghe P']","['VIB Department of Molecular and Developmental Genetics, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090212,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Benzenesulfonates/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chronic Disease', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*genetics', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Sorafenib', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*genetics']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['leu20092 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 May;23(5):845-51. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.2.

This can result from defective Reduced folate carrier (Rfc1)-dependent cellular uptake of MTX. Indeed, we have shown that functional Rfc1 activity is significantly reduced by clinically relevant concentrations of the anticonvulsant drugs PB or carbamazepine in an adequate in vitro model. As PB is known to regulate carrier-associated transport by the nuclear receptor constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), we investigated the involvement of the CAR signaling cascade and the mode of PB-induced downregulation of Rfc1 activity. CAR activation by PB or the CAR agonist 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloro- pyridyloxy)]-benzene resulted in translocation of Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase Calpha (cPKCalpha) to the plasma membrane related to significantly elevated PKC activities. In contrast, subcellular localization of Ca(2+)-independent PKCdelta was only marginally altered. Studies on intracellular distribution of the Rfc1 protein indicated that PB-induced activation of cPKCalpha was associated with carrier internalization from the plasma membrane into the cytosol independent of the Rfc1 phosphorylation status. In conclusion, we identified for the first time the molecular mechanism of this clinically relevant drug resistance in patients with ALL concurrently receiving MTX chemotherapy and antiepileptic drugs.","['Halwachs, S', 'Schafer, I', 'Seibel, P', 'Honscha, W']","['Halwachs S', 'Schafer I', 'Seibel P', 'Honscha W']","['Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Pharmacology, Pharmacy and Toxicology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany. halwachs@vetmed.uni-leipzig.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090212,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Constitutive Androstane Receptor)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'YQE403BP4D (Phenobarbital)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Constitutive Androstane Receptor', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Phenobarbital/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['leu20096 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jun;23(6):1087-97. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.6.

We found a significant correlation among the amounts of WT1, GATA-1 and GATA-2 mRNAs from leukemia and solid tumor cell lines. Overexpression and small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection experiments of GATA-1 and GATA-2 showed that these GATA transcription factors could induce WT1 expression. Promoter analysis showed that the 5' promoter did not explain the different WT1 mRNA levels between cell lines. The 3' enhancer, especially the distal sites out of six putative GATA binding sites located within the region, but not the intron 3 enhancer, were essential for the WT1 mRNA level. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed both GATA-1 and GATA-2 bound to these GATA sites. Besides acute leukemia cell lines, solid tumor cell lines including, TYK-nu-cPr also showed a high level of WT1 mRNA. We showed that GATA-2 expression is a determinant of WT1 mRNA expression in both TYK-nu-cPr cells and HL60 cells without GATA-1 expression.

To exclude the effect of splenomegaly in Tg mice on megakaryopoiesis, splenectomy was performed. After splenectomy, basal platelet counts in peripheral blood were not significantly different between Tg and wild-type (WT) mice. However, when experimental thrombocytopenia was induced by injecting 5-fluorouracil into splenectomized mice, overshoot of platelet counts during the recovery phase was hardly observed in Tg mice. Analyses of MK ploidy during the recovery phase showed that MKs less than 16 N ploidy were significantly decreased in Tg mice, suggesting that MK supply from progenitors is impaired. Supporting this, differentiation of CD34-/c-kit+/Sca-1+/Lineage- stem cells into MKs was significantly hampered in Tg mice, whereas megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) normally differentiated into MKs. It suggests that differentiation into MKs is impaired in Tg mice before the stage of MEP. Furthermore, MK colony formation in WT cells was dose-dependently inhibited in the presence of a caspase inhibitor. Contrary, Bcl-2-overexpressing MKs showed normal ability for in vitro platelet production. We thus believe that caspase activation is involved in the differentiation of progenitors into megakaryocytic lineage but not in platelet production.","['Kozuma, Y', 'Yuki, S', 'Ninomiya, H', 'Nagasawa, T', 'Kojima, H']","['Kozuma Y', 'Yuki S', 'Ninomiya H', 'Nagasawa T', 'Kojima H']","['Division of Hematology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090212,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/*cytology', 'Caspases/*metabolism/physiology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Fluorouracil', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Platelet Count', 'Ploidies', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['leu20097 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jun;23(6):1080-6. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.7.

NK cell numbers normalized quickly relative to B and T cells; however, the expression of both inhibitory and activating isoforms of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) was delayed. Most NK cells expressed an immature phenotype during the first 6 months post-HCT; however, we found high expression of activating NKp46 and NKp44 natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), and cytotoxicity was preserved. Early reconstituting NK cells from unmanipulated grafts showed lower cytotoxicity than those from T-cell-depleted grafts. Differences in NK cell reconstitution had significant effects on clinical outcomes. Patients whose NK cells reconstituted earlier had better survival and lower relapse rates. The best survival group was recipients who possessed HLA-C2 but their donor lacked the cognate-activating KIR2DS1. Collectively, our data underscore the clinical relevance of reconstituting NK cells and their activating KIRs and NCRs.

Trithorax group (trxG) and Polycomb group (PcG) gene products are part of an evolutionarily conserved chromatin remodelling system that activate or silence gene expression, respectively. Although PcG member Bmi1 has been shown to be required for postnatal neural stem cell self-renewal, the role of trxG genes remains unknown. Here we show that the trxG member Mll1 (mixed-lineage leukaemia 1) is required for neurogenesis in the mouse postnatal brain. Mll1-deficient subventricular zone neural stem cells survive, proliferate and efficiently differentiate into glial lineages; however, neuronal differentiation is severely impaired. In Mll1-deficient cells, early proneural Mash1 (also known as Ascl1) and gliogenic Olig2 expression are preserved, but Dlx2, a key downstream regulator of subventricular zone neurogenesis, is not expressed. Overexpression of Dlx2 can rescue neurogenesis in Mll1-deficient cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that Dlx2 is a direct target of MLL in subventricular zone cells. In differentiating wild-type subventricular zone cells, Mash1, Olig2 and Dlx2 loci have high levels of histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), consistent with their transcription. In contrast, in Mll1-deficient subventricular zone cells, chromatin at Dlx2 is bivalently marked by both H3K4me3 and histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), and the Dlx2 gene fails to properly activate. These data support a model in which Mll1 is required to resolve key silenced bivalent loci in postnatal neural precursors to the actively transcribed state for the induction of neurogenesis, but not for gliogenesis.","['Lim, Daniel A', 'Huang, Yin-Cheng', 'Swigut, Tomek', 'Mirick, Anika L', 'Garcia-Verdugo, Jose Manuel', 'Wysocka, Joanna', 'Ernst, Patricia', 'Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo']","['Lim DA', 'Huang YC', 'Swigut T', 'Mirick AL', 'Garcia-Verdugo JM', 'Wysocka J', 'Ernst P', 'Alvarez-Buylla A']","['Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, 505 Parnassus Street M779, San Francisco, California 94143, USA. limd@neurosurg.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090211,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Ascl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Distal-less homeobox proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Olig2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', '*Neurogenesis', 'Neuroglia/cytology/metabolism', 'Neurons/*cytology/metabolism', 'Olfactory Bulb/cytology/metabolism', 'Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2007/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['nature07726 [pii]', '10.1038/nature07726 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2009 Mar 26;458(7237):529-33. doi: 10.1038/nature07726.

Phase 1 and 2 trials have shown a dose-response effect and high-dose imatinib trials in early CP CML showed better results compared with standard dose. Our study is the first prospective trial planned to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose imatinib in previously untreated intermediate Sokal risk CML patients. Seventy-eight patients were treated with 400 mg imatinib twice daily: complete cytogenetic response (CCgR) rates at 12 and 24 months were 88% and 91%; moreover, at 12 and 24 months 56% and 73% of CCgR patients achieved a major molecular response. The incidence of adverse events was slightly higher than reported by the most important standard-dose trials. With a median follow-up of 24 months, 3 patients progressed to advanced phase. In intermediate Sokal risk newly diagnosed CML patients, high-dose imatinib induced rapid and high response rates, apparently faster than those documented in the International Randomized Study of IFN and Imatinib for the same risk category.

However, the critical downstream targets of Scl remain undefined. Here, we identified a novel Scl target gene, transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 C (Mef2C) from Scl(fl/fl) fetal liver progenitor cell lines. Analysis of Mef2C(-/-) embryos showed that Mef2C, in contrast to Scl, is not essential for specification into primitive or definitive hematopoietic lineages. However, adult VavCre(+)Mef2C(fl/fl) mice exhibited platelet defects similar to those observed in Scl-deficient mice. The platelet counts were reduced, whereas platelet size was increased and the platelet shape and granularity were altered. Furthermore, megakaryopoiesis was severely impaired in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray hybridization analysis revealed that Mef2C is directly regulated by Scl in megakaryocytic cells, but not in erythroid cells. In addition, an Scl-independent requirement for Mef2C in B-lymphoid homeostasis was observed in Mef2C-deficient mice, characterized as severe age-dependent reduction of specific B-cell progenitor populations reminiscent of premature aging. In summary, this work identifies Mef2C as an integral member of hematopoietic transcription factors with distinct upstream regulatory mechanisms and functional requirements in megakaryocyte and B-lymphoid lineages.","['Gekas, Christos', 'Rhodes, Katrin E', 'Gereige, Laurraine M', 'Helgadottir, Hildur', 'Ferrari, Roberto', 'Kurdistani, Siavash K', 'Montecino-Rodriguez, Encarnacion', 'Bassel-Duby, Rhonda', 'Olson, Eric', 'Krivtsov, Andrei V', 'Armstrong, Scott', 'Orkin, Stuart H', 'Pellegrini, Matteo', 'Mikkola, Hanna K A']","['Gekas C', 'Rhodes KE', 'Gereige LM', 'Helgadottir H', 'Ferrari R', 'Kurdistani SK', 'Montecino-Rodriguez E', 'Bassel-Duby R', 'Olson E', 'Krivtsov AV', 'Armstrong S', 'Orkin SH', 'Pellegrini M', 'Mikkola HK']","['Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California-Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090211,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Mef2c protein, mouse)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/physiology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Lineage/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Lymphopoiesis/*physiology', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Thrombopoiesis/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39343-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-167577 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 9;113(15):3461-71. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-07-167577.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting protein-coding mRNAs. Recently, miRNAs have been shown to play a role as both targets and effectors in gene hypermethylation and silencing in malignant cells. In the current study, we showed that enforced expression of miR-29b in acute myeloid leukemia cells resulted in marked reduction of the expression of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B at both RNA and protein levels. This in turn led to decrease in global DNA methylation and reexpression of p15(INK4b) and ESR1 via promoter DNA hypomethylation. Although down-regulation of DNMT3A and DNMT3B was the result of a direct interaction of miR-29b with the 3' untranslated regions of these genes, no predicted miR-29b interaction sites were found in the DNMT1 3' untranslated regions. Further experiments revealed that miR-29b down-regulates DNMT1 indirectly by targeting Sp1, a transactivator of the DNMT1 gene. Altogether, these data provide novel functional links between miRNAs and aberrant DNA hypermethylation in acute myeloid leukemia and suggest a potentially therapeutic use of synthetic miR-29b oligonucleotides as effective hypomethylating compounds.","['Garzon, Ramiro', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Fabbri, Muller', 'Liu, Zhongfa', 'Heaphy, Catherine E A', 'Callegari, Elisa', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Pang, Jiuxia', 'Yu, Jianhua', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Havelange, Violaine', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Blum, William', 'Rush, Laura J', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Byrd, John C', 'Chan, Kenneth', 'Wu, Lai-Chu', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Garzon R', 'Liu S', 'Fabbri M', 'Liu Z', 'Heaphy CE', 'Callegari E', 'Schwind S', 'Pang J', 'Yu J', 'Muthusamy N', 'Havelange V', 'Volinia S', 'Blum W', 'Rush LJ', 'Perrotti D', 'Andreeff M', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Byrd JC', 'Chan K', 'Wu LC', 'Croce CM', 'Marcucci G']","['Department of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090211,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (ESR1 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Acute Disease', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Enzyme Induction/genetics', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/07/21 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/21 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37261-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-170589 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jun 18;113(25):6411-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-07-170589.

By fluorescence microscopy of autofluorescent LacI repressor bound to the lacO arrays the telomere mobility during interphase was traced and correlated with the telomere repeat length. A confined diffusion model was derived that describes telomere dynamics in the nucleus on the time scale from seconds to hours. Two telomere groups were identified that differed with respect to the nuclear space accessible to them. Furthermore, translocations of PML-NBs relative to telomeres and their complexes with telomeres were evaluated. Based on these studies, a model is proposed in which the shortening of telomeres results in an increased mobility that could facilitate the formation of complexes between telomeres and PML-NBs.","['Jegou, Thibaud', 'Chung, Inn', 'Heuvelman, Gerrit', 'Wachsmuth, Malte', 'Gorisch, Sabine M', 'Greulich-Bode, Karin M', 'Boukamp, Petra', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Rippe, Karsten']","['Jegou T', 'Chung I', 'Heuvelman G', 'Wachsmuth M', 'Gorisch SM', 'Greulich-Bode KM', 'Boukamp P', 'Lichter P', 'Rippe K']","['Research Group Genome Organization and Function, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090211,United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Operator Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Telomerase/*deficiency', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/07/02 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/02 09:00 [medline]']","['E08-02-0108 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.e08-02-0108 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2009 Apr;20(7):2070-82. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e08-02-0108.

We examined here the overall and specific cancer risks among Swedish subjects who had been hospitalized for sarcoidosis. METHODS: A sarcoidosis research database was created by identifying hospitalized sarcoidosis patients from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and by linking them with the Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for cancers in sarcoidosis patients compared with subjects without sarcoidosis. RESULTS: A total of 10 037 patients were hospitalized for sarcoidosis during years 1964-2004. Among them 1045 patients developed subsequent cancer, giving an overall SIR of 1.40 and 1.18 for cancer diagnosed later than 1 year of follow-up. A significant excess was noted for skin (squamous cell), kidney and nonthyroid endocrine tumors and additionally for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia. Patients with multiple hospitalizations showed high risks. CONCLUSIONS: A 40% overall excess incidence of cancer was noted among sarcoidosis patients, but the increase was confined mainly to the first year after hospitalization. However, the increased risks of skin cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia, especially for those with multiple hospitalizations or hospitalized at old age, call for clinical attention.","['Ji, J', 'Shu, X', 'Li, X', 'Sundquist, K', 'Sundquist, J', 'Hemminki, K']","['Ji J', 'Shu X', 'Li X', 'Sundquist K', 'Sundquist J', 'Hemminki K']","['Center for Family and Community Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Germany. jianguang.ji@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090211,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sarcoidosis/*complications', 'Sweden']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/07/03 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/03 09:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)41074-0 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdn767 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2009 Jun;20(6):1121-6. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdn767.

Although several signaling pathways are activated during engagement of the type I IFN receptor and participate in the induction of IFN responses, the mechanisms of generation of specific signals for distinct biological effects remain to be elucidated. We provide evidence that a novel member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins is rapidly phosphorylated and activated during engagement of the type I IFN receptor. In contrast to other members of the PKC family that are also regulated by IFN receptors, PKCeta does not regulate IFN-inducible transcription of interferon-stimulated genes or generation of antiviral responses. However, its function promotes cell cycle arrest and is essential for the generation of the suppressive effects of IFNalpha on normal and leukemic human myeloid (colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage) bone marrow progenitors. Altogether, our studies establish PKCeta as a unique element in IFN signaling that plays a key and essential role in the generation of the regulatory effects of type I IFNs on normal and leukemic hematopoiesis.","['Redig, Amanda J', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Majchrzak-Kita, Beata', 'Katsoulidis, Efstratios', 'Liu, Hui', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Fish, Eleanor N', 'Wickrema, Amittha', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Redig AJ', 'Sassano A', 'Majchrzak-Kita B', 'Katsoulidis E', 'Liu H', 'Altman JK', 'Fish EN', 'Wickrema A', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

We investigated the role of IFN-gamma in GVHD in sublethally irradiated B6D2F1 recipients of B6 allo-HCT. B6D2F1 mice receiving wild-type B6 splenocytes alone died rapidly, whereas those receiving wild-type B6 splenocytes plus marrow survived long-term. Mice in both groups showed rapid elimination of host hematopoietic cells but minimal parenchymal tissue injury. However, mice receiving allo-HCT from IFN-gamma-deficient donors died rapidly regardless of whether donor marrow was given, and they exhibited severe parenchymal injury but prolonged survival of host hematopoietic cells. IFN-gamma plays a similar role in another model involving delayed B6 donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) to established mixed allogeneic (B6-->BALB/c) chimeras. IFN-gamma promotes DLI-mediated conversion from mixed to full donor chimerism while attenuating GVHD. Importantly, IFN-gamma enhances graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects in both models. Our data indicate that previously reported IFN-gamma-induced early mortality in allo-HCT recipients is due to augmentation of lymphohematopoietic graft-versus-host reaction (LGVHR) and can be avoided by providing an adequate source of donor hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Furthermore, the magnitude of GVL is correlated with the strength of LGVHR, and IFN-gamma reduces the potential of this alloreactivity to cause epithelial tissue GVHD.","['Wang, Hui', 'Asavaroengchai, Wannee', 'Yeap, Beow Yong', 'Wang, Min-Guang', 'Wang, Shumei', 'Sykes, Megan', 'Yang, Yong-Guang']","['Wang H', 'Asavaroengchai W', 'Yeap BY', 'Wang MG', 'Wang S', 'Sykes M', 'Yang YG']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Section, Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical, Boston, MA 02129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090210,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelium/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/*genetics/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphopoiesis/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39362-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-168419 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 9;113(15):3612-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-07-168419.

The surgical strategy among these patients remains controversial. We present our experience of using a two-staged surgical strategy of managing coronary artery disease using off-pump bypass followed by tumor management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a six-year period from 2002 to 2007, 350 patients underwent myocardial revascularization using off-pump bypass. Among these patients, associated malignant disease was found in six patients (1.7%). Two of them had papillary carcinoma of the bladder, one patient had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and the rest suffer from carcinoma affecting the prostate, colon, and right lung. Their mean age was 54 years. Their data was evaluated. Patients were followed up to evaluate their symptoms and progress of their disease. RESULTS: All patients were managed successfully. Complete revascularization was achieved in all patients except one due to small nongraftable vessels. The mean number of grafts was 1.8 +/- 0.8. There was no evidence of postoperative infraction or stroke. The mean hospital stay was 5 +/- 1.1 days. Management of cancer was done during the same hospital admission in two patients with bladder cancer. The rest had a mean interval of 6.6 +/- 5.4 days. Two patients underwent surgery in the form of left hemicolectomy and right lower lobectomy. The rest had chemotherapy as a sole treatment. All patients were followed up completely for a period of 12 to 84 months (mean 39.2 +/- 26.7 months). We had no late mortality. All patients remained asymptomatic except one, who had angina of class III and had recurrence of her bladder tumor, which necessitated two sessions of endoscopic resection. CONCLUSION: We believe that staged operation to treat coronary artery disease and malignancy can be performed safely. The use of off-pump technique to revascularize the myocardium can be performed without any complications.","['Darwazah, Ahmad K', 'Osman, Mohamed', 'Sharabati, Barakat']","['Darwazah AK', 'Osman M', 'Sharabati B']","['Department of Cardiac Surgery, Makassed Hospital, Mount of Olives, Jerusalem, Israel. darwaz30@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090203,United States,J Card Surg,Journal of cardiac surgery,8908809,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Coronary Artery Bypass, Off-Pump', 'Coronary Artery Disease/*surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Stroke Volume', 'Ventricular Function, Left']",2009/02/13 09:00,2011/06/03 06:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['JCS778 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1540-8191.2008.00778.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Card Surg. 2010 Jan-Feb;25(1):1-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1540-8191.2008.00778.x.

All patients were considered for trial entry, however the trial was not offered to 12 (15%) patients. These patients had a worse outcome than the 69 (85%) patients that were invited to participate (P = 0.04). Sixteen patients (23%) invited to participate in the trial declined and were treated on equivalent protocols. These patients had a similar outcome to those who accepted entry into the trial (P = 0.2). These results suggested that physicians exert a selection bias when evaluating patients for trial entry. Thus the overall survival estimates generated from large phase III trials may indicate that the outcome for patients with AML is better than the outcome experienced in the 'real' world.

However, some patients may develop imatinib resistance because of an acquired T674I mutation, which is believed to prevent drug binding through steric hindrance. METHODS: In an imatinib resistant FIP1L1-PDGFRA positive patient, we analyzed the molecular structure of the fusion gene and analyzed the effect of several kinase inhibitors on FIP1L1-PDGFRA-mediated proliferative responses in vitro. RESULTS: Sequencing of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene revealed the occurrence of a S601P mutation, which is located within the nucleotide binding loop. In agreement with the clinical observations, imatinib did not inhibit the proliferation of S601P mutant FIP1L1-PDGFRA-transduced Ba/F3 cells. Moreover, sorafenib, which has been described to inhibit T674I mutant FIP1L1-PDGFRA, failed to block S601P mutant FIP1L1-PDGFRA. Structural modeling revealed that the newly identified S601P mutated form of PDGFRA destabilizes the inactive conformation of the kinase domain that is necessary to bind imatinib as well as sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel mutation in FIP1L1-PDGFRA resulting in both imatinib and sorafenib resistance. The identification of novel drug-resistant FIP1L1-PDGFRA variants may help to develop the next generation of target-directed compounds for CEL/HES and other leukemias.","['Salemi, S', 'Yousefi, S', 'Simon, D', 'Schmid, I', 'Moretti, L', 'Scapozza, L', 'Simon, H-U']","['Salemi S', 'Yousefi S', 'Simon D', 'Schmid I', 'Moretti L', 'Scapozza L', 'Simon HU']","['Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090207,Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Benzenesulfonates/pharmacology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*genetics', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/chemistry/*genetics', 'Sorafenib', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/chemistry/*genetics']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/06/24 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/24 09:00 [medline]']","['ALL1943 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.01943.x [doi]']",ppublish,Allergy. 2009 Jun;64(6):913-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.01943.x.

The prevalence and pattern of vertebral fractures, as well as their relationship to BMD and other clinical indices, have not been systematically studied. We evaluated spine health in 186 newly diagnosed children (median age, 5.3 yr; 108 boys) with ALL (precursor B cell: N = 167; T cell: N = 19) who were enrolled in a national bone health research program. Patients were assessed within 30 days of diagnosis by lateral thoraco-lumbar spine radiograph, bone age (also used for metacarpal morphometry), and BMD. Vertebral morphometry was carried out by the Genant semiquantitative method. Twenty-nine patients (16%) had a total of 75 grade 1 or higher prevalent vertebral compression fractures (53 thoracic, 71%; 22 lumbar). Grade 1 fractures as the worst grade were present in 14 children (48%), 9 patients (31%) had grade 2 fractures, and 6 children (21%) had grade 3 fractures. The distribution of spine fracture was bimodal, with most occurring in the midthoracic and thoraco-lumbar regions. Children with grade 1 or higher vertebral compression had reduced lumbar spine (LS) areal BMD Z-scores compared with those without (mean +/- SD, -2.1 +/- 1.5 versus -1.1 +/- 1.2; p < 0.001). LS BMD Z-score, second metacarpal percent cortical area Z-score, and back pain were associated with increased odds for fracture. For every 1 SD reduction in LS BMD Z-score, the odds for fracture increased by 80% (95% CI: 10-193%); the presence of back pain had an OR of 4.7 (95% CI: 1.5-14.5). These results show that vertebral compression is an under-recognized complication of newly diagnosed ALL. Whether the fractures will resolve through bone growth during or after leukemia chemotherapy remains to be determined.","['Halton, Jacqueline', 'Gaboury, Isabelle', 'Grant, Ronald', 'Alos, Nathalie', 'Cummings, Elizabeth A', 'Matzinger, Maryann', 'Shenouda, Nazih', 'Lentle, Brian', 'Abish, Sharon', 'Atkinson, Stephanie', 'Cairney, Elizabeth', 'Dix, David', 'Israels, Sara', 'Stephure, David', 'Wilson, Beverly', 'Hay, John', 'Moher, David', 'Rauch, Frank', 'Siminoski, Kerry', 'Ward, Leanne M']","['Halton J', 'Gaboury I', 'Grant R', 'Alos N', 'Cummings EA', 'Matzinger M', 'Shenouda N', 'Lentle B', 'Abish S', 'Atkinson S', 'Cairney E', 'Dix D', 'Israels S', 'Stephure D', 'Wilson B', 'Hay J', 'Moher D', 'Rauch F', 'Siminoski K', 'Ward LM']","['University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Density/*drug effects', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/*injuries', 'Male', 'Osteoporosis/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Spinal Fractures/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Thoracic Vertebrae/*injuries']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/09/30 06:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1359/jbmr.090202 [doi]', '10.1359/jbmr.090202 [pii]']",ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 2009 Jul;24(7):1326-34. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.090202.,,,,['64285-1/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada'],PMC3890351,,['CAMS3788'],,,,,['Canadian STOPP Consortium'],"['Sykes E', 'Scharke M', 'Konji V', 'Riddell C', 'Ward LM', 'Feber J', 'Gaboury I', 'Halton J', 'Matzinger M', 'Moher D', 'Roth J', 'Shenouda N', 'Stephure D', 'Kloiber R', 'Lewis V', 'Midgley J', 'Miettunen P', 'Cabral D', 'Dix DB', 'Nadel HR', 'White C', 'Lentle BC', 'Hay J', 'Clarson C', 'Cairney E', 'Filler G', 'Grimmer J', 'Sparrow K', 'Cummings E', 'Fernandez C', 'Huber AM', 'Lang B', ""O'Brien K"", 'Ross A', 'Atkinson S', 'Arora S', 'Barr R', 'Coblentz C', 'Dent PB', 'Webber C', 'Rodd C', 'Abish S', 'Bell L', 'Scuccimarri R', 'Rauch F', 'Glorieux F', 'Alos N', 'Dubois J', 'Laverdiere C', 'Phan V', 'Saint-Cyr C', 'Couch R', 'Ellsworth J', 'LeBlanc C', 'Pinsk M', 'Siminoski K', 'Wilson B', 'Grant R', 'Charron M', 'Hebert D', 'Taback S', 'Blydt-Hansen T', 'Israels S', 'Oen K', 'Reed M']","['Sykes, Elizabeth', 'Scharke, Maya', 'Konji, Victor', 'Riddell, Catherine', 'Ward, Leanne M', 'Feber, Janusz', 'Gaboury, Isabelle', 'Halton, Jacqueline', 'Matzinger, MaryAnn', 'Moher, David', 'Roth, Johannes', 'Shenouda, Nazih', 'Stephure, David', 'Kloiber, Reinhard', 'Lewis, Victor', 'Midgley, Julian', 'Miettunen, Paivi', 'Cabral, David', 'Dix, David B', 'Nadel, Helen R', 'White, Colin', 'Lentle, Brian C', 'Hay, John', 'Clarson, Cheril', 'Cairney, Elizabeth', 'Filler, Guido', 'Grimmer, Joanne', 'Sparrow, Keith', 'Cummings, Elizabeth', 'Fernandez, Conrad', 'Huber, Adam M', 'Lang, Bianca', ""O'Brien, Kathy"", 'Ross, Andrew', 'Atkinson, Stephanie', 'Arora, Steve', 'Barr, Ronald', 'Coblentz, Craig', 'Dent, Peter B', 'Webber, Colin', 'Rodd, Celia', 'Abish, Sharon', 'Bell, Lorraine', 'Scuccimarri, Rosie', 'Rauch, Frank', 'Glorieux, Francis', 'Alos, Nathalie', 'Dubois, Josee', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Phan, Veronique', 'Saint-Cyr, Claire', 'Couch, Robert', 'Ellsworth, Janet', 'LeBlanc, Claire', 'Pinsk, Maury', 'Siminoski, Kerry', 'Wilson, Beverly', 'Grant, Ronald', 'Charron, Martin', 'Hebert, Diane', 'Taback, Shayne', 'Blydt-Hansen, Tom', 'Israels, Sara', 'Oen, Kiem', 'Reed, Martin']",,,,,,['NLM: CAMS3788'],

However, in the minority of cases leukemic cells express markers of more than one lineage, which has led to the introduction of a new subgroup of acute leukemias termed mixed or biphenotypic acute leukemias (BAL). In an effort to distinguish between BAL and those AL with aberrant expression of markers of other lineage, the European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Acute Leukemias (EGIL) has proposed a scoring system in which CD-markers are assigned a score of 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0, depending on the specificity of a particular antigen for myeloid, B- and/or T-lymphoid lineage, respectively. The new WHO classification of hematologic tumors has adopted the EGIL criteria for BAL and introduced a new group of AL termed 'AL of ambiguous lineage'. In addition to BAL in which a single cell population expresses both myeloid and lymphoid differentiation markers, this new group of leukemias also comprises cases that present with two separate blast populations (acute bilineal leukemia, aBLL). In general, BAL accounts for less than 5% of all AL cases, whereas aBLL is a rare disease constituting 1%-2% of AL cases that contains B- or T-lymphoid along with myeloid blasts. Chromosome abnormalities are frequent in both entities with a relatively high incidence of Philadelphia chromosome and rearrangements involving 11q23, especially in cases with B- and myeloid involvement. Other biological features include CD34 expression and multi-drug resistance P-glycoprotein overexpression. The prognosis of BAL and aBLL is unfavorable, with poor prognostic factors being age, high WBC and the presence of Philadelphia chromosome. Unfortunately, optimal therapy is not known, although regimens designed for acute lymphoblastic leukemia may result in a better response rate. Collaborative studies are needed for better understanding of the biology of these entities and establishment of standard therapeutic protocols.","['Batinic, Drago', 'Dubravcic, Klara', 'Rajic, Ljubica', 'Mikulic, Mirta', 'Labar, Boris']","['Batinic D', 'Dubravcic K', 'Rajic L', 'Mikulic M', 'Labar B']","['Zavod za imunologiju i Referentni centar za imunodijagnostiku imunoloskih i hematoloskih bolesti Ministarstva zdravstva Republike Hrvatske, Klinicki bolnicki centar Zagreb, Zagreb, Hrvatska. drago.batinic@zg.t-com.hr']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Croatia,Acta Med Croatica,Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti,9208249,,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/classification/diagnosis/genetics/immunology']",2009/02/13 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2009/02/13 09:00'],"['2009/02/13 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Croatica. 2008 Oct;62(4):387-90.,,30,,,,Bifenotipske i bilinijske akutne leukemije.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of that correlation in the ovarian subpanel of the NCI-60 has made a case for repositioning L-ASP to ovarian cancer. This review presents an overview of the biomarker development process, summarizes the efforts that have been invested thus far in developing ASNS as a biomarker for ovarian cancer treatment, highlights the role of RNAi and the limitations of the NCI-60 in that process, and addresses important considerations for next steps in the development of ASNS as a predictive biomarker.","['Lorenzi, Philip L', 'Weinstein, John N']","['Lorenzi PL', 'Weinstein JN']","['Genomics & Bioinformatics Group, Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. lorenzip@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",,United States,Drug News Perspect,Drug news & perspectives,8809164,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/analysis/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA Interference']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/05/01 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [medline]']","['1303820 [pii]', '10.1358/dnp.2009.22.1.1303820 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug News Perspect. 2009 Jan-Feb;22(1):61-4. doi: 10.1358/dnp.2009.22.1.1303820.,,37,,"['Z01 BC010823-01/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 CA999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4096155,,['NIHMS598099'],,,,"['Copyright 2009 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.

The transfer into T cells of T-cell receptor (TCR) genes encoding high-affinity TCRs recognizing defined tumor-associated antigens can potentially circumvent this obstacle. Using a well-characterized murine model of adoptive T-cell immunotherapy for widely disseminated leukemia, we demonstrate that TCR gene-modified T cells can cure mice of disseminated tumor. One goal of such adoptive therapy is to establish a persistent memory response to prevent recurrence; however, long-term function of transferred TCR-transduced T cells is limited due to reduced expression of the introduced TCR in vivo in quiescent resting T cells. However, by introducing the TCR into a cell with a known endogenous specificity, activation of these T cells by stimulation through the endogenous TCR can be used to increase expression of the introduced TCR, potentially providing a strategy to increase the total number of tumor-reactive T cells in the host and restore more potent antitumor activity.","['Dossett, Michelle L', 'Teague, Ryan M', 'Schmitt, Thomas M', 'Tan, Xiaoxia', 'Cooper, Laurence Jn', 'Pinzon, Cristina', 'Greenberg, Philip D']","['Dossett ML', 'Teague RM', 'Schmitt TM', 'Tan X', 'Cooper LJ', 'Pinzon C', 'Greenberg PD']","['Department of Immunology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090210,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)31568-4 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2008.300 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2009 Apr;17(4):742-9. doi: 10.1038/mt.2008.300.

The disease has been associated with a number of drugs and illnesses such as immunodeficiency states, infections, malignancy and other miscellaneous diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the association of PH and cancer in two consecutive patients. In case 1, the peliotic lesions mimicked metastatic dissemination of a neuroendocrine tumor in a patient with normal octreoscan and tumor markers, parameters that were abnormal at the initial tumor diagnosis. In case 2, PH mimicked systemic candidiasis complicating the treatment of an acute myeloid leukemia, although in a clinical setting in which an infection was unlikely. RESULTS: Computed tomography (CT) imaging and a high level of clinical suspicion had a major role in the correct identification of this uncommon disorder, avoiding unnecessary antitumor-or anti-infection-oriented diagnostic procedures or therapies. CONCLUSIONS: PH should be considered in the differential diagnosis of new liver lesions in patients in whom the clinical settings do not clearly favor metastasization or infection. The detailed analysis of multiphase CT scan imaging is essential for a correct diagnosis.

PATIENT AND METHODS: We report on a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) relapse in 22 weeks of gestation who received chemotherapy with cytarabine and mitoxantrone, as well as fludarabine, cytarabine, idarubicin, and gemtuzumabozogamicin. We describe findings on regular ultrasound examinations and successful management of complications. RESULTS: The foetus developed signs of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, transient cerebral ventriculomegaly, anaemia, and intrauterine growth restriction. The child was delivered by Caesarean section at 33 + 1 weeks of gestation. The newborn showed no congenital malformations. CONCLUSION: This case report confirms that chemotherapy for treatment of AML can be applied in the second trimester of pregnancy under close and careful maternal and foetal monitoring.","['Baumgartner, Anne K', 'Oberhoffer, R', 'Jacobs, Volker R', 'Ostermayer, E', 'Menzel, H', 'Voigt, M', 'Schneider, K T M', 'Pildner von Steinburg, S']","['Baumgartner AK', 'Oberhoffer R', 'Jacobs VR', 'Ostermayer E', 'Menzel H', 'Voigt M', 'Schneider KT', 'Pildner von Steinburg S']","['Abteilung Perinatalmedizin, Frauenklinik rechts der Isar der Technischen Universitat Munchen, Ismaninger Strasse 22, Munich, Germany. annebaumgaertner@web.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090120,Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cardiomyopathies/*chemically induced/embryology', 'Cerebral Ventricles/*abnormalities/drug effects', 'Female', 'Fetal Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/04/29 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/29 09:00 [medline]']","['000184745 [pii]', '10.1159/000184745 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2009 Feb;32(1-2):40-3. doi: 10.1159/000184745.

We report here that the p16 locus is H3K4-methylated in highly expressing cells. H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 directly binds to and is required, along with its core component RbBP5, for the induction of p16 by oncogenic Ras. We further show that damaged DNA binding protein DDB1 and CUL4, which assemble distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases by recruiting various WD40 proteins, act upstream of MLL1-mediated H3K4 methylation. We showed that CUL4A directly binds to p16 and that silencing DDB1 blocks Ras-induced p16 activation. Ras expression dissociates BMI1 from the p16 locus, whereas both CUL4 and MLL1 bind to the p16 locus similarly in both normal and oncogenic stimulated cells. These results suggest that DDB1-CUL4 and MLL1 complexes constitute a novel pathway that mediates p16 activation during oncogenic checkpoint response and is repressed by the polycomb repression complexes during normal growth of young cells.","['Kotake, Yojiro', 'Zeng, Yaxue', 'Xiong, Yue']","['Kotake Y', 'Zeng Y', 'Xiong Y']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Program in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7295, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090210,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CUL4A protein, human)', '0 (Cullin Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DDB1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RBBP5 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cullin Proteins/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Genes, p16', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', '*Oncogenes', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/03/21 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-08-2739 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2739 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Mar 1;69(5):1809-14. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2739.

The effects of Dll4 on Notch signaling in tumor cells expressing Notch receptors remain, however, largely unknown. Here, we report that escape of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells or colorectal cancer cells from dormancy is associated with Dll4 expression in the tumor microenvironment and increased Notch3 signaling in tumor cells. Dll4 was expressed at early time points during the angiogenic process, and its expression preceded perfusion of the newly established vessels. Treatment of EC with angiogenic factors induced Dll4 expression and increased Notch3 activation in cocultured T-ALL cells. Neutralization of Dll4 greatly reduced EC-mediated activation of Notch 3 signaling in T-ALL cells and blocked tumorigenesis. Moreover, silencing Notch3 by RNA interference had marked antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on T-ALL cells in vitro and reduced tumorigenicity in vivo.

A systematic analysis of dynamic changes of the proteome, phosphoproteome, and transcriptome in K562 cells after AS and/or IM treatment was performed to address the mechanisms underlying this synergy. Our data indicate that AS promotes the activities of the unfolded protein reaction (UPR) and ubiquitination pathway, which could form the biochemical basis for the pharmacological effects of this compound. In this CML model, AS targets BCR/ABL through the ubiquitination of key lysine residues, leading to its proteasomal degradation, whereas IM inhibits the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Combination of the 2 agents synergistically arrests the cell cycle, decreases activity of BCR/ABL, and leads to activation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways through complex modifications to both transcription and protein levels.

We evaluated the incidence patterns of ALL in adults. METHODS: We analyzed the incidence patterns of ALL (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology 3 codes 9835-9837) among all patients diagnosed from 1988 to 2004 in California using data from the California Cancer Registry to determine whether adult Hispanics also had higher incidence rates of ALL compared with non-Hispanic Whites (Whites). Age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIR), incidence rate ratios (IRR), and 5-year survival rates were obtained using SEER*Stat. AAIRs of other leukemia subtypes and IRRs relative to non-Hispanic Whites were also examined as references for ALL. RESULTS: AAIRs of ALL in Hispanic males and females ages 20 to 54 years were higher compared with those in White males and females (IRR, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.74-2.28 and IRR, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.60-2.25, respectively). A higher AAIR of ALL was also observed among older (55+ years) Hispanic females (IRR, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-2.21), but not in males (IRR, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.34). Among Hispanics, low socioeconomic status was associated with a higher AAIR compared with high/middle socioeconomic status (IRR, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.70). The respective 5-year survival rates among ALL patients were 38% and 30% for Whites and Hispanics ages 20 to 54 years, and 8% and 12% for patients 55 years of age or older. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics did not have an increased IRR of the other major leukemia subtypes.

We describe a rare case of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in which spinal intradural squamous cell carcinoma with no lesions in the cerebral meninges and leptomeninx, was the primary lesion. METHODS: A 64-year-old man complained of sacral pain. Although the patient was treated with analgesics, epidural block and nerve root block, sacral pain persisted. Since acute urinary retention occurred, he was operated on. The patient was diagnosed as having an intradural squamous cell carcinoma of unknown origin. RESULTS: Since the patient presented with a slightly decreased level of consciousness 2 months after surgery, he was subjected to MRI scanning of the brain and spinal cord, which revealed disseminated lesions in the medulla oblongata. The patient died of pneumonia and sepsis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 5 months after surgery. CONCLUSION: We report the first case of a patient with intradural squamous cell carcinoma with unknown origin that developed independently in the sacrum.","['Fukushima, Tatsuki', 'Kasai, Yuichi', 'Kato, Ko', 'Fujisawa, Kozo', 'Uchida, Atsumasa']","['Fukushima T', 'Kasai Y', 'Kato K', 'Fujisawa K', 'Uchida A']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu City, Mie, Japan. q7apiynn@za.ztv.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090211,England,World J Surg Oncol,World journal of surgical oncology,101170544,,IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology/surgery', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Meningeal Carcinomatosis/*secondary/surgery', 'Methicillin Resistance', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Unknown Primary/*pathology', 'Sacrum/*pathology/surgery', 'Spinal Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2008/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']","['1477-7819-7-16 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7819-7-16 [doi]']",epublish,World J Surg Oncol. 2009 Feb 11;7:16. doi: 10.1186/1477-7819-7-16.,,,,,PMC2644692,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They represent a new type of mutation and are larger-scaled than the single nucleotide polymorphisms. Using genotyping microarray for copy number variation detection has become standard, and there is a need for improving analysis methods. RESULTS: We apply the cumulative plot to the detection of regions with copy number variation/alteration, on samples taken from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient. Two sets of whole-genome genotyping of 317 k single nucleotide polymorphisms, one from the normal cell and another from the cancer cell, are analyzed. We demonstrate the utility of cumulative plot in detecting a 9 Mb (9 x 10(6) bases) hemizygous deletion and 1 Mb homozygous deletion on chromosome 13. We also show the possibility to detect smaller copy number variation/alteration regions below the 100 kb range. CONCLUSION: As a graphic tool, the cumulative plot is an intuitive and a scale-free (window-less) way for detecting copy number variation/alteration regions, especially when such regions are small.","['Li, Wentian', 'Lee, Annette', 'Gregersen, Peter K']","['Li W', 'Lee A', 'Gregersen PK']","['The Robert S Boas Center for Genomics and Human Genetics, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore LIJ Health System, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA. wli@nslij-genetics.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090130,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Gene Dosage/*genetics', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Human', 'Genotype', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Mutation']",2009/02/28 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-10-S1-S67 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-10-S1-S67 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2009 Jan 30;10 Suppl 1:S67. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-10-S1-S67.,,,,,PMC2648736,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) was reported to induce cell death in many malignant cells, but the specific pathway of As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis/necrosis remains controversial. Our aim was to determine if As(2)O(3) kills CLL cells through apoptosis and whether this is accompanied by reduction in Bcl-2 levels. Cells from nine patients with CLL were incubated with increasing concentrations of As(2)O(3) (0.5-2 microM) for 2, 7, or 14 days. Cells viability was measured using Alamar Blue assay and apoptosis using human Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodine (PI) kit (BMS306FI; Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria). Intracellular Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 levels were measured by flow cytometry. As(2)O(3) significantly reduced CLL cell viability (P < 0.01) and induced apoptotic cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After 7 days, CLL cells showed a significant decrease in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Bcl-2 on flow cytometry study. Bax and caspase-3 levels showed significant decrease in MFI only after prolonged incubations (7 and 14 days) and mostly at higher concentrations of As(2)O(3). The mechanism underlying the reduction in viability of CLL cells incubated with As(2)O(3) is mediated by induction of apoptosis maybe through the down-regulation of Bcl-2. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential therapeutic role of As(2)O(3) in CLL.","['Bairey, O', 'Vanichkin, A', 'Shpilberg, O']","['Bairey O', 'Vanichkin A', 'Shpilberg O']","['Institute of Hematology, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petah Tiqwa, Israel. obairey@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090205,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/02/12 09:00,2010/04/08 06:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1134 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2008.01134.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2010 Feb;32(1 Pt 1):e77-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2008.01134.x.

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is strongly induced in cultured human T lymphotropic virus-1-infected T lymphocytes, and may cause apoptosis through interaction with CD7. The aim was to investigate the clinical relevance of the Gal-3-CD7 pathway in ATLL. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry for Gal-3 and CD7 was performed on 22 cases of ATLL in the leukaemic phase. We found that the lymphoma cells were not necessarily Gal-3+, but Gal-3+ stromal cells could always be found. Independent of the status of Gal-3, there was an association of loss of CD7 with a worse prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, by down-regulating CD7, ATLL cells could have escaped Gal-3-induced apoptosis to run a more aggressive clinical course.","['Liu, Ting-Yun', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Lin, Chung-Wu']","['Liu TY', 'Chen CY', 'Tien HF', 'Lin CW']","['Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Galectin 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD7/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Galectin 3/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/05/01 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/01 09:00 [medline]']","['HIS3199 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2559.2008.03199.x [doi]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2009 Jan;54(2):214-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2008.03199.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemia relapsed after 1 year and an allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed for consolidation of leukaemia in second remission. Again, the patient developed macular skin lesions located on the trunk and the extremities with central pallor. Clinical examination showed fever, tachyarrhythmia and a systolic murmur. Fusarium spp. was cultured from blood samples. An antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B, voriconazole and posaconazole failed completely. The patient died in a septic shock with consecutive multiple organ failure. The autopsy (SN 1/06, Institute of Pathology, University of Greifswald) revealed a disseminated infiltration with Fusarium solani including myocardial, endocardial and aortal infection.

However, three EC cell lines (F9, P19 and PCC3) show different developmental potential and self-renewal capacity from those of ES cells. All three EC cell lines maintain self-renewal capacity in serum containing medium without Leukemia Inhibitory factor (LIF) or feeder layer, and show limited differentiation capacity into restricted lineage and cell types. To reveal the underlying mechanism of these characteristics, we took the approach of characterizing extrinsic factors derived from EC cells on the self-renewal capacity and pluripotency of mouse ES cells. Here we demonstrate that EC cell lines F9 and P19 produce factor(s) maintaining the undifferentiated state of mouse ES cells via an unidentified signal pathway, while P19 and PCC3 cells produce self-renewal factors of ES cells other than LIF that were able to activate the STAT3 signal; however, inhibition of STAT3 activation with Janus kinase inhibitor shows only partial impairment on the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of ES cells. Thus, these factors present in EC cells-derived conditioned medium may be responsible for the self-renewal capacity of EC and ES cells independently of LIF signaling.","['Kawazoe, Shinjirou', 'Ikeda, Nobuhito', 'Miki, Kengo', 'Shibuya, Masayuki', 'Morikawa, Kumi', 'Nakano, Seiji', 'Oshimura, Mitsuo', 'Hisatome, Ichiro', 'Shirayoshi, Yasuaki']","['Kawazoe S', 'Ikeda N', 'Miki K', 'Shibuya M', 'Morikawa K', 'Nakano S', 'Oshimura M', 'Hisatome I', 'Shirayoshi Y']","['Division of Regenerative Medicine and Therapeutics, Department of Genetic Medicine and Regenerative Therapeutics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Tottori University, Nishi-cho, Yonago, Tottori, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Dev Growth Differ,"Development, growth & differentiation",0356504,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Factors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Germ Layers/cytology', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/physiology', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', '*Signal Transduction']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/03/17 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/17 09:00 [medline]']","['DGD1082 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-169X.2008.01082.x [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Growth Differ. 2009 Feb;51(2):81-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-169X.2008.01082.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical definition of RS is heterogeneous, and encompasses at least two biologically different conditions: (i) CLL transformation to a clonally related DLBCL, that accounts for the majority of cases; (ii) development of a DLBCL unrelated to the CLL clone. In clonally related RS, the pathogenetic link between the CLL and the DLBCL phases is substantiated by the acquisition of novel molecular lesions at the time of clinico-pathologic transformation. RS is not a rare event in the natural history of CLL, since the cumulative incidence of RS at 10 years exceeds 10%. Prompt recognition of RS is known to be clinically useful, and may be favoured by close monitoring of CLL patients harbouring clinical and/or biological risk factors of RS development. Conventional risk factors that are independent predictors of RS development at the time of CLL diagnosis include: (i) expression of CD38; (ii) absence of del13q14 and (iii) lymph node size > or =3 cm. Other risk factors of RS development include CD38 genotype and usage of specific immunoglobulin variable genes. The molecular pathogenesis of RS has been elucidated to a certain extent. Acquisition of TP53 mutations and/or 17p13 deletion is a frequent molecular event in RS, as it is in other types of transformation from indolent to aggressive B-cell malignancies. Additional molecular alterations are being revealed by genome wide studies. Once that transformation has occurred, RS prognosis may be predicted by the RS score, based on performance status, LDH, platelet count, tumour size and number of prior therapies. Depending on patient's age and RS score, the therapeutic options for RS may range from conventional immunochemotherapy to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.","['Rossi, Davide', 'Gaidano, Gianluca']","['Rossi D', 'Gaidano G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine and BRMA, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Novara, Italy. rossidav@med.unipmn.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Syndrome']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/04/28 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.880 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2009 Mar;27(1):1-10. doi: 10.1002/hon.880.,,90,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,

However, while the introduction of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) has consistently reduced morbidity and mortality of the procedure, relapse still represents the major cause of ASCT failure. One possibility to ameliorate therapeutic results could rely on the adoption of conditioning regimens specifically designed for AML. We report therapeutic results from a series of 40 AML patients older than 60 years (median age 67 years) autografted in first complete remission (CR), after conditioning with continuous infusion (c.i.) high dose idarubicin and busulphan. Fourty patients (median age: 67 years) received 2 days c.i. idarubicin at 20 mg/m(2)/day, followed by 3 days oral or intravenous busulphan (4 mg/kg/day) as conditioning. No case of transplant-related mortality occurred. Cardiac toxicity was absent, while 31 patients (77%) had grade 3-4 mucositis.

PROCEDURES: To identify factors associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in survivors of childhood cancer the authors examined 114 patients (70 males) who had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 43), Hodgkin disease (HD; n = 35), and solid tumors (ST; n = 36) twice. Median age at diagnosis was 8.4 years; at the consecutive examinations it was 12.8 and 16.3 years, respectively. To assess bone density we used dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). RESULTS: In the first examination, patients with a history of steroid therapy had higher total and spine BMD and higher BMI (body mass index) than those who were not given steroids. At the end of the follow-up, no differences were found in BMD between subgroups, although BMI was still higher in both ALL and HD patients than in those with ST. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated for solid tumors have reduced bone mass. Low BMI and local irradiation seem to be the factors responsible for reduced BMD in children treated for ST. The use of steroids does not disturb bone mass accumulation in patients treated for childhood malignancies. However, a long-term effect of cancer treatment on osteoporosis risk remains to be determined.","['Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Konstantynowicz, Jerzy', 'Panasiuk, Anna', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna']","['Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Konstantynowicz J', 'Panasiuk A', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland. kmroslan@umwb.edu.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Steroids)']",IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Body Mass Index', 'Bone Density/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Steroids/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Survivors']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/04/14 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/14 09:00 [medline]']","['908622480 [pii]', '10.1080/08880010802625472 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2009 Jan;26(1):36-47. doi: 10.1080/08880010802625472.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that CD33, CD13, MPO and CD117 were the most commonly expressed antigens in AML. A combination of intensive autofluorescence, both CD34(-) and HLA-DR(-), and high expression of CD13, CD33 and MPO had significant value for M3 diagnosis. CD14 was expressed only in M4 and M5, and both intensive positivity of CD64 and CD15 with high expression of HLA-DR may suggest great possibility for diagnosis of M5. Lymphoid markers expression was documented in 47.9% of the 192 AML cases analyzed. CD56 (26.0%) and CD7 (20.8%) were the most commonly expressed lymphoid markers in AML patients. Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 76 out of 125 (60.8%). Higher CD34 positivity was found in LymAg(+) group (77.2%) than in LymAg(-) group (48.0%). Our results indicate that immunophenotype analysis was useful for AML diagnosis and classification and the immunophenotype did have relevance to the abnormal cytogenetic changes and clinical features in AML.","['Tong, Haixia', 'Lu, Chunwei', 'Zhang, Jihong', 'Liu, Zhuogang', 'Ma, Yu']","['Tong H', 'Lu C', 'Zhang J', 'Liu Z', 'Ma Y']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Tiexi District, 110022 Shenyang, China. tonghaixia18@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090210,Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, CD7/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2008/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10238-009-0030-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2009 Jun;9(2):149-55. doi: 10.1007/s10238-009-0030-8.

All these techniques have a diagnostic and prognostic value. Molecular abnormalities in many cases suggest the pathogenesis of acute leukemia, but also point to the key site of genetic abnormalities that may be targeted with the therapy. Treatment approach in acute leukemia is still chemotherapy. The probability of long-term disease-free survival after intensive chemotherapy for younger patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia is 30%-40% and 40%-50%, respectively. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is associated with better disease-free survival compared to other cytotoxic regimens. In recent years, targeted therapy seems to improve the chemotherapy outcome. This therapy targets only leukemic cells while sparing normal cells. Immunotherapy, differential agents and especially drugs acting on the key molecular abnormalities are currently being used together with chemotherapy as a treatment approach for acute leukemia. It is expected that techniques such as gene expression profiling will identify genetic abnormalities and their proteins as a targeted site for new drugs. This might increase the efficacy of leukemia treatment and control.","['Labar, Boris', 'Nemet, Damir', 'Sucic, Mate', 'Batinic, Drago', 'Zadro, Renata', 'Mrsic, Sanja', 'Serventi-Seiwerth, Ranka', 'Sertic, Dubravka', 'Mikulic, Mirta', 'Durakovic, Nadira']","['Labar B', 'Nemet D', 'Sucic M', 'Batinic D', 'Zadro R', 'Mrsic S', 'Serventi-Seiwerth R', 'Sertic D', 'Mikulic M', 'Durakovic N']","['Zavod za hematologiju, Klinika za unutrasnje bolesti, Klinicki bolnicki centar, Zagreb, Hrvatska. boris.labar@inet.hr']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Croatia,Acta Med Croatica,Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti,9208249,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Croatica. 2008 Oct;62(4):403-8.,,,,,,Suvremeni pristup dijagnostici i lijecenju akutnih leukemija u odraslih.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not all AL with myeloid and lymphoid antigens (ALMy+Ly) are true biphenotypic AL. According to EGIL scoring system, true biphenotypic ALMy+Ly are those with a sum of antigens 2 or more points for both myeloid and lymphoid lineage or for B and T lineage. The aim of this study was to compare cytomorphology and immunophenotype of AL to better understand the relation of certain AL morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetics and molecular biology of biphenotypic AL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included a group of 169 AL patients treated from 1985 till 1991, and a group of 102 AL patients treated from 1993 till 1996 at Zagreb University Hospital Center. Bone marrow and peripheral blood of the two groups of AL patients were analyzed according to Pappenheim (May-Grunwald-Giemsa), cytochemical and alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) immunocytochemical staining. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping of bone marrow was also done in both patient groups. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In the group of 169 adult AL patients, 116 were cytomorphologically classified as acute myeloblastic leukemias (AML), 35 as acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) and 18 as acute undifferentiated leukemias (ANLM). In 6 (3.4%) of 169 AL patients, blasts expressed both myeloid and lymphoid antigens. In the group of 102 AL patients there were 19 (18.6%) ALMy+Ly. In 64 patients cytomorphologically classified into AML subgroup out of 102 AL patients, there were 15 (14.7%/102; 23.4%/64) AML with lymphoid antigens (AMLLy+). In 35 patients cytomorphologically diagnosed as ALL and 3 as ANLM out of 102 AL, there were 4 (3.9%/102; 10.5%/38) ALL with myeloid antigens (ALLMy+). The incidence of mixed AL in 102 AL was more consistent with other studies, pointing to the necessity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD7 and TdT determination as part of standard immunophenotyping for better recognition of mixed AL. CONCLUSION: In both groups of 169 and 102 AL patients, the majority of AL cases were cytomorphologically classified as AML. In the group of 169 patients there were 5 AMLLy+ and in the group of 102 patients there were 15 AMLLy+. In one ANLM,My+ out of 169 AL and also one ANLM,My+ out of 102 AL, blasts were cytomorphologically undifferentiated; in 3 ALLMy+ of 102 AL blasts expressed lymphoid morphology. According to EGIL scoring system, among 15 AMLLy+ of 102 AL there were 4 true biphenotypic ALMy+Ly (1 M1, 2 M3, 1 M4), and in 4 ALMy+Ly with undifferentiated and lymphoid morphology there were 2 true biphenotypic AL (1 L2; 1 ANLM). In 3 ALLB+T out of 35 ALL, one was interlineal biphenotypic AL. These observations are consistent with other studies and WHO determinations indicating that the majority of true biphenotypic leukemias are associated with immature monoblastic or myeloid cytomorphology or with lymphoid or undifferentiated characteristics, but may also express any AML cytomorphology type. Thus, there is no direct correlation of leukemic cell cytomorphology and biphenotypic AL immunophenotype.","['Sucic, Mirna', 'Batinic, Drago', 'Zadro, Renata', 'Mrsic, Sanja', 'Labar, Boris']","['Sucic M', 'Batinic D', 'Zadro R', 'Mrsic S', 'Labar B']","['Zavod za citologiju, Klinicki zavod za patologiju i citologiju, Klinicki bolnicki centar Zagreb, Zagreb, Hrvatska.']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Croatia,Acta Med Croatica,Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti,9208249,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/classification/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/immunology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/immunology/pathology']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Croatica. 2008 Oct;62(4):379-85.,,,,,,Citomorfologija akutnih mjesovitih leukemija.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study included 155 CLLPD patients. Analysis was performed in the overall CLLPD population and separately in a subgroup of patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia with variants (B-CLL+V) including typical B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), mixed chronic lymphocytic leukemia and prolymphocytic leukemia (CLL/PLL), and a variant of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with lymphoplasmocytoid differentiation (CLL/IMC). Kaplan-Meier method (Statistica 7.1) was used on survival analysis. RESULTS: Male patients older than 62 (p=0.03991), female patients (p=0.02871), patients not receiving antitumor therapy on study entry (p=0.01902) and patients not treated for CLLPB upon study entry (p=0.04076) showed better survival rate. Older patient predominated in the group requiring no antitumor therapy (p=0.019247). Analyis of sex distribution yielded an equal male to female ratio in the overall CLLPD population and B-CLL+V subgroup. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to assess the clinical significance of quantitative parameters related to patient age and sex. The level of bilirubin, the size of cervical lymph nodes and doubling of peripheral blood lymphocytosis (DTL) were lower in the group of older patients (>60 years). Men had higher levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, SGOT and creatinine, and larger spleen and liver. Statistically significant survival differences were recorded for 16 of 20 clinical parameters. Patients older than 60, female patients and patients receiving no antitumor therapy showed better survival. Lower clinical stage according to Rai and Binet and total tumor mass (TTM) lower than 9 indicated better prognosis, whereas patients with spleen enlargement and multiple regions involved with lymph node enlargement showed poorer survival. B-CLL+V patients and patients free from doubling of total tumor (DTM) or of absolute lymphocyte count (DTL) within 12 months had better survival than the overall CLLPD patient population. A statistically significant survival difference was recorded for 5 of 15 bone marrow (BM) parameters tested: normal and less cellular BM puncture specimen, >70% of all lymphatic cells, >16% of atypical lymphatic cells, and >18% of granulocytes in myelogram indicated better prognosis. Poorer disease outcome was associated with interstitial and nodular infiltration found on bone biopsy. Ten of 20 hematologic parameters were found to be statistically significant. Poorer prognosis was associated with red blood cell count <2.5 x 10(12)/L, leukocyte count >100 x 10(9)/L, reticulocyte count >5/10(3) E, hemoglobin <100 g/L and iron <15 mol/L. Better survival was associated with absolute count of total lymphatic cells <100 x 10(9)/L and absolute count of atypical lymphatic cells <5 x 10(9)/L in peripheral blood; <10% of all atypical lymphatic cells, >5.1% monocytes and >10.1% granulocytes in differential blood count. Statistically significant survival differences were found for 10 of 20 biochemical parameters tested. Poorer survival was recorded in patients with LDH >300 U/L, SGOT >24 U/L, calcium <2.3 mmol/L, total protein <66.1 g/L, albumin <40 g/L, alpha2 globulin<5.9 g/L, beta globulin <7.3 g/L, y globulin <9 g/L and IgG <10 g/L. Better prognosis was only indicated by lower levels of IgM (<0.91 g/L). CONCLUSION: Careful clinical examination is an important step on assessing the extent and progression of the disease, and a major chain on tailoring individualized therapeutic approach, along with clinical stages according to Rai and Binet, CLLPD subtype and progression factors (DTM and DTL). Laboratory parameters (hematologic and biochemical) as objective quantitative parameters obtained by simple venipuncture, in contrast to the 'researcher-dependent' ones, increase the utilization of some of these parameters as risk factors in CLL.","['Kardum-Skelin, Ika', 'Planinc-Peraica, Ana', 'Ostojic Kolonic, Slobodanka', 'Radic-Kristo, Delfa', 'Milas, Marina', 'Vrhovac, Radovan', 'Sustercic, Dunja', 'Minigo, Hrvoje', 'Jaksic, Branimir']","['Kardum-Skelin I', 'Planinc-Peraica A', 'Ostojic Kolonic S', 'Radic-Kristo D', 'Milas M', 'Vrhovac R', 'Sustercic D', 'Minigo H', 'Jaksic B']","['Klinicka bolnica Merkur, Zagreb, Hrvatska. ikardum@hi.t-com.hr']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Croatia,Acta Med Croatica,Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti,9208249,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2009/02/12 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2009/02/12 09:00'],"['2009/02/12 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Croatica. 2008 Oct;62(4):351-64.,,,,,,Klinicki i laboratorijski prognosticki pokazatelji kronicnih leukemijskih limfoproliferativnih bolesti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virus expression has been reported to be limited or absent when ATLL is diagnosed, and this has suggested that secondary genetic or epigenetic changes are important in disease pathogenesis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We prospectively investigated combination chemotherapy followed by antiretroviral therapy for this disorder. Nineteen patients were prospectively enrolled between 2002 and 2006 at five medical centers in a phase II clinical trial of infusional chemotherapy with etoposide, doxorubicin, and vincristine, daily prednisone, and bolus cyclophosphamide (EPOCH) given for two to six cycles until maximal clinical response, and followed by antiviral therapy with daily zidovudine, lamivudine, and alpha interferon-2a for up to one year. Seven patients were on study for less than one month due to progressive disease or chemotherapy toxicity. Eleven patients achieved an objective response with median duration of response of thirteen months, and two complete remissions. During chemotherapy induction, viral RNA expression increased (median 190-fold), and virus replication occurred, coincident with development of disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: EPOCH chemotherapy followed by antiretroviral therapy is an active therapeutic regimen for adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, but viral reactivation during induction chemotherapy may contribute to treatment failure. Alternative therapies are sorely needed in this disease that simultaneously prevent virus expression, and are cytocidal for malignant cells.","['Ratner, Lee', 'Harrington, William', 'Feng, Xuan', 'Grant, Christian', 'Jacobson, Steve', 'Noy, Ariela', 'Sparano, Joseph', 'Lee, Jeannette', 'Ambinder, Richard', 'Campbell, Nancy', 'Lairmore, Michael']","['Ratner L', 'Harrington W', 'Feng X', 'Grant C', 'Jacobson S', 'Noy A', 'Sparano J', 'Lee J', 'Ambinder R', 'Campbell N', 'Lairmore M']","['Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri, USA. lratner@im.wustl.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090210,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology/*virology', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Virus Activation/drug effects']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/03/21 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2008/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0004420 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(2):e4420. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004420.

Drug resistance, acquired by mutations, is an obstacle to success. Two additional drugs are now considered and could be combined with Imatinib to prevent resistance, Dasatinib and Nilotinib. While most mutations conferring resistance to one drug do not confer resistance to the other drugs, there is one mutation (T315I) that induces resistance against all three drugs. Using computational methods, the combination of two drugs is found to increase the probability of treatment success despite this cross-resistance. Combining more than two drugs, however, does not provide further advantages. We also explore possible combination therapies using drugs currently under development. We conclude that among the targeted drugs currently available for the treatment of CML, only the two most effective ones should be used in combination for the prevention of drug resistance.","['Komarova, Natalia L', 'Katouli, Allen A', 'Wodarz, Dominik']","['Komarova NL', 'Katouli AA', 'Wodarz D']","['Department of Mathematics, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090210,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/03/21 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2008/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0004423 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(2):e4423. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004423.

TR2 is known to function as an activator (Wei et al. 2000), or a repressor (Chinpaisal et al., 1998, Gupta et al. 2007). Due to the lack of specific ligands, mechanisms triggering its activator or repressor function have remained puzzling for decades. Recently, we found that all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) triggers the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), which phosphorylates TR2 and stimulates its partitioning to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, thereby converting the activator function of TR2 into repression (Gupta et al. 2008; Park et al. 2007). Recruitment of TR2 to PML is a crucial step in the conversion of TR2 from an activator to a repressor. However, it is unclear how phosphorylated TR2 is recruited to PML, an essential step in converting TR2 from an activator to a repressor. In the present study, we use both in vitro and in vivo systems to address the problem of recruiting TR2 to PML nuclear bodies. First, we identify histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) as an effector molecule. HDAC3 is known to interact with TR2 (Franco et al. 2001) and this interaction is enhanced by the atRA-stimulated phosphorylation of TR2 at Thr-210 (Gupta et al. 2008). Secondly, in this study, we also find that the carrier function of HDAC3 is independent of its deacetylase activity. Thirdly, we find another novel activity of atRA that stimulates nuclear enrichment of HDAC3 to form nuclear complex with PML, which is ERK2 independent. This is the first report identifying a deacetylase-independent function for HDAC3, which serves as a specific carrier molecule that targets a specifically phosphorylated protein to PML NBs. This is also the first study delineating how protein recruitment to PML nuclear bodies occurs, which can be stimulated by atRA in an ERK2-independent manner. These findings could provide new insights into the development of potential therapeutics and in understanding how orphan nuclear receptor activities can be regulated without ligands.","['Gupta, Pawan', 'Ho, Ping-Chih', 'Ha, Sung Gil', 'Lin, Yi-Wei', 'Wei, Li-Na']","['Gupta P', 'Ho PC', 'Ha SG', 'Lin YW', 'Wei LN']","['Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090210,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nr2c1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2, Group C, Member 1)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Chaperones/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2, Group C, Member 1', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphothreonine/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/*metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/03/21 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2008/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/21 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0004363 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2009;4(2):e4363. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004363.

Following autologous transplant and engraftment, 30 patients (35.7%) had a transient secondary decline in their plt counts, which was not associated with graft rejection, relapse or infection. The median time to onset of thrombocytopenia was 59 days post transplant, with spontaneous recovery after a median period of 41 days. A secondary decline in ANC also occurred in eight patients. Patients with secondary plt decline had a significantly earlier primary plt engraftment (median 15 days) and a trend towards earlier neutrophil engraftment compared with patients who maintained steady plt counts (median 21 days). There was a trend towards a lower incidence of secondary plt decline in patients who received BM stem cells compared with those who received PBSC. No cause was evident for the occurrence of a secondary cytopenia, and it did not adversely affect survival.

In addition, there have been concerns regarding imatinib associated cardiac toxicity. We investigated the outcome of 61 patients with CML who received a myeloablative allo-HCT at the University of Minnesota between 1999 and 2006. The median age at HCT was 38.4 (range; 6.9-56.9) years. Thirty-seven patients were in first chronic phase and twenty-four patients in a second chronic or accelerated phase at the time of HCT. Twenty-six patients received imatinib therapy before or after HCT, and thirty-five patients either never received imatinib (n=32) or received it only at the time of relapse after HCT (n=3).

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: A 52-year-old male had been diagnosed earlier as having chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and treated for 6 months with chlorambucil, although compliance was poor and the patient eventually stopped treatment. He presented to our hospital 18 months later with clinical features in keeping with Richter's syndrome. The blood and bone marrow smear review, together with fine-needle aspiration cytology of the masses, showed diffuse large cells of non-Hodgkin lymphoma consistent with the Richter's syndrome stage of CLL. There was significant improvement in response to the first 4 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy (consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) instituted, but then there were features of relapse. CONCLUSION: The case report serves to increase awareness and improve the index of suspicion about the terminal phase of CLL and low-grade lymphoma. It equally emphasizes the great need to strengthen further the laboratory diagnosis of haematological malignancies in developing countries.","['Olaniyi, J A', 'Ibijola, A A']","['Olaniyi JA', 'Ibijola AA']","['Department of Haematology, PMB 5116University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. johnniyi2001@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090210,Switzerland,Med Princ Pract,"Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",8901334,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Syndrome']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2007/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['000189815 [pii]', '10.1159/000189815 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Princ Pract. 2009;18(2):152-4. doi: 10.1159/000189815.

The most prevalent activated mutant FLT3 ITD exhibits an altered signaling quality, including strong activation of the STAT5 transcription factor. FLT3 ITD has also been found partially retained as a high-mannose precursor in an intracellular compartment. To analyze the role of intracellular retention of FLT3 for transformation, we have generated FLT3 versions that are anchored in the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by appending an ER retention sequence containing a RRR (R3) motif. ER retention of R3, but not of corresponding A3 FLT3 versions, is shown by biochemical, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and immunocytochemical analyses. ER anchoring reduced global autophosphorylation and diminished constitutive activation of ERK1/2 and AKT of the constitutively active FLT3 versions. ER anchoring was, however, associated with elevated signaling to STAT3. Transforming activity of the FLT3 D835Y mutant was suppressed by ER anchoring. In contrast, ER-anchored FLT3 ITD retained STAT5-activating capacity and was transforming in vitro and in vivo. The findings highlight another aspect of the different signaling quality of FLT3 ITD: It can transform cells from an intracellular location.","['Schmidt-Arras, Dirk', 'Bohmer, Sylvia-Annette', 'Koch, Sina', 'Muller, Jorg P', 'Blei, Lutz', 'Cornils, Hauke', 'Bauer, Reinhard', 'Korasikha, Sridhar', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Bohmer, Frank-D']","['Schmidt-Arras D', 'Bohmer SA', 'Koch S', 'Muller JP', 'Blei L', 'Cornils H', 'Bauer R', 'Korasikha S', 'Thiede C', 'Bohmer FD']","['Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090209,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mutagenesis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/*metabolism']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39356-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-10-121426 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 9;113(15):3568-76. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-10-121426.

The ETO portion of the fusion protein includes the eTAFH domain, which is homologous to several TATA binding protein-associated factors (TAFs) and interacts with E proteins (E2A and HEB). It has been proposed that AML1-ETO-mediated silencing of E protein function might be important for t(8;21) leukemogenesis. Here, we determined the solution structure of a complex between the AML1-ETO eTAFH domain and an interacting peptide from HEB. On the basis of the structure, key residues in AML1-ETO for HEB association were mutated. These mutations do not impair the ability of AML1-ETO to enhance the clonogenic capacity of primary mouse bone marrow cells and do not eliminate its ability to repress proliferation or granulocyte differentiation. Therefore, the eTAFH-E protein interaction appears to contribute relatively little to the activity of AML1-ETO.","['Park, Sangho', 'Chen, Wei', 'Cierpicki, Tomasz', 'Tonelli, Marco', 'Cai, Xiongwei', 'Speck, Nancy A', 'Bushweller, John H']","['Park S', 'Chen W', 'Cierpicki T', 'Tonelli M', 'Cai X', 'Speck NA', 'Bushweller JH']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090209,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MTG8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39355-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-161307 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 9;113(15):3558-67. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-06-161307.

Extensive sequence analysis has shown that flit-1, which is noncoding, is conserved on human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 15. The human and murine homologs of flit-1 are positioned approximately 30-kb upstream to activin-A receptor type II-like 1 (ACVRL1/ALK1) gene. Expression of ACVRL1 mRNA was examined in two of five lymphomas with flit-1 rearrangement and detected in both of the two whereas normal thymuses and seven lymphoid tumors without flit-1 rearrangement had no detectable expression.

In this report, we describe the incidence of and risk factors for GVHD over time in children receiving URD BMT. We analyzed outcomes of 638 myeloablative URD BMTs performed between 1990 and 2003 to treat acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome MDS, using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database. All recipients were under age 18 years and had available high-resolution HLA typing for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1. Overall, 27% of the recipients developed acute GVHD (aGVHD) grade III-IV; the risk was significantly higher in children receiving T cell-replete grafts compared with those receiving T cell-depleted grafts (odds ratio [OR] = 3.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.02 to 4.83; P < .0001). Acute GVHD significantly reduced the risk of relapse in children with ALL (OR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.86; P = .0052), but not in those with AML (OR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.22 to 2.98; P = .26).

It is reported to induce cardiac arrhythmia via altering various ion channels involved in the repolarization phase of cardiac action potential. The exact molecular mechanism of cardiovascular adverse effect due to ATO exposure has not been fully elucidated except for alteration on ion channels. To evaluate the cytotoxic effect of ATO on cardiac myocytes, primary culture of myocytes was treated with different doses (30, 60 and 90 microM) of ATO for various periods (24, 48 and 72 h). Cardiac toxicity was assessed by monitoring cell viability, mitochondrial and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integrity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, calcium overload and apoptosis. ATO exposure caused alteration in mitochondrial integrity, generation of ROS, calcium overload and apoptosis in cardiac cells in dose- and duration-dependent manner. There was no DNA fragmentation. Hence our results show that ATO causes apoptosis in cardiomyocytes by generation of ROS and the induction of calcium overload.","['Raghu, K G', 'Cherian, Ozhathil Lijo']","['Raghu KG', 'Cherian OL']","['Pharmacology Division, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 226001, India. raghukgopal@rediffmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20081223,Germany,J Trace Elem Med Biol,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),9508274,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/07/10 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2008/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2008/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0946-672X(08)00101-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtemb.2008.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Trace Elem Med Biol. 2009;23(1):61-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jtemb.2008.10.001.

Her past medical history was remarkable for easy fatigability, weight loss, low-grade fever, hypogammaglobulinemia and mild hepatosplenomegaly manifested over the past 6 years. Several liver and bone marrow biopsies during that period had shown a nonspecific polyclonal T-cell infiltration, and she was administered low-dose steroids for symptomatic relief. Physical examination, laboratory workup and imaging studies at presentation showed pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, large symmetric kidneys with normal cortices and no evidence of obstructive uropathy, aseptic pyuria with neutrophils and lymphocytes and mild proteinuria. On biopsy the renal interstitium was infiltrated by large, granular CD3+CD8+CD56-CD57+ lymphocytes, clonal by molecular analysis, which established the diagnosis of T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia. Most urinary and peripheral blood lymphocytes bore the same T-LGL surface markers and were also clonal, as shown by flow-cytometry and PCR amplification of the T-cell receptor g-chain genes. A subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed infiltration by lymphoma cells and excluded a myelodysplastic or hemophagocytic syndrome. After exclusion of an underlying EBV, CMV, HBV, HCV or HIV infection with negative serology and blood PCR the patient received one cycle of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone. No improvement of renal function was achieved, while complication with a prolonged pulmonary infection and severe sepsis precluded further treatment. Our report indicates that the T-LGL leukemia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of renal failure with large-sized kidneys, especially when hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia and aseptic pyuria are also present. In the latter case, flow-cytometric and clonality analysis of the urine sediment can aid in establishing a diagnosis. Since renal function may deteriorate rapidly, chemotherapy should not be delayed.","['Christopoulos, P D', 'Katsoudas, S', 'Androulaki, A', 'Nakopoulou, L', 'Economopoulos, T', 'Vlahakos, D V']","['Christopoulos PD', 'Katsoudas S', 'Androulaki A', 'Nakopoulou L', 'Economopoulos T', 'Vlahakos DV']","['Department of Medicine II, Attikon University Hospital, Medical School of the University of Athens, Athens, Greece. petros.christopoulos@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Clin Nephrol,Clinical nephrology,0364441,,IM,"['Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*diagnosis/urine', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*diagnosis/urine', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/04/17 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/17 09:00 [medline]']","['5410 [pii]', '10.5414/cnp71198 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Nephrol. 2009 Feb;71(2):198-202. doi: 10.5414/cnp71198.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of LIF targets and of genes regulating the transition between pluripotent and early differentiated cells is a critical step for understanding the control of ES cell pluripotency. RESULTS: By gene profiling studies carried out with mRNAs from ES cells and their early derivatives treated or not with LIF, we have identified i) LIF-dependent genes, highly expressed in pluripotent cells, whose expression level decreases sharply upon LIF withdrawal [Pluri genes], ii) LIF induced genes [Lifind genes] whose expression is differentially regulated depending upon cell context and iii) genes specific to the reversible or irreversible committed states. In addition, by hierarchical gene clustering, we have identified, among eight independent gene clusters, two atypical groups of genes, whose expression level was highly modulated in committed cells only. Computer based analyses led to the characterization of different sub-types of Pluri and Lifind genes, and revealed their differential modulation by Oct4 or Nanog master genes. Individual knock down of a selection of Pluri and Lifind genes leads to weak changes in the expression of early differentiation markers, in cell growth conditions in which these master genes are still expressed. CONCLUSION: We have identified different sets of LIF-regulated genes depending upon the cell state (reversible or irreversible commitment), which allowed us to present a novel global view of LIF responses. We are also reporting on the identification of genes whose expression is strictly regulated during the commitment step. Furthermore, our studies identify sub-networks of genes with a restricted expression in pluripotent ES cells, whose down regulation occurs while the master knot (composed of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG) is still expressed and which might be down-regulated together for driving cells towards differentiation.","['Trouillas, Marina', 'Saucourt, Claire', 'Guillotin, Bertrand', 'Gauthereau, Xavier', 'Ding, Li', 'Buchholz, Frank', 'Doss, Michael Xavier', 'Sachinidis, Agapios', 'Hescheler, Jurgen', 'Hummel, Oliver', 'Huebner, Norbert', 'Kolde, Raivo', 'Vilo, Jaak', 'Schulz, Herbert', 'Boeuf, Helene']","['Trouillas M', 'Saucourt C', 'Guillotin B', 'Gauthereau X', 'Ding L', 'Buchholz F', 'Doss MX', 'Sachinidis A', 'Hescheler J', 'Hummel O', 'Huebner N', 'Kolde R', 'Vilo J', 'Schulz H', 'Boeuf H']","['Universite Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090209,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice/*genetics', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2008/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-10-73 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-10-73 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2009 Feb 9;10:73. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-10-73.,,,,,PMC2674464,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of additional transgene sequences, for example, increases the length of the viral genome, which can lead to reductions in replication efficiency and in turn to vector genome instability. This necessitates efforts to analyse the rate and mechanism of recombinant emergence during the replication of such vectors to provide data which should contribute to improvements in RCR vector design. RESULTS: In this study, we have performed detailed molecular analyses on packaged vector genomes and proviral DNA following propagation of MLV-based RCR vectors both in cell culture and in pre-formed subcutaneous tumours in vivo. The effects of strain of MLV, transgene position and host cell type on the rate of emergence of vector recombinants were quantitatively analysed by applying real-time PCR and real-time RT-PCR assays. Individual mutants were further characterized by PCR, and nucleotide sequence and structural motifs associated with these mutants were determined by sequencing. Our data indicate that virus strain, vector design and host cell influence the rate of emergence of predominating vector mutants, but not the underlying recombination mechanisms in vitro. In contrast, however, differences in the RNA secondary structural motifs associated with sequenced mutants emerging in cell culture and in solid tumours in vivo were observed. CONCLUSION: Our data provide further evidence that MLV-based RCR vectors based on the Moloney strain of MLV and containing the transgene cassette in the 3' UTR region are superior to those based on Akv-MLV and/or containing the transgene cassette in the U3 region of the LTR. The observed discrepancies between the data obtained in solid tumours in vivo and our own and previously published data from infected cells in vitro demonstrates the importance of evaluating vectors designed for use in cancer gene therapy in vivo as well as in vitro.","['Paar, Matthias', 'Klein, Dieter', 'Salmons, Brian', 'Gunzburg, Walter H', 'Renner, Matthias', 'Portsmouth, Daniel']","['Paar M', 'Klein D', 'Salmons B', 'Gunzburg WH', 'Renner M', 'Portsmouth D']","['Department of Pathobiology, Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. matthias.paar@vu-wien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090209,England,BMC Mol Biol,BMC molecular biology,100966983,,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Recombination, Genetic/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/03/05 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2008/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/05 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2199-10-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2199-10-8 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Mol Biol. 2009 Feb 9;10:8. doi: 10.1186/1471-2199-10-8.,,,,,PMC2645402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Bcr-Abl-independent signalling pathways may be activated and contributed to imatinib resistance in some CML (chronic myelogenous leukaemia) patients. We had isolated three imatinib-resistant K562/R1, R2 and R3 variants with gradual loss of Bcr-Abl from K562 cells to develop effective therapeutic strategies for imatinib-resistant CML. Interestingly, we found that these cells became highly sensitive to TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing factor) in comparison with K562 cells showing high resistance to TRAIL. Treatment of K562/R3 cells with TRAIL resulted in activation of TRAIL receptor pathway by including caspase 8 activation, Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation. These results were accompanied by down-regulation of c-FLIP {cellular FLICE [FADD (Fas-associated death domain)-like interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme]-inhibitory protein} in imatinib-resistant K562 variants compared with K562 cells. Overexpression of c-FLIP in K562/R3 cells acquired TRAIL resistance and conversely, c-FLIP-silenced K562 cells became sensitive to TRAIL. Moreover, Bcr-Abl-silenced K562 cells showed down-regulation of c-FLIP and the subsequent overcome of TRAIL resistance. Taken together, our results demonstrated for the first time that the loss of Bcr-Abl in imatinib-resistant cells led to the down-regulation of c-FLIP and subsequent increase of TRAIL sensitivity, suggesting that TRAIL could be an effective strategy for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML with loss of Bcr-Abl.","['Park, Soo-Jung', 'Kim, Mi-Ju', 'Kim, Hak-Bong', 'Kang, Chi-Dug', 'Kim, Sun-Hee']","['Park SJ', 'Kim MJ', 'Kim HB', 'Kang CD', 'Kim SH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan 622-770, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090428,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/physiology']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/05/21 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/21 09:00 [medline]']","['BJ20082131 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20082131 [doi]']",epublish,Biochem J. 2009 Apr 28;420(1):73-81. doi: 10.1042/BJ20082131.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective analysis of data reported to the Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry by the seven paediatric HSCT institutions in Australia and New Zealand over the 9-year period 1998-2006, with particular focus on the most recent years (2002-2006). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Types of HSCT performed; transplant-related mortality (TRM); stem cell sources; indications for HSCT; causes of death after HSCT. RESULTS: Over the period 1998-2006, 522 autologous HSCT procedures (41%) and 737 allogeneic procedures (59%) were performed. About 60% of allogeneic transplants involved alternative donors (donors other than a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling). The use of umbilical cord blood as a source of haemopoietic stem cells has doubled since 1998, with 34% of allogeneic transplants in 2006 using cord blood. Over the period 2002-2006, the median age of patients receiving transplants was 7 years (range, 0-19 years). The most common indications for allogeneic HSCT were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (33%) and acute myeloid leukaemia (24%). The most common indications for autologous HSCT were neuroblastoma (23%), medulloblastoma (21%) and Ewing sarcoma (10%). TRM at 1 year after transplant was 22% for alternative donor transplants, 7% for matched-sibling transplants and 5% for autologous transplants. Relapse or persistence of a child's underlying condition accounted for 54% of all deaths within 1 year after transplant. CONCLUSIONS: HSCT is an important procedure for children with a range of life-threatening illnesses. Local trends in the indications for HSCT, donor selection and TRM reflect contemporary international practice.","['Moore, Andrew S', 'Shaw, Peter J', 'Hallahan, Andrew R', 'Carter, Tina L', 'Kilo, Tatjana', 'Nivison-Smith, Ian', ""O'Brien, Tracey A"", 'Tapp, Heather', 'Teague, Lochie', 'Wilson, Shaun R', 'Tiedemann, Karin']","['Moore AS', 'Shaw PJ', 'Hallahan AR', 'Carter TL', 'Kilo T', 'Nivison-Smith I', ""O'Brien TA"", 'Tapp H', 'Teague L', 'Wilson SR', 'Tiedemann K']","[""Oncology/Haematology Service, Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, QLD.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Med J Aust,The Medical journal of Australia,0400714,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Australia', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'New Zealand', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/04/04 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2008/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/04 09:00 [medline]']","['moo10299_fm [pii]', '10.5694/j.1326-5377.2009.tb02309.x [doi]']",ppublish,Med J Aust. 2009 Feb 2;190(3):121-5. doi: 10.5694/j.1326-5377.2009.tb02309.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In allosteric proteins a signal originating at one site in the molecule is communicated through the protein structure to trigger a specific response at a remote site. Using NMR relaxation dispersion techniques we directly observe the dynamic process through which the KIX domain of CREB binding protein communicates allosteric information between binding sites. KIX mediates cooperativity between pairs of transcription factors through binding to two distinct interaction surfaces in an allosteric manner. We show that binding the activation domain of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) transcription factor to KIX induces a redistribution of the relative populations of KIX conformations toward a high-energy state in which the allosterically activated second binding site is already preformed, consistent with the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (WMC) model of allostery. The structural rearrangement process that links the two conformers and by which allosteric information is communicated occurs with a time constant of 3 ms at 27 degrees C.

With an increasing number of children cancer survivors the identification of the short-term or late effects becomes more detailed. The psychosocial and cognitive problems are of the most frequent sequelae of the cancer treatment and their prevalence is nearly 20% in survivors of childhood cancer. These problems can have an adverse impact on further professional career or private life in the childhood cancer survivors. The most threatened group of patients are children treated for brain tumors and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN: The object of this paper is to review the present information in the area of the neuropsychological sequelae in the childhood cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of the specific cognitive problems in childhood cancer survivors can have the profound impact on improvement of the support delivered to the children and adolescents by their families, in the school and further career. Tailored interventions can have the positive impact on the quality of life of this subgroup of children. Multidisciplinary approach including routine psychological screening is necessary for addressed follow-up care concerning this vulnerable at-risk population.","['Vlckova, I', 'Pavelkova, K', 'Kepak, T', 'Pilat, M', 'Bajciova, V', 'Mazanek, P', 'Sterba, J', 'Jelinek, M']","['Vlckova I', 'Pavelkova K', 'Kepak T', 'Pilat M', 'Bajciova V', 'Mazanek P', 'Sterba J', 'Jelinek M']","['FN Brno, Oddeleni Detske Psychiatrie a Klinicke Psychologie.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Czech Republic,Klin Onkol,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,9425213,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/psychology/*therapy', 'Quality of Life']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Klin Onkol. 2008;21(5):294-302.,,84,,,,Zmeny v oblasti neurokognitivnich funkci v dusledku lecby nadorovych onemocneni deti a dospivajicich.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis of MPS is often difficult due to need of differential diagnosis with reactive proliferation caused by primarily non-hematological factors. Differentiation of individual MPS forms is also difficult because of overlapping of particular clinical or laboratory adnormalities. Discovery of specific molecular aberrations in the last few years facilitates diagnostic procedures. The discovered gene mutations or their fusions are associated with production of proteins possessing tyrosine kinase properties. These discoveries resulted in the successful introduction of the targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the recent years.","['Hellmann, Andrzej']",['Hellmann A'],"['Department of Hematology and Transplantology, Medical University, Gdansk, Poland. klhem@amg.gda.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Poland,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej,0401225,,IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/diagnosis/therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/classification/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocytosis/diagnosis/therapy']",2009/02/11 09:00,2009/03/25 09:00,['2009/02/11 09:00'],"['2009/02/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pol Arch Med Wewn. 2008 Dec;118(12):756-60.,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report results of prospective monitoring for alloimmunization in our recent CBT experience. Among 46 consecutive patients, four patients (9%) (5 of 88 units [6%]) had evidence of at least moderate antibodies to HLA antigens on cord units originally selected for transplantation.

Patients were divided into 2 groups. The first group included 49 patients (25 men and 24 women, average age was 41.2+/-2.1) with malignant blood diseases. The second group consisted of 50 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (39 men and 11 women, average age was 38.8+/-9.36).

The LV systolic-diastolic function was evaluated twice using echo CG. Consistent dose-dependent evolution of doxorubicin cardio toxicity was observed, which eventually resulted in development of anthracycline myocardiopathy. Doxorubicin cardio toxicity is evident as early as at low total doses (232 mg/m(2)); at a ""critical dose"" (356-388 mg/m(2)) LV diastolic dysfunction with clinical signs of HF develops; at a total dose of 533 mg/m(2) anthracycline dilated myocardiopathy with LV systolic-diastolic dysfunction and clinical signs of HF develops in 100% of cases.

Malignancies derived from mature B cells constitute the majority of leukemias and lymphomas. These malignancies often maintain the characteristics of the normal B cells that they are derived from, a feature that is frequently used in their diagnosis. The role of microRNAs in mature B cells is largely unknown. Through concomitant microRNA and mRNA profiling, we demonstrate a potential regulatory role for microRNAs at every stage of the mature B-cell differentiation process. In addition, we have experimentally identified a direct role for the microRNA regulation of key transcription factors in B-cell differentiation: LMO2 and PRDM1 (Blimp1). We also profiled the microRNA of B-cell tumors derived from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We found that, in contrast to many other malignancies, common B-cell malignancies do not down-regulate microRNA expression. Although these tumors could be distinguished from each other with use of microRNA expression, each tumor type maintained the expression of the lineage-specific microRNAs. Expression of these lineage-specific microRNAs could correctly predict the lineage of B-cell malignancies in more than 95% of the cases. Thus, our data demonstrate that microRNAs may be important in maintaining the mature B-cell phenotype in normal and malignant B cells.","['Zhang, Jenny', 'Jima, Dereje D', 'Jacobs, Cassandra', 'Fischer, Randy', 'Gottwein, Eva', 'Huang, Grace', 'Lugar, Patricia L', 'Lagoo, Anand S', 'Rizzieri, David A', 'Friedman, Daphne R', 'Weinberg, J Brice', 'Lipsky, Peter E', 'Dave, Sandeep S']","['Zhang J', 'Jima DD', 'Jacobs C', 'Fischer R', 'Gottwein E', 'Huang G', 'Lugar PL', 'Lagoo AS', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Friedman DR', 'Weinberg JB', 'Lipsky PE', 'Dave SS']","['Duke Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090206,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/02/10 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/02/10 09:00'],"['2009/02/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39185-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-178186 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 May 7;113(19):4586-94. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-09-178186.

Similarly, the hetero-oligomeric interaction with transcriptional repressor ETO family proteins and the highly conserved NHR1 domain in AE fusion are also dispensable for transforming activity. In contrast, AE-mediated transformation is critically dependent on the DNA binding and homo-oligomeric properties of the fusion. Abolishment of homo-oligomerization by a small-molecule inhibitor could specifically suppress AML1 fusion-mediated transformation of primary hematopoietic cells. Together, these results not only identify the essential molecular components but also potential avenues for therapeutic targeting of AE-mediated leukemogenesis.","['Kwok, Colin', 'Zeisig, Bernd B', 'Qiu, Jihui', 'Dong, Shuo', 'So, Chi Wai Eric']","['Kwok C', 'Zeisig BB', 'Qiu J', 'Dong S', 'So CW']","['Hemato-Oncology Section, The Institute of Cancer Research, Greater London SM2 5NG, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090206,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biopolymers)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biopolymers/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2009/02/10 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2009/02/10 09:00'],"['2009/02/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']","['0810558106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0810558106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Feb 24;106(8):2853-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0810558106.

Our previous study reported that atypical protein kinase C zeta (PKCzeta) regulates epidermal growth factor-induced chemotaxis of human breast cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the role of PKCzeta in CSF-1-induced chemotaxis of macrophages. Knockdown of PKCzeta by small interference RNA impaired CSF-1-induced chemotaxis of human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1, which was probably a result of a decrease in CSF-1-induced phosphorylation of LIN-11, Is11, and MEC-3 protein domain kinase (LIMK)/cofilin and actin polymerization. Furthermore, silencing PKCzeta expression also impaired migration of mouse peritoneal macrophages. Scratch analysis indicated that PKCzeta was required for macrophage migration. Therefore, PKCzeta is required for CSF-1-induced chemotaxis of macrophages. Blocking activation of PKCzeta will be a novel strategy to inhibit cancer metastasis by blocking migration of cancer cells and macrophages.","['Guo, Hua', 'Ma, Yongjie', 'Zhang, Baogang', 'Sun, Baocun', 'Niu, Ruifang', 'Ying, Guoguang', 'Zhang, Ning']","['Guo H', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang B', 'Sun B', 'Niu R', 'Ying G', 'Zhang N']","['Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences and Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, 300060, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090206,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (protein kinase C zeta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL2/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism']",2009/02/10 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2009/02/10 09:00'],"['2009/02/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0708429 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0708429 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2009 Jun;85(6):911-8. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0708429.

A recombinant p24 (rp24) was expressed in the Escherichia coli expression system, purified in a nickel charged resin and used as antigen in the ELISA test. A cut-off point was established considering the distribution of reactivity values obtained by rp24-ELISA on a set of 555 field serum samples that were stated as double positive (DP) or double negative (DN) by the combination of commercial agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) assay and gp51-ELISA tests results. The rp24-ELISA showed good concordance with the agar gel immunodiffusion assay, when 710 serum samples were analyzed. In addition, rp24-ELISA demonstrated to be a precise assay with good repeatability and reproducibility and a better analytical sensitivity than AGID. From 67 discordant rp24-ELISA-AGID sera, 4 negative reactors were from the DP group, 28 positive samples were from the DN group and 35 positive samples were stated as negative by AGID but positive by the gp51-ELISA. Samples from this last subgroup were sent to an OIE reference laboratory where 28 samples were stated as negative, 5 samples were stated as positive and 2 as inconclusive. Complete concordance with blind previous results from an international proficiency test panel confirmed the capability of the assay to discriminate between infected and non-infected animals. In conclusion, the rp24-ELISA developed and standardized demonstrated to have good analytical characteristics to be considered for screening of BLV.","['Gutierrez, G', 'Alvarez, I', 'Fondevila, N', 'Politzki, R', 'Lomonaco, M', 'Rodriguez, S', 'Dus Santos, M J', 'Trono, K']","['Gutierrez G', 'Alvarez I', 'Fondevila N', 'Politzki R', 'Lomonaco M', 'Rodriguez S', 'Dus Santos MJ', 'Trono K']","['Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, INTA, C.C. 1712, Castelar, Buenos Aires, Argentina. ggutierrez@cnia.inta.gov.ar']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090120,Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (core protein p24, bovine leukemia virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Cattle', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/*veterinary', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Viral Core Proteins/*immunology']",2009/02/10 09:00,2009/10/22 06:00,['2009/02/10 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1135(09)00042-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.01.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2009 Jun 12;137(3-4):224-34. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.01.022.

Hematological disorders associated with hypereosinophilias can be classified as clonal, reactive or idiopathic, and recently the improvements of cytogenetic, molecular biology and immunology have allowed to revisit numerous cases previously diagnosed as idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Reactive eosinophilias are mainly associated with lymphoma or abnormal, often clonal T lymphoid population. Clonal eosinophilia is related either to various myeloid malignancies or to a genuine myeloproliferative disorder from the eosinophile lineage, the so-called chronic eosinophilic leukaemia. Chronic eosinophilic leukaemia can be associated with recurrent genes rearrangements involving PDGFRA, PDGFRB and FGFR1 or with clonal abnormalities not yet categorized. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome remains an exclusive diagnosis in presence of moderate or severe unexplained eosinophilia with target organ damage. The purpose of the diagnostic work-up of hypereosinophilic syndrome is to evidence either an abnormal T cell population or a clonal haematopoiesis. Imatinib mesylate dramatically improves chronic eosinophilic leukaemias associated with PDGFR abnormalities, while corticosteroids are still the main treatment for the other patients. In a near future, advances could arise from identification of new genes involved in clonal eosinophilia or in alternative therapy such as the anti-IL-5 antibodies.","['Malfuson, J-V', 'Fagot, T', 'Konopacki, J', 'Mangouka, L', 'Souleau, B', 'de Revel, T']","['Malfuson JV', 'Fagot T', 'Konopacki J', 'Mangouka L', 'Souleau B', 'de Revel T']","[""Service d'hematologie clinique, hopital d'instruction des Armees Percy, 101, avenue Henri-Barbusse, BP406, 92141 Clamart, France. jvmalf@free.fr""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20090207,France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Eosinophilia/etiology/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Diseases/*classification/complications', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/drug therapy/*etiology/genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/genetics']",2009/02/10 09:00,2009/07/30 09:00,['2009/02/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2008/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/30 09:00 [medline]']","['S0248-8663(08)00880-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.revmed.2008.10.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 2009 Apr;30(4):322-30. doi: 10.1016/j.revmed.2008.10.019.

We examined the role of telomerase in mediating the growth suppression of human acute lymphoblastic leukemic CEM cells by AMR-Me. The results showed that AMR-Me inhibited the growth and viability of CEM cells, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G(2)+M phase. AMR-Me treatment resulted in suppression of hTERT expression and a concomitant inhibition of telomerase activity. The in vivo antitumor activity of AMR-Me was determined using mice inoculated with Dalton's lymphoma ascites tumor cells. Intraperitoneal administration of the AMR-Me at doses of 1 or 3mg/kg, increased the survival rate by 121% and 133% respectively, without weight change over the treatment period. Our results suggest that AMR-Me inhibits telomerase activity by decreasing the hTERT expression and induces apoptosis in human lymphoblastic leukemic CEM cells, thus providing the molecular basis for the development of AMR-Me as a novel chemotherapeutic agent against leukemia.","['Rabi, Thangaiyan', 'Banerjee, Sipra']","['Rabi T', 'Banerjee S']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.

Previous studies showed that Scl is essential for embryonic and adult erythropoiesis, while Lyl1 is important for B cell development. Single-knockout mice have not revealed an essential function for Scl or Lyl1 in adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To determine if maintenance of HSCs in single-knockout mice is due to functional redundancy, we generated Lyl1;Scl-conditional double-knockout mice. Here, we report a striking genetic interaction between the two genes, with a clear dose dependence for the presence of Scl or Lyl1 alleles for HSC function. Bone marrow repopulation assays and analyses demonstrated rapid loss of hematopoietic progenitors due to apoptosis. The function of HSCs could be rescued by a single allele of Lyl1 but not Scl. These results show that expression of at least one of these factors is essential for maintenance of adult HSC function.","['Souroullas, George P', 'Salmon, Jessica M', 'Sablitzky, Fred', 'Curtis, David J', 'Goodell, Margaret A']","['Souroullas GP', 'Salmon JM', 'Sablitzky F', 'Curtis DJ', 'Goodell MA']","['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Lyl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2009/02/10 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/02/10 09:00'],"['2008/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(09)00004-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2009.01.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2009 Feb 6;4(2):180-6. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2009.01.001.,,,,"['R01 HL096360/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 08100/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB005173/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB005173-04/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'EB 005173/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK058192-09/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK058192/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 58192/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HL081007-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2672304,,['NIHMS100258'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphorylation of Tax on serine residues 300/301 was a prerequisite for Tax localization in the nucleus and correlated with its subsequent acetylation by p300, whereas sumoylation, resulting in the formation of Tax nuclear bodies in which p300 was recruited, favored Tax acetylation. Overexpression of p300 markedly increased Tax acetylation and the ability of a wild type HTLV-1 provirus, but not of a mutant provirus carrying an acetylation deficient Tax gene, to activate gene expression from an integrated NF-kappaB-controlled promoter.

However, emergence of imatinib-resistance has put up a serious problem that requires novel treatment methods. Catechins, polyphenolic compounds in green tea, are gathering much attention due to their potential antitumor effects. So far (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant component of catechin, has been shown to cause typical apoptosis in several tumor cell lines in most cases through activation of caspases. In this study, we showed that EGCG predominantly caused necrosis-like cell death via a caspase-independent mechanism in CML cells, K562 and C2F8, whereas imatinib induced the typical apoptotic cell death. Moreover, this caspase-independent cell death partially mediated the release of apoptosis-inducing factor, AIF, and serine protease, HtrA2/Omi, from the mitochondria to cytosol. In addition, EGCG enhanced the imatinib-induced cell death (P < 0.01) resulting in additive cell death in K562 cells and EGCG alone, effectively reduced the viability of imatinib-resistant K562 cells (P < 0.01). Catechin is a possible candidate for an antitumor agent that causes cell death in CML cells via a caspase-independent mechanism.","['Iwasaki, Reo', 'Ito, Kinji', 'Ishida, Takaomi', 'Hamanoue, Makoto', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Sato, Yuko']","['Iwasaki R', 'Ito K', 'Ishida T', 'Hamanoue M', 'Adachi S', 'Watanabe T', 'Sato Y']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shiroganedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Tea)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Necrosis', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Tea/*chemistry']",2009/02/10 09:00,2011/04/27 06:00,['2009/02/10 09:00'],"['2009/02/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1046 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01046.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2009 Feb;100(2):349-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01046.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite current treatment protocols achieving rapid cytoreduction in the vast majority of patients, serious acute and late complications are frequent and resistance to chemotherapy often develops. In contrast to the successes obtained with pediatric patients, treatment outcomes for adults remain poor with only 40% of patients being long-term survivors.

TcsL exhibits glucosyltransferase activity to inactivate Rho and Ras proteins. On cultured cells, TcsL causes actin reorganization (""cytopathic effect"") and apoptotic cell death (""cytotoxic effect""). This study is based on the concept that the cytotoxic effects of TcsL depend on the glucosylation of critical substrate proteins rather than on the glucosyltransferase activity per se. The cytotoxic effects of TcsL depend on the glucosyltransferase activity of TcsL, as neither chemically inactivated TcsL nor a glucosyltransferase-deficient mutant version of TcsL caused it. The TcsL homologous toxin B from Clostridium difficile serotype F strain 1470 (TcdBF) also failed to cause cytotoxic effects. Correlation of the toxins' respective protein substrate specificities highlighted (H/K/N)Ras as critical substrate proteins for the cytotoxic effects. (H/K/N)Ras are critical upstream regulators of phosphatidylinositide 3'-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival signaling. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) classified to activate PI3K/Akt signaling downstream of apoptosis-inducing stimuli prevented the cytotoxic effects of TcsL.

We examined the expression of the CDH13 gene and BCR/ABL fusion gene using EVA Green real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The expression of the BCR/ABL fusion gene in the patients with blastic crisis CML was 4.72 folds as that of the patients with primary CML. The expression of the CDH13 gene in the primary and blastic crisis CML patients was significantly reduced to 36% and 25% of that in healthy controls, respectively. Moreover, negative correlation was found between the expressions of these two genes. CONCLUSION: The study showed that the reduction of the CDH13 expression at different clinical stage of CML may account for the defective cell adhesion in CML, and the expression of the CDH13 gene was probably down-regulated by the BCR/ABL fusion gene.","['Mu, Hui-jun', 'Xie, Ping', 'Shen, Yun-feng', 'Jiang, Yuan-qiang']","['Mu HJ', 'Xie P', 'Shen YF', 'Jiang YQ']","['Central Laboratory Wuxi Peopleos Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, 214023 PR China. wxmuhj@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (H-cadherin)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cadherins/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/02/10 09:00,2009/05/21 09:00,['2009/02/10 09:00'],"['2009/02/10 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/21 09:00 [medline]']","['940626023 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2009.01.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Feb;26(1):98-101. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2009.01.023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The frequencies of HLA-A-B, B-DRB1, A-B-DR haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium were estimated by Expectation Maximization method based on the genotypes of 643 patients with ALL and 2 0359 unrelated healthy donors, and the statistical significance between the two groups were estimated by chi-square test. Linkage disequilibrium was analyzed with population genetic methods. RESULTS: The most common HLA-A-B, B-DRB1, and A-B-DR haplotypes were A30-B13, A2-B46, A33-B58, B13-DR7, B46-DR9, B52-DR15, B58-DR17, A30-B13-DR7, A33-B58-DR17 and A1-B37-DR10 in both groups. The frequencies of A30-B13, A2-B46, A33-B44, B13-DR7, A30-B13-DR7 and A2-B46-DR9 haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium value were significantly decreased (P<0.05) in the patient group than that in the control group.

METHODS: One hundred and twelve adult patients with previously untreated B-ALL were prospectively investigated by interphase dual-color dual-fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (DD-FISH) with two-color break apart probe BCR-ABL and the results were compared with that of conventional cytogenetics (CC). RESULTS: The incidence of Ph chromosome was 17.98% (16/89) and 31.25% (35/112) by CC and DD-FISH, respectively. The mean positive rate of Ph+cells by FISH was 66.23% (ranging 18.5%-99%). Of the 35 Ph+ALL patients by FISH, 25 were successfully karyotyped by CC which included 5 normal karyotypes, 20 abnormal karyotypes including 16 Ph chromosome and 13 complex abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The incidence of Ph chromosome was 31.25% in adult with B-ALL. DD-FISH with BCR-ABL probe provides a powerful technique for the diagnosis of Ph+B-ALL. It is an important supplement to the CC analysis.

Successful implantation requires a receptive endometrium, a normal and functional embryo at the blastocyst stage, and a synchronized dialogue between maternal and embryonic tissues. In addition to the well-characterized role of sex steroids, the complexity of embryo implantation and placentation is exemplified by the number of cytokines and growth factors with demonstrated roles in these processes. Disturbances in the normal expression and action of these cytokines result in an absolute or partial failure of implantation and abnormal placental formation in mice and human. Members of the gp130 cytokine family, interleukin-11 (IL-11) and leukemia inhibitory factor, the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, the colony-stimulating factors, and the IL-1 and IL-15 systems are crucial molecules for a successful implantation. Chemokines are also important, both in recruiting specific cohorts of leukocytes to the implantation site and in trophoblast trafficking and differentiation. This review provides discussion of the embryonic and uterine factors that are involved in the process of implantation in autocrine, paracrine, and/or juxtacrine manners at the hormonal, cellular, and molecular levels.","['Guzeloglu-Kayisli, Ozlem', 'Kayisli, Umit Ali', 'Taylor, Hugh S']","['Guzeloglu-Kayisli O', 'Kayisli UA', 'Taylor HS']","['Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520-8063, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20090205,United States,Semin Reprod Med,Seminars in reproductive medicine,100909394,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Embryo Implantation/genetics/*physiology', 'Embryonic Development/genetics/physiology', 'Endocrine Cells/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Paracrine Communication/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology']",2009/02/07 09:00,2009/04/03 09:00,['2009/02/07 09:00'],"['2009/02/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0028-1108011 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Reprod Med. 2009 Jan;27(1):62-79. doi: 10.1055/s-0028-1108011.

Although elderly patients represent the largest group of CLL patients they are clearly underrepresented in clinical trials. One important prognostic factor in the elderly is the burden of comorbidity. Survival is significantly impaired in CLL patients with multiple comorbidities (>or=2) or with severe comorbidity (Charlson score >or=2). Therefore, not only age but also the incidence and burden of comorbidity should influence the choice of treatment strategy for every patient individually. A reliable tool for measuring comorbidity is the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. The German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG) has used this tool within their clinical trials to distinguish between physically fit and non-fit patients. Although chlorambucil is still the standard treatment of choice in non-fit patients, dose-reduced purine analogue-based combination therapies with or without immunotherapy are currently investigated within clinical trials. Because full-dosed combination treatment might cause increased toxicity rates in relapse situation, dose-reduced combination therapies should be considered in this situation. An adequate supportive treatment is necessary for the prevention of toxicities as well as for the improvement of health-related quality of life. In summary, the treatment decision in elderly CLL patients is carefully to be made in each patient individually considering not only the stage and risk factors of the disease but also the patients' physical condition and social environment.","['Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Goede, Valentin', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Eichhorst B', 'Goede V', 'Hallek M']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, Center of Integrated Oncology Koln Bonn, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. barbara.eichhorst@uk-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of Life', 'Recurrence']",2009/02/07 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2009/02/07 09:00'],"['2009/02/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]']","['908511306 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802688517 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2009 Feb;50(2):171-8. doi: 10.1080/10428190802688517.,,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may be due in part to the fact that the leukemia-initiating cells in AML reside within the rare and highly primitive CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSC) population that are often resistant to chemotherapy. Docosahexanoic acid (DHA), a major component of fish oil, has previously been shown to inhibit the induction and progression of breast, prostate and colon cancer, and increase the therapeutic effects of numerous chemotherapeutics, often by enhancing apoptosis. In the present studies, we investigated DHA's effect on the primitive and undifferentiated AML cell line KG1a, to explore the potential of this fatty acid to serve as adjuvant therapy for AML. Treatment of KG1a cells with DHA for 96 hours did not lead to maturation or cell cycle modification when compared to an untreated KG1a control (n = 4). However, DHA treatment of KG1a cells resulted in a progressive loss of viability, DNA fragmentation, and an increase in Annexin V expression, demonstrating DHA-induced apoptosis (n = 4). Moreover, expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax was increased, with resultant skewing in the Bax/bcl-2 ratio, providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed DHA-induced increase in apoptosis. Since we also show that DHA does not have a detrimental effect on normal hematopoiesis our results suggest that DHA could potentially serve as an well-tolerated adjuvant in the treatment of AML patients.","['Yamagami, Takashi', 'Porada, Christopher D', 'Pardini, Ronald S', 'Zanjani, Esmail D', 'Almeida-Porada, Graca']","['Yamagami T', 'Porada CD', 'Pardini RS', 'Zanjani ED', 'Almeida-Porada G']","['Department of Animal Biotechnology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557-0104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090203,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis']",2009/02/07 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2009/02/07 09:00'],"['2009/02/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]']","['7334 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.8.4.7334 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2009 Feb;8(4):331-7. doi: 10.4161/cbt.8.4.7334.

Administered as prodrugs, dFdC and ara-C are transported across cell membranes and are converted to cytotoxic derivatives through consecutive phosphorylation steps catalyzed by endogenous nucleoside kinases. Deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) controls the rate-limiting step in the activation cascade of dFdC and ara-C. DCK activity varies significantly among individuals and across different tumor types and is a critical determinant of tumor responses to these prodrugs. Current assays to measure DCK expression and activity require biopsy samples and are prone to sampling errors. Noninvasive methods that can detect DCK activity in tumor lesions throughout the body could circumvent these limitations. Here, we demonstrate an approach to detecting DCK activity in vivo by using positron emission tomography (PET) and (18)F-labeled 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroarabinofuranosyl) cytosine] ([(18)F]FAC), a PET probe recently developed by our group. We show that [(18)F]FAC is a DCK substrate with an affinity similar to that of dFdC. In vitro, accumulation of [(18)F]FAC in murine and human leukemia cell lines is critically dependent on DCK activity and correlates with dFdC sensitivity. In mice, [(18)F]FAC accumulates selectively in DCK-positive vs. DCK-negative tumors, and [(18)F]FAC microPET scans can predict responses to dFdC. We suggest that [(18)F]FAC PET might be useful for guiding treatment decisions in certain cancers by enabling individualized chemotherapy.","['Laing, Rachel E', 'Walter, Martin A', 'Campbell, Dean O', 'Herschman, Harvey R', 'Satyamurthy, Nagichettiar', 'Phelps, Michael E', 'Czernin, Johannes', 'Witte, Owen N', 'Radu, Caius G']","['Laing RE', 'Walter MA', 'Campbell DO', 'Herschman HR', 'Satyamurthy N', 'Phelps ME', 'Czernin J', 'Witte ON', 'Radu CG']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090205,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Positron-Emission Tomography']",2009/02/07 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2009/02/07 09:00'],"['2009/02/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]']","['0812890106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0812890106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Feb 24;106(8):2847-52. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0812890106.

Intracellular NAD is essential for cell survival, and NAD depletion resulting from APO866 treatment elicits tumor cell death. Here, we determine the in vitro and in vivo sensitivities of hematologic cancer cells to APO866 using a panel of cell lines (n = 45) and primary cells (n = 32). Most cancer cells (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], mantle cell lymphoma [MCL], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], and T-cell lymphoma), but not normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, were sensitive to low concentrations of APO866 as measured in cytotoxicity and clonogenic assays. Treatment with APO866 decreased intracellular NAD and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) at 24 hours and 48 to72 hours, respectively. The NAD depletion led to cell death. At 96 hours, APO866-mediated cell death occurred in a caspase-independent mode, and was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy. Further, in vivo administration of APO866 as a single agent prevented and abrogated tumor growth in animal models of human AML, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and leukemia without significant toxicity to the animals. The results support the potential of APO866 for treating hematologic malignancies.","['Nahimana, Aimable', 'Attinger, Antoine', 'Aubry, Dominique', 'Greaney, Peter', 'Ireson, Christopher', 'Thougaard, Annemette V', 'Tjornelund, Jette', 'Dawson, Keith M', 'Dupuis, Marc', 'Duchosal, Michel A']","['Nahimana A', 'Attinger A', 'Aubry D', 'Greaney P', 'Ireson C', 'Thougaard AV', 'Tjornelund J', 'Dawson KM', 'Dupuis M', 'Duchosal MA']","['Service of Hematology, University Hospital of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090205,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (N-(4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, human)']",IM,"['Acrylamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'NAD/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/02/07 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/02/07 09:00'],"['2009/02/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39387-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-08-173369 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 2;113(14):3276-86. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-08-173369.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The antagonistic activities of SDF-1betaP2G against CXCR4 were evaluated in vitro and in vivo and compared with phosphate-buffered saline and AMD3100 (a small bicyclam antagonist of SDF-1). Angiogenesis, muscle regeneration and the expression of pro-angiogenic factors were evaluated in ischaemic gastrocnemius muscles. Distant toxic effects of SDF-1betaP2G were evaluated by inflammatory and apoptotic markers. SDF-1betaP2G induced CXCR4 internalization and competitively inhibited the chemotaxis of SDF-1beta but did not mediate migration, calcium influx, or the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase in cultured T-lymphoblastic leukaemia cells or H9C2 cells. SDF-1betaP2G enhanced blood flow, angiogenesis, and muscle regeneration in ischaemic hind limbs, and the enhancement was significantly better than that of AMD3100. Markers of angiogenesis and progenitor cell migration, including phosphorylated Akt, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), SDF-1 and CXCR4, were up-regulated by SDF-1betaP2G and co-localized with CD31-positive cells. Neutralization of VEGF with its specific antibody abolished SDF-1betaP2G-induced blood reperfusion and angiogenesis. No apparent inflammatory and apoptotic effects were found in heart, liver, kidneys, and testes after SDF-1betaP2G administration. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the novel CXCR4 antagonist, SDF-1betaP2G, can efficiently enhance ischaemic angiogenesis, blood flow restoration, and muscle regeneration without apparent adverse effects, most likely through a VEGF-dependent pathway.","['Tan, Yi', 'Li, Yan', 'Xiao, Jian', 'Shao, Hongwei', 'Ding, Chuanlin', 'Arteel, Gavin E', 'Webster, Keith A', 'Yan, Jun', 'Yu, Hong', 'Cai, Lu', 'Li, Xiaokun']","['Tan Y', 'Li Y', 'Xiao J', 'Shao H', 'Ding C', 'Arteel GE', 'Webster KA', 'Yan J', 'Yu H', 'Cai L', 'Li X']","['Chinese-American Research Institute for Diabetic Complications, Wenzhou Medical College, Chashan College Park, Wenzhou 325035, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090205,England,Cardiovasc Res,Cardiovascular research,0077427,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CXCL12/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Escherichia coli', 'Hindlimb/*blood supply', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/chemically induced', 'Ischemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Skeletal/drug effects', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Regeneration/*drug effects', 'Regional Blood Flow/*drug effects', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/02/07 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/02/07 09:00'],"['2009/02/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']","['cvp044 [pii]', '10.1093/cvr/cvp044 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Res. 2009 Jun 1;82(3):513-21. doi: 10.1093/cvr/cvp044.

Upon Rho activation, several downstream events occur, such as morphological and cytoskeletal changes, motility, growth, survival, and gene transcription. The leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) is a member of the regulators of G-protein signaling homology domain (RH) family of GEFs originally identified as a result of chromosomal translocation in acute myeloid leukemia. Using a novel fluorescence polarization guanine nucleotide-binding assay using BODIPY-Texas Red-GTPgammaS (BODIPY-TR-GTPgammaS), the authors performed a 10,000-compound high-throughput screen for inhibitors of LARG-stimulated RhoA nucleotide binding. Five compounds identified from the high-throughput screen were confirmed in a nonfluorescent radioactive guanine nucleotide-binding assay measuring LARG-stimulated [( 35)S] GTPgammaS binding to RhoA, thus ruling out nonspecific fluorescent effects. All 5 compounds selectively inhibited LARG-stimulated RhoA [( 35)S] GTPgammaS binding but had little to no effect on RhoA or Galpha( o) [(35)S] GTPgammaS binding. Therefore, these 5 compounds should serve as promising starting points for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of LARG-mediated nucleotide exchange as both pharmacological tools and therapeutics. In addition, the fluorescence polarization guanine nucleotide-binding assay described here should serve as a useful approach for both high-throughput screening and general biological applications.","['Evelyn, Chris R', 'Ferng, Timothy', 'Rojas, Rafael J', 'Larsen, Martha J', 'Sondek, John', 'Neubig, Richard R']","['Evelyn CR', 'Ferng T', 'Rojas RJ', 'Larsen MJ', 'Sondek J', 'Neubig RR']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0632, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090204,United States,J Biomol Screen,Journal of biomolecular screening,9612112,"['0 (ARHGEF12 protein, human)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Fluorescence Polarization/methods', 'Growth Inhibitors/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism/*physiology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/metabolism/pharmacokinetics"", 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2009/02/07 09:00,2009/05/30 09:00,['2009/02/07 09:00'],"['2009/02/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [medline]']","['1087057108328761 [pii]', '10.1177/1087057108328761 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomol Screen. 2009 Feb;14(2):161-72. doi: 10.1177/1087057108328761.

RAD001 treatment of established disease increased the median survival of mice from 21.3 days to 42.3 days (P < .02). RAD001 together with vincristine significantly increased survival compared with either treatment alone (P < .02). RAD001 induced a cell-cycle arrest in the G(0/1) phase with associated dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, and reduced levels of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6. Ultrastructure analysis demonstrated the presence of autophagy and limited apoptosis in cells of RAD001-treated animals. In contrast, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase suggested apoptosis in cells from animals treated with vincristine or the combination of RAD001 and vincristine, but not in those receiving RAD001 alone.

Not only fructose, but also glucose, mannose, rhamnose and glucosamine could inhibit the lectin. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of its identical 15-kDa subunits was similar to lectins from other Musa species except for the deletion of the N-terminal glycine residue in Del Monte banana lectin. The hemagglutinating activity was stable up to 80 degrees C and also stable in the range pH 1-13. However, the hemagglutinating activity dwindled to an undetectable level at 90 degrees C. The lectin was capable of eliciting a mitogenic response in murine splenocytes and inducing the expression of the cytokines interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-2 in splenocytes. The lectin also inhibited proliferation of leukemia (L1210) cells and hepatoma (HepG2) cells and the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The additional information obtained in the present study includes demonstration of fructose-binding activity and cytokine-inducing activity of Del Monte banana lectin. Fructose binding is an unusual characteristic of plant lectins. It is possible that the banana lectin can be developed into a useful anti-HIV, immunopotentiating and antitumor agent in view of its trypsin stability and thermostability.","['Cheung, Allen H K', 'Wong, Jack H', 'Ng, T B']","['Cheung AH', 'Wong JH', 'Ng TB']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090204,Germany,Phytomedicine,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Lectins)', '30237-26-4 (Fructose)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fructose/*metabolism', 'Hemagglutination Tests', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lectins/isolation & purification/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Musa/*chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', 'Temperature']",2009/02/07 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/02/07 09:00'],"['2008/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['S0944-7113(08)00248-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phymed.2008.12.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Phytomedicine. 2009 Jun;16(6-7):594-600. doi: 10.1016/j.phymed.2008.12.016.

We investigated cellular and molecular effects of the three substances relative to cytarabine in Kasumi-1 AML blasts. Under in vitro conditions mimicking those used in clinical trials, the DNMT inhibitors inhibited proliferation and triggered apoptosis but did not induce myeloid differentiation. The DNMT inhibitors showed no interference with cell-cycle progression whereas cytarabine treatment resulted in an S-phase arrest. Quantitative methylation analysis of hypermethylated gene promoters and of genome-wide LINE1 fragments using bisulfite sequencing and MassARRAY suggested that the hypomethylating potency of decitabine was stronger than that of azacitidine; zebularine showed no hypomethylating activity. In a comparative gene expression analysis, we found that the effects of each DNMT inhibitor on gene transcription were surprisingly different, involving several genes relevant to leukemogenesis. In addition, the gene methylation and expression analyses suggested that the effects of DNMT-inhibiting cytosine nucleoside analogues on the cellular transcriptome may, in part, be unrelated to direct promoter DNA hypomethylation, as previously shown by others.","['Flotho, C', 'Claus, R', 'Batz, C', 'Schneider, M', 'Sandrock, I', 'Ihde, S', 'Plass, C', 'Niemeyer, C M', 'Lubbert, M']","['Flotho C', 'Claus R', 'Batz C', 'Schneider M', 'Sandrock I', 'Ihde S', 'Plass C', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Lubbert M']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. christian.flotho@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090205,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '7A9Y5SX0GY (pyrimidin-2-one beta-ribofuranoside)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology']",2009/02/06 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/02/06 09:00'],"['2009/02/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008397 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.397 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jun;23(6):1019-28. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.397.

Cytomorphology was characterized by parallel positive myeloperoxidase and non-specific esterase staining, therefore, French-American-British (FAB)-classification was impossible and origin of the AML with t(8;16) from an early stem cell with myeloid and monoblastic potential is hypothesized. Erythrophagocytosis was observed in 7/13 cases. Using gene expression profiling on 407 cases, patients with t(8;16) were compared to AML FAB subtypes with normal karyotype. Principal component analyses demonstrated that AML with t(8;16) were distinct from FAB subtypes M1, M4, M5a/b. When further compared to AML showing balanced rearrangements, that is, current WHO categories t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16) and t(11q23)/MLL, AML with t(8;16) cases were clustered close to t(11q23)/MLL sharing commonly expressed genes. Subsequently, a pairwise comparison discriminated AML with t(8;16) from AML with t(11q23)/MLL, thus defining a highly unique signature for AML with t(8;16). In conclusion, AML with t(8;16) demonstrates unique cytomorphological, cytogenetic, molecular and prognostic features and is a specific subtype of AML.","['Haferlach, T', 'Kohlmann, A', 'Klein, H-U', 'Ruckert, C', 'Dugas, M', 'Williams, P M', 'Kern, W', 'Schnittger, S', 'Bacher, U', 'Loffler, H', 'Haferlach, C']","['Haferlach T', 'Kohlmann A', 'Klein HU', 'Ruckert C', 'Dugas M', 'Williams PM', 'Kern W', 'Schnittger S', 'Bacher U', 'Loffler H', 'Haferlach C']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany. torsten.haferlach@mll-online.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090205,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2009/02/06 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2009/02/06 09:00'],"['2009/02/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]']","['leu2008388 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.388 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 May;23(5):934-43. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.388.

Reduced-intensity/non-myeloablative regimens have decreased the non-relapse mortality (NRM) in elderly and/or heavily pretreated patients. We performed a retrospective study to assess whether HCT-CI may predict clinical outcomes in a cohort of 203 patients with non-Hodgkin's (NHL; n=108), Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL; n=26), and multiple myeloma (MM; n=69), who were transplanted from a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling (n=121) or an unrelated donor (n=82) after a reduced-intensity regimen (n=154) or a low-dose total body irradiation-based non-myeloblative regimen (n=49). Cumulative incidence of NRM was 5, 16 and 20% at 1 year and 6, 24 and 27% at 2 years, for patients with an HCT-CI of 0, 1-2 and > or =3, respectively. By multivariate analysis, HCT-CI significantly predicted NRM (hazard ratio (HR)=1.6, P=0.03), overall survival (OS; HR=1.62, P<0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS; HR=1.43, P=0.002). Moreover, the Karnofsky performance status was also significantly associated with OS and NRM (HR=1.62, P<0.001 and HR=2.12, P=0.04, respectively). Conditioning type did not affect outcome after stratifying patients by HCT-CI. In the light of our study, all future prospective trials of the Gruppo Italiano Trapianti di Midollo (GITMO) will include the HCT-CI to stratify patients.","['Farina, L', 'Bruno, B', 'Patriarca, F', 'Spina, F', 'Sorasio, R', 'Morelli, M', 'Fanin, R', 'Boccadoro, M', 'Corradini, P']","['Farina L', 'Bruno B', 'Patriarca F', 'Spina F', 'Sorasio R', 'Morelli M', 'Fanin R', 'Boccadoro M', 'Corradini P']","['Hematology Department, IRCCS Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milano, Italy. lucia.farina@istitutotumori.mi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090205,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Comorbidity', 'HLA Antigens', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Karnofsky Performance Status', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/02/06 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/02/06 09:00'],"['2009/02/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['leu20091 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jun;23(6):1131-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.1.

We performed array comparative genomic hybridization analysis on a number of NK cell lines and primary tumors to gain better understanding of the pathogenesis and tumor biology of these malignancies. We also obtained transcriptional profiles of genes residing in these regions and compared them with normal and activated NK cells. Only 30-50% of the genes residing in the gained or deleted regions showed corresponding increased or decreased expression. However, many of the upregulated genes in regions of gain are functionally important for the proliferation and growth of the neoplastic population. Genes downregulated in regions of loss included many transcription factors or repressors, tumor suppressors or negative regulators of the cell cycle. The minimal common region of deletion in 6q21 included three known genes (PRDM1, ATG5 and AIM1) showing generally low expression. Mutations resulting in truncated PRDM1 and changes in conserved amino-acid sequences of AIM1 were detected. Highly methylated CpG islands 5' of PRDM1 and AIM1 correlated with low expression of the transcripts. Reversal of methylation by Decitabine induced expression of PRDM1 and cell death. In conclusion, we have shown a general tumor-promoting effect of genetic alterations and have identified PRDM1 as the most likely target gene in del6q21. ATG5, an essential gene for autophagy and AIM1, a gene implicated in melanoma, may also participate in the functional abnormalities.","['Iqbal, J', 'Kucuk, C', 'Deleeuw, R J', 'Srivastava, G', 'Tam, W', 'Geng, H', 'Klinkebiel, D', 'Christman, J K', 'Patel, K', 'Cao, K', 'Shen, L', 'Dybkaer, K', 'Tsui, I F L', 'Ali, H', 'Shimizu, N', 'Au, W Y', 'Lam, W L', 'Chan, W C']","['Iqbal J', 'Kucuk C', 'Deleeuw RJ', 'Srivastava G', 'Tam W', 'Geng H', 'Klinkebiel D', 'Christman JK', 'Patel K', 'Cao K', 'Shen L', 'Dybkaer K', 'Tsui IF', 'Ali H', 'Shimizu N', 'Au WY', 'Lam WL', 'Chan WC']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090205,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATG5 protein, human)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (CRYBG1 protein, human)', '0 (Crystallins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '138415-26-6 (PRDM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', '*Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Crystallins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/02/06 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2009/02/06 09:00'],"['2009/02/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]']","['leu20093 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jun;23(6):1139-51. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.3.

To further improve cure rates whereas minimizing long-term toxicity, we designed a protocol (NHL13) based on a regimen for childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which features intensive intrathecal chemotherapy for central -nervous system-directed therapy and excludes prophylactic cranial irradiation. From 1992 to 2002, 41 patients with advanced-stage lymphoblastic lymphoma were enrolled on the protocol. Thirty patients had stage III and 11 had stage IV disease. Thirty-three cases had a precursor T-cell immunophenotype, five had precursor B-cell immunophenotype and in three immunophenotype was not determined. Out of the 41 patients, 39 (95%) achieved a complete remission. The 5-year event-free rate was 82.9+/-6.3% (s.e.), and 5-year overall survival rate was 90.2+/-4.8% (median follow-up 9.3 years (range 4.62-13.49 years)). Adverse events included two induction failures, one death from typhlitis during remission, three relapses and one secondary acute myeloid leukemia.

It has been hypothesized that a highly regulated pattern of HTLV-1 gene expression is critical for virus survival and disease pathogenesis. In this study, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was used to determine the kinetics of viral gene expression in cells transiently transfected with an HTLV-1 proviral plasmid, in newly infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and in PBMCs from newly infected rabbits. The HTLV-1 gene expression profiles in transiently transfected and infected cells were similar; over time, all transcripts increased and then maintained stable levels. gag/pol, tax/rex, and env mRNA were detected first and at the highest levels, whereas the expression levels of the accessory genes, including the antisense Hbz, were significantly lower than the tax/rex levels (ranging from 1 to 4 logs depending on the specific mRNA). In infected rabbits, tax/rex and gag/pol mRNA levels peaked early after inoculation and progressively decreased, which correlated inversely with the proviral load and host antibody response against viral proteins. Interestingly, Hbz mRNA was detectable at 1 week postinfection and increased and stabilized. The expression levels of all other HTLV-1 genes in infected rabbit PBMCs were at or below our limit of detection. This analysis provides insight into viral gene expression under various in vitro and in vivo experimental conditions. Our in vivo data indicate that in infected rabbits, Hbz mRNA expression over time directly correlates with the proviral load, which provides the first evidence linking Hbz expression to proviral load and the survival of the virus-infected cell in the host.","['Li, Min', 'Kesic, Matthew', 'Yin, Han', 'Yu, Lianbo', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Li M', 'Kesic M', 'Yin H', 'Yu L', 'Green PL']","['Departments of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, 1925 Coffey Road, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090204,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Proviruses/growth & development', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Rabbits', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors']",2009/02/06 09:00,2009/04/11 09:00,['2009/02/06 09:00'],"['2009/02/06 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02315-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02315-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2009 Apr;83(8):3788-97. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02315-08.

METHODS: SV129-derived ESC were seeded at 2 x 10(4)/cm2 and maintained undifferentiated on ESC culture medium in the presence of 1000 U/mL leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Embryoid body (EB) formatted when ESC cultured in suspension in the lack of LIF. At 4 days, EB was transferred to 0.1% gelatin coated dish and cultured with medium supplementary of VEGF to be induced differentiation. The characteristics of differentiated cells were determined by immunohistochemistry staining, flow cytometry (FCM), 1, 1-dioctadecyl-3, 3, 3, 3-tetramethylindocarbocyanine-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein (DiI-Ac-LDL) take up test, and TEM detection. RESULTS: Differentiated cells were morphologically characterized as endothelial cells. They could take up DiI-Ac-LDL, be stained positive by Flk-1 and CD31. The CD31 positive cells reached above 90% when measured by FCM. Furthermore, Weibel-Palade bodies were detected and tight junctions were found when differentiated cells were examined by TEM. CONCLUSION: Using a simple adhesive culture method and by supplied with VEGF alone, ESCs can be induced to differentiate into endothelioid cells. The differentiation method is simple and economic, and can provide seed cells for vascular tissue engineering or cell-therapy.","['Zhang, Bin', 'Gu, Yongquan', 'Tong, Zhu', 'Yang, Shengjia', 'Hao, Lisong', 'Zhang, Shuwen', 'Wang, Zhonggao']","['Zhang B', 'Gu Y', 'Tong Z', 'Yang S', 'Hao L', 'Zhang S', 'Wang Z']","['Department of Vascular Surgery, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100053, P.R.

We have shown that Rem is expressed from a doubly spliced RNA, typical of complex retroviruses. Several recent reports indicate that MMTV can infect human cells, suggesting that MMTV might interact with human retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), and human endogenous retrovirus type K (HERV-K). In this report, we test whether the export/regulatory proteins of human complex retroviruses will increase expression from vectors containing the Rem-responsive element (RmRE). RESULTS: MMTV Rem, HIV Rev, and HTLV Rex proteins, but not HERV-K Rec, enhanced expression from an MMTV-based reporter plasmid in human T cells, and this activity was dependent on the RmRE. No RmRE-dependent reporter gene expression was detectable using Rev, Rex, or Rec in HC11 mouse mammary cells. Cell fractionation and RNA quantitation experiments suggested that the regulatory proteins did not affect RNA stability or nuclear export in the MMTV reporter system. Rem had no demonstrable activity on export elements from HIV, HTLV, or HERV-K. Similar to the Rem-specific activity in rodent cells, the RmRE-dependent functions of Rem, Rev, or Rex in human cells were inhibited by a dominant-negative truncated nucleoporin that acts in the Crm1 pathway of RNA and protein export. CONCLUSION: These data argue that many retroviral regulatory proteins recognize similar complex RNA structures, which may depend on the presence of cell-type specific proteins. Retroviral protein activity on the RmRE appears to affect a post-export function of the reporter RNA. Our results provide additional evidence that MMTV is a complex retrovirus with the potential for viral interactions in human cells.","['Mertz, Jennifer A', 'Lozano, Mary M', 'Dudley, Jaquelin P']","['Mertz JA', 'Lozano MM', 'Dudley JP']","['Section of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology and Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA. mertzja@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20090203,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (ERVK-6 protein, human endogenous retrovirus)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, rex/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*metabolism']",2009/02/05 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2009/02/05 09:00'],"['2008/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-6-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-6-10 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2009 Feb 3;6:10. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-6-10.,,,,['R01 CA116813/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2661877,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, imatinib resistance has raised concern and prompted interest in additional strategies to achieve disease eradication. Resistance to imatinib is mainly associated with three mechanisms: acquired mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL protein, genetic amplification, and transcript overexpression of BCR-ABL rearrangement. Therefore an accurate assessment of resistance mechanism is particularly important to improve strategies to overcome resistance. In order to determine overexpression of BCR-ABL, we propose a method that correlates quantitative real time PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization data from the same peripheral blood sample. The ratio between both methodologies permits to calculate the expression index (EI) for each patient. EI estimates the rate of BCR-ABL transcription per rearrangement. The median EI value, including all cases (n = 123), was 0.288; those cases (n = 13) included in percentile 90 showed an increment of EI above 1 Log (>2.88) with respect to the median value and were considered as cases with overexpression. We also evaluated the EIs using receiver operating characteristics curve; choosing an EI cutoff of 1.836 we obtained a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 61%. Using this EI cutoff value, more patients (n = 17) were included in the overexpression group. Patients within this group were resistant to imatinib and also showed a worse overall survival if compared with the remaining.","['Bianchini, Michele', 'De Brasi, Carlos', 'Gargallo, Patricia', 'Gonzalez, Mariana', 'Bengio, Raquel', 'Larripa, Irene']","['Bianchini M', 'De Brasi C', 'Gargallo P', 'Gonzalez M', 'Bengio R', 'Larripa I']","['Depto Genetica, Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas, Academia Nacional de Medicina.

It acts as an ecto-enzyme as well as a receptor. The enzymatic activity catalyzes the formation of two potent Ca(2+) releasing agents: cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR) from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) from NAD phosphate (NADP). The receptor function of CD38 leads to the phosphorylation of intracellular signaling proteins and the up-regulation of cytokine production in immune cells. These two functions of CD38 underlie its involvement in various biological processes, such as hormone secretion, immune cell differentiation, and immune responses. Clinically, CD38 is used as a negative prognosis marker for chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL). However, a clear molecular understanding of CD38's role in physiology and pathology is still lacking. To facilitate the study of CD38 at cellular and molecular levels, here we report a mechanism-based method for fluorescently labeling CD38 on live cells. This labeling method does not interfere with the receptor function of CD38 and the downstream signaling. The labeling method is thus a useful tool to study the receptor function of CD38 in live cells. In addition, since the mechanism-based labeling also inhibits the enzymatic activity of CD38, it should be useful for dissecting the receptor function of CD38 without interference from its enzyme function in complicated biological processes.","['Jiang, Hong', 'Congleton, Johanna', 'Liu, Qun', 'Merchant, Paolomi', 'Malavasi, Fabio', 'Lee, Hon Cheung', 'Hao, Quan', 'Yen, Andrew', 'Lin, Hening']","['Jiang H', 'Congleton J', 'Liu Q', 'Merchant P', 'Malavasi F', 'Lee HC', 'Hao Q', 'Yen A', 'Lin H']","['Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1094-61-7 (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemical synthesis/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Nicotinamide Mononucleotide/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Rhodamines/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction']",2009/02/05 09:00,2009/04/28 09:00,['2009/02/05 09:00'],"['2009/02/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1021/ja808387g [doi]', '10.1021/ja808387g [pii]']",ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2009 Feb 11;131(5):1658-9. doi: 10.1021/ja808387g.,,,,"['R01 CA033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA033505-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2644825,,['NIHMS90269'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was previously mapped to a chromosome 8 segment containing the Plzf gene. Plzf (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein) influences limb development as a direct repressor of posterior HoxD genes. However, the Plzf coding sequence is intact in the Lx mutants. Using linkage mapping in F2 hybrids, we downsized the segment containing Lx to 155 kb and sequenced conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) inside. A 2,964-bp deletion in Plzf intron 2, never detected in control animals, is the only candidate for Lx. The deletion removes the most deeply conserved CNE in the 155-kb segment, suggesting a regulatory influence on Plzf expression. Correspondingly, using in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we found a decrease of Plzf expression in Lx/Lx limb buds with concomitant anterior expansion of expression domains of its targets, Hoxd10-13 genes, in the absence of ectopic Sonic hedgehog expression. Upstream regulation of Plzf in limb buds is currently unknown. We present here the first candidate Plzf cis-regulatory sequence.","['Liska, Frantisek', 'Snajdr, Pavel', 'Sedova, Lucie', 'Seda, Ondrej', 'Chylikova, Blanka', 'Slamova, Petra', 'Krejci, Eliska', 'Sedmera, David', 'Grim, Milos', 'Krenova, Drahomira', 'Kren, Vladimir']","['Liska F', 'Snajdr P', 'Sedova L', 'Seda O', 'Chylikova B', 'Slamova P', 'Krejci E', 'Sedmera D', 'Grim M', 'Krenova D', 'Kren V']","['Institute of Biology and Medical Genetics of the 1st Faculty of Medicine and General Teaching Hospital, Charles University in Prague, Praha, Czech Republic. frantisek.liska@lf1.cuni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Dev Dyn,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,9201927,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (ZBTB16 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Body Patterning', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian/embryology/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Introns/*genetics', 'Limb Buds/*abnormalities/*metabolism', 'Polydactyly/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Untranslated/*genetics', 'Rats']",2009/02/05 09:00,2009/05/05 09:00,['2009/02/05 09:00'],"['2009/02/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/05 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dvdy.21859 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Dyn. 2009 Mar;238(3):673-84. doi: 10.1002/dvdy.21859.,,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Although CD10 expression has been investigated in some cutaneous tumors, to our knowledge, data regarding its expression in cutaneous epithelial neoplasms are very limited. We aimed to determine the immunohistochemical expression of CD10 in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and to associate it with the available clinicopathological parameters in both tumors. Patients and Methods : This study included 16 SCC and 21 BCC cases (17 solid type, 2 morphea type and 2 adenoid basal types). BCC cases were divided into 12 cases with microscopic infiltrative base and 9 cases with well-circumscribed base. The localization of anti-CD10 to the tumor and/or stromal cells was determined in each case. Results : Positive CD10 staining was identified as brown cytoplasmic, with or without cell membrane staining. In all the 16 SCC cases, tumor cells failed to stain with CD10 in contrast to the stromal cells that showed CD10 expression in 13 cases (81%). In BCC cases, the expression of CD10 was noted in tumor cells in 10 cases (47.6%) and in stromal cells of 20 cases (95.24%). Most of CD10+ (7/10) BCC showed well-circumscribed deep margin, however, most of CD10- cases (9/11) showed infiltrating base (p=0.030). BCCs with infiltrating deep margins (12 cases) tended to show CD10 negative basaloid cells (9/12) and CD10 positive stromal cells (12/12) (p=0.0003). Conclusion : From our results we suggest that CD10 might be a useful immunohistochemical marker to differentiate between BCC and SCC. At least, if tumor cells were CD10 positive, this would favor BCC over SCC. Absence of CD10 in all the SCC and in infiltrating BCC together with its overexpression in the surrounding stromal cells might confer invasive properties to such tumors. However, its relation to other poor prognostic factors needs larger studies to be confirmed.

Available treatments can also deplete T lymphocytes, leaving patients at risk of life-threatening infections. In the National Cancer Institute cell line screen, the structurally unique natural product silvestrol produces an unusual pattern of cytotoxicity that suggests activity in leukemia and selectivity for B cells. We investigated silvestrol efficacy using primary human B-leukemia cells, established B-leukemia cell lines, and animal models. In CLL cells, silvestrol LC(50) (concentration lethal to 50%) is 6.9 nM at 72 hours. At this concentration, there is no difference in sensitivity of cells from patients with or without the del(17p13.1) abnormality. In isolated cells and whole blood, silvestrol is more cytotoxic toward B cells than T cells. Silvestrol causes early reduction in Mcl-1 expression due to translational inhibition with subsequent mitochondrial damage, as evidenced by reactive oxygen species generation and membrane depolarization. In vivo, silvestrol causes significant B-cell reduction in Emu-Tcl-1 transgenic mice and significantly extends survival of 697 xenograft severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice without discernible toxicity. These data indicate silvestrol has efficacy against B cells in vitro and in vivo and identify translational inhibition as a potential therapeutic target in B-cell leukemias.","['Lucas, David M', 'Edwards, Ryan B', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'West, Derek A', 'Shin, Jungook D', 'Vargo, Melissa A', 'Davis, Melanie E', 'Rozewski, Darlene M', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Su, Bao-Ning', 'Goettl, Virginia M', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Lin, Thomas S', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Newman, David J', 'Byrd, John C', 'Kinghorn, A Douglas', 'Grever, Michael R']","['Lucas DM', 'Edwards RB', 'Lozanski G', 'West DA', 'Shin JD', 'Vargo MA', 'Davis ME', 'Rozewski DM', 'Johnson AJ', 'Su BN', 'Goettl VM', 'Heerema NA', 'Lin TS', 'Lehman A', 'Zhang X', 'Jarjoura D', 'Newman DJ', 'Byrd JC', 'Kinghorn AD', 'Grever MR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. david.lucas@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090203,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (silvestrol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology']",2009/02/05 09:00,2009/06/10 09:00,['2009/02/05 09:00'],"['2009/02/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39192-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-175430 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 May 7;113(19):4656-66. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-09-175430.

A direct demonstration that NOTCH1 was a transcriptional target of p53 in leukemic cells was obtained in experiments carried out with siRNA for p53. Moreover, inhibition of Notch1 expression using Notch1-specific siRNA significantly increased cytotoxicity in TP53(wild-type) leukemic cells. Of note, Nutlin-3 up-regulated Notch1 expression also in primary TP53(wild-type) B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells and the combined use of Nutlin-3 plus pharmacological gamma-secretase inhibitors of the Notch signaling showed a synergistic cytotoxicity in both TP53(wild-type) leukemic cell lines and primary B-CLL cells. A potential drawback of gamma-secretase inhibitors was their ability to enhance osteoclastic maturation of normal circulating preosteoclasts induced by RANKL + M-CSF. Notwithstanding, Nutlin-3 completely suppressed osteoclastogenesis irrespective of the presence of gamma-secretase inhibitors. Taken together, these data indicate that the p53-dependent up-regulation of Notch1 in response to Nutlin-3 represents an antiapoptotic feedback mechanism able to restrain the potential therapeutic efficacy of Nutlin-3 in hematologic malignancies.

Parents were asked to rate the extent to which they experienced a set of specific fears related to their child's brain tumor and its treatment. Outcomes for parents of CNS tumor patients (n = 82) were compared with those of reference parents of patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 208). The fears about an illness recurrence and the late effects of treatment were most prominent among parents of CNS tumor patients. For 7 out of 11 kinds of fear, parents of CNS tumor patients expressed a stronger fear than the reference group. More than a quarter of the parents of children treated for CNS tumors feared a complete decline of the child. Parents of CNS tumor patients experience relatively heightened cancer related fears in several domains. The fear of devastating consequences felt by one fourth of parents signals the need of individualized psychological support and information at diagnosis and follow-up to facilitate parental coping with the posttreatment situation.","['Anclair, M', 'Hoven, E', 'Lannering, B', 'Boman, K K']","['Anclair M', 'Hoven E', 'Lannering B', 'Boman KK']","['Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Astrid Lindgren Childrens Hospital Q6:05, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden. malin.anclair@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090203,United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnosis/*psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Fear', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Parents/*psychology']",2009/02/05 09:00,2009/05/30 09:00,['2009/02/05 09:00'],"['2009/02/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [medline]']","['1043454208323912 [pii]', '10.1177/1043454208323912 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2009 Mar-Apr;26(2):68-74. doi: 10.1177/1043454208323912.

Molecular key players in this process comprise the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) that functions as a Ca(2+) sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum and ORAI1 located in the plasma membrane. Depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores leads to STIM1 multimerization into discrete puncta, which co-cluster with ORAI1 to couple to and activate ORAI1 channels. The cytosolic C terminus of STIM1 is sufficient to activate ORAI1 currents independent of store depletion. Here we identified an ORAI1-activating small fragment (OASF, amino acids 233-450/474) within STIM1 C terminus comprising the two coiled-coil domains and additional 50-74 amino acids that exhibited enhanced interaction with ORAI1, resulting in 3-fold increased Ca(2+) currents. This OASF, similar to the complete STIM1 C terminus, displayed the ability to homomerize by a novel assembly domain that occurred subsequent to the coiled-coil domains. A smaller fragment (amino acids 233-420) generated by a further deletion of 30 amino acids substantially reduced the ability to homomerize concomitant to a loss of coupling to as well as activation of ORAI1. Extending OASF by 35 amino acids (233-485) did not alter homomerization but substantially decreased efficiency in coupling to and activation of ORAI1. Expressing OASF in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells demonstrated its enhanced plasma membrane targeting associated with 2.5-fold larger CRAC currents in comparison with the complete STIM1 C terminus. In aggregate, we have identified two cytosolic key regions within STIM1 C terminus that control ORAI1/CRAC activation: a homomerization domain indispensable for coupling to ORAI1 and a modulatory domain that controls the extent of coupling to ORAI1.","['Muik, Martin', 'Fahrner, Marc', 'Derler, Isabella', 'Schindl, Rainer', 'Bergsmann, Judith', 'Frischauf, Irene', 'Groschner, Klaus', 'Romanin, Christoph']","['Muik M', 'Fahrner M', 'Derler I', 'Schindl R', 'Bergsmann J', 'Frischauf I', 'Groschner K', 'Romanin C']","['Institute of Biophysics, University of Linz, A-4040 Linz.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090203,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (ORAI1 Protein)', '0 (ORAI1 protein, human)', '0 (Orai1 protein, rat)', '0 (STIM1 protein, human)', '0 (Stim1 protein, rat)', '0 (Stromal Interaction Molecule 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'ORAI1 Protein', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Secondary/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Rats', 'Stromal Interaction Molecule 1']",2009/02/05 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2009/02/05 09:00'],"['2009/02/05 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)32388-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.C800229200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2009 Mar 27;284(13):8421-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.C800229200.

PTEN physically and genetically interacts with the central genome guardian p53. PTEN also associates with the centromeric protein CENP-C to maintain centromere integrity and suppresses chromosomal instability from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through transcriptional regulation of Rad51 (radiosensitive yeast mutant 51). Moreover PTEN controls the growth and proliferation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and restrains cells from leukemia in an mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) dependent manner.

This provides the opportunity to perform ""genomic karyotyping."" Such application of karyotyping may indicate whether two chromosomes involved in a translocation are both maternal, both paternal, or intermingled, i.e., one maternal and the other paternal (we refer to this as mixed). The parental origin for these translocations likely has profound differences and implications in disease expression and response to treatments, making such information very important to personalized medicine. In this mini-review, we present our observations from specimens with translocations BCR-ABL, t(9;22) and PML-RARA, t(15;17). About 20% metaphases of these specimens indicated ploidywise organization and were amenable to genomic karyotyping analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes for BCR-ABL translocation suggest a close approximation of the HSA 9 and 22, as control values for false-positive signals run from approximately 5-10%. Given a ploidywise distribution of the maternal and paternal sets of chromosomes, it would be expected that the chromosomes involved in the translocation t(9;22) would more often belong to one of the two genomes, either maternal or paternal. Contrastingly, HSA 15 and 17 are not considered as spatially close to each other and therefore an intragenomic involvement would be rarer for translocation t(15;17). In 14 out of the 21 (66.6%) specimens with informative metaphases, the chromosomes involved in the translocation BCR-ABL were restricted to one of the two genomes--either maternal or paternal. In cases of translocation PML-RARA only 4 out of 21 (19.1%) specimens indicated an intragenomic involvement. These simple yet informative analyses of cancer-related translocations show profound underlying genomic origins and lend support to genomic karyotyping.","['Chaudhuri, Jyoti P', 'Karamanov, Sultan', 'Paulraj, Prabakaran', 'McGill, John R', 'Walther, Joachimu']","['Chaudhuri JP', 'Karamanov S', 'Paulraj P', 'McGill JR', 'Walther J']","['Tumor Cytogenetik Unit, Kinderklinik, LMU, 80336 Miinchen, Germany.

[Ca(2+)](i) was evaluated with a spectrophotometer. The degree of differentiation in SMF-exposed cells was lower than that of non-exposed cells, the difference being exposure time-dependent. SMF-exposed cells showed cell shape and F-actin modification, inhibition of cell attachment, appearance of membrane roughness and large blebs and impaired expression of specific macrophagic markers on the cell surface. The intracellular localization of SER and lysosomes was only partially affected by exposure. A significant localization of mitochondria with an intact membrane potential at the cell periphery in non-exposed, TPA-stimulated cells was observed; conversely, in the presence of SMF, mitochondria were mainly localised near the nucleus. In no case did SMF exposure affect cell viability.

B-CLL is not characterized by a unique recurrent genomic alteration but rather by genomic instability giving rise frequently to several chromosomal aberrations. Besides we reported that approximately 15% of B-CLL patients present malignant B-cells resistant to irradiation-induced apoptosis, contrary to approximately 85% of patients and normal human lymphocytes. Telomere length shortening is observed in radioresistant B-CLL cells. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multicolour FISH, we tested whether specific chromosomal aberrations might be associated with the radioresistance of a subset of B-CLL cells and whether they are correlated with telomere shortening. In a cohort of 30 B-CLL patients, all of the radioresistant B-CLL cell samples exhibited homozygous or heterozygous deletion of 13q14.3 in contrast to 52% of the radiosensitive samples. In addition to the 13q14.3 deletion, ten out of the 11 radioresistant B-cell samples had another clonal genomic alteration such as trisomy 12, deletion 17p13.1, mutation of the p53 gene or translocations in contrast to only three out of 19 radiosensitive samples. Telomere fusions and non-reciprocal translocations, hallmarks of telomere dysfunction, are not increased in radioresistant B-CLL cells. These findings suggest (i) that the 13q14.3 deletion accompanied by another chromosomal aberration is associated with radioresistance of B-CLL cells and (ii) that telomere shortening is not causative of increased clonal chromosomal aberrations in radioresistant B-CLL cells.","['Salin, H', 'Ricoul, M', 'Morat, L', 'Sabatier, L']","['Salin H', 'Ricoul M', 'Morat L', 'Sabatier L']","[""Laboratoire de Radiobiologie et d'Oncologie, CEA, DSV/iRCM, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090130,Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics/radiation effects', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Metaphase', 'Sequence Deletion/radiation effects', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics/ultrastructure']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/03/12 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2008/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [medline]']","['000167821 [pii]', '10.1159/000167821 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2008;122(3-4):343-9. doi: 10.1159/000167821.

Here, we show that MLL normally regulates expression of mir-196b, a hematopoietic microRNA located within the HoxA cluster, in a pattern similar to that of the surrounding 5' Hox genes, Hoxa9 and Hoxa10, during embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation. Within the hematopoietic lineage, mir-196b is most abundant in short-term hematopoietic stem cells and is down-regulated in more differentiated hematopoietic cells. Leukemogenic MLL fusion proteins cause overexpression of mir-196b, while treatment of MLL-AF9 transformed bone marrow cells with mir-196-specific antagomir abrogates their replating potential in methylcellulose. This demonstrates that mir-196b function is necessary for MLL fusion-mediated immortalization. Furthermore, overexpression of mir-196b was found specifically in patients with MLL associated leukemias as determined from analysis of 55 primary leukemia samples. Overexpression of mir-196b in bone marrow progenitor cells leads to increased proliferative capacity and survival, as well as a partial block in differentiation. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby increased expression of mir-196b by MLL fusion proteins significantly contributes to leukemia development.","['Popovic, Relja', 'Riesbeck, Laurie E', 'Velu, Chinavenmeni S', 'Chaubey, Aditya', 'Zhang, Jiwang', 'Achille, Nicholas J', 'Erfurth, Frank E', 'Eaton, Katherine', 'Lu, Jun', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J']","['Popovic R', 'Riesbeck LE', 'Velu CS', 'Chaubey A', 'Zhang J', 'Achille NJ', 'Erfurth FE', 'Eaton K', 'Lu J', 'Grimes HL', 'Chen J', 'Rowley JD', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ']","['Molecular Biology Program, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090202,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MIRN196 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Leukemia/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/05/09 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/09 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39391-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-04-154310 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Apr 2;113(14):3314-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-04-154310.

Our data showed that human monocytic leukemia/lymphoma U937 and acute myeloid leukemia HL-60, but not chronic myeloid leukemia K562, cells were susceptible to apoptosis induced by ER stressor tunicamycin, a protein glycosylation inhibitor. Tunicamycin caused early activation of caspase-2, -3, -4, and -8, followed by apoptosis, whereas caspase-9 was slowly activated. Inhibiting caspase-2 reduced activation of caspase-8 and -3 but had no effect on caspase-4. Tunicamycin induced apoptosis independently of the mitochondrial pathway but caused lysosomal destabilization followed by lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), cathepsin B relocation from lysosomes to the cytosol, and caspase-8 and -3 activation. It is notable that caspase-2 mediated lysosomal destabilization. Inhibiting GSK-3beta comprehensively reduced lysosomal apoptosis after caspase-2 inhibition. Unlike U937 and HL-60 cells, K562 cells showed nonresponsive ER stress and failure of activation of GSK-3beta and caspase-2 in response to tunicamycin. Activating GSK-3beta caused K562 cells to be susceptible to tunicamycin-induced apoptosis. Taken together, we show that GSK-3beta exhibits a mechanism of ER stress-induced lysosomal apoptosis in leukemia involving caspase-2-induced LMP and cathepsin B relocation, which result in caspase-8 and -3 activation.","['Huang, Wei-Ching', 'Lin, Yee-Shin', 'Chen, Chia-Ling', 'Wang, Chi-Yun', 'Chiu, Wei-Hsin', 'Lin, Chiou-Feng']","['Huang WC', 'Lin YS', 'Chen CL', 'Wang CY', 'Chiu WH', 'Lin CF']","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, National Cheng Kung University Medical College, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090202,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism/*physiology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Glycosylation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Permeability', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/05/23 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/23 09:00 [medline]']","['jpet.108.148122 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.108.148122 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2009 May;329(2):524-31. doi: 10.1124/jpet.108.148122.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the prognostic value of the long-term evolution of the molecular response based on a retrospective analysis of 130 late chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients who achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCgR) with 400 mg/d imatinib and have now a median follow-up of 72 months (range, 48-77). RESULTS: In 71 (55%) patients, molecular response was consistently major (stable MMolR); in 19 (15%) patients, molecular response was occasionally less than major (unstable MMolR); in 40 (30%) patients, MMolR was never achieved (never MMolR) during all the course of CCgR. Patients with stable MMolR had a longer CCgR duration and a significantly better progression-free survival compared with patients with absent or unstable MMolR. The achievement of a MMolR, if maintained continuously, conferred a marked long-term stability to the CCgR: patients with a stable MMolR have a significantly lower risk of losing the CCgR than patients with unstable and never MMolR (4% versus 21%, P = 0.03, and 4% versus 33%, P < 0.0001, respectively). Finally, if a MMolR is not maintained consistently, the risk of losing the CCgR is higher but not significantly than if it is never achieved (33% versus 21%, P = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that achieving a MMolR is prognostically important but point out that the prognostic value of achieving a MMolR is greater if the response is confirmed and stable.","['Palandri, Francesca', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Poerio, Angela', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Alimena, Giuliana', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Varaldo, Riccardo', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Rosti, Gianantonio']","['Palandri F', 'Iacobucci I', 'Soverini S', 'Castagnetti F', 'Poerio A', 'Testoni N', 'Alimena G', 'Breccia M', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Tiribelli M', 'Varaldo R', 'Abruzzese E', 'Martino B', 'Luciano L', 'Pane F', 'Saglio G', 'Martinelli G', 'Baccarani M', 'Rosti G']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology L. and A.

Conversely, it is unknown whether TP53 mutations carry any prognostic value independent of del17p13. We tested the independent prognostic value of TP53 mutations in CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The study was based on a consecutive series of 308 CLL. DNA sequencing of TP53 exons 2 to 10 and del17p13 interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization were done at CLL diagnosis. Study end points were survival and chemorefractoriness. RESULTS: At diagnosis, TP53 mutations (n = 32) occurred in 31 of 308 (10.0%) patients. Of all CLL showing TP53 disruption by either mutation and/or deletion (n = 44), 10 cases (22.7%) showed TP53 mutations in the absence of del17p13. Multivariate analysis selected TP53 mutations (hazard ratio, 3.20; P = 0.002) as an independent predictor of overall survival after adjustment for del17p13. Also, multivariate analysis selected TP53 mutations (hazard ratio, 3.97; P < 0.001) as an independent predictor of chemorefractoriness after adjustment for del17p13. Compared with cases without TP53 alterations, CLL harboring any type of TP53 disruption (mutation only, del17p13 only, or both mutation and del17p13) uniformly displayed a high prevalence of unfavorable prognosticators and poor outcome. Analysis of sequential CLL samples showed the acquisition of new or additional TP53 alterations at the time of chemorefractoriness. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that (a) TP53 mutations are an independent predictor of short survival and chemorefractoriness, and (b) that CLL presenting with TP53 mutations without del17p13 fare as poorly as CLL carrying del17p13. Because CLL harboring TP53 mutations without del17p13 are currently not recognized by conventional diagnostic strategies, these results may be relevant for a comprehensive prognostic characterization of CLL.","['Rossi, Davide', 'Cerri, Michaela', 'Deambrogi, Clara', 'Sozzi, Elisa', 'Cresta, Stefania', 'Rasi, Silvia', 'De Paoli, Lorenzo', 'Spina, Valeria', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Capello, Daniela', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Lauria, Francesco', 'Gaidano, Gianluca']","['Rossi D', 'Cerri M', 'Deambrogi C', 'Sozzi E', 'Cresta S', 'Rasi S', 'De Paoli L', 'Spina V', 'Gattei V', 'Capello D', 'Forconi F', 'Lauria F', 'Gaidano G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine and BRMA, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Novara, Italy. rossidav@med.unipmn.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,IM,"['Aged', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']","['15/3/995 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1630 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Feb 1;15(3):995-1004. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1630.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The biological activity of CAT-8015 was examined in vitro using B-cell tumor lines and in vivo in a JD38-based s.c. tumor model in NCr athymic mice. Pharmacokinetics and interspecies scaling of CAT-8015 were evaluated in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. The potential toxicity of CAT-8015 was assessed in monkeys in a toxicologic study and compared with CAT-3888. RESULTS: The IC50 values of CAT-8015 in vitro using the EHEB, MEC1, Daudi, CA46, and JD38 cell lines ranged from 0.3 to 8.6 ng/mL. Pharmacokinetic studies with CAT-8015 were conducted in mouse, rat, and cynomolgus monkey. The t1/2 was calculated to be 0.42, 0.61, and 0.79 hours and the Vss was 1.37, 5.57, and 140.3 mL in mouse, rat, and monkey, respectively. In vivo, when JD38 tumor-bearing animals were treated with CAT-8015 at doses > or =75 microg/kg at 48-hour intervals for a total of three doses, a rapid reduction in tumor volume and in some cases complete remission in tumor growth was observed. The comparative toxicologic study showed comparable clinical and anatomic pathology changes for CAT-8015 and CAT-3888.

Here, we describe the discovery and first functional characterization of a novel germline MLH1 mutant allele. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A large kindred including 54 potential carriers was investigated at the molecular level by using different types of PCR experiments, gene cloning, transfection studies, Western blot experiments, and mismatch repair assays to identify and characterize a novel MLH1 mutant allele. Twenty-two of 54 putative carriers developed colon cancer or other tumors, including breast cancer. RESULTS: The identified MLH1 mutant allele emerged from an interstitial deletion on chromosome 3p21.3, leading to an in-frame fusion of MLH1 (exons 1-11) with ITGA9 (integrin alpha 9; exons 17-28). The deleted area has a size of about 400 kb; codes for LRRFIP2 (leucine-rich repeat in flightless interaction protein 2), GOLGA4 (Golgi autoantigen, golgin subfamily a, 4), and C3orf35/APRG1 (chromosome 3 open reading frame 35/AP20 region protein 1); and partly disrupts the AP20 region implicated in major epithelial malignancies. Tumor cells lost their second MLH1 allele. The MLH1*ITGA9 fusion protein provides no capability for DNA mismatch repair. Murine fibroblasts, expressing a doxycycline-inducible MLH1*ITGA9 fusion gene, exhibit a loss-of-contact inhibition phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of a functional gene fusion of the human MLH1 gene, resulting in the loss of mismatch repair capabilities. The MLH1*ITGA9 fusion allele, together with deletions of the AP20 region, presumably defines a novel subclass of Lynch syndrome patients, which results in an extended tumor spectrum known from hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and Muir-Torre syndrome patients.","['Meyer, Claus', 'Brieger, Angela', 'Plotz, Guido', 'Weber, Nicole', 'Passmann, Sandra', 'Dingermann, Theo', 'Zeuzem, Stefan', 'Trojan, Joerg', 'Marschalek, Rolf']","['Meyer C', 'Brieger A', 'Plotz G', 'Weber N', 'Passmann S', 'Dingermann T', 'Zeuzem S', 'Trojan J', 'Marschalek R']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/Diagnostic Center for Acute Leukemia/Zentrum fur Arzneimittelforschung, Entwicklung und Sicherheit/Cluster of Excellence Frankfurt, Biocenter, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (ITGA9 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alpha Chains)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Colorectal Neoplasms, Hereditary Nonpolyposis/*genetics', 'DNA Mismatch Repair', 'Female', '*Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha Chains/*genetics', 'Integrins/*genetics', 'Male', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Sequence Deletion']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/07/17 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/17 09:00 [medline]']","['15/3/762 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1908 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Feb 1;15(3):762-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1908.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of cell survival pathways such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase/AKT/IKK or RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase are known to phosphorylate FOXOs at different sites which cause FOXOs nuclear exclusion and degradation, resulting in the suppression of FOXO's transcriptional activity. Perturbation of FOXO's function leads to deregulated cell proliferation and accumulation of DNA damage, resulting in diseases such as cancer. Emerging evidence shows that active FOXO proteins are crucial for keeping cells in check; and inactivation of FOXO proteins is associated with tumorigenesis, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, glioblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemia. Moreover, clinically used drugs like paclitaxel, imatinib, and doxorubicin have been shown to achieve their therapeutic effects through activation of FOXO3a and FOXO3a targets.

Immunodeficiency may be primary or secondary. Secondary causes of immune deficiency are more common and more frequently encountered during imaging. Immune deficiency can arise in patients with conditions such as leukemia and lymphoma; from infectious agents such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); from the administration of drugs, including chemotherapy agents and steroids; and as a result of metabolic diseases such as renal failure and diabetes. A condition that often presents challenges in the interpretation of abnormal uptake within radionuclide imaging is the patient with HIV infection. This has been compounded in some ways by the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy and the advent of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Imaging abnormalities are found in association with the underlying disease, eg, lymphoma, HIV which, on occasion, may be difficult to separate from an opportunistic infection. The primary value of radionuclide imaging and in particular (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography is to rapidly establish the probable site of disease to direct biopsy or aspiration so that the underlying pathology can be confirmed. The value of single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography has been enhanced by the introduction of hybrid imaging so that the computed tomography element of the scan localizes the site of disease more accurately than imaging without the computed tomography. Interest in monitoring response to treatment of infection is increasing but care has to be taken as inflammatory uptake attributable to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome can be similar to a worsening of infective uptake and this can lead to misinterpretation of the effect of treatment. It is important for the imager to be aware of the effects of underlying treatments on functional imaging and therefore to have a full history of the disease and the drug treatments that the patient is taking.","[""O'Doherty, Michael J"", 'Barrington, Sally F', 'Klein, John L']","[""O'Doherty MJ"", 'Barrington SF', 'Klein JL']","[""King's College London, Division of Imaging, St Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom. michael.o'doherty@kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Nucl Med,Seminars in nuclear medicine,1264464,,IM,"['Animals', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', '*Nuclear Medicine', 'Opportunistic Infections/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/pathology', 'Radiography', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]']","['S0001-2998(08)00120-7 [pii]', '10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2008.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Nucl Med. 2009 Mar;39(2):88-102. doi: 10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2008.10.003.,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report a rapid and efficient strategy to generate ASHmAb. Different from usual immunization methods is that we suppressed the production of non-allele-specific anti-HLA antibodies against xenogeneic determinants of HLA molecules by immunizing human HLA-B51 transgenic mice against non-HLA-B51 HLA tetramers. In addition, HLA-coated beads enabled rapid and efficient screening for ASHmAb. ASHmAb generated by this strategy will be useful for HLA typing and for clinical diagnosis, such as flow cytometry-based chimerism analysis for early detection of graft failure and relapse of leukemia after HLA-mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Yamazaki, Satoshi', 'Suzuki, Nao', 'Saito, Tsuneyoshi', 'Ishii, Yumiko', 'Takiguchi, Masafumi', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu', 'Watanabe, Nobukazu']","['Yamazaki S', 'Suzuki N', 'Saito T', 'Ishii Y', 'Takiguchi M', 'Nakauchi H', 'Watanabe N']","['Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090131,Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B51 Antigen)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', '*Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Fusion', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-B Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-B51 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/04/01 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2008/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [medline]']","['S0022-1759(09)00005-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jim.2009.01.007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2009 Mar 31;343(1):56-60. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2009.01.007.

Random forest has received much attention recently; its primary characteristic is that it can form a classification model from the data with high dimensionality. However, optimal results can not be obtained for gene selection since it is still affected by undifferentiated genes. We proposed recursive random forest analysis and applied it to gene selection. METHODS: Recursive random forest, which is an improvement of random forest, obtains optimal differentiated genes after step by step dropping of genes which, according to a certain algorithm, have no effects on classification. The method has the advantage of random forest and provides a gene importance scale as well. The value of the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which synthesizes the information of sensitivity and specificity, is adopted as the key standard for evaluating the performance of this method. The focus of the paper is to validate the effectiveness of gene selection using recursive random forest through the analysis of five microarray datasets; colon, prostate, leukemia, breast and skin data. RESULTS: Five microarray datasets were analyzed and better classification results have been attained using only a few genes after gene selection. The biological information of the selected genes from breast and skin data was confirmed according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The results prove that the genes associated with diseases can be effectively retained by recursive random forest. CONCLUSIONS: Recursive random forest can be effectively applied to microarray data analysis and gene selection. The retained genes in the optimal model provide important information for clinical diagnoses and research of the biological mechanism of diseases.","['Wu, Xiao-yan', 'Wu, Zhen-yu', 'Li, Kang']","['Wu XY', 'Wu ZY', 'Li K']","['Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/03/28 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/28 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2008 Dec 20;121(24):2492-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the curse of dimensionality, many gene selection methods weight the contribution from each individual subject equally. This equal-contribution assumption cannot account for the possible dependence among subjects who associate similarly to the disease, and may restrict the selection of influential genes. RESULTS: A novel approach to gene selection is proposed based on kernel similarities and kernel weights. We do not assume uniformity for subject contribution. Weights are calculated via regularized least squares support vector regression (RLS-SVR) of class levels on kernel similarities and are used to weight subject contribution. The cumulative sum of weighted expression levels are next ranked to select responsible genes. These procedures also work for multiclass classification. We demonstrate this algorithm on acute leukemia, colon cancer, small, round blue cell tumors of childhood, breast cancer, and lung cancer studies, using kernel Fisher discriminant analysis and support vector machines as classifiers. Other procedures are compared as well. CONCLUSION: This approach is easy to implement and fast in computation for both binary and multiclass problems. The gene set provided by the RLS-SVR weight-based approach contains a less number of genes, and achieves a higher accuracy than other procedures.","['Chen, Pei-Chun', 'Huang, Su-Yun', 'Chen, Wei J', 'Hsiao, Chuhsing K']","['Chen PC', 'Huang SY', 'Chen WJ', 'Hsiao CK']","['1Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core Laboratory, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China. d93842005@ntu.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090203,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['*Algorithms', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/06/19 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2008/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-10-44 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-10-44 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2009 Feb 3;10:44. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-10-44.,,,,,PMC2669483,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken in order to examine the prevalence and the associated clinicopathologic and genetic features of FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement in a cohort of 15 adult patients presenting with profound eosinophilia (> 1.5 x 109/L). METHODS: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for the detection of FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement and the results confirmed by direct sequencing. C-KIT-D816V mutation was analysed retrospectively by PCR and restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), in all cases with primary eosinophilia. RESULTS: Two male patients with splenomegaly carried the FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement, whilst 2 others were ultimately classified as suffering from idiopathic hypereosinophlic syndrome (HES) and one from systemic mastocytosis. These patients were negative for the C-KIT-D816V mutation and received imatinib (100-400 mg daily). Patients with CEL and HES responded to imatinib and remained in complete haematological, clinical and molecular (for carriers of FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement) remission for a median of 28.2 months (range: 11-54), whilst the patient with systemic mastocytosis did not respond. Interestingly, in both patients with FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement, the breakpoints into PDGFRA were located within exon 12 and fused with exons 8 and 8a of FIP1L1, respectively. CONCLUSION: An early diagnosis of FIPIL1-PDGFRA-positive CEL and imatinib treatment offer to the affected patients an excellent clinical therapeutic result, avoiding undesirable morbidity. Moreover, although the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remain to be determined, imatinib can be effective in patients with idiopathic HES.","['Loules, Gedeon', 'Kalala, Fani', 'Giannakoulas, Nikolaos', 'Papadakis, Emmanouil', 'Matsouka, Panagiota', 'Speletas, Matthaios']","['Loules G', 'Kalala F', 'Giannakoulas N', 'Papadakis E', 'Matsouka P', 'Speletas M']","['Department of Immunology and Histocompatibility, University of Thessaly Medical School, University Hospital of Larissa, Larissa, Greece. gedloules@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090202,England,BMC Blood Disord,BMC blood disorders,100968550,,,,2009/02/04 09:00,2009/02/04 09:01,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2008/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/04 09:01 [medline]']","['1471-2326-9-1 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2326-9-1 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Blood Disord. 2009 Feb 2;9:1. doi: 10.1186/1471-2326-9-1.,,,,,PMC2640376,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the utility of plasma as a DNA source for detection of genetic abnormalities in patients with suspected B- or T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. METHODS: DNA was extracted from paired peripheral blood (PB) cells and plasma for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and T-cell receptor gamma chain (TCR-gamma) rearrangements, and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL)-1/IgH and BCL-2/IgH translocations. RESULTS: Concordance between plasma and PB cell analysis was 100% for IgH (n = 57), TCR-gamma (n = 57), and BCL-1/IgH (n = 37) rearrangements, and 94% (60/64) for BCL-2/IgH; four of 11 plasma samples positive for BCL-2/IgH tested negative in paired cells. No plasma or PB cell samples from 195 healthy donors showed genetic abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that plasma is a reliable sample type for detection of abnormalities associated with B- and T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, providing sensitivity equal to or greater than that of PB cells.","['Yeh, Chen-Hsiung', 'Tseng, Richard', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Yeh CH', 'Tseng R', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematopathology R&D, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090210,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/blood/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Plasma', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/05/28 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/28 09:00 [medline]']","['EJH1231 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01231.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Jun;82(6):450-3. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01231.x.

It has been suggested that its' high expression may confer them survival advantage and lead to unfavorable prognosis, but the prognostic significance of p27(Kip1) expression for previously untreated, non-advanced stage B-CLL was not established. We studied a relationship between the intracellular level of p27(Kip1) of lymphocytes of early- and intermediate stage B-CLL patients and their spontaneous apoptosis in vitro, as well as prognostic significance of p27(Kip1) in B-CLL lymphocytes for the risk of disease progression. Intracellular p27(Kip1) content of peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 48 previously untreated 0-II Rai stage B-CLL patients was determined by flow cytometry. The viability and apoptosis of those lymphocytes after 72-h culture were also assessed. During the follow-up period (6-71 months, median 59.5), we recorded the time elapsed to the doubling of lymphocyte count, progression to a higher Rai stage and the appearance of indications for cytostatic treatment. The p27(Kip1) expression was neither correlated with initial lymphocyte count, CD38 expression, cell viability nor spontaneous apoptosis ratio after 72-h culture. Higher p27(Kip1) level was related to the probability of earlier occurrence of each of three above-mentioned events. We did not find a prognostic significance of in vitro cell viability nor apoptosis as to the risk of disease progression. Our results indicate that elevated intracellular p27(Kip1) level in leukemic lymphocytes of early- and intermediate stage B-CLL patients contributes to rapid progression of the disease.","['Wolowiec, Dariusz', 'Wojtowicz, Marcin', 'Ciszak, Lidia', 'Kosmaczewska, Agata', 'Frydecka, Irena', 'Potoczek, Stanislaw', 'Urbaniak-Kujda, Donata', 'Kapelko-Slowik, Katarzyna', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz']","['Wolowiec D', 'Wojtowicz M', 'Ciszak L', 'Kosmaczewska A', 'Frydecka I', 'Potoczek S', 'Urbaniak-Kujda D', 'Kapelko-Slowik K', 'Kuliczkowski K']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland. marwojtowicz@poczta.onet.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090106,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/pathology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Reference Values', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survivors']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/04/28 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/28 09:00 [medline]']","['EJH1196 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01196.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Apr;82(4):260-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01196.x.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A strain of Lact. plantarum (tolerant to acid and bile salts and resistant to several antibiotics) was used. It inhibited the growth of pathogenic Escherichia coli and L. monocytogenes. Supernatants from Lact. plantarum were concentrated by centrifugation. Either E. coli or HL-60 cells (a human promyelocytic cell line) were treated in the presence of the concentrated supernatants. The effect of concentrated supernatants from Lact. plantarum on E. coli growth demonstrated a bacteriostatic activity and a loss of cell viability measured by sytox green staining. Concentrated supernatants were capable of disturbing plasma membrane in E. coli and of promoting a cytotoxic and lyctic action on HL-60 cells and on human erythrocytes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Lact. plantarum release an effective compound responsible for an important effect in the disruption of E. coli plasma membrane and for a cytototoxic activity on promyelocytic leukaemia cells.

We then analyzed the ligands and functions of STAT3 activation in RT4 schwannoma cells and adult SCs in vitro and in vivo. We have identified that interleukin-6 (IL-6), but not ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, or ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases, activates STAT3 in SCs. The IL-6/STAT3 signaling in primary SCs and RT4 cells induced the gene expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is known to be required for the proper regeneration of the injured nerves. Finally, the GFAP induction in the sciatic nerves after injury was significantly delayed in IL-6-deficient mice. These findings indicate that IL-6 plays an important role in STAT3-dependent GFAP induction in SCs during peripheral nerve regeneration.","['Lee, Hyun Kyoung', 'Seo, In Ae', 'Suh, Duk Joon', 'Hong, Jeong-In', 'Yoo, Young Hyun', 'Park, Hwan Tae']","['Lee HK', 'Seo IA', 'Suh DJ', 'Hong JI', 'Yoo YH', 'Park HT']","['Department of Physiology, Medical Science Research Institute, College of Medicine, Dong-A University, Busan, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/physiology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genes, Reporter/drug effects', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Schwann Cells/*metabolism', 'Sciatic Nerve/cytology/metabolism', 'Wallerian Degeneration/*metabolism']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]']","['JNC5826 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05826.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2009 Feb;108(3):776-86. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05826.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer was likely rare in this population historically, but recent life-style changes suggest that this may no longer be the case. The purpose of this study was to estimate incidence and mortality rates among Aboriginal people living on reserves and in northern villages in Quebec during the period 1988-2004, and to compare these estimates with those of the general population. STUDY DESIGN: Incidence and mortality data were extracted respectively from the provincial tumour registry and death file. METHODS: Aboriginal people were identified based on geographic residence codes. Population data were taken from the Canadian census of 1991, 1996 and 2001. Incidence and mortality rates were calculated and age-standardized according to the World Standard Population. RESULTS: The Aboriginal incidence and mortality rates for cancer, all sites combined, was 321.8 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 304.5-339.2) and 160.3 per 100,000 (95% CI 147.8-172.8), respectively. These rates are not significantly different from those of the general population of Quebec. However, there are differences according to cancer site and sex. Aboriginal men had a higher risk for liver, lung and kidney cancers and a lower risk for prostate, bladder, leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cancers, whereas Aboriginal women had a higher risk for colorectal, lung, cervix and kidney cancers, and a lower risk for breast, uterus, bladder, brain, leukemia, stomach and pancreas cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Aboriginal people in Quebec now experience an overall cancer risk comparable to the general population. The observed differences in specific sites suggest exposure to unique environmental risk factors. Basic surveillance specific to this population is necessary for the planning and evaluation of cancer preventive and curative services.","['Louchini, Robia', 'Beaupre, Michele']","['Louchini R', 'Beaupre M']","['Institut national de sante publique du Quebec, Quebec, Canada. rabia.louchini@inspq.qc.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Circumpolar Health,International journal of circumpolar health,9713056,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Arctic Regions/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Indians, North American/*statistics & numerical data', 'Inuits/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*ethnology/mortality', 'Quebec/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2009/02/04 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2009/02/04 09:00'],"['2009/02/04 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]']","['20 [pii]', '10.3402/ijch.v67i5.18355 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Circumpolar Health. 2008 Dec;67(5):445-51. doi: 10.3402/ijch.v67i5.18355.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These diseases destroy both the thymus and the small and large intestines, after infecting and killing T-lineage cells in both tissues. A mutant of the murine leukemia retrovirus MoMuLV-TB, called ts1, causes this syndrome in susceptible strains of mice. In FVB/N strain mice that are infected at birth, thymic atrophy, CD4+ T cell loss, intestinal collapse, body wasting, and death occur by approximately 30-40 days postinfection (dpi). Apoptosis of ts1-infected T-lineage cells, in the thymus, peripheral lymphoid system and intestines is caused by accumulation of the ts1 mutant viral envelope preprotein gPr80(env), which is inefficiently cleaved into the mature viral proteins gp70 and PrP15E. We show here that ts1 infection in the small intestine is followed by loss of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and cell cycling gradients (along the crypt-villus axes), accumulation of gPr80(env) in intestinal cells, apoptosis of developing T cells in the lamina propria (LP), and intestinal collapse by approximately 30 dpi. In infected mice treated with the antioxidant drug monosodium luminol (GVT), however, normal intestinal epithelial cell gradients are still in place at 30 dpi, and IECs covering both the crypts and villi contain large amounts of the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2. In addition, no apoptotic cells are present, and accumulated gpr80(env) is absent from the tissue at this time. We conclude that GVT treatment can make ts1 a noncytopathic virus for intestinal lymphoid cells, as it does for thymocytes [25]. As in the thymus, GVT may protect the intestine by reducing oxidant stress in infected intestinal T cells, perhaps by prevention of gPr80(env) accumulation via Nrf2 upregulation in the IECs. These results identify GVT as a potential therapy for intestinal diseases or inflammatory conditions, including HIV-AIDS, in which oxidative stress is a triggering or exacerbating factor.","['Scofield, Virginia L', 'Yan, Mingshan', 'Kuang, Xianghong', 'Kim, Soo-Jin', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Scofield VL', 'Yan M', 'Kuang X', 'Kim SJ', 'Wong PK']","['Department of Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville, TX 78957, USA. vscofield@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090130,Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '5EXP385Q4F (Luminol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/therapeutic use', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral/drug effects/immunology', 'Epithelial Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects/immunology', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Intestines/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Luminol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/12/17 06:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2478(08)00265-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imlet.2008.12.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2009 Feb 21;122(2):150-8. doi: 10.1016/j.imlet.2008.12.012.

N(6)-furfuryladenosine (FAdo, kinetin-riboside) displays anti-proliferative and apoptogenic activity against various human cancer cell lines, and FAdo has recently been shown to suppress tumor growth in murine xenograft models of human leukemia and melanoma. In this study, FAdo-induced genotoxicity, stress response gene expression, and cellular ATP depletion were examined as early molecular consequences of FAdo exposure in MiaPaCa-2 pancreas carcinoma, A375 melanoma, and other human cancer cell lines. FAdo, but not adenosine or N(6)-furfuryladenine (FA), displayed potent anti-proliferative activity that was also observed in human primary fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Remarkably, massive ATP depletion and induction of genotoxic stress as assessed by the alkaline comet assay occurred within 60-180min of exposure to low micromolar concentrations of FAdo. This was followed by rapid upregulation of CDKN1A and other DNA damage/stress response genes (HMOX1, DDIT3, and GADD45A) as revealed by expression array and Western analysis. Pharmacological and siRNA-based genetic inhibition of adenosine kinase (ADK) suppressed FAdo cytotoxicity and also prevented ATP depletion and p21 upregulation suggesting the importance of bioconversion of FAdo into the nucleotide form required for drug action. Taken together our data suggest that early induction of genotoxicity and energy crisis are important causative factors involved in FAdo cytotoxicity.","['Cabello, Christopher M', 'Bair, Warner B 3rd', 'Ley, Stephanie', 'Lamore, Sarah D', 'Azimian, Sara', 'Wondrak, Georg T']","['Cabello CM', 'Bair WB 3rd', 'Ley S', 'Lamore SD', 'Azimian S', 'Wondrak GT']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20081224,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (kinetin riboside)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'P39Y9652YJ (Kinetin)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Kinetin/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/*physiology']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/04/10 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(08)00888-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.12.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2009 Apr 1;77(7):1125-38. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.12.002.

Appropriate choice of anticonvulsant therapy with respect to ongoing oncologic treatment is not established in this age group. We report the case of a neonate with ALL who was successfully treated for seizures with levetiracetam monotherapy. This full-term boy did well until 3 days of age when he had an episode of left extremity jerking (07/06/07). Computed tomography of the head demonstrated extensive multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhages. Initial EEG demonstrated multifocal epileptiform activity. Patient was loaded with Phenobarbital at 20 mg/kg. Complete blood count revealed leukocytosis (78 x 103/mm(3)). Peripheral blood smear contained blastocytes and DNA analysis confirmed B-cell ALL. A second focal seizure was reported on the same day and he was re-loaded with Phenobarbital. Maintenance dosing of Phenobarbital was initiated and no further seizures were noted. A repeat EEG on 7/10/07 remained abnormal with excessive multifocal sharp waves. Continuation of anticonvulsant therapy was recommended. Given concern for interaction between Phenobarbital and planned chemotherapy regimen, oncology requested a non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsant. Phenobarbital was subsequently weaned and Levetiracetam monotherapy initiated at 40 mg/kg/day (07/10/2007). Currently, the patient is seizure free at 8 months of age on Levetiracetam monotherapy. The use of Levetiracetam as monotherapy in neonates has not been formally evaluated and experience is limited.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is well known as having non-cholinergic functions and has been detected in the blood and plasma of humans including in lymphocytes. Thus, we investigated whole blood and lymphocyte AChE activity in patients with ALL. METHODS: This study was performed on 72 children with ALL divided into 4 groups: newly diagnosed, remission induction, remission maintenance and out-of-treatment and one control group of 50 healthy subjects. We determined AChE activity in whole blood and lymphocytes of these patients. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that whole blood AChE activity was enhanced in the newly diagnosed group and reduced in the remission induction and remission maintenance groups in relation to the control group. For lymphocyte AChE activity we found an increase in the newly diagnosed group and a decrease in the remission induction group in relation to the control. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that AChE activity was altered in ALL patients.

METHODS: The study cohort derived from statewide patient discharge records was followed via linkage with cancer registry data over the period 1991-2002. Age and sex adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare observed to expected numbers of cancers based on age, race, and sex specific incidence rates in the California population. RESULTS: Among the 84,475 RA patients, who were observed for 405,540 person-years, 5,533 incident cancers were diagnosed during the observation interval. The risk of developing lymphohematopoietic cancer was significantly higher in the cohort for both sexes. Males had significantly higher risks of lung, liver, and esophageal cancer, but a lower risk of prostate cancer. Females were at significantly decreased risk for several cancers including breast, ovary, uterus, cervix, and melanoma, with the risk reduction ranging from 15 to 57% lower than the general population. Hispanics had increased risks of leukemia, vagina/vulva, lung, and liver cancers. CONCLUSION: Studies investigating the mechanisms that underlie the reported associations between RA and specific cancer types are needed.","['Parikh-Patel, Arti', 'White, Richard H', 'Allen, Mark', 'Cress, Rosemary']","['Parikh-Patel A', 'White RH', 'Allen M', 'Cress R']","['California Cancer Registry, Public Health Institute, 1825 Bell Street, Suite 102, Sacramento, CA 95825, USA. aparikh@ccr.ca.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20090128,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/complications/*epidemiology', 'California/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/08/20 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2008/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/20 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-009-9298-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2009 Aug;20(6):1001-10. doi: 10.1007/s10552-009-9298-y.

Sixteen patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in whom in the reinduction phase of treatment hypersensitivity against L-asparaginase was observed and/or the presence of anti-asparaginase antibodies was established were recruited for the present study. Ten out of 16 tested sera showed cross-immunoreactivity to PEG-asparaginase, while no reactivity to L-asparaginase derived from Erwinia chrysantemi was observed. Since cross-reacting antibodies were also found in sera of patients with no overt allergic reaction, L: -asparaginase may undergo silent inactivation during the reinduction phase of therapy. This finding is of clinical importance with regard to appropriate dosage and necessitates careful enzyme activity monitoring in all patients undergoing repeated treatment with various L-asparaginase preparations.","['Zalewska-Szewczyk, Beata', 'Gach, Agnieszka', 'Wyka, Krystyna', 'Bodalski, Jerzy', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech']","['Zalewska-Szewczyk B', 'Gach A', 'Wyka K', 'Bodalski J', 'Mlynarski W']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology, Oncology and Diabetology, 1st Chair of Pediatrics, Medical University of Lodz, 91-738 Lodz, Poland. bszewczy@toya.net.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090130,Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,"['0 (Antibodies)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antibodies/*immunology', 'Asparaginase/*immunology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/*enzymology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Humans']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/08/26 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2008/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/26 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10238-008-0026-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2009 Jun;9(2):113-6. doi: 10.1007/s10238-008-0026-9.

Several of these compounds have been shown also to possess anti-tumor potential. The aim of the present work was the characterization of the tumor cell growth inhibition activity of four cardenolides, isolated from Periploca graeca L., and the mechanisms underlying such an effect. METHODS: The pro-apoptotic and cytostatic effect of the compounds was tested in U937 (monocytic leukemia) and PC3 (prostate adenocarcinoma). Characterization of apoptosis and cell cycle impairment was obtained by cytofluorimetry and WB. RESULTS: Periplocymarin and periplocin were the most active compounds, periplocymarin being more effective than the reference compound ouabain. The reduction of cell number by these two cardenolides was due in PC3 cells mainly to the activation of caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways, while in U937 cells to the induction of cell cycle impairment without extensive cell death. Interestingly, periplocymarin, at cytostatic but non-cytotoxic doses, was shown to sensitize U937 cells to TRAIL. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data outline that cardiac glycosides are promising anticancer drugs and contribute to the identification of new natural cardiac glycosides to obtain chemically modified non-cardioactive/low toxic derivatives with enhanced anticancer potency.","['Bloise, Elena', 'Braca, Alessandra', 'De Tommasi, Nunziatina', 'Belisario, Maria Antonietta']","['Bloise E', 'Braca A', 'De Tommasi N', 'Belisario MA']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, Universita di Salerno, Via Ponte Don Melillo, Fisciano, SA, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090128,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cardenolides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cardenolides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/antagonists & inhibitors']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/08/18 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2008/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/18 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-0929-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2009 Sep;64(4):793-802. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-0929-5.

In mice infected at birth, thymic atrophy, CD4+ T cell loss, body wasting, and death occur by approximately 30-40 days postinfection (dpi). We have shown previously that the death of ts1-infected cells is not caused by viral replication per se, but by oxidative stress and apoptosis following their accumulation the ts1 viral envelope precursor protein, gPr80(env). In infected mice treated with the antioxidant monosodium alpha-luminol (GVT), T cell loss and thymic atrophy are delayed for many weeks, and body wasting and death do not occur until long after infected, untreated control mice have died. We show here that GVT treatment of ts1-infected mice maintains the thymic epithelial cell (TEC) cytoarchitecture and cytokeratin gradients required for thymocyte differentiation. It also suppresses thymocyte reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, upregulates and stabilizes levels of the antioxidant-regulating transcription factor Nrf2, and prevents accumulation of gPr80(env) in thymocytes. We conclude that GVT treatment can make ts1 a non-cytopathic virus for thymocytes, although it cannot prevent thymocyte infection. Since oxidative stress also contributes to the loss of T cells in HIV-AIDS, the antioxidant effects of GVT may make it a useful therapeutic adjunct to HAART treatment.","['Scofield, Virginia L', 'Yan, Mingshan', 'Kuang, Xianghong', 'Kim, Soo-Jin', 'Crunk, Derek', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Scofield VL', 'Yan M', 'Kuang X', 'Kim SJ', 'Crunk D', 'Wong PK']","['Department of Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville, TX 78957, USA. vscofield@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090223,Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/therapeutic use', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral/drug effects/immunology', 'Epithelial Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects/immunology', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Keratins/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/immunology/*pathology/virology']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/12/17 06:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2478(08)00266-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imlet.2008.12.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2009 Feb 21;122(2):159-69. doi: 10.1016/j.imlet.2008.12.009.

SGN-40 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody currently in Phase I/II clinical trials for indolent lymphomas, diffuse large B cell lymphomas and Multiple Myeloma. Its biological effect on CLL cells has not been studied. The present study demonstrated that SGN-40 mediated modest apoptosis in a subset of patients with secondary cross-linking but did not mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity. SGN-40 also mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) predominantly through natural killer (NK) cells. Previous studies by our group and others have demonstrated that lenalidomide upregulates CD40 expression on primary B CLL cells and activates NK-cells. We therefore examined for the combinatorial effect of lenalidomide and SGN-40 and demonstrated that both enhanced direct apoptosis and ADCC against primary CLL B cells. These data together provide justification for clinical trials of SGN-40 and lenalidomide in combination for CLL therapy.","['Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Gowda, Aruna', 'Joshi, Trupti', 'Mehter, Najma', 'Cheney, Carolyn', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Chen, Ching-Shih', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Tridandapani, Susheela', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Byrd, John C']","['Lapalombella R', 'Gowda A', 'Joshi T', 'Mehter N', 'Cheney C', 'Lehman A', 'Chen CS', 'Johnson AJ', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Tridandapani S', 'Muthusamy N', 'Byrd JC']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090112,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7548 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07548.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Mar;144(6):848-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07548.x.

However, development of resistance to FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as PKC412A, has been described recently. This observation may have an increasing impact on the duration of response and relapse rates in upcoming clinical trials employing FLT3-TKI. Herein we investigated two representatives of a novel class of FLT3-TKI: Bis(1H-indol-2-yl)methanones. Both compounds effectively induced apoptosis in FLT3-internal tandem duplicate (ITD)-transfected murine myeloid cells and in primary FLT3-ITD positive blasts. Combination of both compounds with chemotherapy revealed synergistic effects in apoptosis assays. The compounds did not show significant toxicity in human bone marrow cells derived from healthy donors. Compound102 overcame resistance to PKC412 within a non-myelotoxic dose-range. Western Blotting experiments of 32D-FLT3-ITD cells showed dose-dependent dephosphorylation of FLT3-ITD and of its downstream targets STAT5, AKT and ERK upon incubation with either compound. In conclusion, bis(1H-indol-2-yl)methanones overcome resistance mediated by FLT3-ITD mutations at position N676 and show strong efficacy in FLT3-ITD-positive cells alone as well as in combination with chemotherapy. We propose that further development of methanone compounds overcoming resistance to currently established FLT3-TKIs is an important step forward to an anticipated need within our future therapeutic algorithm in FLT3-ITD-positive AML.","['Heidel, Florian', 'Lipka, Daniel B', 'Mirea, Fian K', 'Mahboobi, Siavosh', 'Grundler, Rebekka', 'Kancha, Rama K', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Naumann, Michael', 'Huber, Christoph', 'Bohmer, Frank D', 'Fischer, Thomas']","['Heidel F', 'Lipka DB', 'Mirea FK', 'Mahboobi S', 'Grundler R', 'Kancha RK', 'Duyster J', 'Naumann M', 'Huber C', 'Bohmer FD', 'Fischer T']","['Department of Haematology/Oncology, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090116,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/05/27 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/27 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7567 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07567.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Mar;144(6):865-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07567.x.

To determine whether DP supertypes are associated with childhood ALL prognosis, we compared treatment outcomes in a cohort (n = 798) of DPB1-typed ALL cases in the UK Medical Research Council UKALL XI trial. No differences in clinical characteristics and outcome between DPB1-typed and untyped (n = 1292) cases suggest no selection bias. Event-free survival (EFS) rates in patients with DP1 and DP3 supertypes were significantly worse than in patients with DP2, DP4, DP6 and DP8 [10-year EFS: 55%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 49-61%; compared with 64% (61-68%), P = 0.006]. Ten-year EFS in DP1/DP3 heterozygous patients [30% (2-58%)] was significantly worse than in patients with DP1, DP3 or neither allele [56% (50-62%); P = 0.02]. Lack of evidence that DP1 or DP3 are associated with known prognostic factors leads us to suggest that these two supertypes exert an independent effect on prognosis. This may involve abrogation of DP1/3-restricted T-cell control of residual disease due to selective effects of chemotherapy. Further studies of HLA supertypes in relation to outcome in recent childhood ALL trials may resolve this question.","['Taylor, G Malcolm', 'Richards, Sue', 'Wade, Rachel', 'Hussain, Adiba', 'Simpson, Jill', 'Hill, Frank', 'Mitchell, Chris', 'Eden, Tim']","['Taylor GM', 'Richards S', 'Wade R', 'Hussain A', 'Simpson J', 'Hill F', 'Mitchell C', 'Eden T']","['Cancer Immunogenetics, School of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. gmtaylor@manchester.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090116,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPw1 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DPw2 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DPw3 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DPw4 antigen)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'HLA-DP Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*genetics/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]']","['BJH7571 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07571.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2009 Apr;145(1):87-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07571.x.

However, the limited efficacy shown in recent clinical trials calls attention to the need for further development of novel and more efficient delivery systems. In order to address this issue, transferrin receptor (TfR)-targeted, protamine-containing lipid nanoparticles (Tf-LNs) were synthesized as delivery vehicles for G3139. The LNs were produced by an ethanol dilution method, and lipid-conjugated Tf ligand was then incorporated by a postinsertion method. The resulting Tf-LNs had a mean particle diameter of approximately 90 nm and G3139 loading efficiency of 90.4%. Antisense delivery efficiency of Tf-LNs was evaluated in K562, MV4-11, and Raji leukemia cell lines. The results showed that Tf-LNs were more effective than nontargeted LNs and free G3139 (p < 0.05) in decreasing Bcl-2 expression (by up to 62% at the mRNA level in K562 cells) and in inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis. In addition, Bcl-2 down-regulation and apoptosis induced by Tf-LN G3139 were shown to be blocked by excess free Tf and thus were TfR-dependent. Cell lines with higher TfR expression also showed greater Bcl-2 down-regulation. Furthermore, up-regulation of TfR expression in leukemia cells by iron chelator deferoxamine resulted in a further increase in antisense effect (up to 79% Bcl-2 reduction in K562 at the mRNA level) and in caspase-dependent apoptosis (by approximately 3-fold) by Tf-LN. Tf-LN-mediated delivery combined with TfR up-regulation by deferoxamine appears to be a potentially promising strategy for enhancing the delivery efficiency and therapeutic efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides.","['Yang, Xiaojuan', 'Koh, Chee Guan', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Pan, Xiaogang', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Yu, Bo', 'Peng, Yong', 'Pang, Jiuxia', 'Golan, Sharon', 'Talmon, Yeshayahu', 'Jin, Yan', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Byrd, John C', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Lee, L James', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Lee, Robert J']","['Yang X', 'Koh CG', 'Liu S', 'Pan X', 'Santhanam R', 'Yu B', 'Peng Y', 'Pang J', 'Golan S', 'Talmon Y', 'Jin Y', 'Muthusamy N', 'Byrd JC', 'Chan KK', 'Lee LJ', 'Marcucci G', 'Lee RJ']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Colloids)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colloids', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Particle Size', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*chemistry/*metabolism']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/03/24 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/24 09:00 [medline]']","['10.1021/mp800149s [doi]', '10.1021/mp800149s [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2009 Jan-Feb;6(1):221-30. doi: 10.1021/mp800149s.,,,,"['R01 CA135243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025755/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3608852,,['NIHMS447482'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intracellular NAMPT and NAD(+) amounts in myeloid cells, as well as plasma NAMPT and NAD(+) levels, were increased by G-CSF treatment of both healthy volunteers and individuals with congenital neutropenia. NAMPT administered both extracellularly and intracellularly induced granulocytic differentiation of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells and of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. Treatment of healthy individuals with high doses of vitamin B3 (nicotinamide), a substrate of NAMPT, induced neutrophilic granulocyte differentiation. The molecular events triggered by NAMPT include NAD(+)-dependent sirtuin-1 activation, subsequent induction of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta, and, ultimately, upregulation of G-CSF synthesis and G-CSF receptor expression. G-CSF, in turn, further increases NAMPT levels. These results reveal a decisive role of the NAD(+) metabolic pathway in G-CSF-triggered myelopoiesis.","['Skokowa, Julia', 'Lan, Dan', 'Thakur, Basant Kumar', 'Wang, Fei', 'Gupta, Kshama', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Brechlin, Annette Muller', 'Schambach, Axel', 'Hinrichsen, Lars', 'Meyer, Gustav', 'Gaestel, Matthias', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Tong, Qiang', 'Welte, Karl']","['Skokowa J', 'Lan D', 'Thakur BK', 'Wang F', 'Gupta K', 'Cario G', 'Brechlin AM', 'Schambach A', 'Hinrichsen L', 'Meyer G', 'Gaestel M', 'Stanulla M', 'Tong Q', 'Welte K']","['Department of Molecular Hematopoiesis, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany. skokowa.julia@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20090201,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuins)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'NAD/*physiology', 'Niacinamide/pharmacology', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Sirtuin 1', 'Sirtuins/*physiology']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]']","['nm.1913 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.1913 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2009 Feb;15(2):151-8. doi: 10.1038/nm.1913.

Hematological and microbiological investigation revealed normal except radiological findings when there were destructive lesions of affected bones and thought to be Langerhan's cell histiocytosis but did not respond to treatment. Subsequently, he was transfer to Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) for proper management. On examination, the boy was mildly pale, severe bone pain, no organomegaly but few occipital group of lymphnode were palpable. He had extensive red tender swelling over the hands and legs. Hematological values showed high WBC, low platelet count and lymphoblasts. Biochemical values were high serum LDH and serum uric acid. Skeletal survey showed diffuse osteolytic lesion and osteoporosis with evidence of transverse metaphyseal radiolucent bands (leukemic line), lamellar periosteal reactions and cortical erosions widespread throughout the skeleton with subperiosteal new bone formation. Radioisotop of skeleton showed increase uptake at the site of lesions. Bone marrow aspiration findings were suggestive of ALL-L1 and cytochemistry of aspirate showed PAS positive and Sudan black negative. Immunophenotype confirmed as pre-B ALL, Then, protocol based induction had given for 4 weeks. Thereafter, a short course of intensification followed by maintenance therapy had started with significant improvement of physical, hematological and radiological findings. So, an awareness of varied clinical and radiological manifestations of childhood ALL in bone marrow and skeletal system are needed in order to establish a correct diagnosis when the presenting signs and symptoms are enigmatic. It is also important to keep in mind the possibility of extensive skeletal involvement in ALL, especially when a child present with pain, swelling of limb with walking difficulties. The curability of ALL in contrast to metastatic malignancies makes accurate diagnosis of paramount importance.","['Hafiz, M G', 'Islam, A']","['Hafiz MG', 'Islam A']","['Department of Paediatrics, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Shahbag, Dhaka, Bangladesh.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Bangladesh,Mymensingh Med J,Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,9601799,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arthralgia/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/etiology', 'Bone Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*secondary', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/pathology', 'Radiography']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/08/28 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/28 09:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mymensingh Med J. 2009 Jan;18(1):88-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This addiction is generally dependent on the acquisition of an activating kinase mutation, e.g., the bcr-abl fusion gene in chronic myeloid leukemia, or point mutations of KIT or PDGFRA in gastrointestinal stroma tumors (GIST). Other types of sarcomas are generally considered to be insensitive to imatinib. We have observed a striking and durable remission of an advanced angiosarcoma to imatinib that can only be explained by TK addiction. Unexpectedly, GIST-type KIT and PDGFRA mutations were absent in this case. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenges in identifying individual candidate patients for TK inhibitor therapy.","['Kiesel, Holger', 'Muller, Antonia M S', 'Schmitt-Graeff, Annette', 'Veelken, Hendrik']","['Kiesel H', 'Muller AM', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Veelken H']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090202,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Benzamides', 'Hemangiosarcoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*drug effects', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2009/02/03 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2009/02/03 09:00'],"['2009/02/03 09:00 [entrez]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]']","['7547 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.8.4.7547 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2009 Feb;8(4):319-21. doi: 10.4161/cbt.8.4.7547.
